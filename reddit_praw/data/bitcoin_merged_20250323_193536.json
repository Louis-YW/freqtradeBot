    "selftext": "I know some significant number of people here do not believe government dislikes Bitcoin. They believe we should lobby it, we should cozy up to regulations, we should co-operate and educate government. They believe government is not inherently bad or good and that we ought to make it better.\n\nToday I'm here to say that you should wake up from this dream. Government is here not to protect you, it's here to keep you a slave, unaware of one's own bondage. They take not only your money in the form of taxes, they take time out of your lifetime by conscripting you to be part-time accountants, they take your freedom by forcing you to obey laws you don't believe in, they take your aspirations and dreams by regulating and licencing the shit out of every move you make, they take your dignity by throwing you a useless bone in the form of voting, as if it can actually change things. Most important of all, they deprive you of your most important asset: your own ability to think clearly about the way things are. It can do all that, because it controls money and is able to finance the force it has. Those things it does to you cannot be done at no price.\n\nThat's why government hates Bitcoin to the core. It hates it with all the mighty of its dark sociopathic soul. It will never tell you that in the face. And oh, there will be a fight, because it doesn't want to die. The time has come to pick sides. I can't blame people who don't understand what's going on - those who are dependent on the system and know nothing about Bitcoin. But you, who knows how Bitcoin works and why it was invented, you don't have to be a slave. You don't owe anyone anything, just like nobody owes you. And because some people think you do owe them, there will be a fight. And they are going to lose. The choice is yours, however, how soon they lose and how many more lives they take.",

Almost every day for 6 weeks, I saw the same clerk over and over, as I handed over hundreds of dollars per day. \n\nAfter about the 5th day in a row, she started asking me questions, and I told her about Bitcoin.  Each day, I told her a little more, and almost every day, the price was a little higher than the previous day.\n\nHaving seen me send about $10K to BitInstant to buy Bitcoin, she decided to buy as well.  Today I ran into her again, for the first time since then.  She told me she's given notice to leave Walmart, and is going back to school in January.  She mentioned that she has over 1000 Bitcoins, and was hoping to see me to thank me personally before she left.\n\nI love how Bitcoins can change lives.\n\n(Throwaway account used for obvious reasons.)",

    "selftext": "A few hours ago Antonopoulos posted a [tweet](https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/432635743794507777) regarding the sentiments that a few members of the Dogecoin community have towards Bitcoin. Ordinarily I would defend the Dogecoin community as being a generally happy and jovial bunch, even if quite silly on more than occasion. People are having a good time, and in the past few weeks I've come to appreciate the unique blend of kitch, investment, child-like wonder, and generosity.\n\nHowever, recently I've noticed the same shift Antonopoulos has. Whereas before the Dogecoin community was open to outsiders and new ideas we seemed to have lost our way, instead reveling in our own success and becoming quite arrogant. Perhaps we are becoming resentful of others who do not seem to understand us?\n\nI suppose the new attitude is that [we don't need Bitcoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x54xi/embracing_the_bitcoin_community/). (I posted that a few days ago. Not a single reponse or vote.) The same day [I posted some ideas](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x2mp2/making_a_userfriendly_dogecoin_experience/) on making a more user-friendly Dogecoin experience. 69 vote score and 50 comments. Now at least we can see how much r/dogecoin thinks of itself and no other.\n\nSo after a few days of thinking about this I posted, \"[Why does the Bitcoin Center welcome Dogecoin but /r/bitcoin does not? (Rant)\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1xekel/why_does_the_bitcoin_center_welcome_dogecoin_but/) in order to open a dialogue about how an increasing number of Dogers seem to feel about Bitcoin. Again, no response (as of this writing). No upvotes or downvotes. If we think Bitcoin is so bad for whatever reason, why are we beginning to act worse than we think they are?\n\nI would rather post something like this in r/bitcoin and at least get some feedback and constructive criticism than be ignored in r/dogecoin because they can't be bothered to think about anything serious for a moment that doesn't involve charity. I'm almost inclined to suggest a joint charity drive with Bitcoin to promote solidarity but I already know what kind of response that would get in the Dogecoin community. We now seem to have *charity for vanity*, and it's not a good thing. How can rational thought possibly compete against [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1xcnpy/how_to_draw_a_doge/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x4xiz/test_gif_please_ignore/) in such a community?\n\nI was strangely attracted to r/dogecoin at first, when exploring the trivial and making money at the same time was entertaining. But no more. I'm going to excuse myself from it, sell my ~22MM shares, consider putting half into [Karmacoin](http://karmacoin.info/) as a more reasonable, more future-proof alternative with a similar concept (and a dev that doesn't surprise) along with putting half back into BTC as it makes its way up again.\n\nWhen the DOGE price takes a significant hit we seem to pretend that we're in it just for the fun, and downvote others who talk about price. A great many of us are, indeed, and continue to tip like there's no tomorrow. The price begins to climb again the past day or so and I can't count the number of posts exclaiming how great it is and how good they feel. We're even beginning to think that the community's financial resources [can do just about anything](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1xg186/emergency_we_must_fund_2_audience_members_to_wear/). I don't know how corruption and unethical behaviour begins but I'm willing to bet that it begins when this kind of attitude starts cropping up. The choice of the mascot was prophetic, because so many of us [from the mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x6vhr/at_5pm_est_someone_from_4_paws_for_ability/) on down are starting to beg like dogs. A community that encourages begging soon becomes overrun by voluntary homelessness, lethargy, and scum. A jerk that begs whilst smiling in your face and laughing is not good company. I really hope r/dogecoin doesn't reach that point.\n\n(If anyone from r/dogecoin is reading this, I'll still honor the contest I created but I find it really telling that a user with [200 million Dogecoins](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x84j3/i_have_200_million_dogecoins_ask_me_anything/) (around USD$300,000 worth) could [delete a comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x9322/giving_away_200000_doge_to_10_people_that_upload/) after saying he donated 400,000 to the official video contest and I asked if he could donate 200,000 to the winner of mine if it received over 1 million views. Surely there must be a better way to say no?)\n\nLooks like I won't be going to the moon this time. Mom, dad.. I'm coming back home.",

    "selftext": "(I submitted this post yesterday, but I think it got lost amongst the thousands of MT GOX posts in a thread. I think people deserve a chance to see it and decide on what I've presented for themselves. I'm the Blockchain Avenger. I don't like Reddit much, but when I post my findings here I am SheepRoadReloaded2. I'm a forensic bitcoin accountant. When I work for the public good, I use wallet  1AhYNAoMxDPD7bnNvxuSY9FB1CDviEuqzZ)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nI don't think they've just \"found\" them. I think I \"found\" them, so they decided not to steal them. Or it jogged their memory. There are at least 120 wallets, each containing 10,000.000777 BTC.\n\nHere is a typical one:-\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/1LfV1tSt3KNyHpFJnAzrqsLFdeD2EvU1MK\n\nThe 10,000BTC was moved into each wallet in February, then the thief marked them all the same day with a 0,000777BTC payment from a phone wallet:-\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/12Nxd2X12WZeYSjUcbtm5NpS3d81Yh8sKh\n\nI sat on the discovery for a few weeks, then discussed it with a bitcoin forum moderator and posted it a few places. It was ignored.\n\nThen I emailed Kolin Burgess. He's the guy who did the protest outside Gox, then organised a group action.\n\nClick on any of those red arrow \"777\" payments. Who could possibly stash half a billion $US of bitcoins in early february? Satoshi, the Winkelvii, or the Mt GOX owner. T\n\nwo of them looked smug, one looked confused in his driveway, and one was sweating like a shifty-eyed pig.\n\nI think the phone wallet (now empty) was used to record the public keys (wallet addresses). The private keys would have been printed off and stashed in the same order between the pages of a book or something. A private key on its own is useless, and not evidence unless somebody tries to unlock every wallet in the world with it, and gets lucky.\n\nThose malleable transactions, eh?\n\nBollocks! Bitcoins started being stolen in 2011 if you look at the oldest wallets.\n\nI was working on another job, and just checking out big chunks of bitcoin moving about. I always mark suspected stolen bitcoin wallets with a \"666\", or a combo of 3s, 6s or 9s depending on my level of certainty. I kept noticing these 777s in piles of bitcoins and I wondered if I'd done them when I was drunk or something.Seeing my own marking method being used for crime instead of philanthropy pissed me off.\n\nSo I \"666\"ed that wallet. I 666'd it up good, using my 1Ah \"blockchain avenger\" wallet because he was obviously familiar with its work\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/tx/5988729edfc4871c7b5668394b9175f1b15219d3776255287e19e8222df5465a\n\nThe first time on 16 Feb, I didn't put 2 and 2 together to make Gox. I did some more poking about when I finished my paid job on the blockchain, posted a few places, but not here. I don't like Reddit.\n\nMaybe the wallet owner noticed 666's in it and knew the gig was up. \"Oh! Here they all are!\".\n\nLets see if those wallets start having transactions now. We've got that phone owner bang to rights. It can only be a GOX employee\n\nApologies for the long post. Just to remind you of the sums and dates, here is a typical 10,000BTC cashpile again that somebody stashed and marked\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/1LfV1tSt3KNyHpFJnAzrqsLFdeD2EvU1MK\n\nOver a hundred of those \"777\" marked ones alone. He market other wallets with other numbers, but haven't worked out his code.\n\nPlease satisfy yourself that there is half a billion dollars of bitcoins in 120 wallets, moved in, then marked by the same android phone wallet in early february, and base your comments on if its factually correct, or technically flawed. Sometimes you can point at half a billion dollars, and Reddit users talk about your finger. \n\nI'm quite busy at the moment, and don't intend to come back to answer questions or teach people how to use blockchain.info or reverse taint analysis etc\n\nI asked Kolin Burgess to buy me a nice sponge cake if his group get their bitcoins back. If you are a magic the gathering victim and get some or all of your bitcoin back, please make a donation to a charity of your choice\n\nThen put your bitcoin into an address on the blockchain administered by a wallet on your own PC or phone, use localbitcoins.com in future, and think about what happened here today. **The entirety of bitcoin is just YOU and THE BLOCKCHAIN.**\n\n**Be very suspicious of anybody who tries come between the two of you offering a service.** \n\nBitcoins don't exist. They don't \"flow\" through the internet like emails, can't live in cold storage or a vault. They don't even live in a wallet. If I \"send\" you one BTC, my blockchain address has -1 added to it. Yours has +1 added. No bitcoins move. Nothing does.\n\nThey are just an idea. All bitcoin thefts are accountancy tricks in a database called the blockchain. the stolen bitcoins haven't even moved an inch.",

    "selftext": "Thank you for taking the time to click this. Allow me to briefly introduce myself and then I'll get straight to the meat and potatoes of the matter:\n\nI work for a small bookstore iaccepting bitcoin n Austin Texas, and am host to a radio broadcast which focuses on currency, technology and anarchy. As a result, I've had the pleasure of personally getting to know some of the biggest players in the spheres. I've been invited to sit down in interviews alongside guys like Jeffrey Tucker and Kristov Atlas (they cancelled last minute in favor of putting a female face in the mix).\n\nI've persoanlly sat down and interviewed Amir Taaki, and Cody Wilson (not to mention chased down the guy who stole his wallet while in our store... yeah, we caught him. And Cody gave the dude some cash since he was hard up enough to be stealing wallets).\n\nIn short, I've been at the center of one of the bigger activity hubs for Libertarianism, Anarcho Capitalism, Bitcoin, etc.\n\nAnd, I've sat down with Lyn Ulbricht who is Ross Ulbricht's mother, and just a terribly sweet woman overall. If you're not familiar, Ross Ulbricht is being acused by \"government\" of being the man known as Dread Pirate Roberts, the man behind the popular online free market known as The Silk Road.\n\nWe've covered his case at length. And the more I've looked at this thing, the more I realize how increasingly likely it is that he could be acquitted of all charges against him. I've also come to realize that this could be a HUGE precident setting case, and the implications if he's found guilty could be really bad for everyone.\n\nWe're talking future of the internet. Future of freedom of speech. Future of how money laundering charges are handled in the courts. This is a pretty big deal when you examine this more closely.\n\nSo....\n\nLast night we launched an Indiegogo campaign to raise $20k for his legal defense fund. WIth the assistance of the Alliance of Austin Agorists we were able to get Ross' parents to join us live via Skype to discuss the situation. We also had our friend Cody Wilson join us live via Skype as well to talk about the importance of the case. (There should be YouTube video up shortly of the event, and I'll circle back and post it in an edit when that happens). We also had a mail to jail campaign where we filled a good sized box with letters for Ross to help keep his spirits alive and well while he's in a cage.\n\nWe're going to have a variety of perks for this campaign, including but not limited to:\n\nFree Ross T-shirts\n\nButtons\n\nNecklaces\n\nRaspberry Pi privacy browsing bundle known as Onion Pi\n\nAnd last but not least: A Replicator 2.0 Makerbot 3d printer, signed by Cody Wilson himself!\n\nWe managed to raise almost $2k last night! For some reason we're having a little technical troubles getting the website to accept the next donation we have to put towards it but we'll get that worked out soon enough.\n\nBut now we NEED your help!\n\nWith your support we plan to not only raise the funds neccessary to prove his innocenece on all charges, and set him free. But to go the one further and make him a hero and symbol of free markets everywhere!\n\nPlease check out the Free Ross website at:\n\nwww.FreeRoss.org\n\nand make whatever size contribution (and score some cool stuff in the process) that you can by going here:\n\nhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/free-ross-free-the-market-a-legal-defense-fundraiser-for-ross-ulbricht\n\nAlso... one final personal little thing. The guy that put this together is one of my best friends. He has selflessly put this project together and is pouring himself into it. This is in spite of his fathers battle with cancer, and a laundry list of other shit that's on his plate... a list so long if you saw it, you'd feel compelled to put together an Indiegogo campaing for him. He truely is one of the most unsung heros of freedom that I can think of.\n\nHe is all chips in on this and so as you can imagine there's some emotional stock riding on it for him.\n\nBut he's not just one of my best friends. He's also my boss. And Co-host. And Landlord. And soon to be roommate.\n\nSo... as you can imagine. If he's not happy, then pretty much everyone of relevance in my life is pissed off. And that shit just sucks.\n\nSo if for whatever reason you don't do it for Ross and his family. If you don't do it for the markets and to give a huge finger to government. If you don't do it because your conscious compells you. Do it for him, and fucks sake do it for me!\n\nIn all seriousness though...\n\nThank you in advance for your contribution. Thank you for spreading the word everywhere you can think of about this campaign. Thank you for sacraficing some small part of yourself for this cause. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nAnd remember, the Silk Road played a HUGE element in why Bitcoin is where it is today much the same way the porn industry playe da huge roll in the internet gaining the popularity it did back in the day.\n\n\nEdit:  A number of people have asked for detailed reasons we think he'll be acquitted on various charges.  We went into at length on our 5-28 epsiode of our show which you can listen to hear.  (at present it's just a lot of shit to hash out via the keyboard and a hell of a lot easier to just post a link to the dialog)\n\nCheck out the 5-28 episode in the archives links on the right.  There's also an episode where we intrerview Lyn Ulbricht somewhere down on the front page as well if you want to check that out as well.  [www.TheCryptoShow.com](http://thecryptoshow.com/)\n",

The plan is to release new games we create for parents hoping to teach their kids how to program. If they find the games fun and useful, hopefully they will throw Devon some satoshis. We have 7 games built already including a Race Car Game with Bombs, Pong, Brick Breaker, Missile Attack, Helicopter Firefighter, Bone Digger and Space Invaders!

Now we are in the slow froth and churn that marks the beginning of the next exponential expansion.  \n  \nWall Street is getting fired up, as are funds and banks.  The \"do not sell before\" embargo sticker has been lifted off of bitcoin and our street date has arrived.  The most prominent minds in the world are teeming with possibilities and the bitcoin venture space looks a LOT like the Internet in the early nineties.  \n  \nBasically, we are at a situation where bitcoin is becoming a precious, desirable, and scarce resource...  But people just haven't realized it yet.  \n  \n----------  \n  \nAnd when they do, it won't be a slow and steady March upward.  It will be a monumental movement that will leave our heads spinning.  One day we will go from $300 to $350, and we'll all be smiling and patting ourselves on the backs.  😄\n  \nThen in a week we'll be at $500, and positive news stories will start to flow.

How high can it go?  OK...  It's crashing, finally...  Down to...  Whoops.  Nope.   \n  \nNew money flows in, and people begin to believe in bitcoin in earnest and there is a rush to own an asset that is rising every single day....  $5000, $7000.  😰\n  \nThose of us who own at these levels will be freaking the fuck out.  Should we sell?  Is it going all the way up?  I mean, the news is abuzz about bitcoin.   Everyone's talking about it.  All your relatives that you've been 'preaching' to for a year now are freaking out and asking how they can buy some 'bits' as fast as possible, while bits are still less than a cent apiece.  \n  \nMany panic and sell on the way up...  And truthfully I don't know how high the next bubble can take bitcoin...  At $10k the \"market cap\"  will be about $150 billion...  That's a lot, but about the valuation of a single large company.  At this point people will be screaming about how this is a financial revolution.  We may get all the way to $28k before the major correction, but you bet your ass if we get that high people will be imagining that we are going all the way up, to a million dollars per \"coin\" asap.  \n  \nPerhaps a financial crisis will hasten the rise.  Perhaps not.  \n  \n-------------  \n  \nI know this, bitcoin hasn't moved in a stable predictable rise yet, and there's no reason to think it will start now.  It has moved in exponential bursts, each preceded by a pessimistic retraction period.  \n  \nThis will be the sixth such time we have done so, and we are growing increasingly efficient at it.  \n  \nI want you to go ahead and start thinking about what you will do, and how you will act when the 'unthinkable' occurs.  Because the unthinkable is always right around the corner.  \n  \nThe rest of our lifetimes will be filled with 'unthinkable' moments.   The next bitcoin bubble (due before the end of 2016) will be one more such incident.  💥\n  \nMainly I want you to think about the world events that will have to happen to make this true... And then what would have to happen to cause a major correction in the price from $25k per bitcoin back down to $2000 per.  \n  \nWisdom is recognizing that history repeats itself, and there's nothing new under the sun.  \n  \nWealth is the end result of taking a calculated risk based off your acquired wisdom.

However, I'm sure that he will continue to use his Bitcoin hashtags and saying his new platform is \"ledger agnostic\" to try to get the true crypto enthusiastic Bitcoin-ers to rally behind him. \n\nWhat he will come to find out in the near future is that any centralized ledger is always mutable whether it be by the companies' specific intent, a rogue employee or a hacker. \n\nI'd recommend no longer giving up your bitcoins to his company and start ignoring all of his pro-bitcoin statements while he secretly works on his own private databases to maintain the status quo with the only difference being that he will gain control of the equities/stock markets rather than large banks or brokers. \n\nAt this time I think the best alternatives will be Nasdaq using the Open Asset Protocol (colored coins) on top of the Bitcoin network and/or counterparty.

    "selftext": "# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Sticky FAQ\n\nMaybe you're here because you've received a tip on social media, or maybe you've just been hearing a lot recently about Bitcoin and are wondering what the big deal is?  The following videos are a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little bit about its long term potential:\n\n* [Video 1: What Is Bitcoin & Why Should You Care?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSQdhxnvCc)\n* [Video 2: The real value of bitcoin and crypto currency technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVAluSL9SU&index=1&list=FLqnDHJBl3xGTosMjyXc4-0A)\n* [Video 3: Bitcoin Is Independent Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzFOwFXlR48)\n* [Video 4: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4)\n\nFor lots of additional video resources check out the [videos wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/videos) or /r/BitcoinTV .  Peer-reviewed, research papers can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg) and [here](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger).  Developer resources can be found [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-for-developers).  Lots of Bitcoin statistics can be found [here](https://coin.dance/).\n\n## Where can I buy bitcoins?\n\nYou can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank account.  A good list of exchanges sorted by region can be found on the [exchanges wiki here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/exchanges).\n\n**Note:** Bitcoins are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitfinex/btcusd/1hr) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Here are a couple useful sites [[bitkoin.io](http://bitkoin.io/), [preev.com](http://preev.com/btc/usd)] that shows how much various denominations of bitcoin are worth in different currencies. Alternatively you can just Google \"1 bitcoin in (your local currency)\".\n\n## Securing your bitcoins\n\nWith bitcoin you can \"be your own bank\" and personally secure your bitcoins **OR** you can use established companies which have secured wallets where they hold the bitcoins for you and provide insurance.\n\n* If you prefer to let bitcoin banks manage your coins, try [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Circle](https://www.circle.com/).\n\n* If you prefer to \"be your own bank\" and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, there are many software wallet options [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/wallets).  If you prefer easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.bitcointrezor.com/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/), [Case Wallet](https://choosecase.com), or [KeepKey](http://www.keepkey.com/) is recommended.\n\n**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** \n\n2FA requires a second confirmation code to access your account, usually from a text message or app, making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.\n\nGoogle Authenticator | Authy\n--------------------|-----\n[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en)\n[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8)\n\n## Tipping\n\nUse [ChangeTip.com](https://www.changetip.com/) ([/r/changetip](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip)) for tipping people on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr, Google+, GitHub, Slack and more! (you can even use [custom monikers](https://www.changetip.com/tip-amounts) to tailor your tip to the discussion or add a bit of humor).  Read more about ChangeTip at their reddit [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/index).\n\nGo to [/r/FreeBits](https://www.reddit.com/r/freebits) to get a few bits to practice with and then tip them forward. Go to [/r/BitTippers](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitTippers) to play games and solve riddles to earn your bits. Don't forget your flair!\n\n## Where can I spend bitcoins?\n\nStore | Product\n---|---\n[Microsoft](http://www.microsoftstore.com/) | Xbox games, phone apps and software\n[Spendabit](https://spendabit.co/) and [The Bitcoin Shop](https://shop.btcs.com/) | Search engines of online retailers accepting bitcoin with millions of results\n[Overstock](http://www.overstock.com/) and [Rakuten](http://global.rakuten.com/en/)  | Everything under the sun\n[Gyft](http://www.gyft.com/)  | Gift cards for hundreds of retailers including Amazon, Target, Walmart, Starbucks, Whole Foods, CVS, Lowes, Home Depot, iTunes, Best Buy, Sears, Kohls, eBay, GameStop, etc.\n[NewEgg](http://www.newegg.com/), [TigerDirect](http://www.tigerdirect.com/) and [Dell](http://www.dell.com/) | For all your electronic needs\n[Expedia](http://www.expedia.com/), [Cheapair](http://www.cheapair.com/), [Lot](http://www.lot.com/us/en/), [Destinia](http://destinia.us/), [BTCTrip](https://btctrip.com/), [Abitsky](http://www.abitsky.com/) and [9flats](http://www.9flats.com/) | For when you need to get away\n[BoltVM](https://boltvm.com/) | VPS service\n[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) | For new domain name registration\n[Cryptostorm](https://cryptostorm.is), [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net), and [PIA](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) | VPN services\n[Foodler](http://www.foodler.com/) and [Takeaway](http://corporate.takeaway.com/) | Takeout delivered to your door!\n[HumbleBundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/), [Disco Melee](https://beta.discomelee.com/hub), [GreenmanGaming](http://www.greenmangaming.com/), and [Coinplay.io](https://coinplay.io)  | For when you need to get your game on\n[Reddit Gold](https://www.reddit.com/gold/about/)  | Premium membership which can be gifted to others\n[Shipnik](https://shipnik.com)  | Discounted USPS Priority & Express mail postage\n\n[Coinmap](http://coinmap.org/) and [AirBitz](https://airbitz.co/) are helpful to find local businesses accepting bitcoins. UK residents can find a comprehensive directory of shops, pubs, websites and other places in the UK that accept bitcoins at [wheretospendbitcoins.co.uk](http://www.wheretospendbitcoins.co.uk).\n\nThere are also lots of charities which accept bitcoin donations, such as [Wikipedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Ways_to_Give#bitcoin), [Red Cross](https://bitpay.com/520663/donate), [Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org/), [United Way](http://www.unitedway.org/content/splash_holiday2014/), [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/) and the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/). You can find a longer list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/suggestions).\n\nAdditional resources can also be found at [TheBitcoinPage.com](http://www.thebitcoinpage.com/)\n\n## Merchant Resources\n\nThere are several benefits to accepting bitcoin as a payment option if you are a merchant;\n\n* 1-3% savings over credit cards or PayPal.\n* No chargebacks (final settlement in 10 minutes as opposed to 3+ months with credit cards / PayPal).\n* Accept business from a global customer base.\n* Increased privacy for your customers.\n* The payment processor can convert 100% of the sale to the currency of your choice for deposit to your account which means there is no need to hold bitcoins and no exposure to price volatility.  Alternatively, you can choose to keep a certain percentage of the sale in bitcoin if you wish to begin accumulating it.  \n\nIf you are interested in accepting bitcoin as a payment method, there are several options available;\n\n* [Bitpay](https://bitpay.com/bitcoin-for-retail)\n* [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/merchants)\n* [Coinify](https://coinify.com/merchants)\n* [Coinkite](https://coinkite.com/faq/terminal)\n* [Snapcard](https://www.snapcard.io)\n* [GoCoin](https://www.gocoin.com/)\n* [BitMerchant](https://github.com/tchoulihan/bitmerchant)\n\n## Can I mine bitcoin?\n\nMining bitcoins can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. \n\nIf you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can run a full node [using this setup guide](https://medium.com/@lopp/how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-full-node-2dd1c09763d3). You can view the global node distribution [here](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/).\n\n## Earning bitcoins\n\nJust like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoins by being paid to do a job.\n\n* [/r/Jobs4Bitcoins](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins)\n* [Coinality job board](https://coinality.com/)\n* [Bitgigs job board](http://bitgigs.com/)\n* [Find Bitcoin Jobs](http://www.findbitcoinjobs.com/)\n\nYou can also earn bitcoins by participating as a market maker to allow users to perform CoinJoin transactions with your bitcoins for a small fee (requires you to already have some bitcoins)\n\n* [JoinMarket](https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket)\n\n## Fundraising\n\nYou can use [Lighthouse](https://www.vinumeris.com/lighthouse) to crowdsource fundraising initiatives with bitcoin. It's similar to Kickstarter, but without intermediaries or exorbitant fees. You can participate in project discussions at [/r/LighthouseProjects](https://www.reddit.com/r/LighthouseProjects), and watch the progress of fundraisers at [lightlist.io](http://lightlist.io/). \n\n## Bitcoin Projects\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/projects) is a **short** list of ongoing projects that might be worth taking a look at if you are interested in current development in the bitcoin space.\n \n## Bitcoin Units\n\nOne Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of £/$/€) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:\n\nUnit | Symbol | Value | Info\n---|:---:|---|---\nmillibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for milli i.e. millilitre (mL) or millimetre (mm)\nmicrobitcoin | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for micro i.e microlitre (μL) or micrometre (μm)\nbit |bit| 1,000,000 per bitcoin| Colloquial \"slang\" term for microbitcoin\nsatoshi |sat| 100,000,000 per bitcoin| Smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor\n\nFor example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $500 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:\n\n* 0.02 BTC\n* 20 mBTC\n* 20,000 bits\n\nIf you want to use 'bits' exclusively, just remember that there are 100 satoshis in 1 bit, and 1 million bits in one bitcoin. For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).\n\n---\n\n**Still have questions?**  The friendly folks at /r/BitcoinBeginners would be happy to help you out, or stick around for our weekly Mentor Monday thread.

In 5 years now, every single mobile phone produced will have a bitcoin chip linked to the blockchain.\n\nToday on September 22nd 2015, the world stock markets are plunging.

    "selftext": "Just wanted to post some random thoughts in favor of sticking to core instead going with the new flavours.\n\n- A block size increase should be done, but no more than to 2/3Mb, there is (near)absolute consensus about this among all devs.\n\n- A block size increase should be done with a soft-fork, for technical security reasons, this is better than a hard fork (which could be done faster at the cost of added risks).\n\n- Bitcoin as it is right now won't scale, period. A block size increase (of more than the current consensus of 2Mb) is just a hack, not a solution for the scaling problem. It is a hack even if you make super optimistic assumptions on bandwidth and computing power increase over the years.\n\n- The Bitcoin Core roadmap addresses the scaling problem with the Lightning Network, maybe the best way of integrating off-chain transactions right into the main chain, and adds instant transactions.\n\n- The Lightning Network is open to everyone and there are several teams working on it (not just Blockstream), which goes in line with the open source model that have managed Bitcoin since the very beggining.\n\n- About the RBF drama : 0-conf transactions are insecure NOW and have always been, also they won't work EVER. No matter the amount of hacks you throw into it. The only secure and smart way of having instant transactions with Bitcoin are Payment Channels and the LN.\n\n- The LN network will also allow for privacy enanched transactions (transaction anonimity), something that is currently only possible with some easy to ban/attack HACKS like mixers.\n\nBitcoin is changing the world, mass adoption is happening and the fee market can have some additional pressure added while all the above gets deployed.\n\nAre you in a hurry for a half baked very short term solution ? Then go for some AltBitcoin.\n\nEDIT: Please feel free to comment after down voting :*",

    "is_self": true,
    "selftext": "Ethereum recently had an apparently mostly-\"successful\" hardfork, which demonstrates the extreme danger of not having an economy that is sufficiently backed by full nodes. 99% of ETH owners used EWallets, so miners + a small handful of \"major players\" were able to completely change the currency, even despite significant objection within the Ethereum community. It's possible to argue that the hardfork was itself good in some ways, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. A hardfork can change *anything* about a currency, and this incident showed how even things that might be considered unthinkable at one point in time (confiscating and redistributing coins) can eventually be justified and pushed through. In hardforks, everything that makes Bitcoin special could easily be destroyed. Bitcoin's *largest advantage* over fiat currency is its large degree of immunity from human tampering -- it's an emotionless, absolutely fair, incorruptible judge --, which hardforks by their very nature subvert. It is probably the case that Bitcoin must very rarely undergo hardforks in order to efficiently evolve, but they must be *extremely difficult*. If the rules of Bitcoin are easy to change, then Bitcoin doesn't really have any solid rules, and then what's Bitcoin's value?\n\nThankfully, this sort of hardfork probably couldn't happen in today's Bitcoin because a sufficient chunk of the economy is backed by full nodes. If miners + the top five exchanges tried to do a hardfork, there would be a clear and automatic split in the currency between these people and ~everyone else, since full nodes will never follow a hardfork, and enough of \"everyone else\" is running full nodes. I don't think that 5-10 exchanges would have enough economic strength to have a good chance of outweighing everyone else running a full node and pushing through a hardfork. In today's Bitcoin, many independent merchants and users run full nodes, and they all contribute to Bitcoin's economic strength.\n\nHowever, there is a disturbing trend away from this sort of robustness. Significantly increasing the max block size would make it more difficult for normal people to run full nodes, of course, but another huge concern is that a lot of businesses are relying on centralized APIs such as BitGo and BitPay to handle Bitcoin payments. For Bitcoin to be undefeatable, we should strive to make running a full node *easier* than any centralized API so that each merchant enforces the rules of Bitcoin independently, securing both themselves and Bitcoin as a whole.\n\nRelated:  \nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node#Economic_strength  \nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/validation",

This thief-hacker transaction, which I will remember forever, just taught me last night to not trust any service provider anymore. \n\nhttps://blockchain.info/tx/c81520e658a013332889a2e62d3215ba96bc5264b0806ec72f5933106f65d10d\n\nI created a private key from Bitaddress.org on 2017-08-08 and imported my private key into Blockchain Wallet (Blockchain.info) which provided the SMS, 2nd password, and confirmation by email for its security procedure. \n\nBut last night around 3 am GMT+7, my wallet got stolen. The thief transferred out everything with no access through Blockchain.info wallet at all. So it seems like the thief some how hacked and accessed to my private key which allows him to make a transaction manually with the third-party broadcasting tool.\n\nThese past few months, I never aware of this risk since many tutorials suggest me how to make a paper wallet via Bitaddress.org and just simply link it with Blockchain.info wallet.\n\nI realize it’s my fault to not create and keep my Bitcoin in a real cold storage. I would like to share this story to be a lesson for our Cryptocurrency community so everyone can be aware and start taking the security issue more serious.\n\nI want to say that I am Thai, many people think this is a lie. For me, I have to admit that the money is gone. I use google transate to communicate with you. My language ability is terrible Do you see the problem? Why the money is gone Because i read less I agree that I think wrong. What makes it safe? And to put money in. Blockchain.info, which is a hot wallet. If this is the case for everyone else, I want to make it. I think that making 387 bitcoin for my fool is not possible. But it is already. I'm a programmer who bought this bitcoin 3-4 years ago, and it's not expensive. At that time, I could spend only 200,000, which is not very difficult to buy.\n\nEdit: This is answer for some reply\n\nStill, people do not believe that I'm really stupid.\n\nYes It's real. And I try to tell you SMS, 2nd password, and confirmation by email for its security procedure.\nWhy I don't get any access log.\n\nThis is my missing 2/3 amount.\nNow I have bought a Ledger nano S. Do you think this is the best way to keep Bitcoin and it will not disappear anymore?\n\nI'm stupid, do not rush to buy hardware wallet before being hacked.\n\n(1) What is happening is real. Fools like me\n(2) I added a transfer because I did not know that already hacked.\n(3) My English friend wrote this message to me, ignoring the Crypto Safe Project, and I bought the hardware wallet.\n(4) I'm trying to find out why I got hacked. And I'm trying to find a way to save the rest.\n(5) I'm still a Bitcoin investor. Although 2 million dollars are gone, I bought it for only 200,000 and I do not want to make Bitcoin look bad. I do not want it to happen to anyone else.\n\nIt reminds me of Edward Snowden Do not trust computer when it connect internet.\nMy $ 1.7 million dollar memoir must be memorable, and I will tell everyone I love. About this lesson.\n\nAddress : 1EENuimoixhyn6k67UgeYo2mFFhRfEYots \n\nMessage :\nThis address belongs to reddit.com/u/gamezxz, today is 10/30/17. \n\nSignature : IExWjk6+Lfn4kJOYAX7vbOr1WfiYF2NkumurUo68FJgyPgACxdXL9CP1pKRzZstUIT5c7MEiq6ynG/qtQCiqqtQ=\n\nNow I thought I'd never get it back again. But at least I would like to know that after this financial route, how to use money laundering. Will there be some way to get it back?\nAfter this, I still have enough money left for my distribution.\nI will continue to live. I'm a very negligent programmer. I've bought a hardware wallet and now I'm thinking of something that Edward Snowden is not comfortable with and vulnerable.",

    "selftext": "**So I sold the last of my 22ish BTC yesterday.**\n\nI first got in around September of 2013 when the price was $130. I later set up a weekly buy on Coinbase buying the majority of my coins between $200 to $400. My original goal back then was to accumulate 21 BTC and be in the million club. I turned it off in 2015 once I was well over 21 coins. Of course looking back I wish I had never turned it off.\n\n**So why did I sell?** The value is now enough that I can pay my capital gains and still have enough to pay off my house leaving me completely debt free. I found myself constantly stressing over the fact I was storing close to 200K and I also fully expect a pull back at some point soon. Once my house is paid off I will most likely start buying back in again using money that would have been going towards a house payment.\n\n**Things I learned**  \n**Test your recovery process.** If you have a hardware wallet (and you should) send a small amount of crypto to it then wipe it and reload it using your seed. This made me much more confident using the wallet once I had done this and knew that recovery was pretty simple. Also use a passphrase, but make sure it is one you will never forget.\n\n**Store your seed securely.** I used a metal stamp to punch my seed into a ¼ inch steel plate. After that I dipped it in plastisol so it cannot be read and stored it in my safe with a description written on the outside. I also had another copy of the seed stored behind a picture at a trusted family member’s house just in case.\n\n**Sending a BTC transaction for tens of thousands of dollars is extremely stressful.** I first moved my coins from Coinbase to a hardware wallet before the BCH fork (yes, I was stupid and stored them on an exchange, although I did use their cold storage feature so there was a waiting period before they could be moved if my account was compromised). It was a long 15 minutes before the transaction showed up on the blockchain (I think Coinbase batches transactions up before sending) so I was freaking out that I had done something wrong and all my coins were gone. I wanted to save on transaction fees, but I should have moved them in smaller increments.\n\n**Weekly buys and dollar cost averaging is the way to buy.** I never had to think about the weekly buy so it was worth the small amount I paid for fees. Over time I was able to build a substantial sum.\n\n**It takes a long time to get out due to limits.** I was limited to 10K withdrawal per day so it is taking a while to transition to fiat. I applied for an increase but it was denied for some reason. I am pretty happy with Coinbase, but they are obviously dealing with growing pains. After withdrawing around 50K they quit letting me withdraw and said I needed to do some more verification. I tried uploading my license but the verification kept failing with a blank error message. I submitted a support ticket and heard nothing for several days. I finally remembered that they had recently added phone support so found the number and called. I only had to wait about 10 minutes until I talked to someone and they were very helpful. It turns out I was supposed to be prompted to use a web cam to take a selfie after uploading my license. Once I found that out I did it on my laptop that has a camera and was verified within 5 minutes. I had no problems with withdrawals after that.\n\n**Capital gains suck.** I took all the risk of buying into crypto yet I am going to be on the hook for close to 30K to the government for my long term gains. There is no way I am fucking around with the IRS though, so I will happily pay them. I still have some other crypto and will most likely start buying back in again in a few months. In a few years when I retire I will most likely try to live off of 37.5K income per year from selling crypto so I do not have to pay those capital gains. After a few years of that I will dip into my traditional retirement accounts. I still need to find out if I need to pay an estimated tax payment this quarter to avoid a penalty for not having enough taken out of my paycheck to cover my taxes for the year.\n\nMy hat is off to those that are still hodling. It has already gone up quite a bit since I sold. I might look back at selling and kick myself in the future, but right now the thought of being debt free is pretty liberating. \n**It has been one fucking hell of a ride and I will be back on the coaster with the rest of you soon!**\n",

    "selftext": "I posted about this [just a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6jrl5o/unrealistic_volatility_expectations/), but I feel that it's necessary to repeat. The Bitcoin price is on an unbelievably ridiculous upswing which is rather likely to be a bubble. If you're trying to get rich quick by dumping your retirement funds into BTC at $10k, then your \"investment strategy\" is not much better than someone betting everything on a game of roulette. High-risk-high-reward investing is not *necessarily* bad, but you have to seriously look at your thought process to make sure that you're not:\n\n* Being blinded by dreams of getting rich quickly, similarly to people who dump money on very-negative-EV lottery tickets.\n* Getting wrapped up in \"HODL\" memes, reddit comments, and other groupthink, which is sometimes fun, **but absolutely the last appropriate source of investment advice**.\n* Acting based on panic thinking like, \"OMG the price is going to $1 million and I will *miss my chance forever* if I don't buy *right now*\" or \"OMG the price is going to $0.01 and I will *miss my chance forever* to retain some value if I don't sell *right now*\".\n* Investing more than you can afford to lose. **Bitcoin is HIGHLY, HIGHLY speculative**. No investment advisor would tell you to put all of your life savings into MSFT or whatever, and MSFT has a market cap 4x larger than Bitcoin. Although I *believe* that it is very unlikely, there are several ways in which the value could drop precipitously, even to zero. For example, there is *no mathematical proof* that the cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin are actually secure -- they are merely *believed* to be secure because nobody has been able to break them after many years of intense scrutiny. (I'm not here recommending \"diversifying\" into altcoins -- altcoins are almost all complete trash, and price-wise they follow BTC but with even more volatility, so they're not really useful for diversification.)\n\nIt is entirely possible that the massive price increase of the last year is based on lasting fundamentals. In addition to things like the fairly recent subsidy halving, the defeat of B2X, etc., the world fiat-based economy is in many ways on very shaky ground, and getting worse all the time. There are many good reasons why BTC should have a larger market cap than every fiat currency combined. It's even possible that the price will increase quite a bit more from now. But for goodness sake, don't think that Bitcoin is the first-ever infinite-money generator that will continue to rise exponentially forever (in real terms). I can nearly guarantee that **there will be a large and long-lasting crash/downturn at some point**. Maybe it will be $10k to $5k, maybe it will be $50k to $30k, who knows. But if you're thinking for example that the current $5k+ price range is *absolutely secure* after only existing for a few months, then you're traveling blind through very dangerous territory.\n\nSome points to consider:\n\n* Buying near the ATH is very risky, and while it *can* be correct/profitable, it puts you on the wrong footing. You need to buy *low* and sell *high* to make money.\n* On 2013-11-29 (exactly 4 years ago) the peak ATH hit $1163, and then fell to $152 by 2015-01-13. That's a drop of 86.9%. Imagine this happens again: The price drops sharply to $2000 or something and then just continuously decreases down to a low of $1,432 (an 86.9% reduction from today's ATH) over the course of a *whole year*. I'm not saying that this *will* happen, but it's happened once and it *can* happen again. **Could you survive this?**\n* Bitcoin is experimental, and it is probably imprudent for someone who is not a true believer in the *soul* of Bitcoin to invest a lot into it. For example, I personally wouldn't invest more than a few percent of my total assets into ETH even if I felt very confident that it would rise in price because I simply don't believe in its philosophy or long-term value.\n* To reduce risk, it is frequently recommended to allocate assets by percentage, and rebalance upon large price movements. Eg. If you previously decided that you want to allocate 50% of your wealth in BTC (because you are a super big true believer), but BTC is now 90% of your wealth because the price increased so much, it may generally be advisable to start selling to rebalance your BTC allocation back down to 50%. I'm not saying that it is always absolutely wrong to have 90% of your assets in BTC or whatever, but it should be because you are intentionally *choosing* to do so, not because the price got away from you and you never really considered that you now have 90% of your wealth riding on one thing.\n* Avoid panic buys and panic sells. Dollar-cost-averaging over a long period of time is often a good strategy.\n* Nothing rises in real value to infinity. That's impossible. It is possible that 1 BTC could someday be worth infinite *dollars*, but that just means that dollars are worthless in that hypothetical scenario. BTC probably does have plenty of room to grow in real value before it completely takes over the world, but keep in mind that there *is* a ceiling.\n* If BTC were to reach values like $100k-$250k, that'd probably cause/imply that the prevailing economic regime has completely fallen apart. At some point in that price area, people around the world would probably lose substantial faith in fiat currencies. A good result, but ask yourself: do you expect the prevailing economic regime to *go down easily*?\n\nI'm not telling you to buy or sell, and I'm not giving financial advice here. I'm just urging everyone to think rationally, not emotionally or recklessly.",

    "is_self": true,
    "selftext": "On November 28, 2017, the US Senate, Committee of the Judiciary held a hearing regarding bill S.1241: Modernizing AML Laws to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. Despite little attention being given to digital currencies during the hearing, bill S.1241 itself would amend the definition of ‘financial institution’ in the United States Code to include digital currencies and digital exchanges. This could have alarming consequences for users of cryptocurrencies both in the US and abroad.\n\nBill S.1241 would amend the definition of ‘financial institution,’ in Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, to include “an issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.” Currently, the definition of ‘financial institution’ includes banks, trust companies, credit unions, currency exchanges, etc.\n\nIn her introduction, Mrs. Feinstein, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, said (31:35), “The bill criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.” Although, during the hearing, no further clarifications were given as to the effects this would have on the cryptocurrency community, based on the amended definition of ‘financial institution’, it seems clear enough that the bill would “criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.” Wow. Let this sink in for a minute…\n\nThe US senate is proposing a bill to make criminals out of anyone intentionally concealing ownership or control of a digital currency or digital exchange account. What’s more, according to the hearing’s prolonged discussion of US law enforcement’s handling of foreign banks and financial institutions, this bill is certain to have far-reaching effects on not only US citizens but the global community as a whole.\n\nIf the above statement describes you, it is strongly recommended that you watch the hearing with this new definition of ‘financial institution’ in mind. If you’ve already watched the hearing, watch it again, but this time replace all mentions of ‘banks and financial institutions’ with ‘digital currencies and digital exchanges.’ The implications are really rather alarming.\n\nInterestingly enough, Ms. Kathryn Haun Rodriguez, a Coinbase Board of Directors Member, made absolutely no mention of digital currencies or digital exchanges in her testimony; nor was she asked any questions pertaining to these topics.\n\nConversely, in her July 2017 written testimony to the US House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services and Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance, she stated that some users of digital currencies use them “to conceal and move illicit proceeds because of the perception that virtual currency is untraceable.”\n\nAlso in her prior written testimony, she stated that “the FinTech industry could be a very helpful partner to the government in addressing national security concerns;” that “investigators like digital footprints and that is exactly what digital currencies provide;” and that “of course, we can only follow the money to an individual or group if they used a Regulated exchange, one that follows basic AML/KYC laws.” Advertisement\n\nContrary to the bill itself, the hearing was noticeably lacking in references to cryptocurrencies; although there was some limited mention of such.\n\nMs. Klobuchar (2:16:58):\n\n“Is this transition we’re seeing from cash to digital going to make it easier or harder for law enforcement to track these money laundering cases, and you think these drug cartels are gonna start going cash free, and what do you do about it?”\nMr. John A. Cassara (2:17:15):\n\n“Senator, I’m just glad I had my career when I did because I don’t know what I’d do trying to follow the money when it comes to digital currencies, it’s extremely, extremely challenging…I think if you look at the metrics, the metrics suggest today [that] digital currencies are a small fraction of the threat that we face. That’s not to say it’s gonna be the case in 5-10 years from now. We’re right at a crossroads, and it’s going to be very, very interesting to see what goes forward.”\nDue to the probable negative implications for the global cryptocurrency community, hopefully the interpretation of bill S.1241 in this article is proven incorrect; however, at this point, it seems fairly clear (at least to me, the author) that this is the intent behind the bill. If this is indeed the case, it will be the most recent attack on a growing list of State-backed attacks against the crypto-community.\n\nFurthermore, from the noticeable lack of references made to digital currencies during the hearing, it would appear this bill is yet another underhanded attempt of the US Government to further erode global freedoms and civil liberties, which markedly began with the introduction of the Patriot Act, shortly after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAs Tone Vayes mentioned, it would have been nice if Andreas Antonopoulos was there to impart some of the wisdom he shared with the Canadian Senate, on October 8, 2014.\n\nTone Vayes’ summation*: “It’s bad…I think it’s gonna end in a very confrontational way between Bitcoin—even Bitcoin holders and users—and the US Government.”\n\nJimmy Song’s summation*: “Yeah, the nice thing about laws is they take a long time…”\n\nIndeed it will be “very, very interesting to see what goes forward.” If this bill passes, how many of you future criminals out there are still set on hodling?\n\n*to be fair, neither had yet watched the entire hearing.\n\nFull Disclosure: Landon Mutch is a contributor to the Lightning Network, a layer-two Bitcoin protocol, also BTCManager is scamming it’s writers and not paying them :(.",

With all this net neutrality stuff going on you'd be crazy to invest in money that they can just shut down with the flick of a switch!\"\n\nBecky, last week i heard you ask the IT guy if you needed two mice plugged in to your computer if you want to use two screens at once and now you have a working knowledge of both the monetary system, crypto currencies AND the internet?! that's very impressive.\n\nI have no idea why this is annoying me so much, I just found the need to rant while waiting for a meeting to start.\n\nEdit: people seem to have come to some weird conclusions that i've been doing nothing but come to work and try sell crypto to the entire office. the \"i told ya so\" isn't directed at me or anyone in particular, it's just general chatter around the office. i'm not printing out weekly bitcoin news letters to put on peoples desks or waiting by their car at night to ask why they haven't bought BTC.\n\nTry not to jump to conclusions based on a semi-satirical piece of information.\n\nDon't be a John or a Becky\n\nthe salty no-coiner input here is the best part. shout out to /r/all and probably /r/buttcoin",

At the time BTC-OTC  was one of the most reputable traders on  Localbitcoins.\n\nI  shortly reported this to localbitcoins.com whitch led to BTC-OTC's account being banned and funds being locked - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhjCz/37f0ab1fc8.png)  also made a police fraud complaint to the relevant authority in UK\n\nLocalbitcoins freezed the funds stating the following in my support ticket  - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmDT/0a136c253b.png)\n\nSince then I've been actively trying to get my coins with no result receiving only one single reply on my support ticket in 8 months\n\nWhen contacting Max on linkedin his reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmJU/01610eaef4.png)\n\nWhen contacting Max on reddit his reply was - [ HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmIn/71ff537bcf.png)   nevertheless 6 months passed with no reply on my ticket.\n\nI emailed  Jeremias Kangas (CEO & Founder of LBC)  with no success. Also in my numerous visits at Metropolitan Police with this issue I was advised the same, this is a localbitcoins.com customer service issue not a legal issue.\n\nPolice official statement on my complaint   -  [ HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmOd/9045da5342.png)\n\nNational Fraud Intelligence Bureau advised  to change my fraud complaint against localbitcoins in order for them to investigate and contact localbitcoins regarding the case.\n\nAfter 6 months of waiting, Max's reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmTD/d93973a8bf.png) , after sharing all the info on both support ticket and email he replied on email   [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmXK/a213a8d27b.png)\n\nI knew this won't go anywhere so meanwhile I found a Metropolitan Police Sergeant specialized in blockchain and cyber-crime that understood this issue and decided to help me by contacting them using the fraud report I made in 2015.\n\nAlmost 2 months passed since he contacted localbitcoins (3 times) receiving no reply.\n\nReason I'm posting this is because  there are other 5 persons in this very situation, also other hundreds based on the posts complaining online.\n\nNow I'm in the process of taking legal action. I've been in contact with over 40 lawyers from Finland, and found only 2 that are looking to take this case and quoted me at €10.000 to  €15.000 for civil proceedings,\n\nFinnish Law allows only Ombudsman to initiate  a class action lawsuit so this can be settled only in civil court\n\nIf you are a victim of this or you can help please get in touch.",

This is what happens when a dishonest company needs more capital fast and the chances of your RH BTC positions being non-collateralized have literally never been higher. Further, the chances of RH failing as a company have never been higher.\n\nLook into the faces of the young CEOs who made their fortunes by deceiving retail investors and selling them out via order flow. Do you really want to let these guys hold your BTC?\n\nFor the next 24 hours I will personally answer any questions that any of you may have about liquidating your RH positions and getting into a real exchange or decentralized marketplace (like BISQ)\n\nDo the right thing because it’s also the smart thing and because you low key always knew you should have been",

    "selftext": "We have been dating over three years. I met her in Uni when I did a semester in Scotland. Some people search a lifetime to find someone like her. Our paths collided at the exact right moment for us both and we quickly became inseparable. Truth be told its a cosmic anomaly that I landed a girl like her. I am gangly and goofy; a real nerd. She is a beauty with a swimmer's body. But I digress.\n\n I have never had a ton of money. But I was VERY early to BTC and accumulated almost 3 coins by the time we met. My first purchase was at $909, so it was a lot easier to stack back then. \n\nDoes she understand BTC? Not really. She barely understands money at all TBH. She looks at it as a hobby of mine. I see it as the keys to my (our?) financial future. \n\nSo COVID comes along and totally wrecks her career (she is in tourism) and my income is down as well. We are borderline struggling financially but I was still DCA monthly. Not as much as I before, but still working my way towards my goal of 4 BTC. With prices at $48k, my $500 DCA wasn't much but it was steps in the right direction.\n\nHere is where she doesn't understand money. With this economic uncertainty, and prices going up (HELLO INFLATION!), she wants to save CASH to make her feel more secure. She wants $$ in the bank. I have shown her websites, papers, and so much data about how BTC is deflationary and where we need to be positioned. She tunes me  out, and if I press the issue it turns into a verbal row and she ends up skwawking at me and disappearing. Believe me if she doesn't want to be found, she won't be. \n\nI had to make a decision. Do I want 4.0 and no GF, or 3.5 and the love of my life? After a few days she came back but she was acting very strange. She did sleep in the bed with me, which I didn't expect. I watched her sleep. I snuggled up behind her and nuzzled her slender neck, admiring her smooth skin in the moonlight. She pulled away from me. \n\nI turned on the light. It was time to clear the air. \"I have decided to not buy any more BTC until we are financially more stable. I am sorry I didn't respect your wishes. These are decisions we should make together.\"\n\nI immediately knew something was wrong. She then gave me the bad news...\n\nShe had taken my Trezor and thrown it in the lake. \n\nI RAGED. I am not violent but damn my fists were clenched in rage. HOW DARE SHE?!?!? I threw things. I literally flipped a table. I am not proud of how I reacted but there were YEARS of my labor in that device. At some point she slipped away.\n\nI heard the safe clank open in the other room. My mother fucking keys are in there! There she stood in the door with the paper holding my 12 words in her mouth. Her eyes were full of tears. \"I am so sorry. Here, you need this\". She had just climbed out of the lake and was dripping wet. The water rolled off of her and onto the paper, leaching the ink off the paper and destroying my only copy of my backup phrase.\n\nYOU BITCH! HOW COULD YOU?!?!?!?!??!??!\n\nDO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH THAT WAS WORTH?\n\nI saw anger flash in her eyes as she lifted herself to her full height (about 15 feet tall). She issued a low guttural growl, bared her teeth and said \"About tree fiddy\".\n\nIt was then I saw her for what she was; a plesiosaur from the Jurassic Period.",

    "selftext": "Bitcoin is not \"crypto\". Bitcoin IS the breakthrough. \"Crypto\" (tokens, alts, all that) are only possible because Bitcoin showed it was possible.\n\nBitcoin is a network, a protocol, and a system of digital money that made one of the biggest breakthroughs in history - the invention of digital scarcity. It allowed a digital thing to be tied to the real world through quantifiable expenditure of energy (PoW). Bitcoin is a public utility that has no owners, no rulers, no backing of any state or corporation, and a conception that can never again be repeated in history.\n\n\"Cryptos\" are \"projects\" that tackle \"use cases\", raise funding, have employees, ceos, board members, foundations, and can easily be censored by a state. 99.99% of crypto is created to enrich the creators, with retail as exit liquidity. All of them will trend to zero against Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is an alternative to central banking/modern monetary policy run by volunteers and can be used by anyone and everyone. It does not discriminate. It is a public good like the internet is for moving and storing information. The Bitcoin network is for moving and storing value.\n\n\"Crypto\" is not much different from fintech companies except they use a slow and expensive database and print their own treasuries at the push of a button. Sure there might be some interesting use cases, but literally all of them can be done without a blockchain.\n\nUnderstanding that Bitcoin is not crypto is just the first step. The deeper you go into that rabbit hole, the more questions you ask, the more you put Bitcoin under a microscope, the more mind-blowing it becomes.\n\nBitcoin is **not** \"crypto\".\n\nEdit: What happened to this sub. Personal attacks? Pretty sad. But what do you expect with 4.4 Million subscribers. Thanks to all the decent commenters that encouraged healthy discourse. The keyboard warriors that are sending ad hominem messages, go nurse your 4 digit \"crypto\" portfolio that's down 80%. HFSP.",

I bought the marketing hook line and sinker myself.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \nI know, this might be a very controversial take for this subreddit, but these companies' marketing has been pretty damn pervasive.\n\nToo many times on this subreddit I see people recommending these products as something secure, as almost foolproof.\n\nUnfortunately, that's  just their marketing at work, and it's sadly working.  Take ledger for example:I'll copy my comment from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zatcbe/comment/iynjkh1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n>The company has leaked 273k people's data with 0 recourse,Due to shitcoin support, bitcoin was sent instead of shitcoins [source](https://decrypt.co/37651/ledger-exploit-makes-you-spend-bitcoin-instead-of-altcoins).If you use ledger live instead of something like electrum, it phones home to ledger's servers.Which if said servers are down you cannot transact [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/jurv7w/ther_server_could_not_handle_your_request_please/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).It's also closed sourced so who knows what the hell it's doing under the covers.Not to mention it's not airgapped.  \n>  \n>Imo coldcard is much better as a solution.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso to quote MisterRGnome, if you MUST use these devices, do NOT use their bundled in wallet software, use something like electrum, blue, sparrow, ANYTHING else to handle your signing/transacting.\n\nTrezor is similarly bad, maybe slightly less.\n\nthey're open sourced, but [They have been hacked if you have physical access to the wallet](https://www.coolwallet.io/kraken-hacks-trezor-in-15-minutes/).You'd think a company that sells itself on security would you know, revise their hardware to make this impossible, but they haven't!\n\nThere are myriads of issues with so many hardware wallets.\n\ncoldcard comes closest to being good, but they're not without fault either.\n\nTheir recent mk4 comes with NFC support that flies in the face of what their philosophy was. They're appealing to the masses and trying to get your money, making their device less secure in the process.\n\nif you're serious about being safe take a look into something like [Glacier Protocol](https://glacierprotocol.org/).",

When I was young I was once in a car with my older aunty and she said turn on the wireless. What the fuck is a wireless? The radio. Oh ok why on earth do you call a radio a wireless. It made her sound like she was from world war one.\n\nTheres so many examples of this in daily life. Some older people still refer to the internet as the world wide web because thats what everyone called it in the 90s.\n\nRight now we have this luxury of refering to whole bitcoins but that wont last forever. Soon one bitcoin will be worth so much the only way to effectively refer to amounts of bitcoin will be using sats. Sats just makes so much more sense especially when one bitcoin is above $100k.\n\nOnce sats become the main currency term used bitcoin or bitcoins will no longer be used when talking about the currency. Bitcoin will be the name of the network and sats will be the currency everyone owns and uses.\n\nYou will ask a kid in 2035 if they have bitcoin and they will say I dont have bitcoin I have sats. Looking back there will have been this tiny initial 15 year window where we all called the bitcoin currency \"bitcoins\" but after that initial window for the rest of bitcoins existence the bitcoin currency will be called sats by everyone on earth.\n\nIn 2035 if you say you own bitcoin or you want to pay using bitcoins kids will laugh at you and tell you that you sound old AF. Everyone will save sats, pay with sats, transact with sats, use sats, send sats, and tip sats. The name of the network will be bitcoin but the monetary unit will be known by everyone as sats not \"bitcoins\" and if you try to use the term bitcoins you will be considered ancient and out of touch.\n\nOnce one bitcoin (sorry, 100 million sats) is worth more than $100k im going to stop saying bitcoins and im going to only refer to the monetary unit as sats from that point on.\n\nBitcoin is the name of the network, sats is the name of the money.",

    "selftext": "Whenever he mentions Bitcoin, you can sense his ignorance. Just have a look at some old videos from 2020 or later. There are statements like these:\n\n  \n1.\n\n\"Bitcoin may not necessarily be the solution, but blockchain is brilliant.\"\n\nSo, he prefers data being centrally entered into a decentralized database? Then why not just run a regular database on AWS?\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\"The inventor of Bitcoin surely wouldn't have wanted warehouses full of ASICs consuming more electricity than some major cities.\"\n\nBut at the same time, he ignores that Bitcoin mining can also have positive aspects:\n\nCoinDesk article: [https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/06/bitcoin-mining-is-good-for-the-energy-grid-and-good-for-the-environment/](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/06/bitcoin-mining-is-good-for-the-energy-grid-and-good-for-the-environment/)\n\n\n\n3.\n\nOr consider the following statement:\n\n\"The prices of graphics cards are so high because of Bitcoin miners.\"\n\nBut he ignores the fact that graphics cards are not used for Bitcoin mining...\n\nFor example, if you engage in graphics card mining with NiceHash, you mine some random altcoin and get paid in Bitcoin through NiceHash. But just because you're paid in Bitcoin for your computing power doesn't mean you're engaged in Bitcoin mining.\n\n\n\nHere's the link that likely proves Linus hasn't really spent 10 minutes delving into Bitcoin, why bother when bLoCkChain is supposedly better...\n\nYouTube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ1JE43L9mI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ1JE43L9mI)\n\n\n\n**I would like to see a debate between Linus and Michael Saylor. Linus' arguments would be rendered useless within 10 minutes, as they would be refuted by facts.**\n\n",

    "selftext": "# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ\n\nYou've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  \n\nIt all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:\n\n* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)\n* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) - or [download a free copy here](http://cryptache.ro/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Bitcoin-Standard-The-Decentralized-Alternative-to-Central-Banking-PDF-Room.pdf)\n* [Video 1: An introduction to Bitcoin - Wences Casares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFKJVLNVQA)\n* [Video 2: The Stories We Tell About Money - Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONvg9SbauMg)\n* [Video 3: The Bitcoin Standard - Saifdean Ammous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbm772vF-5M&t=286s) \n* [Video 4: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4)\n\nSome other great educational resources include;\n\n* The [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/) (check them out!)  \n* Swan [Bitcoin Canon](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/canon/)\n* Michael Saylor's [Hope.com](https://hope.com/) and [\"Bitcoin for Everybody\"'](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=468) course\n* Jameson Lopp's [resource page](http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html)\n* Gigi's [resource page](https://bitcoin-resources.com/#bitcoin-non-technical)\n* James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q&index=7&t=0s)\n* Parker Lewis's [Gradually Then Suddenly series](https://unchained.com/blog/category/gradually-then-suddenly/)\n* Some Bitcoin statistics can be found here ([1](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/), [2](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/hashrate/6m?c=m&g=15&r=week&t=a), [3](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/), [4](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/), [5](https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-price-performance-since-halving), [6](https://augmentedcoin.io/btc), [7](https://nakamotoportfolio.com/nakamoto/start)).\n* A Reading List of [Advanced Bitcoin Books](https://new.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c5fjhn/advanced_bitcoin_reading_list_curriculum_in_order/)  \n\nIf you are technically or academically inclined check out;\n\n* Developer resources ([1](https://developer.bitcoin.org/), [2](https://spiral.xyz/#projects)) \n* [Peer-reviewed research papers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg)\n* Course lectures from both [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/) and [Princeton](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qynvj/dont_panic_just_learn_sixty_free_lectures_from/) \n*  Future [protocol improvements](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/) and [scaling resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/56nnd8/the_scaling_bitcoin_website_is_awesome_videos/).  \n\nMicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial Bitcoin integration.\n\nYou can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)\n\n## Key properties of Bitcoin\n\n* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.\n* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.\n* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).\n* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  \n* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).\n* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.\n* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).\n* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.\n* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. \n* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.\n* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met\n* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. \n* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. \n* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).\n* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.\n* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).\n* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.\n* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.\n\n## Where can I buy bitcoin?\n\n[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.\n\n* [Strike](https://strike.me/)\n* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)\n* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)\n* [River Financial](https://river.com/)\n* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) \n* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) \n* [Relai](https://relai.app/)\n* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)\n* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)\n* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)\n* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)\n* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)\n* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)\n\nYou can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  \n\n**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. \n\n## Securing your bitcoin\n\nWith Bitcoin you can **\"Be your own bank\"** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **\"Bitcoin banks\"** which will hold your bitcoin for you.\n\n* If you prefer to **\"Be your own bank\"** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).\n\n* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.\n\n* If you prefer to work with third party **\"Bitcoin banks\"** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **\"Not your keys, not your coins\"**. \n\n**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** \n\n2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.\n\n**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called \"SIM swapping\" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.\n\nGoogle Auth | Authy | OTP Auth \n--------------|--------|------------\n[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A \n[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | \n\nPhysical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.\n\n## Running Bitcoin\n\nYou can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. \n\nIt is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). \n\nDon't Trust, Verify.\n\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases\n* https://bitcoincore.org\n* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/\n\nA verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). \n\nFor wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.\n\n## Watch out for scams\n\nAs mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **\"Don't trust, verify\"**. \n\n* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.\n* Ignore private messages offering services.\n* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.\n* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.\n* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.\n\n## Common Bitcoin Myths\nOften the same concerns arise about Bitcoin from newcomers.

    "selftext": "Okay I asked chat gpt the following and I know it’s bad at math but I think this looks right:\n\n\nSay I bought $1000 worth of bitcoin when it was worth $.25 a bitcoin then every time I doubled my money I took out $1000 and kept my original $1000 invested in bitcoin then as bitcoin goes up in Price again and again and again each time I get to 2000 I take out 1000 and I’m left with 1000.How much money would I have now? Given that bitcoin’s current price is $65,000\n\n\nLet’s break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Purchase**: \n   - You bought $1,000 worth of Bitcoin when the price was $0.25 per Bitcoin.\n   - Number of Bitcoins you own initially = $1,000 / $0.25 = **4,000 Bitcoins**.\n\n2. **Doubling Strategy**: \n   - Every time your investment doubles, you take out $1,000 but leave $1,000 invested.\n   - For this, we need to track each time the price of Bitcoin doubles, how many Bitcoins you withdraw, and how many you keep invested.\n\nLet’s walk through the price doubling steps, starting at $0.25 and doubling up to $65,000.\n\n### Step-by-Step Doubling:\n- **$0.25 to $0.50**: \n  - Value of 4,000 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (2,000 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$0.50 to $1.00**: \n  - Value of 2,000 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (1,000 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$1.00 to $2.00**: \n  - Value of 1,000 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (500 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$2.00 to $4.00**: \n  - Value of 500 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (250 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$4.00 to $8.00**: \n  - Value of 250 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (125 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$8.00 to $16.00**: \n  - Value of 125 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (62.5 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$16.00 to $32.00**: \n  - Value of 62.5 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (31.25 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$32.00 to $64.00**: \n  - Value of 31.25 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (15.625 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$64.00 to $128.00**: \n  - Value of 15.625 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (7.8125 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$128.00 to $256.00**: \n  - Value of 7.8125 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (3.90625 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$256.00 to $512.00**: \n  - Value of 3.90625 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (1.953125 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$512.00 to $1,024.00**: \n  - Value of 1.953125 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (0.9765625 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$1,024.00 to $2,048.00**: \n  - Value of 0.9765625 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (0.48828125 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$2,048.00 to $4,096.00**: \n  - Value of 0.48828125 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (0.244140625 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$4,096.00 to $8,192.00**: \n  - Value of 0.244140625 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (0.1220703125 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$8,192.00 to $16,384.00**: \n  - Value of 0.1220703125 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (0.06103515625 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$16,384.00 to $32,768.00**: \n  - Value of 0.06103515625 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (0.030517578125 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$32,768.00 to $65,536.00**: \n  - Value of 0.030517578125 Bitcoins = ~$2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000, leaving **0.0152587890625 Bitcoins**.\n\n### Final Calculation:\n- Now, at a Bitcoin price of **$65,000**, your remaining **0.0152587890625 Bitcoins** are worth:\n  - **0.0152587890625 BTC × $65,000 = $991.82**.\n\nSo, after taking out $1,000 repeatedly whenever the value doubled, you would now have about **$991.82 worth of Bitcoin** remaining. However, along the way, you would have already withdrawn **$19,000 in total** (since you took out $1,000 each time your investment doubled).\n\n### Total Money:\n- Total withdrawals: **$19,000**.\n- Remaining Bitcoin value: **$991.82**.\n- **Total = $19,991.82**.\n\n\nSo a great outcome but not life changing. \n\n\nHODL",

Amazon was once 2000$ and up only because that was pre-split, not because the stock market is down... The average person will never grasp these financial concepts. \n\nWill it ever be possible to set up bitcoin price in a way so its not so intimidating to average society? Sort of like Stock Splits. I mean come on guys, when bitcoin is 200k, normies wont be buying this coin. They will try to buy the next big alt coin. At that point only big institutions will be focusing on bitcoin.",

    "selftext": "The first time I heard about Bitcoin was back in high school, around 2010. It was mostly in the context of the Silk Road and other obscure corners of the internet. I remember stumbling across websites that would reward you with fractions of Bitcoin just for watching ads—worth mere pennies at the time, but today, those tiny fractions would be worth hundreds of dollars.  \n\nMy first Bitcoin purchase was just for fun on Mt. Gox. I threw in maybe $20 or $50—definitely less than $100 per BTC. That purchase sparked my curiosity, and I started binge-reading everything I could find about blockchain technology. It fascinated me, especially since I leaned libertarian and supported small government. But back then, Bitcoin was confusing, impractical, and barely accepted anywhere. It felt more like a speculative gamble than anything revolutionary.  \n\nAn older sibling of mine had some BTC at the time but lost the password to their exchange wallet. (Probably just leftover funds from Silk Road purchases #420)  \n\nCollege Years: The First Bitcoin Boom  \n\nFast forward to 2011, and I started hearing more about Bitcoin as the price fluctuated. But it was mostly background noise while I focused on college. When I visited home, friends would talk about how they \"missed the boat\" when BTC hit $600. I felt the same way.  \n\nThen in 2014, Mt. Gox collapsed. I had completely forgotten about the small fraction of BTC I had sitting on the exchange. When it went bankrupt, I lost faith in Bitcoin. If the only way to buy and store BTC was on shady exchanges that could get hacked or mismanage funds, what was the point? At the time, I didn’t know about cold storage, and hardware wallets weren’t even widely available yet.  \n\nLooking back, my understanding was still shallow. It was hard to find clear, digestible explanations of Bitcoin, and information was scattered across niche forums and technical whitepapers.  \n\n2017: The Bull Market That Hooked Me  \n\nAfter graduating college, I got my first job in 2017. That’s when I started hearing about Bitcoin again—this time from my colleagues. The 2017 bull run was all over the news as BTC broke $10,000 for the first time.  \n\nThis time, I took Bitcoin seriously. I spent over 100-200 hours deep-diving into the technology, and by the time I was done, I was hooked. Learning about Bitcoin in 2017 was infinitely easier than in 2010 or 2011—there were explainers, debates, YouTube channels, and books.  \n\nWith all the hype, I made my first significant investment—just a few thousand dollars, but enough to matter to me. You probably know what happened next: the market corrected, Bitcoin entered a multi-year bear market, and I eventually sold at a loss after two years.  \n\n2020: The Next Bull Run and My Second Deep-Dive  \n\nI forgot about Bitcoin again until late 2020 when another bull market kicked off. Suddenly, BTC was hitting new all-time highs, and I was drawn back in.  \n\nBy this point, I had already spent over 100 hours learning about Bitcoin in the past, so I wasn’t starting from scratch. But this time, I went even deeper—probably dedicating another 300–400 hours. I was in a new job, had just moved states, and was completely obsessed. I binged every Bitcoin-related video, debate, and explainer I could find. My wife was sick of hearing me talk about it.  \n\nDetermined not to repeat my 2017 mistake, I started dollar-cost averaging—$100 per week, every week. It was going great until I started listening to the wrong people. Specifically, a YouTuber named Gareth Soloway. He convinced me that Bitcoin was going to crash to $20K, so I held off. When it dropped to $28K, he said it was going lower—maybe $14K. I waited. It never happened. BTC rebounded to $60K, then corrected to $43K, then $30K. I was still trying to time the market instead of just stacking and holding.  \n\n2024: The Turning Point  \n\nBear markets have this weird way of making me forget about Bitcoin. After the 2022 crash, I tuned out again—until March 2024, when BTC hit a new all-time high above $70K.  \n\nYou probably see the pattern by now: every time Bitcoin pumps, I go deep into research. But this time, I took it further. I spent the most time out of any deep-dive: at least 500–600 hours studying Bitcoin, reading books like *The Bitcoin Standard* and *Thank God for Bitcoin*, and listening to the entire Michael Saylor series with Robert Breedlove.  At this point I believe I passed the 1000 hour threshold of learning about BTC.\n\nI realized I never wanted to let another \"expert\" like Gareth Soloway shake my conviction again. So, I made the biggest move of my life—I bought my first whole Bitcoin at a $50K cost basis and moved it straight to cold storage. I made a promise: I will not even *think* about selling for at least 20 years. (2045)\n\nThen, as Bitcoin climbed to $90K, I bought my second BTC. When the price dipped after that, I didn’t panic. I had seen this too many times before.  \n\nReflections\n\nI get frustrated when friends dismiss Bitcoin with the same misconceptions I once had. They’ll say things like:  \n\n- “It has an infinite supply, just like fiat.” (Not realizing Bitcoin is hard-capped at 21 million.)  \n- “I don’t trust it—it gets hacked all the time.” (Confusing Bitcoin’s network security with centralized exchanges getting hacked.)  \n- “Only major corporations and whales own it.” (When in reality, everyday retail investors hold the majority of Bitcoin.)  \n\nThe ironic part? --They’re me, 5 or 10 years ago. I used to think Bitcoin was just internet magic money, a passing trend, or worse—a scam. Now, after years of learning, I see the fundamental shift it represents. I try to explain it to them, but I know that real conviction only comes from personal discovery.  \n\nThat’s what makes Bitcoin different. It forces you to challenge your assumptions, do your own research, and develop true conviction.\n\nLessons Learned  \n\n**Knowledge brings conviction. Experience brings fortitude.**  \n\nI’ve been in and out of Bitcoin for over a decade. I’ve watched it crash, rally, and crash again. I’ve made mistakes—selling too early, listening to the wrong voices, trying to time the market. But each cycle, I learned.  \n\nNow, I don’t chase price action. I don’t try to time the dips. I just buy, hold, and secure my Bitcoin for the long haul.  \n\nBecause in the end, Bitcoin isn’t just an investment. It’s a revolution. \n\n",

    "selftext": "\nWall Street plays with something called futures, which are bets on what Bitcoin’s price will be later—like in two weeks. \n\nWith futures, you don’t need to own Bitcoin; you just promise to sell it at today’s price ($82,000 right now) and hope it drops so you can buy it back cheaper and pocket the difference.\n\nHere’s how it goes: Hedge funds make a big futures bet, “selling” thousands of Bitcoin at $82,000 on paper. \n\nThen, they push the real price down by selling some Bitcoin fast on exchanges or spreading rumors (like “ETFs are slowing!”). This panics smaller traders who borrowed money to bet on Bitcoin going up. \n\nWhen the price falls to $80,000 or $79,000, those traders get forced to sell, and it crashes harder—say, down to $77,000.\n\nWhile the price is low, the funds quietly buy real Bitcoin through private deals (not on public exchanges) at $77,000. Then, they close their futures bet by “buying” back the Bitcoin they promised to sell, but at $77,000. \n\nThey make a profit ($5,000 per Bitcoin) and keep the Bitcoin they snagged cheap.\n\nSo, they use futures to tank the price, scare everyone out, and grab Bitcoin at a discount—all while making money on the drop. That’s how the price can fall even when they’re secretly loading up for the long run.\n\nIf we want the big boys to buy we need to play big boy games. \n\nMoral. Keep some powder dry for opportunities like this and remember they aren’t trying to crash it to zero. They’re trying to buy the bags from paper handed pussies.  \n\n",

Are there wallets / protocols supporting recurring payments? Should I build my own solution and send a payment reminder shortly before subscription needs to renew, requiring the user to manually pay each invoice? Has the lightning network matured, and should it be used for accepting payments? If so, should it be presented as an option alongside traditional BTC payments, or as the only option?\n\nThank you in advance.",

Right before the market crashed (i was not aware at all that anything was happening with crypto this big) i got $2000 payment in BTC when it was 95k. I was of course asleep when i got the BTC. Woke up and my shi was now 1900 or 1850 because the price dropped to sub 90k. I panicked and started joining crypto subs to try and understand what should i do. \n\n\nBTC then went to 92k but i got greedy and wanted to go out without a loss. That was a mistake and now Btc is reaching sub 80k. Obviously i know BTC long-term is gonna be waaay higher. But right now i can't afford time.\n\nI honestly have one idea that will probably not work but here it goes. \n\nIf there are crypto bros out there that 0.02 BTC is pocket change for you, please help a guy out and buy me out for my original worth 😭.\n\n\nLong shot obviously so I'd also appreciate anyone with better understanding in the market than me to tell me if there's any logical way for me to get out of this situation without loosing money (my loss is worth a months salary in my country🤣)",

However, I’m struggling to understand the hype around “generational wealth” that people often mention here. Is that really achievable for average folks who can only stack smaller amounts, especially now that Bitcoin’s price is already high?\n\nIf someone owns about 0.1 BTC today, even if Bitcoin hits $1 million per coin in 10-15 years (which would already be an incredible scenario), they’d still only end up with around $100,000. Don’t get me wrong, $100,000 is a lot of money, particularly for someone in a developing country. But realistically, that isn’t the life changing, early retirement amount that I keep hearing about.\n\nIf a regular person stacks roughly $100 to $300 each month, how far could Bitcoin realistically take them over the next 10 or 20 years? Is it more practical to think of Bitcoin as just a good way to protect against inflation rather than expecting it to provide life changing wealth?\n\nI’m curious to hear realistic experiences and opinions from people who’ve stacked consistently over the years, especially those who started small. Has your perspective changed about what’s possible with Bitcoin? What’s a realistic long term goal for regular stackers today?\n\nThanks!",

Things like family, death of consumption culture, energy abundance... There is a lot of talk about what a Bitcoin world would look like.\n\nOne topic that is surprisingly absent from these discussions is the topic of liberal arts. My guess is that the current meaning of the phrase has been so corrupted by the Fiat system that it has kind of become a symbol for \"the other side\". You hear liberal arts today and you think of a misguided youth who got into debt for a useless college degree and now is angry at capitalism for not giving them the job they feel they deserve...\n\nBut a century ago the phrase had a different meaning. A \"Liberal education\" was an education that one sought not because it was needed for a profession, but simply sought for the persuit of knowledge. It is called \"liberal\" not because the political meaning of the word, but rather because it is \"free\" and not done for any other reason than self betterment.\n\nHistorically, a lot of great artists, poets, writers, philosophers, and so on where able to create their great works because they where not burdened by the same financial pressures we have today. Some where aristocrats themselves and others had wealthy patrons.\n\nWith this in mind. Liberal arts and liberal educations become a lot more interesting from a bitcoiners point of view. In a world where one is no longer a Fiat wage/tax slave, would one be more inclined to create things simply because one wants to add beauty to the world rather than for it to be sold as a commercial product?\n\nCommunists and Marxists often talk about these things but fail to recognize the fact that they would surrender their freedom of creation to a central planner instead of being free to express themselves in a permissionless way.\n\n... Just a thought...",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Do not invest in alt coins if you are an average investor, you will lose everything or most of it, there is no chance to do it right and avoid millions of tricks, traps and scam that are plaguing the crypto. Do not think that you can be smart about it. Alts is just another tool for whales to siphon assets from average Joes.\n\nI was warned myself by bitcoiners back when I decided to invest in alt coins. I disregarded the warning, I thought those were coming from ignorance. I was wrong.  \nMaybe someone here reads my post, contributing to saving his money, who knows.\n\nI sold everything I had back 2023 and started to gradually buy BTC, average price around 30k. I was fascinated by the technology and, of course, I couldn't avoid exposure to alt coins, as they looked faster, more efficient with greater opportunities and applications. POS vs POW issue was becoming less and less relevant to me. Long story short, I find myself balls deep in altcoins - multiple wallets, airdrop farming, DeFi, and all kinds of crypto channel subscriptions. First few months felt fantastic, anything I bought was in the green. Then came the highs of March-April 2024. And instead of exiting the market with about 40% in profit, I made a dreaded mistake of investing even more. But how would I know, EVERY single crypto channel was buzzing about how this is only the beginning and the trip to the moon has only started. Up to the end of the year my portfolio was in the red. And then came December - the last opportunity to exit the market, not in profit, but at least with moderate losses. And of course I missed it as well. I just couldn't admit the defeat. Because I'm an average noob. And because crypto influencers are not living off the market, they live off you, they live off clicks, adds, payed access, courses and referrals - they are shepherds taking livestock to the slaughterhouse.  \nMost I lost because of poor investment choices, a lot I lost to straight scams (rug pulls, honey pots, etc.), some I lost to liquidations in DeFi protocols. I still have a little saved in BTC, but largely I am broke and have to go back to the soul crushing 9-5 grind for food and shelter. Back to being a poor dumbass.",

    "selftext": "**All hashrate is not equal**. \n\nBold claim, *I know* \\- Yes, we can all talk about how 1 BTC = 1 BTC, but in quite a few scenarios, 1 Terahash does not 1 Terahash. *nominally*, yes, *but in compute power to the network*, no. Lets talk about three situations in which this is the case, each a little more convoluted than the last.\n\n# 1. Hashrate is inflationary.\n\n>Time Value of Hashrate\n\nWhile 1 BTC will always be 1/21,000,000th of the supply, the value of a hash drastically diminishes over time. 1 Terahash ten years ago, would be orders of magnitude more valuable than 1 Terahash today. This makes sense because of how much more abundant hashrate is in 2025. **Just like how one 2010 dollar is worth more than one 2025 dollar, one 2010 hash is worth more than one 2025 hash.**\n\nThis is not a problem at all though, as we all exist in the same moment in time in this god forsaken corporeal realm. As long as we are all on the same level playing field, and 1 hash/second for me is equal to 1 hash/second for you, there's no problem.\n\n# 2. Hashrate is punctual.\n\n>Speed Value of Hashrate\n\nSending your hashes back to your mining pool too late can result in an invalid hash. This is why having a good internet connection can help you get the full potential of your ASIC miners. If you have a spotty internet connection or high ping to your pool, your 100TH antminer could be less productive than someone else's 100TH antminer.\n\n# 3. Hashrate is... here.\n\n>Spatial Value of Hashrate\n\nAbsolutely crazy Kardashev-scale jump, but here is an unfortunate reality. Bitcoin's network hashrate is here, on Earth.\n\n**The value/power of your hashrate,** ***even with zero latency*****, diminishes approximately linearly by 1%**^(☆) **for every 900,000  kilometers** (\\~560,000 miles) away from the the majority of compute power. This is absolutely not an issue for us on earth, which is a fraction of this size. However, far into the future, 900,000 kilometers will be basically nothing for a space-faring civilization. \n\nHow? The speed of light. Consider an ASIC miner 45 million kilometers away from Earth. At this distance, light takes 2.5 minutes to make a oneway trip. This means it would take the miner 2.5 minutes to get the previous block information, and another 2.5 minutes for them to send back valid hashes for the next block. (they would only be able to mine solo, as no pool would accept them probably) With only 10 minutes between blocks, this gives them only 5 minutes to work on the same problem than people on earth have 10 minutes to accomplish. **This effectively puts a valuation of 1 Earth Terahash for every 2 space-man Terahashes**. Even though they both have the same computational power, Mr. Spaceman is at a big disadvantage. At 90 million km away? A round trip is 10 light-minutes long, making all hashrate essentially worthless.\n\nIt's not that far in the grand scheme of things. The average distance to Mars exceeds this figure, and a future civilization there will be out of luck for Bitcoin mining - let alone an eventual civilization beyond the solar system.\n\n  \n^(☆ Not accounting for the realistic standard distribution of block-times, and instead based on a static 10-minute block time.)

Even if I used a dedicated wallet for purchases—transferring funds from my main wallet (or \"bag\")—the shop could still trace the transaction back to my \"bag\" address.\n\nSo, my question is: should we only consolidate our UTXOs if we never plan on making purchases with BTC?

    "selftext": "I talked about this a little bit in some previous posts of mine, but I used generalized linear formulas, and i wanted to get a more exact formula of the diminishing of hashrate effectiveness across distance. I understand this might be a little over-the-top for a subreddit that is ***hyper-focused on posting the next rollercoaster gif***, but let me do me, and maybe some mathematicians and generational-maxis can appreciate it.\n\n**A little context:**\n\nBitcoin's block time is not **exactly** 10 minutes, as it is a probabilistic function which follows a poisson distribution. Every second has a 1/600 chance of having the next block. Essentially making a block **always** approximately 10 minutes away. 5 minutes worth of Bitcoin mining on block #982357 does not make a miner any closer to mining that block, as it's not a progress bar of completion.\n\nOrphaned blocks will be pretty important in this post, these are blocks that the Bitcoin network rejects for a number of reasons, namely submitting the block too late, when the network has already found another solution and moved on.\n\nAlright now we can take the mental leap into this thought experiment.\n\nIf you are several light-minutes away, any block (*or information for that matter*) will take several minutes to arrive back at Earth, as nothing can exceed the speed of light. This means that there is a higher chance of any block you find being orphaned, as it is likely that an Earth-based miner would have announced their correct solution before your solution has a chance to arrive, thus the network has moved on.\n\nThis reduces your **effective hashrate** because only some of your blocks will be accepted. In this post we will calculate effective hashrate as a function of distance.\n\nAt any distance within Earth's bounds, your effective hashrate is essentially equal to real hashrate. But Let's go beyond.\n\nThe probability of mining a successful block is **e****^(-(1/600(d/c)****))**, a negative exponential distribution, where **d** is the distance from the compute network you are, and **c** is the speed of light. This makes the probability of mining an orphaned block the complement of this, or,  **P = 1 - (e****^(-(1/600(d/c)****)))**\n\nPlugging in the Hashrate variables gives us a final equation of:\n\n**Effective Hashrate = Raw Hashrate \\* (e****^(-(1/600(d/c)****)))**\n\nLet's plug in some relatively close (in galactic terms) distances and see how the math works out.\n\n|Distance|Light-Distance|Effective Hashrate|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Earth (0km)|0 seconds|100%|\n|Moon (384,400km)|1.28 seconds|99.8%|\n|Closest Mars (56,000,000km)|186 seconds|69%|\n|Farthest Mars (400,000,000km)|1,320 seconds|3%|\n\nAlright so lets make some sense of these numbers. How can someone be 1,320 light seconds away and still have some effective hashrate, when blocktimes are 10 minutes?\n\nWell I'm sure we've all experienced an unfortunate transaction when the next block takes 30+ minutes to be found. These would essentially be the only blocks that a miner on Mars would be able to contribute to when Mars' is farthest away from Earth in its orbit. Graphed out, looks a little like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sf82e2n5ewne1.png?width=1332&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c2ae424a255514fe936b79703ceb279998061a\n\nThis essentially means that you would need **3,333 TH/s** on mars (far) to have the same effective hashrate as someone with just **100 TH/s** on Earth. This decreases throughout the Martian-Earth orbit cycle until they are at their closest, where only **145 TH/s** on mars is necessary to be equivalent to **100 TH/s.** A Martian miner would see their effective hashrate revolve overtime like so:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fgfu1zawzwne1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=78814c982f1a179f1b9627c718118eb9995b13d8\n\nNow all of this is a long, long ways off. But it's still interesting to make note of as I always see people talking about Bitcoin as an asset that will last deep into such futures.  A fun little thought experiment.",

I understand by doing!\n\nIf I use something like bitaddress to make one, do I never log into the internet on that device ever again? If I generate a random whatsits then close the screen restart the computer can spooky internet gremlins somehow retrieve that in my computer's history somehow? Should I factory reset before I connect to internet again? \n\nCan I just make my own random wallet and passkey? \n\nI've used my laptop to view spicy cuddle sessions and I'm certain there's a few sneaky-sneakies left behind from the sketchy websites so should I just buy a brand new laptop, generate a wallet and key, then burn the laptop?

I cannot get verification texts to access my western union account to wire transfer, but I have a wallet with my BTC on it with me, just as a last resort it occurred to me that it might be possible to send it and receive in cash (although I understand the chances are extremely slight). Currently in the Baltics and living off Uber and Ubereats (because they accept my AMEX). Have tried googling but it's a difficult thing to google and was just hoping someone could give a yay or nay, really just looking for confirmation that this is not possible so I can drop it.",

    "selftext": "I think to see mainstream adaptation of bitcoin will require some letting go regarding the storage of bitcoin. Many people are hesitant to buy bitcoin and store it themselves for the same reason they dont want to store all their money in a safe inside their house. \n\n  \nTheres also the topic of bitcoin becoming a transact-able currency as opposed to what it is now, a reserve of value. People want a simple way of transacting without risking the balance in their accounts. Its a reason why people like to use credit cards as opposed to debit cards, they know that their bank balance is safe from attacks/scams to their credit card. Even the reserve in the bank accounts has insurance. \n\n  \nI think we are moving in this direction, the release of the bitcoin ETFs has made a safer option of having exposure to bitcoin without the high risk of the custodian rug pulling the client. These institutional companies are more regulated and have a larger client base they need to keep happy, such as union pension funds. \n\n  \nCurrently we have some bitcoin loan services but I think moving forward we may see some mainsteam fintech services, even banks offering bitcoin backed spending accounts.

Every 2 weeks I get paid and put half my check into crypto.\n\nHe who shall not be named got elected and while I felt bad that my country would burn and ww3 might vaporize my family, I felt good about my crypto investment.

The customer support team has been incredibly responsive and worked tirelessly to resolve my case. In fact, they refunded 97% of my amount within just 24 hours!\n\nI'm truly impressed by their dedication, and even the top management got involved to ensure my issue was resolved. This experience reassured me that CoinDCX is one of the safest platforms for crypto investments in India—they make sure no funds are lost.\n\nI’m still in the process of recovering the remaining amount, and the team has assured me that it will be sorted out soon. I’ll update this post once that happens. But for now, I can confidently say their after-service and customer support are top-notch—10/10!\n\nIf you're looking for a secure and reliable crypto investment platform, I highly recommend CoinDCX.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEarlier post :- \n\nI have been investing in CoinDCX for over a year now and had a significant amount of BTC in my CoinDCX Web3 wallet. Today, when I woke up, I found my wallet completely empty. Upon tracing the transaction, I saw that my BTC had been transferred to an anonymous wallet, and a few hours later, it was moved again to another unknown address. I tried contacting customer support, but I haven't received any response yet.  \n\nI've lost mine—withdraw your funds before it's too late!",

How could a free money like bitcoin and its idea of liberalism and therefore free markets take sustainability and fairer distribution of wealth on a global scale into account?\n\nBecause i dont think the best money created will solve our problems if we continue to go on economically like we did in the past centuries.\n\nAre you aware of any books that further elaborate on this topic or do you have a personal opinion on it? If so, I would be very interested in hearing your thoughts!",

I just dont see an incentive for people to switch when they could just get 2% cash back and convert the rest to bitcoin for the long term.

In contrast, I’m starting to question whether BTC is actually less of a headache in the long run.\n\nThat said, BTC has its own risks. It can be just as vulnerable, and we’ve seen how a single tweet or news event can send it soaring or crashing by 10-20% in a matter of hours.\n\nCurious to hear thoughts from those who have made the move or are weighing their options.",

According to historical data, gold has an inverse correlation to the s&p 500 during market downturns.\n\n““However, when the sample is limited to the identified drawdown periods, this inverse correlation strengthens to around –0.30. These figures suggest that, based solely on historical price data, spot gold tends to exhibit a countertrend response during major equity corrections in the cash market for the S&P 500. The data thereby supports the notion that ^XAUUSD can serve as a risk mitigator when $SPX declines sharply, as evidenced by its positive performance during these stress periods.”\n\n“For the five-year period that encompassed the 2008 financial crisis, gold very nearly doubled in value, rallying from just above $825 to north of $1650 per ounce.”\n\nI’ve also heard that bitcoin has a very high correlation with the s&p500, and that bitcoin will not perform well when the overall macro economy is performing poorly.\n\nHowever given that gold has historically done well in recessions and we believe btc to be superior to analogue gold, Im here to ask you all if you are bullish or not on bitcoin even if knowing 100% we were to go into a prolonged recession or depression?

Is it really that widespread?\n\nMy take here is if you reveal your holdings to someone you know (friend, coworker, family member), this might become a much bigger threat than what you do online. It seems commenters tend to exaggerate and fear monger cause if you use cold storage and know well not to click on suspicious links or reply to DMs, you aren’t that vulnerable (the scammer only knows your reddit username or email, maybe I’m missing smth here).\nWhat can they possibly get from you?\n\nBut again, I might not know how sophisticated scammers can be.\nPersonally I’ve never revealed what I own online but I don’t have a problem other people flexing.\nThoughts?",

Their Bitcoin purchases are done in an over the counter (OTC) arrangement with exchanges. This means that  ETF inflows don't really create upward price pressure, and won't until the exchanges run low of Bitcoin to meet even the OTC demand (the long-anticipated supply shock). I can't seem to find out if the ETF providers' selling is also done OTC. The reason I want to know is because it seems that ETF inflows don't really push the price up, yet it seems when ETFs have a red day - lots of those lately! - it does create downward pressure on BTC price. Surely the ETF providers don't buy OTC, but sell to the market? That would produce only selling pressure until supply shock comes, if it ever does?",

    "selftext": "Hi all, very newbie question here. \n\nI am slowly trying to overcome my deep fear of putting money in a cold wallet and losing all because of various events. So I am thinking of just starting to play with small amounts, considering the cost of hard wallet etc the cost of, basically, toys I am learning to play with, so that if I get more confident and want to put real money in my cold wallet one day I am already past the learning curve. This means I might, if I do it, spend £400 in cold wallet and seed metal plates and only have £600 in BTC, but I wouldn't care because it's just a kind of toy. \n\nThe way I understand it, the way one proceeds is that one opens an account with a bitcoin exchange (to me it's like a brokerage; say, Fidelity), buys a certain amount in BTC with it, and then transfers this amount (or part of this amount) to his brand new cold wallet. \n\nSo I started to look at Coinbase, and discovered that they require (as would be the case in a brokerage account) my ID to open the account. \n\nI thought the entire point was anonymity? The ID allows the British Government to know when I have opened an account, and what I have bought and transferred (because they have access to all accounts). So they would \\*know\\* that I have XYZ Bitcoin investment, or have bought such and such on this and that day. They might contact me and say, just as an example, \"give a full account of what you have done with your BTC, because we are confiscating BTC/have declared it illegal\". \n\nHow is this different from buying the BTC directly through a broker or through an ETF? Isn't the \"anonymity\" part heavily compromised? \n\nI know I must be missing something here, I just don't know what I don't know... \n\nThanks in advance     \n\n",

Once I have bought the crypto I don't have anything tangible that I can lock in a vault to sell later on.\n\nEven with something like a thumb drive looking crypto wallet, if I lose it or something, what's to keep someone from accessing it?\n\nLike, if someone manages to get a hold of my crypto wallet (and access it) is there any way of proving that the crypto they were using was mine? I know that Bitcoin is traceable, but does that mean it can be shown it came from my wallet?\n\nI know this is all probably REALLY stupid over cautious questions, but I would really appreciate helpful responses.",

So I’m trying my luck here:\n\nPlease help educate me as I'm interested in MSTR but I have questions that I haven't been able to find answers to.\n\n1. One of the main selling point for Bitcoin versus the dollar is that Bitcoin has a fixed amount and the dollar can be printed out of thin air forever.  Wouldn't this also apply to MSTR shares.  With the recent share count approval, MSTR shares can be printed out of thin air.  And is there a fix cap on these shares because it possible for it to grow again in the future.  If I want to invest in Bitcoin, wouldn't it be better to just buy Bitcoin or the Bitcoin ETF if I don't want to deal with cold storage?\n\n2. Where is the moat? I understand that MSTR provides leveraged exposure to Bitcoin vs a pure Bitcoin ETF but nothing is stopping the next company from copying MSTR.  In fact, Saylor is always working to convince other company to copy MSTR.\n\nThanks in advance for reading.  Looking forward to learning.",

Cold wallets, however, are not connected to the internet, offering enhanced security for storing cryptocurrency over long periods.\n\n# Security and Risks\n\nHot wallets are more susceptible to online attacks due to their internet connection, while cold wallets are safer because their private keys are kept offline, reducing the risk of remote hacking. However, cold wallets can be lost, stolen, or damaged, which could lead to loss of funds if not properly backed up.\n\n# Usage and Convenience\n\nHot wallets are ideal for day-to-day transactions and trading, offering quick access. Cold wallets are better suited for holding large amounts of cryptocurrency for extended periods but require additional steps, like connecting a hardware device, to use.\n\n# Unexpected Detail\n\nAn interesting aspect is that some cold wallets, like hardware wallets with Bluetooth, might have connectivity options, potentially reducing their security when in use, though they remain offline when not connected.\n\n# [Detailed Analysis of Cryptocurrency Hot Wallets and Cold Wallets](https://cryptoaskzone.com/how-are-cryptocurrency-hot-wallets-different-from-cold-wallets/)",

    "selftext": "I purchased a Coldcard MK4 in 2023 migrating from a ledger device. Coldcard MK4 offers different options to generate a seed which includes random, random + dice-roll, dice-roll only. Their website claims that if you do random + 50 dice rolls , it is a low risk method of generating your seed and the way it is suppose to work is that the dice rolls are suppose to remove every mistake made by the random number generator. I unfortunately saw my hard work money being swept and after reporting it to Coldcard, they blocked me like they have been doing to the other users.\n\nThe funds after an hour went into external wallets: Hacker wallet bc1qa4hrzegkrrq5fmyelma2y3lcs2papk5ee7suns received 3.731 BTC. A similar experience has been encountered by someone who used their mk3 wallets and the drain has happened 6 months after making a deposit. I hired a blockchain expert to analyze my transaction and it appears it has been stolen and after that coinjoins have happened.\n\nColdcard Seed Generation Process I followed \n\na. Select the 12 word option with no dice rolls \n\nb. -Select 4 to mix in rolls into what is randomly generated \n\nc. - Add 50 dice roll values . The values were extracted using a python script which does the dice rolls for you. \n\nd. - Write the seed on paper along with Pin and anti phishing words which the device will have you setup before you setup the seed \n\ne. - Make the deposit from ledger live to coldcard \n\nf. - Saw my deposit sweeped \n\ng. - Contacted the support team of coinkite to report the incident \n\nh. - They stopped responding and after a while I was blocked on reddit after I posted my comment about the experience I had while using their product.\n\n They did not care to respond back to my emails either once I reported the issue. Their team stopped writing back to me. There is a X post and other reddit posts where similar users have reported encountering bitcoin theft using coldcard: \n\nA manufacturer named foundation even reported their solution being incomplete:\nhttps://twitter.com/FOUNDATIONdvcs/status/1778581463618773441\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Electrum/comments/id7bpj/the\\_loss\\_of\\_bitcoin/?rdt=46007](https://www.reddit.com/r/Electrum/comments/id7bpj/the_loss_of_bitcoin/?rdt=46007)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/coldcard/comments/17epqk8/040\\_bitcoin\\_taken\\_instantly\\_from\\_my\\_coldcard/](https://www.reddit.com/r/coldcard/comments/17epqk8/040_bitcoin_taken_instantly_from_my_coldcard/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Electrum/comments/id7bpj/the\\_loss\\_of\\_bitcoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Electrum/comments/id7bpj/the_loss_of_bitcoin/)\n\n[1.7 BTC drained instantly using sparrow to cold card : r/coldcard](https://www.reddit.com/r/coldcard/comments/17fy8cz/17_btc_drained_instantly_using_sparrow_to_cold/?share_id=BncHEU8zoI46QuXMjetnB)\n\n[https://x.com/hodldee/status/1717248472544415789?s=46&t=eSMf6GPdOx23jkMeKqJS9Q](https://x.com/hodldee/status/1717248472544415789?s=46&t=eSMf6GPdOx23jkMeKqJS9Q)\n\n[https://x.com/unknownbitcoins/status/1717451541517422621?s=46&t=eSMf6GPdOx23jkMeKqJS9Q](https://x.com/unknownbitcoins/status/1717451541517422621?s=46&t=eSMf6GPdOx23jkMeKqJS9Q)\n\n  \nI have reported the company to law enforcement and trying to seek legal action against them hoping to help several others who can help me by reporting their wallets here if they have encountered a similar user experience.

    "selftext": "# Celebrating the Evolution of Bitcoin: From an Idea to a Global Financial Force\n\nBitcoin has come a long way since its inception in 2009. What started as an experimental digital currency, outlined in Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper, has evolved into a revolutionary financial asset that challenges traditional banking, reshapes global economies, and empowers individuals with financial sovereignty.\n\nIn its early days, Bitcoin was misunderstood, dismissed, and often linked to niche internet communities. Its first real-world transaction—10,000 BTC for two pizzas in 2010—seemed insignificant at the time but now stands as a historic milestone. Bitcoin’s value has since skyrocketed, proving that decentralized finance is not only viable but essential in an era of economic uncertainty.\n\nOver time, Bitcoin has weathered volatility, regulatory challenges, and skepticism from the financial elite. It has transformed from a peer-to-peer digital cash system into a store of value, often referred to as \"digital gold.\" Major corporations, institutional investors, and even governments now recognize Bitcoin’s potential, integrating it into portfolios and national economies.\n\nBitcoin’s impact extends beyond wealth accumulation. It provides financial inclusion to millions in countries with unstable currencies. It enables borderless transactions, fights inflation, and ensures transparency in a system controlled by code rather than central authorities. The Lightning Network has further expanded Bitcoin’s usability, making instant transactions possible while reducing costs.",

Yes I know, \"Keep stacking, keep doing what you can.\" \n\nPeople are asking this question, at least in my opinion, because they want to dream that they are just in time for complete financial freedom. \n\nOf course BTC will, if all trajectories are true it will definitely make life a little easier. Despite all the scarcity and inflation protection, I think people get caught up with multipliers. I'm guilty of it. The 4k Bitcoin days are long gone, but it gave those who invested a 25x gain, from 4k to 100K. If someone does own 0.1 BTC now that same multiplier would (assuming BTC had a current value of 100K) turn ~10K to 250K. \n\nThis is if Bitcoin is at 2.5mil per coin. For anyone dreaming of complete financial freedom, say randomly a 5mil goal, the price of 1 BTC would need to go up 500x to 50mil. \n\nSo my question again, those who own ~0.1 BTC, are they actually early enough for financial freedom?

    "selftext": "A wallet provider, Braavos, has introduced a new feature designed to simplify cryptocurrency payments by allowing users to make instant transactions using STRK (with other tokens to come, like stablecoins) at any vendor that accepts Lightning Network payments. This feature integrates directly into the Braavos app, enabling users to scan a QR code and complete payments within seconds, without the need for additional setup or separate accounts.\n\n# The Significance of Lightning Network Payments\n\nBitcoin was originally envisioned as a decentralized digital currency for everyday transactions. However, due to network congestion and transaction fees, Bitcoin has primarily been used for long-term holding rather than daily spending. The Lightning Network was developed as a second-layer solution to address these issues by enabling fast and cost-effective transactions. However, traditional Lightning Network usage often requires users to set up accounts, manage liquidity, and navigate technical challenges.\n\nBraavos aims to remove these barriers by offering a seamless payment experience, and bring in a new existing user base to the Bitcoin ecosystem. With its new feature, users can make Lightning Network transactions with the ease of a conventional payment app.\n\n# How Braavos’ Lightning Network Feature Works\n\nThe feature utilizes the Atomiq bridge, a non-custodial solution that facilitates Starknet-to-Lightning conversions. The payment process consists of four simple steps:\n\n1. **Scan the QR Code** – Users scan the Lightning Network QR code at checkout using the Braavos wallet.\n2. **Choose Your Token** – Payments can be made with STRK, eliminating the need to hold Bitcoin.\n3. **Instant Conversion** – The Atomiq bridge automatically converts STRK to Bitcoin and processes the transaction.\n4. **Transaction Completion** – The vendor receives the payment instantly, similar to any other Lightning transaction.\n\n# Key Differences from Other Lightning Payment Solutions\n\nWhile Lightning Network payments have existed for some time, Braavos offers a more integrated and user-friendly approach. Key advantages include:\n\n* **No Lightning Wallet Setup** – Unlike many Lightning payment solutions that require separate Lightning wallets, Braavos handles this process automatically.\n* **No Need for Liquidity Management** – Users do not need to pre-fund or manage channels, as liquidity is available on demand.\n* **Support for Multiple Assets** – Unlike traditional Lightning wallets that require Bitcoin, Braavos enables payments using STRK, with other tokens to follow.\n* **Low Fees & Fast Transactions** – Transactions are completed in seconds with minimal fees, facilitated by the Atomiq bridge.\n\n# Transaction Fees\n\nA small fee is included with each transaction to cover the costs associated with:\n\n* Asset conversion via the Atomiq bridge.\n* Ongoing maintenance and support to ensure a smooth user experience.\n\nDespite these fees, Braavos’ solution remains a cost-effective option for Lightning Network payments.\n\n# Availability\n\nThe [Braavos](https://braavos.app/introducing-lightning-network-payments-via-braavos-fast-easy-and-cost-effective/) Lightning Network payment feature is available now. Users can utilize it for various transactions, including retail purchases, service payments, and online shopping, wherever Lightning Network payments are accepted.",

Is Coldcard the better option? What would you do?\n\nI’d like to add that a couple of buddies of mine had the original Jade. One of them dropped it on their tile floor, and it ended up breaking. That’s the reason why I paid more for the metal Jade—because it’s more durable and arguably will last longer.",

    "selftext": "A year ago, I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bub36s/im_starting_an_initiative_to_teach_women_in/) about starting [Bitfiasi](https://bitfiasi.org), a nonprofit to teach women about Bitcoin in Africa, starting from my home country, Ghana. It’s been a journey, and this Saturday, we’ll be celebrating 44 women graduating from our [Bitcoin for Beginners](https://bitfiasi.org/bitcoin-for-beginners/) program, a big leap from the 16 in our first cohort! \n\nThe response has been incredible. More people are already reaching out to be part of the next cohort, and it’s clear that the interest in Bitcoin among women in Ghana is growing fast.\n\nBeyond the classes, I’ve also managed to take Bitcoin education to 4 senior high schools, running workshops to introduce students (especially young women) to Bitcoin, financial sovereignty, and digital assets. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and it’s exciting to see more women eager to explore Bitcoin for savings, business, and long-term financial security.\n\n[This Saturday’s event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bitcoin-the-future-of-money-what-you-need-to-know-tickets-1271382020849) will have over 100 people attending, and it’s already creating a buzz among those looking to start their Bitcoin journey.\n\nI’d love to hear from this community, how do you think I can make this even better and also get support to reach a wider audience? Any ideas on improving outreach, structuring classes, or engaging more women in Bitcoin?\n\nWould appreciate any advice, and happy to share more about what’s working so far!\n\n",

I’ve been in crypto since last bull run and have been aware of auto buys but it just never really occurred to me to do it myself. I guess I just thought I wouldn’t auto buy enough for it to make a difference. But I figure now that something is better than nothing. I plan to continue to let it buy for the foreseeable future (next couple years). Only thing that bothers me is that CB charges a dollar every purchase so my $8 turns into $7 and I pay Coinbase $365 per year to do this. CB advertises Coinbase One and says I can avoid fees by signing up, however, it’s $30/month which is the same as I’m paying anyway without the subscription. I guess I’m just trying to find a better way to purchase daily. I like using CB because it takes it directly from my bank and I don’t have to fund the account. I want to make it as easy and mindless for myself as possible, which is also why I’m doing small daily buys rather than larger weekly or monthly buys. I won’t miss the $8 everyday but it will bother me to see $56/week or $240/month to come out. I’m also curious what your guys’ thoughts are on such small purchases, is it even worth it? I mean, at this rate it would take me decades to reach a whole coin, granted the price never went up. I’m involved in crypto in a lot of other ways and have a substantial portfolio relative to my income, just no btc at the moment. Hoping you guys can suggest better ways I can do what I’m doing and just hype me up on the whole plan in general. Thanks in advance!",

It could be utilized to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) through executive action, without the need for congressional approval\n\n- ⁠Seizing (stealing) more bitcoin including those holdings from people trying to use it to evade taxes\n\n- ⁠Accepting government payments/fines/taxes in Bitcoin\n\n- “Printing” money to buy Bitcoin would presumably not cost the tax payer (well directly anyway!) \n\n- ⁠Mining bitcoin with excess unutilised energy sources like Bhutan have been doing\n\n- ⁠Selling other confiscated assets from crime (crypto and non crypto) for bitcoin\n\n- ⁠Revaluing or swapping the existing gold stockpile for some digital gold\n\n\nI’m sure there might be other ways for them to get more BTC without directly buying with tax payers funds… the fact they have actively pledged to do this and seem to have the personnel in charge who are motivated and from a crypto perspective pretty competent, qualified and experienced to do so is really bullish for the longer term bigger macro picture. \n\nWhat other methods could they use for tax payer neutral bitcoin acquisition ….",

So every time you close a position with profit, the taxes automatically get drawn away from it and only the money you can keep stays in your account. \n\nSo I thought I d just make a small 1000€ Btc fun/hobby fund on such an broker/exchange.

I would like to buy a whole coin, but my budget is around 55k EUR (60k USD), given the period is it possible that Bitcoin can reach that low? If so, is this similar to a 2022 crash situation in any way?\n\n  \n2. Given my intention to buy once and just kind of leave it there, is Kraken or Coinbase better? Can I just buy pro for either to get lower fees for the big transaction and never renew it?\n\n  \nThanks!",

It could be utilized to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) through executive action, without the need for congressional approval\n\n- ⁠Seizing (stealing) more bitcoin including those holdings from people trying to use it to evade taxes\n\n- ⁠Accepting government payments/fines/taxes in Bitcoin\n\n- “Printing” money to buy Bitcoin would presumably not cost the tax payer (well directly anyway!) \n\n- ⁠Mining bitcoin with excess unutilised energy sources like Bhutan have been doing\n\n- ⁠Selling other confiscated assets from crime (crypto and non crypto) for bitcoin\n\n- ⁠Revaluing or swapping the existing gold stockpile for some digital gold\n\n\nI’m sure there might be other ways for them to get more BTC without directly buying with tax payers funds… the fact they have actively pledged to do this and seem to have the personnel in charge who are motivated and from a crypto perspective pretty competent, qualified and experienced to do so is really bullish for the longer term bigger macro picture. \n\nWhat other methods could they use for tax payer neutral bitcoin acquisition ….",

Bitcoin crashed down to as low as the 3,000's (USD), prices of goods soared such as eggs and toilet paper, supply and demand was absolutely wild in those times. Housing prices have essentially doubled since then.\n\nHow do you expect bitcoin to keep up with that long-term? Eggs are $8 a dozen now. My house that I bought in 2019 for $160k is now worth over $300. But the sad thing about bitcoin is that every 4 years, it is destined to crash back down again. It crashed from 19k in 2017, it crashed from 69k in 2021, and 2025 is the fourth year of the so-called \"cycle\" so guess what it's going to do again this year?\n\nHow many more cycles until it crashes from 7 figures? Are any of you even paying attention? And what about the suckers who bought bitcoin BEFORE it crashed? Those greater fools stuck holding the bag from weeks before COVID hit probably bought in around $10k, maybe even higher than that, if we're being honest. How do you expect bitcoin to hedge against inflation when it's only between 700% to 2,000% higher than it was 5 years ago either right before or right after the market was pulverized by COVID?\n\nInflation is supposed to be around 2% PER YEAR! That compounds over the years, you know. So just you wait and see. You'll find out the hard way that in just TEN YEARS that 2% inflation will amount to nearly 22% inflation. Try looking me in the eyes with a straight face a decade from now and tell me that bitcoin won't crash from the high 6, or even 7 figures. We'll see how smug you all are then, eh? Good riddance.",

Ex: say you first bought BTC back when it was 20k and then DCA'd all the way until now. It's now hovering at 80k, and you make a small sale worth $200. Well then instead of being a tiny gain/loss, if you use fifo, that means the sale uses a cost basis of 20k... meaning that after maths, that translates into a capital *gain* close to the *full* $200!! Now repeat for every small sale and well...damn.\n\nHowever, if we're now doing wallet based accounting, once you move the money to a new wallet, the cost basis resets so if you had done the same from a new wallet, the gain/loss on that sale would have been small.\n\nSo... what this tells me is that if you plan on doing something like options trading (where you frequently buy/sell) or use a DEX to fund other wallets, then do it from a wallet that has a very small (or zero) crypto balance.\n\nSo... wallet based cost basis may actually be a good thing, since with FIFO, the original cost basis doesn't follow you around. \n\nUnless i'm misunderstanding how this wallet based cost basis works.\n\n",

How should I store the 24-word seed phrase? Should I write it on a piece of paper and split it into multiple parts stored in different locations? Or should I store it in multiple cloud services?\n4. I use Bitstack to buy BTC, which I find convenient as a beginner. Would there be a better and easier solution?\n5. Do you use Trezor or Ledger Suite to buy BTC, or do you use an exchange and then transfer it to your wallet (e.g., small amounts like €XX)?

Surely, I will not be allowed to transfer tokens?\n\nWill Coinbase automatically credit the proper BTC to my Coldcard Q account and cancel the tokens, or will I have to re-transfer the money to Coinbase Exchange before allowing the money to exit the Coinbase ecosystem?

Since 2000, if you had $10K it would have shrank to $5.4K in value , since then housing doubled, energy spiked further decreasing the cost of your dollar. Bitcoin fights back because it is scarce, no upkeep, all you have to do is just secure your keys. Its Hardest money ever, thriving as fiat flops.\n\nIf you Buy $10K in BTC today, with lost coins (3-6M) + gov/corps hoarding and buy its supply shrink its 21M cap. At 40% yearly (vs 200%+ hist.), $10K hits $34M by 2050. Fiat? $5.3K.\n\nNeutral case: 15% yearly growth (still beats gold), $10K turns $330K by 2050. S&P 500’s 10% avg? $108K. BTC’s edge shines.\n\nEven in the most neutral case , your money will still be better off in Bitcoin! \n\n",

    "selftext": "There is a book called the 4th turning published in 1997. \n\nIt discusses first, second, third and fourth turnings in American history. \n\nThe Crisis (Fourth Turning) is a period of upheaval, where institutions collapse, and society undergoes major transformation, often triggered by wars, economic collapse, or revolutions. This is where the authors argue America is now (starting in 2008 with the financial crisis). It’s a time of struggle that eventually leads to the rebuilding of institutions and a new High.\n\nWhere Are We Now?\n\nIf the theory holds, we are currently in the middle of the Fourth Turning, which is expected to last until the early 2030s. According to Strauss and Howe, this phase typically brings major conflicts (economic, political, or military), followed by the emergence of a new social order.\n\nThe book is often cited in discussions about current events, including economic instability, political division, and global tensions, suggesting that we are in the midst of a defining moment in American history.\n\nIn past Fourth Turnings, financial systems have been restructured like the gold standard changes in the 1930s and 1970s. Bitcoin could be a part of the next monetary reset.\n\nBitcoins role\n\nBitcoin aligns with the historical patterns of the Fourth Turning challenging the old system, thriving during economic chaos, and potentially becoming part of the new order. Whether it emerges as the “\nnew gold or something bigger depends on how this Turning plays out.\n\nDo you see Bitcoin as a hedge for personal wealth during this crisis, or as something even bigger—like a foundation for a new financial system?",

    "selftext": "I keep seeing posts about people getting financially wrecked, sometimes in irrecoverable ways, because of meme coins and shitcoins. It genuinely upsets me, not just as a Bitcoiner, but from a humanist perspective. The lies shitcoin shillers push are pure predatory nonsense, and time after time, people fall for them.\n\nI remember the first warning of this back in 2010 on the Bitcoin forum.  \n\"Titcoin, gitcoin, nitcoin, shitcoin.\"\n\nIt was a premonition. People were bound to get burned chasing easy riches.\n\nI was already annoyed in 2017 when the shitcoin wave took off. Not just because of what it meant for Bitcoin in the short term, distracting from its actual purpose, but because I knew millions of people were about to financially ruin themselves gambling on hype. The worst part is that many believed Bitcoin at one thousand dollars was too expensive and chose random scams instead.\n\nAnd here we are, years later, with endless posts of people losing everything on meme coins and garbage projects that were always doomed to fail. I hate seeing it happen. If only people did not fall for these scams, everyone would win in the long run.\n\nThankfully, the trend is slowly shifting. Bitcoin dominance hit its lowest in 2017 and has not dropped that low since. The shitcoin casino is still open, but the house of cards is gradually collapsing.\n\nStill, it is painful to watch this cycle repeat.",

This time, due to ETFs and new institutional money coming in, the halving event almost a year ago was near the previous ATH.\n\nThe Bitcoin cycle is about the designed scarcity and the inevitable liquidity crunch if demand remains relatively constant. This cycle we got a huge amount of new money and got a mini speculative bubble within this first year, and now a mini crash. But looking at past cycles 11 months in, being up roughly 20% is in line with previous performance. \n\nUltimately, I think the general prediction of 180k by September-October is not out of the question. We are just now coming back in line with the traditional cycle (that is more muted each round) and the early 109k ATH was an anomaly. ",

Can anyone tell me if I have more expenses when using IBKR because it is based in a country outside the European Community? In terms of taxes and fees, do I pay the same as when using XTB, for example?\n\nI don't know if this makes sense, but given the doubts I ended up never using it!\n\nBy the way, I filled out the W-8BEN form through XTB. If I start investing through IBKR, do I need to fill out this form again or will the first time I filled it out be enough?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

However, gold also surves a structural purpose in that people can park wealth in gold when other asset types are in a downturn, say, like in the 2008 crash. So gold serves as a safe haven with the promise of being able to change it back to other assets in the future.\n\nBitcoins could serve the same function, but instead Bitcoins seem to track stock prices rather than be a safe haven in a market crash.\n\nIs Bitcoins always going to be a rally asset, or will it change to behave more like gold in the future?\n\n**Why I care**: If a structural benefit of Bitcoins can be determined, you can begin to speculate on what its proper total market cap should be. Right now gold is about 3% of the total, while Bitcoin is about 0.4%. But if Bitcoin becomes an essential structural asset, you might predict that its relative market cap should increase before it stabilizes.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoins remain a rally yolo asset, it is hard to see its structural value. That's why I am interested in whether it might gravitate towards being a safe haven or diversifying asset instead.",

Why should we expect bitcoin to beat the stock market?\n\nWanted to make an edit because I’m getting downvoted. I do think bitcoin is a great asset as it’s scarce and provides a store of value against inflationary currencies with transactional value as well. The thought experiment is comparing the returns of bitcoin against other financial assets long-term.\n\nFor example when I buy a share of Amazon I am buying a share of the future cash flows in the company. Sure those future cash flows are denominated in USD now but they are currently yielding 3% with double digit earnings growth YoY and have historically far exceeded inflation. Additionally, maybe someday those future cash flows will be denominated in bitcoin growing at a rapid rate. ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’ve been thinking a lot about Bitcoin’s future and I keep running into this concept of the \"death spiral\" after the last Bitcoin is mined in 2140. I know there are a lot of people who are super optimistic about Bitcoin, but I wanted to ask the community – could this \"death spiral\" actually become a real problem for Bitcoin?\n\nHere’s my thinking:\n\nBitcoin mining is currently incentivized by two things: block rewards (which decrease over time due to halvings) and transaction fees. But what happens when the last Bitcoin is mined? With block rewards being non-existent, the system will be relying solely on transaction fees to pay miners. That’s fine for now while Bitcoin’s price is high, but what if the price stagnates or even falls?\n\nIf transaction fees become too high, it could discourage regular users from making transactions, which would reduce the overall usage and value of Bitcoin. Miners may then find it less profitable to continue mining, and we could see fewer miners in the network. This could lead to a death spiral where the network becomes less secure and the value drops, causing even more miners to leave, and so on.\n\nIt’s also worth considering that Bitcoin’s energy consumption and mining difficulty are going to keep increasing, which makes it harder for new or smaller miners to stay in the game. As we get closer to the end, won’t only a few big miners be left? Could that lead to further centralization and make Bitcoin more vulnerable?\n\nI get that the idea of Bitcoin failing seems far-fetched to a lot of people, especially when you’re hearing from maxis all the time about how Bitcoin is \"digital gold\" and its scarcity will drive value. But isn’t it possible that the system might break down if things don’t play out as expected, especially as we near 2140? Could the current design be a flaw waiting to happen?\n\nJust wanted to get some thoughts from the community. Are we really overlooking a potential issue here with Bitcoin’s long-term sustainability, or am I just being too skeptical?",

When I then tried to transfer to her wallet, I scanned the qr code and the wallet address was all caps even though the address wasn't.  Tried twice, same thing. Finally manually typed it in correctly and am waiting for confirmation ATM. Any ideas or experiences with this? My phone isn't cap locked so why was the address, I don't know, but I figured this might be a good place to ask.",

And here’s the kicker: the U.S. government is gearing up to snatch a mountain of Bitcoin using nothing but their trusty printing press—monopoly money in action.

Just a reinvention of gold with an amazing, short monetization period where the early participants made a fortune.\n\nThe difference is gold doesn't unravel if no one uses it as a MoE, it has been a decent store of value for basically ever thanks to the laws of physics maintaining themselves without us needing to do anything.\n\nBitcoin doesn't magically remain scarce. It remains scarce as a by product of it being a payment technology.\n\nYou cannot have one without the other. The permissionless-payments-only big blockers finally gave up and forked away 8 years ago.\n\nThey were more misguided than the people who only understand Bitcoin as savings today, but their blindness will result in the same thing - the softening of what we've gotten used to being the hardest money know to man.",

I’ve decided to go with Independent Reserve as I am from Australia. \nHowever, their withdrawal fee is 0.0002 BTC which is currently about 26$. I can’t find any better options than this which to me is a problem as I don’t want to keep more than $1000 in the exchange but if I withdraw it to my cold wallet they are taking 2.6% every time. I feel like this is a lot. \nSo my questions are:\n1. Is it okay to leave $5000+ on an exchange (in particular independent reserve) in order to lower the withdrawal fee?\n2. Is 0.0002 BTC an okay withdrawal fee (I haven’t seen anything better in Australia and even if there is better ones like maybe Strike then I get fucked with conversions from AUD to USD)\n",

Here’s the outline of my strategy:\n\n1. **Move Crypto to Trezor**: Transfer my bitcoin from Coinbase to a Trezor hardware wallet for added security.\n2. **Convert Fiat to USDC**: Move money from my bank to Coinbase, convert it to USDC, and then transfer the USDC to my Trezor.\n3. **Get a** [**Crypto.com**](http://Crypto.com) **Card**: Apply for a [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) card to use for daily spending.\n4. **Load the Card with USDC**: Pre-load the [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) card with USDC from my Trezor (in set increments) for daily expenses.\n5. **Spend USDC**: Use the card for purchases, where USDC is converted to USD at the point of sale. Since USDC is pegged to the USD, I avoid volatility risks as much as possible.\n6. **Earn Cashback**: Take advantage of the [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) card’s cashback rewards, which I see as a way to earn a small return on my money, similar to what I might get from a traditional bank (though admittedly not as much).\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n* I plan to keep around $5-10K in my traditional bank for emergencies and liquidity.\n* I’ll still have credit cards but plan to use them only in case of emergencies.\n\n**My Goals:**\n\n* Increase control and ownership over my assets.\n* Reduce reliance on banks and credit card companies.\n* Earn cashback rewards to offset the opportunity cost of not earning interest in a traditional bank.\n\n**Questions for the Community:**\n\n1. Is this plan realistic and safe? Are there any risks I’m overlooking?\n2. Are there better alternatives to achieve similar goals?\n3. Has anyone else tried this approach? If so, what has your experience been?\n4. What tax implications I should be aware of when converting fiat to USDC and spending it via the [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) card?\n5. Any tips for minimizing fees or optimizing this strategy?\n\nThanks in advance for your insights!",

I know you want that new lambo and to get that new girl, but as you grow up your wants will change and you will want to see your kids have a bright orange future. By the time they are grown up 0.006 will be like 3 Bitcoin today. You aren’t to late to Bitcoin you are just in time.\nSo start stacking toward a block reward today.\n",

You have to enter once to let the notice start, and then enter again to have access to the stack. \n\nSo I could have wallets with 24, 96, or 168 hours of notice.

But with that arose a different issue—now the middle button doesn’t respond properly, and on top of that, the Jade rattles.\n\nThree Jades, three defects.

In 2021, the total cryptocurrency market cap peaked at $3 trillion. This cycle, we've already reached a high of $3.71 trillion. Does it make sense for this to be the top when the U.S. prints $3-4 trillion every year?\n\nLiquidity is one of the main drivers of market growth, and with continuous money printing, the value of assets like crypto naturally appreciates. Compared to previous cycles, adoption is higher, institutional interest is growing, and macroeconomic conditions still favor risk-on assets.\n\nThe U.S. is still injecting trillions into the system every year. Even though the Fed isn’t officially doing QE, deficit spending + Treasury buybacks + repo operations all add up to more liquidity in the markets. Historically, more liquidity = more demand for risk assets like crypto, stocks, and tech equities.\n\nInflation remains sticky, which means cash is losing value. Investors seek hard assets (crypto, gold, real estate, stocks, etc.) to hedge against devaluation.\n\nThe Fed may start cutting rates this year. Lower interest rates typically push capital into higher-yielding risk assets (crypto, growth stocks, etc.).\n\nThe S&P 500 & Nasdaq are still in a strong uptrend. Historically, crypto follows equities in bullish environments. If markets remain risk-on, crypto should benefit from the same momentum.\n\nWhile short-term corrections are normal, the overall trend remains bullish. If history repeats itself, the market is likely to continue its upward trajectory, setting new all-time highs beyond what we’ve seen so far.",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI decided to post this here as I think this is too technical for \"Bitcoin Beginners\", happy to move or repost if requested. \n\nI am now in the process of setting up my cold wallet, just for the fun of it and because I want to learn this \"sovereignty\" part of my BTC. For now I have set up various accounts with Coinbase/Coinbase Wallet, Muun and Kraken Pro, putting some money on each just to see how it works.\n\nAll the coins were originally bought on Coinbase Exchange, so I bought on Coinbase; from there I transferred a part to Muun, and from there I will move some to Kraken. I have also moved some money to Electrum but I did not terribly like the experience/interface.\n\nI have already received my Trezor 5 plus and Xseed steel plates, and I will make the setup during the weekend.\n\nNow: I understand zippo of technology, but I have seen videos on Youtube (Bitcoin University, excellent site) which, if I understand it correctly, state that Coinbase will be able and willing to \"chase\" the money I have bought on Coinbase Exchange, hoping to get as much information on me as possible. So they (again, if I understood this correctly!) will be able to \"track\" my purchase from Coinbase to Muun and from Muun to what they will understand is my cold wallet.\n\nIt is also my understanding that is not a strictly KYC/legal requirement stuff, it is \\*Coinbase snooping on me\\*. Of course I understand if the police suspects me of a crime they will be able to subpoena the data from Coinbase or track me on their own. But what Matthew Kratter says is that Coinbase goes the extra mile.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. Is this true? Did I understand it correctly? Will Coinbase be able to trace the crypto all the way to their final destination?\n2. If this is true, is there any difference with Kraken Pro, that is: will I avoid the problem if I buy straight on Kraken Pro and transfer on my cold wallet from there?\n\nAgain the issue here is not what is legally allowed to the police. Is what these companies themselves are willing to do.\n\nMany thanks in advance.",

So we never sold anything. It's not easy to get customers from organic search without pouring a lot of time into marketing and SEO and we don't have time to do that. We mainly wanted to prove a point that it's easy and free to sell something for bitcoin online. All we paid was the domain which was like a couple dollars (even that you could get free from Google or Github). Free hosting, free wordpress, free woocommerce plugin, free dropshipping (printful) and free payment plugin (paywithflash). Well it's not free there is a fee but no upfront payment needed and no need to enter a credit card. Over time we added more products whenever there was a cool idea. And today, we finally sold a first item.

Both involve creating money out of thin air and injecting it into the economy. The only real difference? One is **illegal**, and the other is **sanctioned** by central banks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o8kan19npnpe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f5586982eb7063d9ea1b11f3768d995afd6d45c\n\nA counterfeiter prints fake money and spends it, diluting the value of real money. **QE does the same thing**—central banks create new digital money and use it to buy assets like government bonds. This artificially inflates the money supply without increasing goods or services, which inevitably pushes up prices and reduces the purchasing power of existing money.\n\n**Just like counterfeiters** benefit by spending fake money before inflation catches up, the biggest winners of QE are banks and corporations. They get first access to newly created money, allowing them to invest in stocks and real estate before prices rise. Meanwhile, **ordinary people are left dealing with higher costs and stagnant wages.**\n\nOn top of that, **QE distorts the economy** by fueling market bubbles. Stocks, housing, and other assets skyrocket in price, not because of real economic growth, but **because of artificially cheap money.** Eventually, the bubble bursts, leaving regular people to deal with the fallout.\n\n**The only real difference between QE and counterfeiting is that one is legal. But legality doesn’t change reality—whether it's a criminal printing fake bills or a central bank injecting trillions into the economy, the result is the same: devalued money, rising prices, and an economy built on illusion.**",

Bitcoin uses the internet as a superhighway to transfer value between differnet bitcoin users, what if the internet is compromised by a major global network \"glitch\" and we all have bitcoins but are unable to access them or transfer them between each other since we all can bot access the internet. Some people talked about having their own internet networks, like in Angela Merkel's 2013 speech, where in the wake of major security breaches and spying on German companies by foreign agencies, she spoke of the time for Europe to have its own internet, an internet 2.0 if you wish. Would bitcoin be transferable to that archetechture, or would some one have to code a new botcoin 2.0 for the new network. I hope I make enough sense about this idea to illicit a resonable response.

All that to say, I’m pretty disappointed with a lot of these.\n\nDon’t get me wrong they are definitely sleeker and easier to use, the bitkey especially is sexy af. However between the blind sign of Tangem with the card or ring (which straight up doesn’t work on the new iPhones cause the NFC times out before the ring can even connect so that’s straight to the trash for me personally) that you don’t actually know the seed words to or bitkeys server based 2/3. Why can’t I just use these devices as signers for my own setup? Why am I forced to use their wallet and/or 3rd key? And why do have to expose my entire stack to recovery risk with bitkey? Defeats the entire purpose of multisig if someone can recover my wallet with one key. So someone could kidnap me, steal my shit and then make the request and then let me go after day 7 of the recovery hold period are over like wtf? What’s was the point?\n\nMaybe I’m missing something here but while these devices are sleek they feel like a downgrade in terms of what they’re actually supposed to do which is secure my wealth. Idk maybe I’m just an idiot or I’m over thinking it. I guess I just feel like a lot of these new wallets are shined gimmick spend wallets but I’d never actually trust them with my families wealth. A lot of these would only really work with strong legal precedent against companies that manage keys for people. It’s gotta be something almost like a Swiss bank to actually be useful (and right back where we started). Where I have to show up in person and prove I am how I am otherwise it’s all just security for show.",

Had a decent job for 7 years after college. No gf, no children, no mouths to feed, just me enjoying my salary to party, travel and buy the clothes I loved. No money aside. I had heard of Bitcoin but hadn't done my own research at all, just listened to the mainstream opinion around me (\"Bitcoin is a videogame money ponzi fraud!!!\") and didn't question it.\n\nFast forward to the summer of 2023, got fired abruptly (and for no valid reason), and for the first time in my life I realized that money was an issue. No money aside, no investments, no capital of any sort whatsoever, no one to help me. And I was starting to realize this inflation was unsustainable for my lifestyle.\n\nFortunately enough I found a job in early 2024 and committed to finally keeping a share of my income to invest. I coincidentally created an account on Reddit not long after and found out all about personal finances on multiple great subs. Then, I happened to talk finances with a friend of mine in the summer who told me \"You don't invest in BTC? You should look into it dude\".\n\nSooo... I did. I started with this sub and found out all about what money really is, what the problem of Fiat is and how it affects my day-to-day life (and robs me of my hard-earned work), what BTC offers, how it works, why it is so valuable and why there is no second best. And then I was eager to know more so I started reading about BTC EVERYWHERE (Social media, Youtube channels etc..)\n\nIt was like a revelation to me. Everything was adding up, and as I continued researching I started my DCA around July 2024 with small monthly sums. I purchased my cold wallet in december of 2024. I don't own much but even by getting in so late I'm at an overall ~20% profit (but that doesn't mean sh-t to me because BTC is valuable way beyond a shitty Fiat price lens).\n\nAnd now I'm reasearching about BTC and reading news about adoption SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. And I'll hold on to my (small) stack through thick and thin and a massive bear market could be on the way that I'd be happy because it'll mean \"cheaper sats\" to me.\n\nThat's my BTC story, what's yours?",

    "selftext": "# Technical Explanation of Bitcoin Mining and Network Difficulty\n\n# 💡 1. Overview of Bitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoin mining is the process by which new blocks are added to the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners use computational power to solve a **cryptographic puzzle** by finding a valid hash for the next block.\n\nKey steps in the mining process:\n\n1. **Assembling a Block:** Miners gather **pending transactions** from the mempool and create a candidate block.\n2. **Hashing the Block:** Miners repeatedly hash the block header with different **nonce values**.\n3. **Checking the Hash:** They compare the hash against the **current network difficulty target**.\n   * If the hash is **smaller** than the target, the block is successfully mined.\n   * If not, they try again with a new nonce or modify other parameters.\n4. **Broadcasting the Block:** The winning miner broadcasts the valid block to the network, and the block is added to the blockchain.\n\n# 🔢 2. Block Hash and Difficulty Target\n\nEach block header includes:\n\n* **Previous Block Hash:** A 256-bit hash of the preceding block.\n* **Merkle Root:** A hash of all the transactions in the block.\n* **Timestamp:** When the block was created.\n* **Nonce:** A 32-bit arbitrary number that miners increment during mining.\n* **Difficulty Target:** A 256-bit value that defines how small the block hash must be to be considered valid.\n\n✅ **Mining goal:**  \nTo successfully mine a block, the miner must find a hash that is **numerically smaller** than the current **difficulty target**.\n\n**Mathematically:**\n\nHash(block) ≤ Target\n\n# ⚙️ 3. The Network Difficulty Adjustment\n\nThe **difficulty target** dynamically adjusts every **2,016 blocks** (roughly every **2 weeks**), ensuring that new blocks are mined approximately **every 10 minutes**.\n\n* If blocks are being mined **faster** than 10 minutes on average → difficulty **increases**.\n* If blocks are mined **slower** → difficulty **decreases**.\n\n✅ **Difficulty formula:**\n\nNew Difficulty=Old Difficulty× (Actual Time / Expected Time)​\n\n* **Actual Time**: Time taken to mine the last 2,016 blocks.\n* **Expected Time**: 2 weeks (2,016 blocks × 10 minutes).\n\n# 🔨 4. How Small Must the Hash Be?\n\nBitcoin uses the **SHA-256** hashing algorithm, which generates a **256-bit hash**. The miner’s goal is to find a hash smaller than the difficulty target.\n\n✅ **Difficulty Target Representation:**  \nThe target is a **256-bit number** stored in **Compact Form** in the block header:\n\n* It consists of a **3-byte coefficient** and a **1-byte exponent**.\n* The target formula:\n\nTarget=coefficient×2 \\^ (8×(exponent−3))\n\n✅ **Example of difficulty representation:**  \nIf the difficulty target is:\n\n0x0000000000000000000abcdef1234567890000000000000000000000000000000\n\nAny hash with a **higher value** than this target is invalid.  \nMiners must generate hashes **smaller than this value** to successfully mine the block.\n\n# 🔑 5. Hashing Process and Nonce Iteration\n\nMiners construct the block header and repeatedly hash it while varying the **nonce** and other parameters.\n\n**Hashing process:**\n\n1. Miner sets the nonce to **0** and hashes the block header.\n2. If the resulting hash is **greater** than the difficulty target:\n   * Increment the nonce.\n   * Hash the block header again.\n3. Repeat until:\n   * A valid hash is found (smaller than the target).\n   * If the nonce overflows (2³² possibilities), modify the **extraNonce** in the coinbase transaction or change the timestamp slightly to continue.\n\n# ⚡ 6. Why 10 Minutes?\n\nThe 10-minute block time is achieved by adjusting the **difficulty**:\n\n* When miners generate hashes faster → difficulty increases.\n* When they mine slowly → difficulty decreases.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol ensures that, on average, it takes **10 minutes** to find a block by fine-tuning the difficulty every **2,016 blocks**.\n\n# 📊 7. Network Difficulty and Hash Rate\n\n* **Difficulty** is directly related to the network's **total hash rate**.\n* As more miners join the network → hash rate increases → difficulty increases.\n* If miners leave → hash rate drops → difficulty decreases.\n\n✅ **Current difficulty formula:**\n\nDifficulty=Maximum Target / Current Target​\n\nWhere:\n\n* **Maximum Target**: The highest possible target, defined as:\n\n0x00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\n* **Current Target**: The current network difficulty target.\n\n# 🔍 8. Probability of Mining a Block\n\nThe mining process is probabilistic:\n\n* The lower the **difficulty target**, the less probable it is to find a valid hash.\n* With increasing hash power, the chance of finding a valid hash within **10 minutes** increases.\n\n✅ **Probability formula:**\n\nProbability=Target / 2\\^ 256\n\nFor example:\n\n* If the target is:\n\n0x0000000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\n* The probability of finding a valid hash is:\n\n0x0000000000000000000F / 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\n# 🛠️ 9. Conclusion\n\n* **Mining goal:** Find a valid hash smaller than the **difficulty target**.\n* **Difficulty adjusts** every **2,016 blocks** (\\~2 weeks) to maintain a **10-minute block time**.\n* Miners continuously hash the block header, modifying the **nonce** and other parameters until a valid hash is found.\n* **Higher difficulty** makes finding valid hashes harder, requiring more computational power.\n\n✅ This dynamic difficulty adjustment ensures that the Bitcoin network maintains a **consistent block time** despite changes in global mining power.",

They're completely sleeping on this opportunity and maybe just in the next cycle will be interested. (This was me between 2019-2020).\n\n2. Shitcoiners, people who are interested in Bitcoin, but prefer to focus on altcoins, thinking that they can get a better results gambling their money on this kind of stuff. They end up on a rug pull or losing everything on Trading. (This was me between 2021-2024).\n\n3. Scammers, people who know about the power of Bitcoin, but are dishonest and sell illusions and promises to the shitcoiners. Usually they promote random pump and dump schemes or tell their victims to makes some quick gains on it and then go to Bitcoin. (I'm not a scammer lol, you seriously though I would put a date here?).\n\n4. Bitcoin Maximalists, people who got through all of this and survived to understand that Bitcoin is the superior and only true asset you should stay focused on, being all the others \"coins\" a big waste of time and money. (Me right now at 2025, lucky I never brought one of those 100% scam meme coins that go to zero in a single day, so I had most of my portfolio intact to go for Bitcoin).\n\nWhich one are you?",

    "selftext": "Bitcoin won't win everyone over. But it will win.\n\nToday, the dollar is the currency of international trade. Even if you're Spain and trading with Saudi Arabia, you're using dollars. In the past, gold was the currency of international trade: the dollar co-opted gold's goodwill by being backed by gold, but pulling the rug on everyone in 1971.\n\nInternational trade converges on one main currency because it's more efficient to use whatever the most people are using, and so naturally, one currency snowballs into the predominant one.\n\nAt some point, the dollar will cease to be the currency of international trade. I don't know when, and I don't know why, but history shows that it will happen. I think that a US debt crisis leading to massive devaluation is a possibility which may facilitate that, but I don't know for sure.\n\nAll I know is that when it does happen, a vacuum will form.\n\nEurope will try to convince everyone else that the euro ought to be the new currency of international trade. And everyone else will say \"No, why should everyone trust you? You have constant debt crises in your member states, your GDP is stagnant, and you will likely extract seigniorage from us to fund your ever-increasing social programs.\"\n\nRussia will try to convince everyone else that the ruble ought to be the new currency of international trade. And everyone else will say \"No, why should everyone trust you? You are invading your neighbors, you are actively printing more rubles to fund your wars, and your economy is tiny.\"\n\nChina will try to convince everyone else that the yuan ought to be the new currency. And everyone will say \"No China, you're a communist dictatorship with crushing capital controls and a digital currency that you can restrict and program at will.\"\n\nAnd so on, with other countries all trying to get everyone else to use their currency in international trade, but a consensus on any one national currency will be impossible. This is because none of the nations can put forward a *neutral* currency. There's baggage that comes along with bestowing any one country this privilege: the entire world is saddled with the results of their monetary policy, which can change on a whim, and for political reasons. You can bet that they will act in self-interest.\n\nIn the chaos, Bitcoin will emerge as a \"temporary\" workaround. Alright, fine, you won't use our ruble and we won't use your yen, but we need to trade, so let's just temporarily use Bitcoin. After all, it's already internationally valuable, it's quick to send, settlement is final, the liquidity is deeper than any other neutral digital asset...\n\nSome countries are already settling some trades in Bitcoin today (Russia and China.)\n\nBitcoin isn't going to win because everybody will decide to use Bitcoin at the same time. No, Bitcoin will win by process of elimination. It will be the last man standing: the only currency that is credibly neutral. It will be used because getting consensus on any other currency is even more difficult. It will be used begrudgingly even by the haters, because even the haters cannot force all other nations to accept their money in international trade.\n\nThen, it will be used more and more. And more. Soon it will become entrenched. After some time, it will be clear that it is not temporary, and it will emerge as the dominant currency for international trade. Soon after that, it will emerge as the dominant currency for domestic trade, in every country, following a similar path to victory.\n\nBefore we know it, everyone will be on a Bitcoin standard. We'll look back scratching our heads wondering how it unfolded so quickly. Once the process begins, it could be over within a geopolitical blink-of-an-eye (a few years.)",

Some quit after a few losses, some blow their accounts chasing unrealistic gains, and others just get stuck in an endless cycle of strategy-hopping.\n\nIf you’ve been trading for a while but still feel **stuck, frustrated, or inconsistent**, here’s why:\n\n# 1. You’re Searching for the “Perfect” Strategy (It Doesn’t Exist)\n\nBe honest—how many times have you switched strategies after a few losing trades? Most traders keep looking for a holy grail setup, when in reality, **even the best strategies have losses.** The difference between a profitable trader and a losing one isn’t the strategy—it’s the **discipline to stick with it long enough to let probability play out.**\n\n# 2. You’re Risking Too Much and Panicking\n\nA single trade should never make or break your account. But too many traders go all-in, hoping for a big win, only to freeze when the market moves against them. **Proper risk management is the difference between surviving and blowing up.**\n\n# 3. You’re Letting Emotions Control Your Trades\n\nEver revenge-traded after a loss? Closed early because you were scared? Moved a stop loss hoping the trade would turn? **That’s emotional trading, and it’s killing your account.** The market doesn’t care about your feelings—it rewards those who execute with precision.\n\n# So, How Do You Fix It?\n\n✅ Stick to one strategy and **master it** instead of jumping around.  \n✅ Risk small per trade—**think long-term, not trade-by-trade.**  \n✅ Remove emotions by following a structured, rule-based approach.\n\nMost traders don’t fail because they lack skill. They fail because they **never fix these bad habits.**\n\nWhat’s been the hardest lesson for you in trading? Let’s talk 👇",

I thought entering Bitcoin in 2024 meant I was too late.\n\nBut I’ve come to realize that I’m not—and neither are you. Over the past few months, I’ve tried (unsuccessfully) to convince close friends and family about Bitcoin’s significance. What really surprised me, though, is that even highly tech-savvy people don’t get it. I have friends who are engineers at major U.S. tech companies; CEOs of AI startups , high-level directors in FinTech in the Middle East, and even professors studying the history of science and technology in major US universities. Yet, almost none of them truly understand Bitcoin. To them, it’s just another cryptocurrency, and they don’t see the massive historical shift happening right now.\n\nSo, if you ever feel like you’re late—don’t. We’re still early.

On it's own, Bitcoin is completely useless and has no real value.\n\n**All networks are useless without people who gain value from them.**\n\nImagine if no one used the internet. You can't, can you? That's because it basically supports our society at this point. But when it very first was invented, people had a hard time conceptualizing how it would help them personally.\n\nNow it's very apparent. It enhances our lives in many ways and will continue to.\n\nBitcoin is no different. The less you understand the many, many problems that Bitcoin fixes, the less you will see the \"value\" in what Bitcoin is doing, and will continue to do for decades to come.\n\nUnlike the internet though, once you understand why Bitcoin will thrive for decades to come, you can actually own it while it grows. Bitcoin's network is currently valued in the market at around $86k a coin.\n\nWe could make another 100 Bitcoin networks if we wanted to. All 100 would fail just like if you made another 100 internets right now.\n\nSo, the next time someone says \"Bitcoin has no value\", tell them that technically they used to be right. That assertion is no more than *denial* today, though, as far as the market is concerned.\n\nSome good reading that will help depict why the Bitcoin network will be worth many many trillions of dollars in the future if it stays decentralized and secure:\n\nPrice of Tomorrow\n\nPrinciples of Economics\n\nBroken Money\n\nThe Creature on Jekyll Island\n\nMastering Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin Standard\n\nThe Big Print (new one and GREAT read)\n\nMoney You Can't Fuck With",

To cut a long story short it was a long messy divorce. I lost the house and most of my cash. I was frozen out of my bank accounts and ended up being relant on family members.\n\nOnce the divorce was all finanalised I took on more work and every month put my savings into BTC. Now fast forward a few years and I have a similar amount of savings that I lost (thankfully buying during 2022 helped) and I finally feel content again. Hopefully BTC will do well in the future when I start to cash it out to live off in 2030 when I'll be in my 50s. But even if it only keeps up with cash I'll still be happy.\n\nThe banks freezing my accounts so quickly when I did nothing wrong in the long term has actually helped me. I get paid into my bank account and it very quickly leaves to buy BTC for anything I won't need for the next month. It's nice knowing I can't be locked out of my own money at the whim of them.",

    "selftext": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/s/2TPBODXWQw\n\n\"So my grandpa died a week ago and my sis and I are helping my mom move his stuff into boxes and throw away some stuff, I came across his suitcase and there were many picture books and stuff and one of them has a bunch of codes that look like the wallet crypto codes when I Google them, how do I get into them? \n\nMy grandpa was never rich so I don't expect much, but I am curious, hoping to get an answer soon because my mom still haven't emptied out the trash bin outside, so if I have to look for something else that is needed to access these codes, now is the time, trash gets emptied 22 March \n\nUpdate 1:\nMy sister and I gathered the electronics. We also searched every book and suitcase for any other important looking things, all we found were family pictures. \n\nWe put everything in a box and it's in our closet for now, we haven't told our mom yet because we aren't sure if it has anything, besides she is the type to give the money away to help people and the rest of the family, even though they are mean to us because of the breakup, so if it has anything inside my sis and I will keep it a secret until we are older. \n\nRight now we have to go to school, we read all the comments, so thanks for the advice and suggestions, will be doing them when back home. \n\nBtw the electronics don't seem to work, not sure if I should throw them out\"\n\n\nAlright so I've updated twice on the original post but I'm not sure people are getting notified, so I'm making a separate post for the update 2. Also the posts were deleted because of Altcoins??\n\nUpdate 2:\nMy sis and I ended up using the usb on the pc and found a few pdf with words which we typed into a wallet\nWe also learned that the codes we initially found are private keys, but we have no idea how to log into them. \n\nWe logged into the words which has some money inside: 5.5382483886 Bitcoin. \n\nDue to the post being deleted due to a moderator saying something about altcoins, I won't be able to write down the other coins that were in the wallet, but from what I searched on Google, the total is 1mil euros ~\n\nWe still have to check the rest of the words, but this is what we found so far.\n\nAbout our mom, I saw a comment mentioning that we are stealing her inheritance, please keep in mind that we are trying to keep it a secret because she will give most of the money away, when she is the one that needs it the most, we aren't homeless, but most days we have to eat spaghetti and I know maybe it's not that bad, but compared to the meals she used to cook and the empty fridge, I am going to assume she's broke because our dad and mom are divorcing and he isn't giving money I think, but if I tell my mom she will just tell everyone and the family doesn't like her, I hear them arguing all the time and I know when money gets involved people will make problems and my mom will be too weak to say no , idk what to do but wait it out\n\n\n\n\nLast Update: \nFollowing the advice of nice people, I  will be deleting my comments and account. \n\nF*ck the government, they ain't touching my mom's money, I'll launder if I have to 👿\n\nGoodbye, ganna drink a glass of cold choco milk now",

You can’t sell outright without shaking market confidence.  \nBut you can do something smarter:  \n**open a mirrored short position using your BTC holdings as collateral.**\n\nWhat happens?  \n– You don’t sell any BTC  \n– You don’t need new liquidity  \n– **You reduce net leverage without triggering panic**  \n– If the market dips, **you profit from the short and buy more BTC at a discount**\n\nIn other words:  \n**You accumulate more Bitcoin by draining liquidity from overexposed or overleveraged players.**  \nTechnically, you’re still bullish. Publicly, nothing changes. Behind the scenes, you’ve just executed a perfect hedge fund move.\n\nHere’s where it gets spicy:  \n**In this setup, leverage stops being a risk—it becomes a weapon.**  \nIf you’re long in leverage, and open a mirrored short, you’re not betting on direction anymore.  \n**You’re betting on volatility.**\n\n– Price goes up? Your long gains.  \n– Price goes down? Your short covers you—or even earns more.\n\n**Leverage is no longer your weakness. It’s your control panel.**  \nThis is how hedge funds operate: **they use leverage to dominate, not to pray.**\n\nBitcoin doesn’t need blind loyalty.  \n**It needs vision. Strategy. Protection.**  \nAnd those who truly want to accumulate more BTC… know that some moves aren’t announced. They’re executed.",

    "selftext": "Since people liked my reply, I decided to make it a post to reach even more people. Hope it helps someone out there looking at things from a different perspective.\n\nShould you diversify into something other than Bitcoin?\nThe quick answer is: There's no reason to \"Diversify\".\n\nDiversifying was invented in the Fiat system to compensate for government incompetence.\nThe idea was: Since money doesn't have any value anymore because of unlimited money printing, we need to desperately find a way to make some gains through investments, so let's use everything on the market to make more money. Oh and let's diversify our investments, that way, if a bank, a company at the stock market, or something similar shuts down because of the economy being a mess, we'll not lose our entire money.\n\nThe problem is: No investment in the world pays you more than the % amount of money governments around the world print every year (aka true inflation).\n\nThe only thing that beats it, is Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin is not a investment, Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, since it's not possible to print more Bitcoin like you can do with fiat. You don't need to invest it, just accumulate, it will preserve and increase its value over time.\n\nJust like you don't need to invest your gold into something you just need to buy more gold, it's the same principle with Bitcoin. Just buy more Bitcoin and wait.\n\nBefore the end of gold standard that served as a limit to money printing, investments were not so popular, people just worked and accumulated their money, because since the amount of dollars on a bill was equal to the same amount of gold in banks and government reserves, money had real value and was basically a Gold cupom that represented that value. So you could just accumulate money without investing, because you knew that your money would keep or even increase its value over time (which is not the case anymore).\n\nThe only diversifying you should do is your exposure to Bitcoin. You should have self custodial Bitcoin, ETF Bitcoin, Stocks that have their price directly linked to Bitcoin. Some banks offer you to buy custodial Bitcoin.\n\nWhy does this kind of diversification make sense? Because if you have all your Bitcoin in self custodial wallets, you could get your wallets stolen and lose all your money and you're basically dead. If the same happens in a custodial plataform you have someone to blame and pay the price for you.\n\nSo by having multiple ways of exposing yourself to BTC you can prevent losing all your BTC at once. That's the only way you should diversify, just like people back then doesn't had the need to use investments to keep their money value, you don't need to do that with Bitcoin. You're using gold without needing a paper cupom to represent it.",

That's about a 1.1% difference. Seems higher than what I see elsewhere unless I am missing something?\n\n\\*On Robinhood, (no hate please, the platform is actually great for buying and sending to wallet in my experience) the spread is about half roughly .6%.\n\n\\*I know there's no spread in all active trader platforms, but I'm looking for the best DCA set it and forget experience. \n\nAny help would be appreciated.

He leaned in to show me something on his phone, and for a moment I wasn’t sure what had me lightheaded—the Bitcoin chart on the screen or the way his cologne strangled me under the neon glow.\n\nWe talked for hours. Music got louder, lights got dimmer, and somewhere between our third or forth drink and his hand brushing mine, I stopped caring what time it was. He said something about fiat slavery and freedom money, but I was too busy watching his mouth move to fully track the topic.\n\nAll I’m trying to say in a longwinded breath is we’re still so early. Most people don’t even realize what Bitcoin is let alone crypto. \n\nWe closed the place down. I told him I don’t usually give out my number. He smiled, said “Neither do I,” and typed his in with a kind of confidence that stuck with me all night.\n\nWoke up still tasting the orange pill and wondering if I caught feelings—or if it’s just the bull market talking.\n\nKeep stacking! 🧡",

Now you need to pay someone with an address 1Pay 0.7 BTC. Electrum would handle this by creating a transaction with inputs from addresses 1Abc and 1Xyz (which sum up to 1.0 BTC) and the outputs would be 0.7 BTC to the address 1Pay and 0.3 BTC to the address 1ChA, which is one of your change addresses. Each change address is used only once. The reason for the existence of change address is the same as reason 1. above: it increases your privacy.\"",

There is a supply of only 21 million coins. How certain are we that about 3 to 6 millions are lost. Could it be more?\n\n2. Is there enough Bitcoin for it to serve as a global currency? Is there enough for a system to be put in place where everyone must use this one accepted currency?\n\n3. With the missing coins, what stops a so called Bitcoin reset? Maybe a new Bitcoin, same idea and everything, but a fresh start. People are behind the ideology but now a fresh 21 million to make up for the lost currency?\n\n4. With Botcoin being decentralized, no government had power. I think this is disinterest governments because they lack control of it. However, you can avoid sanctions and such because of this, which could be a pro. Is being decentralized more of a pro or con do you think?\n\n5. Could Bitcoin become backed by gold and/or silver if a government declared so? Would this make the price explode to the heavens above?\n\n6. What do you think will make Satoshis wallet awaken? I thought maybe it's a reserve? Like if governments bought everything, he would release them to give a chance to the common man or something? What do you think the purpose of his fat stack is?\n\nHappy discussion! ",

Also, would it be safe to after an X amount of blocks it automatically delets part of it's history, so it only has a recent record of the chain situation? That could prevent a ton of small blocks making a huge amount of storage over time.\n\nI'm ignorant to the implications of this idea, but the way I see this is: You could make quick small transactions on it since blocks would be confirmed quickly, and you wouldn't need a full record of it like on the main chain of BTC, because your bigger stack is at the layer 1, so you don't have to worry about the record of a L2 Blockchain where some small amounts of sats are spent on a coffee.\n\nIs this even possible? I know how the Blockchain works through analogies, but I have no technical knowledge about it to know if my idea is good, bad or even possible.",

    "selftext": "Bitcoin is much more scarce than you may think.\n\nHere’s what I mean.\n\nTotal money supply globally is about $500 trillion. Max BTC supply is 21 million. This means each BTC is about $23.8 million (500T/21M).\n\n1 BTC = ~$23.8 million.\n(That’s how much each coin would be worth if Bitcoin absorbed all global wealth.)\n\nSo if we work this out proportionally to the total global money supply, you get this:\n\nPercentile - Threshold - BTC Equivalent\n———————————————————————\nTop 0.01% - $25,000,000 - 1.05 BTC\nTop 0.1% - $5,100,000 - 0.214 BTC\nTop 1% - $1,200,000 - 0.05 BTC\nTop 10% - $100,000 - 0.0042 BTC\nTop 50% - $10,000 - 0.00042 BTC\nBottom 50% - $1,000 - 0.000042 BTC\n\nSo what does that mean?\n- To be in the global top 1%, you’d only need 0.05 BTC\n- To hit the top 0.1%, you’d need 0.21 BTC\n- The top 0.01%? Just 1.05 BTC\n\nMeanwhile, the bottom 50% of humanity would each hold just 0.000042 BTC. Barely a crumb.\n\nIt makes you realize just how unbelievably scarce Bitcoin is when you scale it against the sheer size of the world’s wealth. There are over 8 billion people on Earth… and only 21 million Bitcoin, and that’s before factoring in the 3 to 4 million coins lost forever.\n\nMost people are chasing 1 full BTC like it’s some kind of digital trophy, that’s really good, but they don’t fully grasp what it represents. When (not if) Bitcoin becomes the dominant global financial “store of value”, the Digital Gold of the modern age, 1 BTC doesn’t just make you “well off”…\n\nIt makes you part of a global elite.\n\nNot the 1%.\nThe 0.01%.\nMaybe even rarer.\n\nBitcoin is already well on its way there,some argue it’s inevitable. Major institutions, governments, the US government, billionaires, companies even - they’re already moving in. And when the world wakes up and tries to divide $500 trillion of global value across just 21 million units…\n\nThe game will already be over.\n\nSo the real flex won’t be Lambos and yachts.\nIt’ll be owning just one Bitcoin.\n\nAnd get this… even 0.1 BTC would be multi-millionaire territory.\n\nScarcity isn’t just hype, it’s math.\n\nSo the next time someone laughs at you for stacking sats at 100k… just remember: Even 50 millisats could make you a top dog.\n\nIn fact, $100k bitcoin is still *too* early\n\nStack sats like your future depends on it. Because it just might.\n",

Its been multiplied since ETFs\n\n3. reaction of M2 market liquidity, trading between countries, contracts, companies, customers\n\nThis pattern applies to all the years and to the last year. Its even brave to say, that a lot of printed money will go less in the M2 market liquidity, because it will be invested into BTC private wallets before and therefore it will be off the market. \n\n[2024 till now](https://preview.redd.it/tiswx5tpa9qe1.jpg?width=1799&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=799edcc58436c86408c950b669147875c69d400f)\n\nSource: [https://de.tradingview.com/chart/H8xmCgT6/](https://de.tradingview.com/chart/H8xmCgT6/)\n\nHappy to hear your discussions about that.

I know there is something that I am thinking wrong here, but please help me assuage my fears. \n\n\n\nIn the age of mobile phones, one carries a lot of information on his phone, and the rest he likely has on his head. \n\n\n\nTherefore, if criminals want money from a rich Mr Lebowsky (or, by mistake, from another Mr Lebowsky, who could be me!) they could kidnap him, get his phone, use his finger or facial recognition to get in the phone, use the facial recognition to get into his brokerage account, and get the guy to transfer a lot of money to another location; from which, in just a few days, the money would be irretrievably gone. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Lebowsky spends his time in a basement, Breaking Bad style, and fears a lot for his fingers, his toes, or both. \n\n\n\nA similar scenario can be thought of at home. In case of home invasion, the phone is in the same place as the occupant, likely easy to locate. 2-step verification becomes very easy, and the criminals would immediately access the bank account, the brokerage account, and see what crypto apps are installed in the phone. This is a clue as to which wallets, and likely which cold wallets, Mr Lebowsky has. Logging in to Trezor would immediately show them that Mr Leboswky has at least 1 password protected wallet, and then all bets are off, or all fingers are at risk. You get the drift. \n\n\n\nNow the fact is: nothing of this actually seems to happen. My AI engine says that not one single case of the sort was ever reported in the UK. There are a lot of very rich Lebowskys in the UK, living on their own without security, etc. But I do not have a criminal mind, if I think of this stuff I am sure countless criminals have done this, too.\n\n \n\nWhat gives?  \n\n  \n\n\n  ",

    "selftext": "In theory, you could just copy and paste Bitcoin's code or buy one of the hard forks out there. Many of them have strong communities that trust their version of Bitcoin as the real or superior Bitcoin.\n\nBut why doesn't that work?\nSimple, because it's not just about the code or about people trusting Bitcoin. It's about how Bitcoin was created and how it evolved over time.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was created, no one was interested in \"blockchain,\" no one was interested in \"hashrate,\" or which coin would \"moon\".\n\nBitcoin was adopted by people who genuinely liked the idea of a digital currency, not by people who were planning on getting rich the quickest way possible (at least not through Bitcoin). So, Bitcoin had a truly organic distribution and growth, making it truly decentralized.\n\nAfter the success of Bitcoin, those conditions are impossible to replicate. Because even if you copy and paste the code of Bitcoin or made an altcoin that worked better than Bitcoin in terms of superior technology, you would still have lots of investors trying to jump in before the project launches, or you would have people looking at it and trying to manipulate the market with pump-and-dump schemes.\n\nThat, on its own, leads to centralization, and that also interfere in the price action of the coin, and makes it's price action in most cases fully artificial. Only Bitcoin has an organic beginning and evolution over time in terms of adoption and price (yes we do have some whales trying to shake the market, but it is not even close on how violent it happens to altcoins). No other coin has that.\n\nAlso, the best part: No one knows for sure who Satoshi is, or if he is even alive. Not having a CEO prevents Bitcoin from suffering influence from its creator through public opinions, or from having its image compromised by some potential scandal its CEO could end up involved with.\n\nAnd that's what makes Bitcoin a totally different thing from the rest of the crypto market. Some people (including me) even consider all the altcoins just shitcoins, because they will never have the same characteristics as Bitcoin, nor its qualities and properties. They will always fail to replicate what Bitcoin has achieved because you will never be able to recreate the conditions that made Bitcoin possible to become what it is today.\n\nHope I made it clear.\n\nTL;DR: Stack till you're dead, Bitcoin is the best, Altcoins are all Shitcoins.\n",

I went one step further and instead of creating a random mapping from BIP39 to BIP39, I created a mapping from BIP39 to integer numbers. After encoding, the seed phrase does not look like a seed phrase anymore so it is just a bunch of random numbers that could mean anything. This provides enhanced security against a random human (a \"friend\", the plumber, etc) finding your stone-carved recovery words. \n\nIf you are interested in encoding your BIP39 words, in [this repo](https://codeberg.org/uqnvi828vwy/BIP39_encoding) you can find \n1. 999 encodings ready to be used,\n2. the source code to generate new encodings, different from those 999 pre-generated ones, and \n3. a more detailed explanation on the advantages and disadvantages of encoding.\n\nAs a proof that this indeed increases the security, I encoded a seed phrase: `22, 1856, 840, 600, 1298, 663, 696, 1588, 1520, 271, 1039, 371`. I will treansfer 10000 sats to the first one writing what the seed words are in a comment. You have my word that I will do it. I give you some help: The first word is `dignity`. I know 10000 sats is not much today, but it will be a lot in some years!",

If you’ve been affected, I’d love to hear your story and see if we can work together to take legal action.\n\nHere’s what you can do:\n\n1. Comment below or DM me with your experience (e.g., how much you lost, what happened, and any evidence you have).\n2. Upvote/share this post to help it reach more people who might be in the same situation.\n3. Let’s discuss if a class-action lawsuit or group legal action is feasible.\n\nThe more people we have, the stronger our case will be. Let’s not let Wirex get away with this. Together, we can fight for justice and hopefully recover what’s rightfully ours.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you all. Let’s make this happen!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u89gpj8pahqe1.png?width=3512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab480cef6512c61431dcd7b6908de91d011eba62\n\n  \n",
