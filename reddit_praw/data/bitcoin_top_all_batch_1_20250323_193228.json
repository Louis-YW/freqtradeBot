I watched and admired the price jump to $15.. $20.. $30.. wow!\n\nToday, I see $17,539 per BTC. I still don't believe reality sometimes. Bitcoin has changed my life, and I have far more money than I can ever spend. My aims, goals, and motivations in life have nothing to do with having XX million or being the mega rich. So I'm doing something else: donating the majority of my bitcoins to charitable causes. I'm calling it 🍍 The Pineapple Fund.\n\nYes, donating ~$86 million worth of bitcoins to charities :)\n\nSo far, The Pineapple Fund has/is:\n\n* Donated $1 million to Watsi, an impressively innovative charity building technology to finance universal healthcare.\n\n* Donated $1 million to The Water Project, a charity providing sustainable water projects to suffering communities in Africa\n\n* Donating $1 million to the EFF, defending rights and privacy of internet users, fighting for net neutrality, and far far more\n\n* Donated $500k to BitGive Foundation, a charity building projects that leverage bitcoin and blockchain technology for global philanthropy. \n\nIf you know a registered nonprofit charity, please encourage them to apply on the fund's website! While I prefer supporting registered charities, I am open to supporting charitable causes as well. Check out the website :)\n\n# 🍍 https://pineapplefund.org/ \n\nAll transactions are posted on the website for full transparency :)\n\n-----\n\nedit: **Pineapple Fund does not donate to individuals. Please do not post your addresses or PM.**\n\nedit 2: Thanks for the gold! Highlighting new comments is a really useful feature <3 ",

At the time BTC-OTC  was one of the most reputable traders on  Localbitcoins.\n\nI  shortly reported this to localbitcoins.com whitch led to BTC-OTC's account being banned and funds being locked - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhjCz/37f0ab1fc8.png)  also made a police fraud complaint to the relevant authority in UK\n\nLocalbitcoins freezed the funds stating the following in my support ticket  - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmDT/0a136c253b.png)\n\nSince then I've been actively trying to get my coins with no result receiving only one single reply on my support ticket in 8 months\n\nWhen contacting Max on linkedin his reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmJU/01610eaef4.png)\n\nWhen contacting Max on reddit his reply was - [ HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmIn/71ff537bcf.png)   nevertheless 6 months passed with no reply on my ticket.\n\nI emailed  Jeremias Kangas (CEO & Founder of LBC)  with no success. Also in my numerous visits at Metropolitan Police with this issue I was advised the same, this is a localbitcoins.com customer service issue not a legal issue.\n\nPolice official statement on my complaint   -  [ HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmOd/9045da5342.png)\n\nNational Fraud Intelligence Bureau advised  to change my fraud complaint against localbitcoins in order for them to investigate and contact localbitcoins regarding the case.\n\nAfter 6 months of waiting, Max's reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmTD/d93973a8bf.png) , after sharing all the info on both support ticket and email he replied on email   [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmXK/a213a8d27b.png)\n\nI knew this won't go anywhere so meanwhile I found a Metropolitan Police Sergeant specialized in blockchain and cyber-crime that understood this issue and decided to help me by contacting them using the fraud report I made in 2015.\n\nAlmost 2 months passed since he contacted localbitcoins (3 times) receiving no reply.\n\nReason I'm posting this is because  there are other 5 persons in this very situation, also other hundreds based on the posts complaining online.\n\nNow I'm in the process of taking legal action. I've been in contact with over 40 lawyers from Finland, and found only 2 that are looking to take this case and quoted me at €10.000 to  €15.000 for civil proceedings,\n\nFinnish Law allows only Ombudsman to initiate  a class action lawsuit so this can be settled only in civil court\n\nIf you are a victim of this or you can help please get in touch.",

    "is_self": true,
    "selftext": "On November 28, 2017, the US Senate, Committee of the Judiciary held a hearing regarding bill S.1241: Modernizing AML Laws to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. Despite little attention being given to digital currencies during the hearing, bill S.1241 itself would amend the definition of ‘financial institution’ in the United States Code to include digital currencies and digital exchanges. This could have alarming consequences for users of cryptocurrencies both in the US and abroad.\n\nBill S.1241 would amend the definition of ‘financial institution,’ in Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, to include “an issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.” Currently, the definition of ‘financial institution’ includes banks, trust companies, credit unions, currency exchanges, etc.\n\nIn her introduction, Mrs. Feinstein, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, said (31:35), “The bill criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.” Although, during the hearing, no further clarifications were given as to the effects this would have on the cryptocurrency community, based on the amended definition of ‘financial institution’, it seems clear enough that the bill would “criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.” Wow. Let this sink in for a minute…\n\nThe US senate is proposing a bill to make criminals out of anyone intentionally concealing ownership or control of a digital currency or digital exchange account. What’s more, according to the hearing’s prolonged discussion of US law enforcement’s handling of foreign banks and financial institutions, this bill is certain to have far-reaching effects on not only US citizens but the global community as a whole.\n\nIf the above statement describes you, it is strongly recommended that you watch the hearing with this new definition of ‘financial institution’ in mind. If you’ve already watched the hearing, watch it again, but this time replace all mentions of ‘banks and financial institutions’ with ‘digital currencies and digital exchanges.’ The implications are really rather alarming.\n\nInterestingly enough, Ms. Kathryn Haun Rodriguez, a Coinbase Board of Directors Member, made absolutely no mention of digital currencies or digital exchanges in her testimony; nor was she asked any questions pertaining to these topics.\n\nConversely, in her July 2017 written testimony to the US House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services and Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance, she stated that some users of digital currencies use them “to conceal and move illicit proceeds because of the perception that virtual currency is untraceable.”\n\nAlso in her prior written testimony, she stated that “the FinTech industry could be a very helpful partner to the government in addressing national security concerns;” that “investigators like digital footprints and that is exactly what digital currencies provide;” and that “of course, we can only follow the money to an individual or group if they used a Regulated exchange, one that follows basic AML/KYC laws.” Advertisement\n\nContrary to the bill itself, the hearing was noticeably lacking in references to cryptocurrencies; although there was some limited mention of such.\n\nMs. Klobuchar (2:16:58):\n\n“Is this transition we’re seeing from cash to digital going to make it easier or harder for law enforcement to track these money laundering cases, and you think these drug cartels are gonna start going cash free, and what do you do about it?”\nMr. John A. Cassara (2:17:15):\n\n“Senator, I’m just glad I had my career when I did because I don’t know what I’d do trying to follow the money when it comes to digital currencies, it’s extremely, extremely challenging…I think if you look at the metrics, the metrics suggest today [that] digital currencies are a small fraction of the threat that we face. That’s not to say it’s gonna be the case in 5-10 years from now. We’re right at a crossroads, and it’s going to be very, very interesting to see what goes forward.”\nDue to the probable negative implications for the global cryptocurrency community, hopefully the interpretation of bill S.1241 in this article is proven incorrect; however, at this point, it seems fairly clear (at least to me, the author) that this is the intent behind the bill. If this is indeed the case, it will be the most recent attack on a growing list of State-backed attacks against the crypto-community.\n\nFurthermore, from the noticeable lack of references made to digital currencies during the hearing, it would appear this bill is yet another underhanded attempt of the US Government to further erode global freedoms and civil liberties, which markedly began with the introduction of the Patriot Act, shortly after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAs Tone Vayes mentioned, it would have been nice if Andreas Antonopoulos was there to impart some of the wisdom he shared with the Canadian Senate, on October 8, 2014.\n\nTone Vayes’ summation*: “It’s bad…I think it’s gonna end in a very confrontational way between Bitcoin—even Bitcoin holders and users—and the US Government.”\n\nJimmy Song’s summation*: “Yeah, the nice thing about laws is they take a long time…”\n\nIndeed it will be “very, very interesting to see what goes forward.” If this bill passes, how many of you future criminals out there are still set on hodling?\n\n*to be fair, neither had yet watched the entire hearing.\n\nFull Disclosure: Landon Mutch is a contributor to the Lightning Network, a layer-two Bitcoin protocol, also BTCManager is scamming it’s writers and not paying them :(.",

    "is_self": true,
    "selftext": "I posted about this [just a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6jrl5o/unrealistic_volatility_expectations/), but I feel that it's necessary to repeat. The Bitcoin price is on an unbelievably ridiculous upswing which is rather likely to be a bubble. If you're trying to get rich quick by dumping your retirement funds into BTC at $10k, then your \"investment strategy\" is not much better than someone betting everything on a game of roulette. High-risk-high-reward investing is not *necessarily* bad, but you have to seriously look at your thought process to make sure that you're not:\n\n* Being blinded by dreams of getting rich quickly, similarly to people who dump money on very-negative-EV lottery tickets.\n* Getting wrapped up in \"HODL\" memes, reddit comments, and other groupthink, which is sometimes fun, **but absolutely the last appropriate source of investment advice**.\n* Acting based on panic thinking like, \"OMG the price is going to $1 million and I will *miss my chance forever* if I don't buy *right now*\" or \"OMG the price is going to $0.01 and I will *miss my chance forever* to retain some value if I don't sell *right now*\".\n* Investing more than you can afford to lose. **Bitcoin is HIGHLY, HIGHLY speculative**. No investment advisor would tell you to put all of your life savings into MSFT or whatever, and MSFT has a market cap 4x larger than Bitcoin. Although I *believe* that it is very unlikely, there are several ways in which the value could drop precipitously, even to zero. For example, there is *no mathematical proof* that the cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin are actually secure -- they are merely *believed* to be secure because nobody has been able to break them after many years of intense scrutiny. (I'm not here recommending \"diversifying\" into altcoins -- altcoins are almost all complete trash, and price-wise they follow BTC but with even more volatility, so they're not really useful for diversification.)\n\nIt is entirely possible that the massive price increase of the last year is based on lasting fundamentals. In addition to things like the fairly recent subsidy halving, the defeat of B2X, etc., the world fiat-based economy is in many ways on very shaky ground, and getting worse all the time. There are many good reasons why BTC should have a larger market cap than every fiat currency combined. It's even possible that the price will increase quite a bit more from now. But for goodness sake, don't think that Bitcoin is the first-ever infinite-money generator that will continue to rise exponentially forever (in real terms). I can nearly guarantee that **there will be a large and long-lasting crash/downturn at some point**. Maybe it will be $10k to $5k, maybe it will be $50k to $30k, who knows. But if you're thinking for example that the current $5k+ price range is *absolutely secure* after only existing for a few months, then you're traveling blind through very dangerous territory.\n\nSome points to consider:\n\n* Buying near the ATH is very risky, and while it *can* be correct/profitable, it puts you on the wrong footing. You need to buy *low* and sell *high* to make money.\n* On 2013-11-29 (exactly 4 years ago) the peak ATH hit $1163, and then fell to $152 by 2015-01-13. That's a drop of 86.9%. Imagine this happens again: The price drops sharply to $2000 or something and then just continuously decreases down to a low of $1,432 (an 86.9% reduction from today's ATH) over the course of a *whole year*. I'm not saying that this *will* happen, but it's happened once and it *can* happen again. **Could you survive this?**\n* Bitcoin is experimental, and it is probably imprudent for someone who is not a true believer in the *soul* of Bitcoin to invest a lot into it. For example, I personally wouldn't invest more than a few percent of my total assets into ETH even if I felt very confident that it would rise in price because I simply don't believe in its philosophy or long-term value.\n* To reduce risk, it is frequently recommended to allocate assets by percentage, and rebalance upon large price movements. Eg. If you previously decided that you want to allocate 50% of your wealth in BTC (because you are a super big true believer), but BTC is now 90% of your wealth because the price increased so much, it may generally be advisable to start selling to rebalance your BTC allocation back down to 50%. I'm not saying that it is always absolutely wrong to have 90% of your assets in BTC or whatever, but it should be because you are intentionally *choosing* to do so, not because the price got away from you and you never really considered that you now have 90% of your wealth riding on one thing.\n* Avoid panic buys and panic sells. Dollar-cost-averaging over a long period of time is often a good strategy.\n* Nothing rises in real value to infinity. That's impossible. It is possible that 1 BTC could someday be worth infinite *dollars*, but that just means that dollars are worthless in that hypothetical scenario. BTC probably does have plenty of room to grow in real value before it completely takes over the world, but keep in mind that there *is* a ceiling.\n* If BTC were to reach values like $100k-$250k, that'd probably cause/imply that the prevailing economic regime has completely fallen apart. At some point in that price area, people around the world would probably lose substantial faith in fiat currencies. A good result, but ask yourself: do you expect the prevailing economic regime to *go down easily*?\n\nI'm not telling you to buy or sell, and I'm not giving financial advice here. I'm just urging everyone to think rationally, not emotionally or recklessly.",

    "selftext": "**So I sold the last of my 22ish BTC yesterday.**\n\nI first got in around September of 2013 when the price was $130. I later set up a weekly buy on Coinbase buying the majority of my coins between $200 to $400. My original goal back then was to accumulate 21 BTC and be in the million club. I turned it off in 2015 once I was well over 21 coins. Of course looking back I wish I had never turned it off.\n\n**So why did I sell?** The value is now enough that I can pay my capital gains and still have enough to pay off my house leaving me completely debt free. I found myself constantly stressing over the fact I was storing close to 200K and I also fully expect a pull back at some point soon. Once my house is paid off I will most likely start buying back in again using money that would have been going towards a house payment.\n\n**Things I learned**  \n**Test your recovery process.** If you have a hardware wallet (and you should) send a small amount of crypto to it then wipe it and reload it using your seed. This made me much more confident using the wallet once I had done this and knew that recovery was pretty simple. Also use a passphrase, but make sure it is one you will never forget.\n\n**Store your seed securely.** I used a metal stamp to punch my seed into a ¼ inch steel plate. After that I dipped it in plastisol so it cannot be read and stored it in my safe with a description written on the outside. I also had another copy of the seed stored behind a picture at a trusted family member’s house just in case.\n\n**Sending a BTC transaction for tens of thousands of dollars is extremely stressful.** I first moved my coins from Coinbase to a hardware wallet before the BCH fork (yes, I was stupid and stored them on an exchange, although I did use their cold storage feature so there was a waiting period before they could be moved if my account was compromised). It was a long 15 minutes before the transaction showed up on the blockchain (I think Coinbase batches transactions up before sending) so I was freaking out that I had done something wrong and all my coins were gone. I wanted to save on transaction fees, but I should have moved them in smaller increments.\n\n**Weekly buys and dollar cost averaging is the way to buy.** I never had to think about the weekly buy so it was worth the small amount I paid for fees. Over time I was able to build a substantial sum.\n\n**It takes a long time to get out due to limits.** I was limited to 10K withdrawal per day so it is taking a while to transition to fiat. I applied for an increase but it was denied for some reason. I am pretty happy with Coinbase, but they are obviously dealing with growing pains. After withdrawing around 50K they quit letting me withdraw and said I needed to do some more verification. I tried uploading my license but the verification kept failing with a blank error message. I submitted a support ticket and heard nothing for several days. I finally remembered that they had recently added phone support so found the number and called. I only had to wait about 10 minutes until I talked to someone and they were very helpful. It turns out I was supposed to be prompted to use a web cam to take a selfie after uploading my license. Once I found that out I did it on my laptop that has a camera and was verified within 5 minutes. I had no problems with withdrawals after that.\n\n**Capital gains suck.** I took all the risk of buying into crypto yet I am going to be on the hook for close to 30K to the government for my long term gains. There is no way I am fucking around with the IRS though, so I will happily pay them. I still have some other crypto and will most likely start buying back in again in a few months. In a few years when I retire I will most likely try to live off of 37.5K income per year from selling crypto so I do not have to pay those capital gains. After a few years of that I will dip into my traditional retirement accounts. I still need to find out if I need to pay an estimated tax payment this quarter to avoid a penalty for not having enough taken out of my paycheck to cover my taxes for the year.\n\nMy hat is off to those that are still hodling. It has already gone up quite a bit since I sold. I might look back at selling and kick myself in the future, but right now the thought of being debt free is pretty liberating. \n**It has been one fucking hell of a ride and I will be back on the coaster with the rest of you soon!**\n",

With all this net neutrality stuff going on you'd be crazy to invest in money that they can just shut down with the flick of a switch!\"\n\nBecky, last week i heard you ask the IT guy if you needed two mice plugged in to your computer if you want to use two screens at once and now you have a working knowledge of both the monetary system, crypto currencies AND the internet?! that's very impressive.\n\nI have no idea why this is annoying me so much, I just found the need to rant while waiting for a meeting to start.\n\nEdit: people seem to have come to some weird conclusions that i've been doing nothing but come to work and try sell crypto to the entire office. the \"i told ya so\" isn't directed at me or anyone in particular, it's just general chatter around the office. i'm not printing out weekly bitcoin news letters to put on peoples desks or waiting by their car at night to ask why they haven't bought BTC.\n\nTry not to jump to conclusions based on a semi-satirical piece of information.\n\nDon't be a John or a Becky\n\nthe salty no-coiner input here is the best part. shout out to /r/all and probably /r/buttcoin",
