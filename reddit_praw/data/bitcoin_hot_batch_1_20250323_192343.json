    "selftext": "# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ\n\nYou've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  \n\nIt all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:\n\n* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)\n* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) - or [download a free copy here](http://cryptache.ro/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Bitcoin-Standard-The-Decentralized-Alternative-to-Central-Banking-PDF-Room.pdf)\n* [Video 1: An introduction to Bitcoin - Wences Casares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFKJVLNVQA)\n* [Video 2: The Stories We Tell About Money - Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONvg9SbauMg)\n* [Video 3: The Bitcoin Standard - Saifdean Ammous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbm772vF-5M&t=286s) \n* [Video 4: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4)\n\nSome other great educational resources include;\n\n* The [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/) (check them out!)  \n* Swan [Bitcoin Canon](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/canon/)\n* Michael Saylor's [Hope.com](https://hope.com/) and [\"Bitcoin for Everybody\"'](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=468) course\n* Jameson Lopp's [resource page](http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html)\n* Gigi's [resource page](https://bitcoin-resources.com/#bitcoin-non-technical)\n* James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q&index=7&t=0s)\n* Parker Lewis's [Gradually Then Suddenly series](https://unchained.com/blog/category/gradually-then-suddenly/)\n* Some Bitcoin statistics can be found here ([1](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/), [2](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/hashrate/6m?c=m&g=15&r=week&t=a), [3](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/), [4](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/), [5](https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-price-performance-since-halving), [6](https://augmentedcoin.io/btc), [7](https://nakamotoportfolio.com/nakamoto/start)).\n* A Reading List of [Advanced Bitcoin Books](https://new.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c5fjhn/advanced_bitcoin_reading_list_curriculum_in_order/)  \n\nIf you are technically or academically inclined check out;\n\n* Developer resources ([1](https://developer.bitcoin.org/), [2](https://spiral.xyz/#projects)) \n* [Peer-reviewed research papers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg)\n* Course lectures from both [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/) and [Princeton](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qynvj/dont_panic_just_learn_sixty_free_lectures_from/) \n*  Future [protocol improvements](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/) and [scaling resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/56nnd8/the_scaling_bitcoin_website_is_awesome_videos/).  \n\nMicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial Bitcoin integration.\n\nYou can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)\n\n## Key properties of Bitcoin\n\n* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.\n* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.\n* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).\n* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  \n* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).\n* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.\n* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).\n* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.\n* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. \n* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.\n* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met\n* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. \n* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. \n* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).\n* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.\n* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).\n* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.\n* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.\n\n## Where can I buy bitcoin?\n\n[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.\n\n* [Strike](https://strike.me/)\n* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)\n* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)\n* [River Financial](https://river.com/)\n* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) \n* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) \n* [Relai](https://relai.app/)\n* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)\n* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)\n* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)\n* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)\n* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)\n* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)\n\nYou can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  \n\n**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. \n\n## Securing your bitcoin\n\nWith Bitcoin you can **\"Be your own bank\"** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **\"Bitcoin banks\"** which will hold your bitcoin for you.\n\n* If you prefer to **\"Be your own bank\"** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).\n\n* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.\n\n* If you prefer to work with third party **\"Bitcoin banks\"** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **\"Not your keys, not your coins\"**. \n\n**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** \n\n2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.\n\n**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called \"SIM swapping\" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.\n\nGoogle Auth | Authy | OTP Auth \n--------------|--------|------------\n[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A \n[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | \n\nPhysical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.\n\n## Running Bitcoin\n\nYou can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. \n\nIt is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). \n\nDon't Trust, Verify.\n\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases\n* https://bitcoincore.org\n* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/\n\nA verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). \n\nFor wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.\n\n## Watch out for scams\n\nAs mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **\"Don't trust, verify\"**. \n\n* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.\n* Ignore private messages offering services.\n* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.\n* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.\n* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.\n\n## Common Bitcoin Myths\nOften the same concerns arise about Bitcoin from newcomers.  Questions such as:\n\n* Will quantum computers break Bitcoin?\n* Will governments ban Bitcoin?\n* Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?\n\nAll of these questions have been answered many times by a variety of people.  Here are some resources where you can see if your concern has been answered:\n\n* [Common Bitcoin Myths](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths)\n* [Gradually, Then Suddenly](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/series/gradually-then-suddenly/)\n* [Every Reason Bitcoin Will Not Fail](https://safehodl.github.io/failure/)\n* [The Best Articles Debunking Bitcoin FUD](https://endthefud.org/)\n* [Why Bitcoin is Not a Ponzi Scheme: Point by Point](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/why-bitcoin-is-not-a-ponzi-scheme-point-by-point/)\n\n## Where can I spend bitcoin?\n\nCheck out [Spendabit](https://spendabit.co/), [Bitcoin Directory](http://bitcoin.directory/shop), or [Coinmap](http://coinmap.org/) for a plethora of merchant options.

Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. \n\nIf you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/)\n\n## Earning bitcoin\n\nJust like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoin by being paid to do a job.\n\nSite | Description\n---|---\n[WorkingForBitcoins](https://workingforbitcoins.com), [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/for-individuals/), [Coinality](https://coinality.com/), [Bitgigs](http://bitgigs.com/), [/r/Jobs4Bitcoins](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins) | Freelancing\n[Lolli](https://www.lolli.com/) | Earn bitcoin when you shop online!\n\nYou can also earn bitcoin by participating as a market maker on [JoinMarket](https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket) by allowing users to perform CoinJoin transactions with your bitcoin for a small fee (requires you to already have some bitcoin).\n\n## Bitcoin-Related Projects\n\nThe following is a **short** list of ongoing projects that might be worth taking a look at if you are interested in current development in the Bitcoin space.  \n\nProject | Description\n---|---\n[Lightning Network](https://lightning.engineering/index.html)| Second layer scaling\n[Liquid](https://blockstream.com/liquid/) and [Rootstock](https://www.rsk.co/) | Sidechains\n[Hivemind](http://bitcoinhivemind.com) | Prediction markets\n[DropZone](https://github.com/17Q4MX2hmktmpuUKHFuoRmS5MfB5XPbhod/dropzone) and [Beaver](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/464.pdf) | Decentralized markets\n[JoinMarket](https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket), [JAM app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbyjG2upGO8) and [Wasabi](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/) | CoinJoin implementation\n[Peer-to-Peer Exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/) | Peer-to-peer exchanges\n[Keybase](https://keybase.io/) | Identity & Reputation management\n[Abra](https://www.goabra.com/) | Global P2P money transmitter network\n[Bitcore](http://bitcore.io/) | Open source Bitcoin javascript library\n[Bitcoin Knots](https://bitcoinknots.org/) | A Bitcoin Node (Within Consensus Fork of Bitcoin Core)\n\n## Bitcoin Units\n\nOne bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:\n\nUnit | Symbol | Value | Info\n---|:---:|---|---\nbitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis\nmillibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet\nbit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial \"slang\" term for microbitcoin\nsatoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor\n\nFor example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:\n\n* 0.001 BTC\n* 1 mBTC\n* 1,000 bits\n* 100,000 sats\n\nFor more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).\n\n---\n\n**Still have questions?**  Feel free to ask in the comments below or stick around for our weekly [Mentor Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/search/?q=title%3A%22mentor+monday%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) thread.

    "selftext": "In theory, you could just copy and paste Bitcoin's code or buy one of the hard forks out there. Many of them have strong communities that trust their version of Bitcoin as the real or superior Bitcoin.\n\nBut why doesn't that work?\nSimple, because it's not just about the code or about people trusting Bitcoin. It's about how Bitcoin was created and how it evolved over time.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was created, no one was interested in \"blockchain,\" no one was interested in \"hashrate,\" or which coin would \"moon\".\n\nBitcoin was adopted by people who genuinely liked the idea of a digital currency, not by people who were planning on getting rich the quickest way possible (at least not through Bitcoin). So, Bitcoin had a truly organic distribution and growth, making it truly decentralized.\n\nAfter the success of Bitcoin, those conditions are impossible to replicate. Because even if you copy and paste the code of Bitcoin or made an altcoin that worked better than Bitcoin in terms of superior technology, you would still have lots of investors trying to jump in before the project launches, or you would have people looking at it and trying to manipulate the market with pump-and-dump schemes.\n\nThat, on its own, leads to centralization, and that also interfere in the price action of the coin, and makes it's price action in most cases fully artificial. Only Bitcoin has an organic beginning and evolution over time in terms of adoption and price (yes we do have some whales trying to shake the market, but it is not even close on how violent it happens to altcoins). No other coin has that.\n\nAlso, the best part: No one knows for sure who Satoshi is, or if he is even alive. Not having a CEO prevents Bitcoin from suffering influence from its creator through public opinions, or from having its image compromised by some potential scandal its CEO could end up involved with.\n\nAnd that's what makes Bitcoin a totally different thing from the rest of the crypto market. Some people (including me) even consider all the altcoins just shitcoins, because they will never have the same characteristics as Bitcoin, nor its qualities and properties. They will always fail to replicate what Bitcoin has achieved because you will never be able to recreate the conditions that made Bitcoin possible to become what it is today.\n\nHope I made it clear.\n\nTL;DR: Stack till you're dead, Bitcoin is the best, Altcoins are all Shitcoins.\n",

If you’ve been affected, I’d love to hear your story and see if we can work together to take legal action.\n\nHere’s what you can do:\n\n1. Comment below or DM me with your experience (e.g., how much you lost, what happened, and any evidence you have).\n2. Upvote/share this post to help it reach more people who might be in the same situation.\n3. Let’s discuss if a class-action lawsuit or group legal action is feasible.\n\nThe more people we have, the stronger our case will be. Let’s not let Wirex get away with this. Together, we can fight for justice and hopefully recover what’s rightfully ours.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you all. Let’s make this happen!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u89gpj8pahqe1.png?width=3512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab480cef6512c61431dcd7b6908de91d011eba62\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Bitcoin is much more scarce than you may think.\n\nHere’s what I mean.\n\nTotal money supply globally is about $500 trillion. Max BTC supply is 21 million. This means each BTC is about $23.8 million (500T/21M).\n\n1 BTC = ~$23.8 million.\n(That’s how much each coin would be worth if Bitcoin absorbed all global wealth.)\n\nSo if we work this out proportionally to the total global money supply, you get this:\n\nPercentile - Threshold - BTC Equivalent\n———————————————————————\nTop 0.01% - $25,000,000 - 1.05 BTC\nTop 0.1% - $5,100,000 - 0.214 BTC\nTop 1% - $1,200,000 - 0.05 BTC\nTop 10% - $100,000 - 0.0042 BTC\nTop 50% - $10,000 - 0.00042 BTC\nBottom 50% - $1,000 - 0.000042 BTC\n\nSo what does that mean?\n- To be in the global top 1%, you’d only need 0.05 BTC\n- To hit the top 0.1%, you’d need 0.21 BTC\n- The top 0.01%? Just 1.05 BTC\n\nMeanwhile, the bottom 50% of humanity would each hold just 0.000042 BTC. Barely a crumb.\n\nIt makes you realize just how unbelievably scarce Bitcoin is when you scale it against the sheer size of the world’s wealth. There are over 8 billion people on Earth… and only 21 million Bitcoin, and that’s before factoring in the 3 to 4 million coins lost forever.\n\nMost people are chasing 1 full BTC like it’s some kind of digital trophy, that’s really good, but they don’t fully grasp what it represents. When (not if) Bitcoin becomes the dominant global financial “store of value”, the Digital Gold of the modern age, 1 BTC doesn’t just make you “well off”…\n\nIt makes you part of a global elite.\n\nNot the 1%.\nThe 0.01%.\nMaybe even rarer.\n\nBitcoin is already well on its way there,some argue it’s inevitable. Major institutions, governments, the US government, billionaires, companies even - they’re already moving in. And when the world wakes up and tries to divide $500 trillion of global value across just 21 million units…\n\nThe game will already be over.\n\nSo the real flex won’t be Lambos and yachts.\nIt’ll be owning just one Bitcoin.\n\nAnd get this… even 0.1 BTC would be multi-millionaire territory.\n\nScarcity isn’t just hype, it’s math.\n\nSo the next time someone laughs at you for stacking sats at 100k… just remember: Even 50 millisats could make you a top dog.\n\nIn fact, $100k bitcoin is still *too* early\n\nStack sats like your future depends on it. Because it just might.\n",

    "selftext": "Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jefbvc/a_lowtech_encryption_system_for_bitcoin_seed/) I decided to encode my seed words. I went one step further and instead of creating a random mapping from BIP39 to BIP39, I created a mapping from BIP39 to integer numbers. After encoding, the seed phrase does not look like a seed phrase anymore so it is just a bunch of random numbers that could mean anything. This provides enhanced security against a random human (a \"friend\", the plumber, etc) finding your stone-carved recovery words. \n\nIf you are interested in encoding your BIP39 words, in [this repo](https://codeberg.org/uqnvi828vwy/BIP39_encoding) you can find \n1. 999 encodings ready to be used,\n2. the source code to generate new encodings, different from those 999 pre-generated ones, and \n3. a more detailed explanation on the advantages and disadvantages of encoding.\n\nAs a proof that this indeed increases the security, I encoded a seed phrase: `22, 1856, 840, 600, 1298, 663, 696, 1588, 1520, 271, 1039, 371`. I will treansfer 10000 sats to the first one writing what the seed words are in a comment. You have my word that I will do it. I give you some help: The first word is `dignity`. I know 10000 sats is not much today, but it will be a lot in some years!",

The idea that you don't have to work anymore and Bitcoin will retire you is not a viable strategy.\n\nAnd by trying to make that a reality, you're just emotionally attaching yourself to an immediate outcome, and you'll be swaying with the ups and downs.\n\nBitcoin is guaranteed to go up, the economic situation is bad and likely to get much worse with AI erasing entire job sectors in the next 10 years, bringing budget shortfalls in government that will need to be filled with printing and higher taxes.\n\nEvery country is going to accelerate the printing of money, including US, Canada, Europe Union, Australia, UK, and China.\n\nThey're getting to the point where they don't even think twice before printing billions and trillions of dollars, something that we previously unheard of in the 70s and 80s.\n\nJust last week, EU earmarked another 800 billion EUR they don't have for additional war spending that gives EU nations permission to print beyond their previously permitted 3% GDP figures. \n\nBitcoin is going to perform well as an inflation hedge.\n\nBut the days of retiring on Bitcoin, unless you have tens and hundreds of them at this point, it's not going to happen. \n\nYour only hope is to increase your income so you can buy the dip when it happens and continue stacking outside the fiat system, in places where the governments cannot use your funds for paying national debts in tight times.\n\nAnd that is an ever increasing risk, any money held in a Swift bank account is not yours, and we will see some wild stunts pulled by governments in the coming years.",

It clearly indicates money printing in early terms and late money reaction in other countries overlapping.\n\n**Green chart - M2 Global Liquidity Index**\n\nThe amount of money being traded between market, banks and customers.\n\n**Orange chart - BTC/USD price**\n\nThe pattern:\n\n1. money printing shown by GLI Index by FED and banks\n\n2. reaction of BTC price. money invested into assets (btc, stocks, etfs) before the market of M2 reacts. Its been multiplied since ETFs\n\n3. reaction of M2 market liquidity, trading between countries, contracts, companies, customers\n\nThis pattern applies to all the years and to the last year. Its even brave to say, that a lot of printed money will go less in the M2 market liquidity, because it will be invested into BTC private wallets before and therefore it will be off the market. \n\n[2024 till now](https://preview.redd.it/tiswx5tpa9qe1.jpg?width=1799&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=799edcc58436c86408c950b669147875c69d400f)\n\nSource: [https://de.tradingview.com/chart/H8xmCgT6/](https://de.tradingview.com/chart/H8xmCgT6/)\n\nHappy to hear your discussions about that.

There’s nothing wrong with it. I just prefer seed words. \n\nAqua Wallet is more expensive due to how it “swaps” in/out of layer 2.

I know there is something that I am thinking wrong here, but please help me assuage my fears. \n\n\n\nIn the age of mobile phones, one carries a lot of information on his phone, and the rest he likely has on his head. \n\n\n\nTherefore, if criminals want money from a rich Mr Lebowsky (or, by mistake, from another Mr Lebowsky, who could be me!) they could kidnap him, get his phone, use his finger or facial recognition to get in the phone, use the facial recognition to get into his brokerage account, and get the guy to transfer a lot of money to another location; from which, in just a few days, the money would be irretrievably gone. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Lebowsky spends his time in a basement, Breaking Bad style, and fears a lot for his fingers, his toes, or both. \n\n\n\nA similar scenario can be thought of at home. In case of home invasion, the phone is in the same place as the occupant, likely easy to locate. 2-step verification becomes very easy, and the criminals would immediately access the bank account, the brokerage account, and see what crypto apps are installed in the phone. This is a clue as to which wallets, and likely which cold wallets, Mr Lebowsky has. Logging in to Trezor would immediately show them that Mr Leboswky has at least 1 password protected wallet, and then all bets are off, or all fingers are at risk. You get the drift. \n\n\n\nNow the fact is: nothing of this actually seems to happen. My AI engine says that not one single case of the sort was ever reported in the UK. There are a lot of very rich Lebowskys in the UK, living on their own without security, etc. But I do not have a criminal mind, if I think of this stuff I am sure countless criminals have done this, too.\n\n \n\nWhat gives?  \n\n  \n\n\n  ",

But I’m wondering—are there any better exchanges to buy from in Kuwait?\n\nMy plan is to keep stacking, and once I hit $5,000+, I’ll move it to a hardware wallet (most likely a Trezor). My ultimate goal is to reach at least 0.1 BTC by the end of the year.\n\nWould love to hear any tips or recommendations you guys have! Appreciate any advice. 🚀",

    "selftext": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/s/2TPBODXWQw\n\n\"So my grandpa died a week ago and my sis and I are helping my mom move his stuff into boxes and throw away some stuff, I came across his suitcase and there were many picture books and stuff and one of them has a bunch of codes that look like the wallet crypto codes when I Google them, how do I get into them? \n\nMy grandpa was never rich so I don't expect much, but I am curious, hoping to get an answer soon because my mom still haven't emptied out the trash bin outside, so if I have to look for something else that is needed to access these codes, now is the time, trash gets emptied 22 March \n\nUpdate 1:\nMy sister and I gathered the electronics. We also searched every book and suitcase for any other important looking things, all we found were family pictures. \n\nWe put everything in a box and it's in our closet for now, we haven't told our mom yet because we aren't sure if it has anything, besides she is the type to give the money away to help people and the rest of the family, even though they are mean to us because of the breakup, so if it has anything inside my sis and I will keep it a secret until we are older. \n\nRight now we have to go to school, we read all the comments, so thanks for the advice and suggestions, will be doing them when back home. \n\nBtw the electronics don't seem to work, not sure if I should throw them out\"\n\n\nAlright so I've updated twice on the original post but I'm not sure people are getting notified, so I'm making a separate post for the update 2. Also the posts were deleted because of Altcoins??\n\nUpdate 2:\nMy sis and I ended up using the usb on the pc and found a few pdf with words which we typed into a wallet\nWe also learned that the codes we initially found are private keys, but we have no idea how to log into them. \n\nWe logged into the words which has some money inside: 5.5382483886 Bitcoin. \n\nDue to the post being deleted due to a moderator saying something about altcoins, I won't be able to write down the other coins that were in the wallet, but from what I searched on Google, the total is 1mil euros ~\n\nWe still have to check the rest of the words, but this is what we found so far.\n\nAbout our mom, I saw a comment mentioning that we are stealing her inheritance, please keep in mind that we are trying to keep it a secret because she will give most of the money away, when she is the one that needs it the most, we aren't homeless, but most days we have to eat spaghetti and I know maybe it's not that bad, but compared to the meals she used to cook and the empty fridge, I am going to assume she's broke because our dad and mom are divorcing and he isn't giving money I think, but if I tell my mom she will just tell everyone and the family doesn't like her, I hear them arguing all the time and I know when money gets involved people will make problems and my mom will be too weak to say no , idk what to do but wait it out\n\n\n\n\nLast Update: \nFollowing the advice of nice people, I  will be deleting my comments and account. \n\nF*ck the government, they ain't touching my mom's money, I'll launder if I have to 👿\n\nGoodbye, ganna drink a glass of cold choco milk now",

Also, would it be safe to after an X amount of blocks it automatically delets part of it's history, so it only has a recent record of the chain situation? That could prevent a ton of small blocks making a huge amount of storage over time.\n\nI'm ignorant to the implications of this idea, but the way I see this is: You could make quick small transactions on it since blocks would be confirmed quickly, and you wouldn't need a full record of it like on the main chain of BTC, because your bigger stack is at the layer 1, so you don't have to worry about the record of a L2 Blockchain where some small amounts of sats are spent on a coffee.\n\nIs this even possible? I know how the Blockchain works through analogies, but I have no technical knowledge about it to know if my idea is good, bad or even possible.",

Is there enough for a system to be put in place where everyone must use this one accepted currency?\n\n3. With the missing coins, what stops a so called Bitcoin reset? Maybe a new Bitcoin, same idea and everything, but a fresh start. People are behind the ideology but now a fresh 21 million to make up for the lost currency?\n\n4. With Botcoin being decentralized, no government had power. I think this is disinterest governments because they lack control of it. However, you can avoid sanctions and such because of this, which could be a pro. Is being decentralized more of a pro or con do you think?\n\n5. Could Bitcoin become backed by gold and/or silver if a government declared so? Would this make the price explode to the heavens above?\n\n6. What do you think will make Satoshis wallet awaken? I thought maybe it's a reserve? Like if governments bought everything, he would release them to give a chance to the common man or something? What do you think the purpose of his fat stack is?\n\nHappy discussion! ",

Now you need to pay someone with an address 1Pay 0.7 BTC. Electrum would handle this by creating a transaction with inputs from addresses 1Abc and 1Xyz (which sum up to 1.0 BTC) and the outputs would be 0.7 BTC to the address 1Pay and 0.3 BTC to the address 1ChA, which is one of your change addresses. Each change address is used only once. The reason for the existence of change address is the same as reason 1. above: it increases your privacy.\"",

I thought entering Bitcoin in 2024 meant I was too late.\n\nBut I’ve come to realize that I’m not—and neither are you. Over the past few months, I’ve tried (unsuccessfully) to convince close friends and family about Bitcoin’s significance. What really surprised me, though, is that even highly tech-savvy people don’t get it. I have friends who are engineers at major U.S. tech companies; CEOs of AI startups , high-level directors in FinTech in the Middle East, and even professors studying the history of science and technology in major US universities. Yet, almost none of them truly understand Bitcoin. To them, it’s just another cryptocurrency, and they don’t see the massive historical shift happening right now.\n\nSo, if you ever feel like you’re late—don’t. We’re still early.

    "selftext": "Since people liked my reply, I decided to make it a post to reach even more people. Hope it helps someone out there looking at things from a different perspective.\n\nShould you diversify into something other than Bitcoin?\nThe quick answer is: There's no reason to \"Diversify\".\n\nDiversifying was invented in the Fiat system to compensate for government incompetence.\nThe idea was: Since money doesn't have any value anymore because of unlimited money printing, we need to desperately find a way to make some gains through investments, so let's use everything on the market to make more money. Oh and let's diversify our investments, that way, if a bank, a company at the stock market, or something similar shuts down because of the economy being a mess, we'll not lose our entire money.\n\nThe problem is: No investment in the world pays you more than the % amount of money governments around the world print every year (aka true inflation).\n\nThe only thing that beats it, is Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin is not a investment, Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, since it's not possible to print more Bitcoin like you can do with fiat. You don't need to invest it, just accumulate, it will preserve and increase its value over time.\n\nJust like you don't need to invest your gold into something you just need to buy more gold, it's the same principle with Bitcoin. Just buy more Bitcoin and wait.\n\nBefore the end of gold standard that served as a limit to money printing, investments were not so popular, people just worked and accumulated their money, because since the amount of dollars on a bill was equal to the same amount of gold in banks and government reserves, money had real value and was basically a Gold cupom that represented that value. So you could just accumulate money without investing, because you knew that your money would keep or even increase its value over time (which is not the case anymore).\n\nThe only diversifying you should do is your exposure to Bitcoin. You should have self custodial Bitcoin, ETF Bitcoin, Stocks that have their price directly linked to Bitcoin. Some banks offer you to buy custodial Bitcoin.\n\nWhy does this kind of diversification make sense? Because if you have all your Bitcoin in self custodial wallets, you could get your wallets stolen and lose all your money and you're basically dead. If the same happens in a custodial plataform you have someone to blame and pay the price for you.\n\nSo by having multiple ways of exposing yourself to BTC you can prevent losing all your BTC at once. That's the only way you should diversify, just like people back then doesn't had the need to use investments to keep their money value, you don't need to do that with Bitcoin. You're using gold without needing a paper cupom to represent it.",

It’s an open reflection on **how MicroStrategy (or any large BTC holder) could protect their position** without ever admitting they’re reducing exposure—while still appearing ultra-bullish.\n\nImagine you're heavily leveraged on BTC, like MicroStrategy is. You can’t sell outright without shaking market confidence.  \nBut you can do something smarter:  \n**open a mirrored short position using your BTC holdings as collateral.**\n\nWhat happens?  \n– You don’t sell any BTC  \n– You don’t need new liquidity  \n– **You reduce net leverage without triggering panic**  \n– If the market dips, **you profit from the short and buy more BTC at a discount**\n\nIn other words:  \n**You accumulate more Bitcoin by draining liquidity from overexposed or overleveraged players.**  \nTechnically, you’re still bullish. Publicly, nothing changes. Behind the scenes, you’ve just executed a perfect hedge fund move.\n\nHere’s where it gets spicy:  \n**In this setup, leverage stops being a risk—it becomes a weapon.**  \nIf you’re long in leverage, and open a mirrored short, you’re not betting on direction anymore.  \n**You’re betting on volatility.**\n\n– Price goes up? Your long gains.  \n– Price goes down? Your short covers you—or even earns more.\n\n**Leverage is no longer your weakness. It’s your control panel.**  \nThis is how hedge funds operate: **they use leverage to dominate, not to pray.**\n\nBitcoin doesn’t need blind loyalty.  \n**It needs vision. Strategy. Protection.**  \nAnd those who truly want to accumulate more BTC… know that some moves aren’t announced. They’re executed.",

Music got louder, lights got dimmer, and somewhere between our third or forth drink and his hand brushing mine, I stopped caring what time it was. He said something about fiat slavery and freedom money, but I was too busy watching his mouth move to fully track the topic.\n\nAll I’m trying to say in a longwinded breath is we’re still so early. Most people don’t even realize what Bitcoin is let alone crypto. \n\nWe closed the place down. I told him I don’t usually give out my number.

(very slightly..)\n\n|Weekday|BTC Acquired|\n|:-|:-|\n|Monday|2.719786|\n|Tuesday|2.717660|\n|Wednesday|2.712952|\n|Thursday|2.726639|\n|Friday|2.719273|\n|Saturday|2.713581|\n|Sunday|2.717083|\n\n  \nAnd plotted it with a log scale...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yb93g6iroppe1.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6dd19d6bef112528db225d37d88fbd7cc2038ce\n\nFrom the data, the day of the week doesn’t really matter because the total difference over a 7-year period was only around 0.01 BTC. However, I did discover the wonderful power of DCA.\n\n In my simulation, there were 377 weeks, and investing $100 per week adds up to $37,700 total. This would have yielded approximately 2.7 BTC, which at today’s value is worth $230,758.\n\nInsane!!\n\n",

    "selftext": "Bitcoin won't win everyone over. But it will win.\n\nToday, the dollar is the currency of international trade. Even if you're Spain and trading with Saudi Arabia, you're using dollars. In the past, gold was the currency of international trade: the dollar co-opted gold's goodwill by being backed by gold, but pulling the rug on everyone in 1971.\n\nInternational trade converges on one main currency because it's more efficient to use whatever the most people are using, and so naturally, one currency snowballs into the predominant one.\n\nAt some point, the dollar will cease to be the currency of international trade. I don't know when, and I don't know why, but history shows that it will happen. I think that a US debt crisis leading to massive devaluation is a possibility which may facilitate that, but I don't know for sure.\n\nAll I know is that when it does happen, a vacuum will form.\n\nEurope will try to convince everyone else that the euro ought to be the new currency of international trade. And everyone else will say \"No, why should everyone trust you? You have constant debt crises in your member states, your GDP is stagnant, and you will likely extract seigniorage from us to fund your ever-increasing social programs.\"\n\nRussia will try to convince everyone else that the ruble ought to be the new currency of international trade. And everyone else will say \"No, why should everyone trust you? You are invading your neighbors, you are actively printing more rubles to fund your wars, and your economy is tiny.\"\n\nChina will try to convince everyone else that the yuan ought to be the new currency. And everyone will say \"No China, you're a communist dictatorship with crushing capital controls and a digital currency that you can restrict and program at will.\"\n\nAnd so on, with other countries all trying to get everyone else to use their currency in international trade, but a consensus on any one national currency will be impossible. This is because none of the nations can put forward a *neutral* currency. There's baggage that comes along with bestowing any one country this privilege: the entire world is saddled with the results of their monetary policy, which can change on a whim, and for political reasons. You can bet that they will act in self-interest.\n\nIn the chaos, Bitcoin will emerge as a \"temporary\" workaround. Alright, fine, you won't use our ruble and we won't use your yen, but we need to trade, so let's just temporarily use Bitcoin. After all, it's already internationally valuable, it's quick to send, settlement is final, the liquidity is deeper than any other neutral digital asset...\n\nSome countries are already settling some trades in Bitcoin today (Russia and China.)\n\nBitcoin isn't going to win because everybody will decide to use Bitcoin at the same time. No, Bitcoin will win by process of elimination. It will be the last man standing: the only currency that is credibly neutral. It will be used because getting consensus on any other currency is even more difficult. It will be used begrudgingly even by the haters, because even the haters cannot force all other nations to accept their money in international trade.\n\nThen, it will be used more and more. And more. Soon it will become entrenched. After some time, it will be clear that it is not temporary, and it will emerge as the dominant currency for international trade. Soon after that, it will emerge as the dominant currency for domestic trade, in every country, following a similar path to victory.\n\nBefore we know it, everyone will be on a Bitcoin standard. We'll look back scratching our heads wondering how it unfolded so quickly. Once the process begins, it could be over within a geopolitical blink-of-an-eye (a few years.)",

The post was removed eventually by Mods)\n\nAs many of us agree hindsight is the biggest motivating factor for all, I have course corrected and started a simple investment strategy.. \n\nAll my investment ( long terms) goes into BTC, saving for my 9 month old daughter future-- BTC, retirement corpus--- BTC, it's not much atm about $20-30 per month but hope I will save enough.\n\nIf only I had invested that $10 K  over the years into BTC, i would have atleast 0.5 saved up .. 🤞 \n\nHope to achieve the dream soon! \n\nNote: I have been using Bitcoin Wallet to store my BTC on my phone.. taking monthly backups(Every time I make a purchase) to a encrypted pen drive.

In 2021, the total cryptocurrency market cap peaked at $3 trillion. This cycle, we've already reached a high of $3.71 trillion. Does it make sense for this to be the top when the U.S. prints $3-4 trillion every year?\n\nLiquidity is one of the main drivers of market growth, and with continuous money printing, the value of assets like crypto naturally appreciates. Compared to previous cycles, adoption is higher, institutional interest is growing, and macroeconomic conditions still favor risk-on assets.\n\nThe U.S. is still injecting trillions into the system every year. Even though the Fed isn’t officially doing QE, deficit spending + Treasury buybacks + repo operations all add up to more liquidity in the markets. Historically, more liquidity = more demand for risk assets like crypto, stocks, and tech equities.\n\nInflation remains sticky, which means cash is losing value. Investors seek hard assets (crypto, gold, real estate, stocks, etc.) to hedge against devaluation.\n\nThe Fed may start cutting rates this year. Lower interest rates typically push capital into higher-yielding risk assets (crypto, growth stocks, etc.).\n\nThe S&P 500 & Nasdaq are still in a strong uptrend. Historically, crypto follows equities in bullish environments. If markets remain risk-on, crypto should benefit from the same momentum.\n\nWhile short-term corrections are normal, the overall trend remains bullish. If history repeats itself, the market is likely to continue its upward trajectory, setting new all-time highs beyond what we’ve seen so far.",

    "selftext": "TLDR:  never gave a f-ck about finances, got fired 2 years ago, was broke for the first time of my life, got a job again in early 2024, friend orange-pilled me, started doing my research, \"wait.. fiat is actually horsecr*p?\" phase, started to dca as late as 2024 (yet still at a profit lmao), now orange-pilled asf and trying to convince the intelligent people around me that fiat means theft by money-printing, loving life knowing I'll hodl even through the worst possible dip.\n\nLong story: I (now 30) never took care of my personal finances before. Had a decent job for 7 years after college. No gf, no children, no mouths to feed, just me enjoying my salary to party, travel and buy the clothes I loved. No money aside. I had heard of Bitcoin but hadn't done my own research at all, just listened to the mainstream opinion around me (\"Bitcoin is a videogame money ponzi fraud!!!\") and didn't question it.\n\nFast forward to the summer of 2023, got fired abruptly (and for no valid reason), and for the first time in my life I realized that money was an issue. No money aside, no investments, no capital of any sort whatsoever, no one to help me. And I was starting to realize this inflation was unsustainable for my lifestyle.\n\nFortunately enough I found a job in early 2024 and committed to finally keeping a share of my income to invest. I coincidentally created an account on Reddit not long after and found out all about personal finances on multiple great subs. Then, I happened to talk finances with a friend of mine in the summer who told me \"You don't invest in BTC? You should look into it dude\".\n\nSooo... I did. I started with this sub and found out all about what money really is, what the problem of Fiat is and how it affects my day-to-day life (and robs me of my hard-earned work), what BTC offers, how it works, why it is so valuable and why there is no second best. And then I was eager to know more so I started reading about BTC EVERYWHERE (Social media, Youtube channels etc..)\n\nIt was like a revelation to me. Everything was adding up, and as I continued researching I started my DCA around July 2024 with small monthly sums. I purchased my cold wallet in december of 2024. I don't own much but even by getting in so late I'm at an overall ~20% profit (but that doesn't mean sh-t to me because BTC is valuable way beyond a shitty Fiat price lens).\n\nAnd now I'm reasearching about BTC and reading news about adoption SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. And I'll hold on to my (small) stack through thick and thin and a massive bear market could be on the way that I'd be happy because it'll mean \"cheaper sats\" to me.\n\nThat's my BTC story, what's yours?",

We mainly wanted to prove a point that it's easy and free to sell something for bitcoin online. All we paid was the domain which was like a couple dollars (even that you could get free from Google or Github). Free hosting, free wordpress, free woocommerce plugin, free dropshipping (printful) and free payment plugin (paywithflash). Well it's not free there is a fee but no upfront payment needed and no need to enter a credit card. Over time we added more products whenever there was a cool idea.

Both involve creating money out of thin air and injecting it into the economy. The only real difference? One is **illegal**, and the other is **sanctioned** by central banks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o8kan19npnpe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f5586982eb7063d9ea1b11f3768d995afd6d45c\n\nA counterfeiter prints fake money and spends it, diluting the value of real money. **QE does the same thing**—central banks create new digital money and use it to buy assets like government bonds. This artificially inflates the money supply without increasing goods or services, which inevitably pushes up prices and reduces the purchasing power of existing money.\n\n**Just like counterfeiters** benefit by spending fake money before inflation catches up, the biggest winners of QE are banks and corporations. They get first access to newly created money, allowing them to invest in stocks and real estate before prices rise. Meanwhile, **ordinary people are left dealing with higher costs and stagnant wages.**\n\nOn top of that, **QE distorts the economy** by fueling market bubbles. Stocks, housing, and other assets skyrocket in price, not because of real economic growth, but **because of artificially cheap money.** Eventually, the bubble bursts, leaving regular people to deal with the fallout.\n\n**The only real difference between QE and counterfeiting is that one is legal. But legality doesn’t change reality—whether it's a criminal printing fake bills or a central bank injecting trillions into the economy, the result is the same: devalued money, rising prices, and an economy built on illusion.**",

    "selftext": "# Technical Explanation of Bitcoin Mining and Network Difficulty\n\n# 💡 1. Overview of Bitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoin mining is the process by which new blocks are added to the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners use computational power to solve a **cryptographic puzzle** by finding a valid hash for the next block.\n\nKey steps in the mining process:\n\n1. **Assembling a Block:** Miners gather **pending transactions** from the mempool and create a candidate block.\n2. **Hashing the Block:** Miners repeatedly hash the block header with different **nonce values**.\n3. **Checking the Hash:** They compare the hash against the **current network difficulty target**.\n   * If the hash is **smaller** than the target, the block is successfully mined.\n   * If not, they try again with a new nonce or modify other parameters.\n4. **Broadcasting the Block:** The winning miner broadcasts the valid block to the network, and the block is added to the blockchain.\n\n# 🔢 2. Block Hash and Difficulty Target\n\nEach block header includes:\n\n* **Previous Block Hash:** A 256-bit hash of the preceding block.\n* **Merkle Root:** A hash of all the transactions in the block.\n* **Timestamp:** When the block was created.\n* **Nonce:** A 32-bit arbitrary number that miners increment during mining.\n* **Difficulty Target:** A 256-bit value that defines how small the block hash must be to be considered valid.\n\n✅ **Mining goal:**  \nTo successfully mine a block, the miner must find a hash that is **numerically smaller** than the current **difficulty target**.\n\n**Mathematically:**\n\nHash(block) ≤ Target\n\n# ⚙️ 3. The Network Difficulty Adjustment\n\nThe **difficulty target** dynamically adjusts every **2,016 blocks** (roughly every **2 weeks**), ensuring that new blocks are mined approximately **every 10 minutes**.\n\n* If blocks are being mined **faster** than 10 minutes on average → difficulty **increases**.\n* If blocks are mined **slower** → difficulty **decreases**.\n\n✅ **Difficulty formula:**\n\nNew Difficulty=Old Difficulty× (Actual Time / Expected Time)​\n\n* **Actual Time**: Time taken to mine the last 2,016 blocks.\n* **Expected Time**: 2 weeks (2,016 blocks × 10 minutes).\n\n# 🔨 4. How Small Must the Hash Be?\n\nBitcoin uses the **SHA-256** hashing algorithm, which generates a **256-bit hash**. The miner’s goal is to find a hash smaller than the difficulty target.\n\n✅ **Difficulty Target Representation:**  \nThe target is a **256-bit number** stored in **Compact Form** in the block header:\n\n* It consists of a **3-byte coefficient** and a **1-byte exponent**.\n* The target formula:\n\nTarget=coefficient×2 \\^ (8×(exponent−3))\n\n✅ **Example of difficulty representation:**  \nIf the difficulty target is:\n\n0x0000000000000000000abcdef1234567890000000000000000000000000000000\n\nAny hash with a **higher value** than this target is invalid.  \nMiners must generate hashes **smaller than this value** to successfully mine the block.\n\n# 🔑 5. Hashing Process and Nonce Iteration\n\nMiners construct the block header and repeatedly hash it while varying the **nonce** and other parameters.\n\n**Hashing process:**\n\n1. Miner sets the nonce to **0** and hashes the block header.\n2. If the resulting hash is **greater** than the difficulty target:\n   * Increment the nonce.\n   * Hash the block header again.\n3. Repeat until:\n   * A valid hash is found (smaller than the target).\n   * If the nonce overflows (2³² possibilities), modify the **extraNonce** in the coinbase transaction or change the timestamp slightly to continue.\n\n# ⚡ 6. Why 10 Minutes?\n\nThe 10-minute block time is achieved by adjusting the **difficulty**:\n\n* When miners generate hashes faster → difficulty increases.\n* When they mine slowly → difficulty decreases.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol ensures that, on average, it takes **10 minutes** to find a block by fine-tuning the difficulty every **2,016 blocks**.\n\n# 📊 7. Network Difficulty and Hash Rate\n\n* **Difficulty** is directly related to the network's **total hash rate**.\n* As more miners join the network → hash rate increases → difficulty increases.\n* If miners leave → hash rate drops → difficulty decreases.\n\n✅ **Current difficulty formula:**\n\nDifficulty=Maximum Target / Current Target​\n\nWhere:\n\n* **Maximum Target**: The highest possible target, defined as:\n\n0x00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\n* **Current Target**: The current network difficulty target.\n\n# 🔍 8. Probability of Mining a Block\n\nThe mining process is probabilistic:\n\n* The lower the **difficulty target**, the less probable it is to find a valid hash.\n* With increasing hash power, the chance of finding a valid hash within **10 minutes** increases.\n\n✅ **Probability formula:**\n\nProbability=Target / 2\\^ 256\n\nFor example:\n\n* If the target is:\n\n0x0000000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\n* The probability of finding a valid hash is:\n\n0x0000000000000000000F / 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\n# 🛠️ 9. Conclusion\n\n* **Mining goal:** Find a valid hash smaller than the **difficulty target**.\n* **Difficulty adjusts** every **2,016 blocks** (\\~2 weeks) to maintain a **10-minute block time**.\n* Miners continuously hash the block header, modifying the **nonce** and other parameters until a valid hash is found.\n* **Higher difficulty** makes finding valid hashes harder, requiring more computational power.\n\n✅ This dynamic difficulty adjustment ensures that the Bitcoin network maintains a **consistent block time** despite changes in global mining power.",

It enhances our lives in many ways and will continue to.\n\nBitcoin is no different. The less you understand the many, many problems that Bitcoin fixes, the less you will see the \"value\" in what Bitcoin is doing, and will continue to do for decades to come.\n\nUnlike the internet though, once you understand why Bitcoin will thrive for decades to come, you can actually own it while it grows. Bitcoin's network is currently valued in the market at around $86k a coin.\n\nWe could make another 100 Bitcoin networks if we wanted to. All 100 would fail just like if you made another 100 internets right now.\n\nSo, the next time someone says \"Bitcoin has no value\", tell them that technically they used to be right. That assertion is no more than *denial* today, though, as far as the market is concerned.\n\nSome good reading that will help depict why the Bitcoin network will be worth many many trillions of dollars in the future if it stays decentralized and secure:\n\nPrice of Tomorrow\n\nPrinciples of Economics\n\nBroken Money\n\nThe Creature on Jekyll Island\n\nMastering Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin Standard\n\nThe Big Print (new one and GREAT read)\n\nMoney You Can't Fuck With",

    "selftext": "Let’s be real—most people who jump into Forex never make it past the first few months. Some quit after a few losses, some blow their accounts chasing unrealistic gains, and others just get stuck in an endless cycle of strategy-hopping.\n\nIf you’ve been trading for a while but still feel **stuck, frustrated, or inconsistent**, here’s why:\n\n# 1. You’re Searching for the “Perfect” Strategy (It Doesn’t Exist)\n\nBe honest—how many times have you switched strategies after a few losing trades? Most traders keep looking for a holy grail setup, when in reality, **even the best strategies have losses.** The difference between a profitable trader and a losing one isn’t the strategy—it’s the **discipline to stick with it long enough to let probability play out.**\n\n# 2. You’re Risking Too Much and Panicking\n\nA single trade should never make or break your account. But too many traders go all-in, hoping for a big win, only to freeze when the market moves against them. **Proper risk management is the difference between surviving and blowing up.**\n\n# 3. You’re Letting Emotions Control Your Trades\n\nEver revenge-traded after a loss? Closed early because you were scared? Moved a stop loss hoping the trade would turn? **That’s emotional trading, and it’s killing your account.** The market doesn’t care about your feelings—it rewards those who execute with precision.\n\n# So, How Do You Fix It?\n\n✅ Stick to one strategy and **master it** instead of jumping around.  \n✅ Risk small per trade—**think long-term, not trade-by-trade.**  \n✅ Remove emotions by following a structured, rule-based approach.\n\nMost traders don’t fail because they lack skill. They fail because they **never fix these bad habits.**\n\nWhat’s been the hardest lesson for you in trading? Let’s talk 👇",

But my advice for young investors eager to get rich quick, wishing you had 3 Bitcoin today. 0.19 BTC in 2040 will be like 3 Bitcoin today. I know you want that new lambo and to get that new girl, but as you grow up your wants will change and you will want to see your kids have a bright orange future. By the time they are grown up 0.006 will be like 3 Bitcoin today. You aren’t to late to Bitcoin you are just in time.\nSo start stacking toward a block reward today.\n",

All that to say, I’m pretty disappointed with a lot of these.\n\nDon’t get me wrong they are definitely sleeker and easier to use, the bitkey especially is sexy af. However between the blind sign of Tangem with the card or ring (which straight up doesn’t work on the new iPhones cause the NFC times out before the ring can even connect so that’s straight to the trash for me personally) that you don’t actually know the seed words to or bitkeys server based 2/3. Why can’t I just use these devices as signers for my own setup? Why am I forced to use their wallet and/or 3rd key? And why do have to expose my entire stack to recovery risk with bitkey? Defeats the entire purpose of multisig if someone can recover my wallet with one key. So someone could kidnap me, steal my shit and then make the request and then let me go after day 7 of the recovery hold period are over like wtf? What’s was the point?\n\nMaybe I’m missing something here but while these devices are sleek they feel like a downgrade in terms of what they’re actually supposed to do which is secure my wealth. Idk maybe I’m just an idiot or I’m over thinking it. I guess I just feel like a lot of these new wallets are shined gimmick spend wallets but I’d never actually trust them with my families wealth. A lot of these would only really work with strong legal precedent against companies that manage keys for people. It’s gotta be something almost like a Swiss bank to actually be useful (and right back where we started). Where I have to show up in person and prove I am how I am otherwise it’s all just security for show.",

For now I have set up various accounts with Coinbase/Coinbase Wallet, Muun and Kraken Pro, putting some money on each just to see how it works.\n\nAll the coins were originally bought on Coinbase Exchange, so I bought on Coinbase; from there I transferred a part to Muun, and from there I will move some to Kraken. I have also moved some money to Electrum but I did not terribly like the experience/interface.\n\nI have already received my Trezor 5 plus and Xseed steel plates, and I will make the setup during the weekend.\n\nNow: I understand zippo of technology, but I have seen videos on Youtube (Bitcoin University, excellent site) which, if I understand it correctly, state that Coinbase will be able and willing to \"chase\" the money I have bought on Coinbase Exchange, hoping to get as much information on me as possible. So they (again, if I understood this correctly!) will be able to \"track\" my purchase from Coinbase to Muun and from Muun to what they will understand is my cold wallet.\n\nIt is also my understanding that is not a strictly KYC/legal requirement stuff, it is \\*Coinbase snooping on me\\*. Of course I understand if the police suspects me of a crime they will be able to subpoena the data from Coinbase or track me on their own. But what Matthew Kratter says is that Coinbase goes the extra mile.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. Is this true? Did I understand it correctly? Will Coinbase be able to trace the crypto all the way to their final destination?\n2. If this is true, is there any difference with Kraken Pro, that is: will I avoid the problem if I buy straight on Kraken Pro and transfer on my cold wallet from there?\n\nAgain the issue here is not what is legally allowed to the police. Is what these companies themselves are willing to do.\n\nMany thanks in advance.",

Bitcoin uses the internet as a superhighway to transfer value between differnet bitcoin users, what if the internet is compromised by a major global network \"glitch\" and we all have bitcoins but are unable to access them or transfer them between each other since we all can bot access the internet. Some people talked about having their own internet networks, like in Angela Merkel's 2013 speech, where in the wake of major security breaches and spying on German companies by foreign agencies, she spoke of the time for Europe to have its own internet, an internet 2.0 if you wish. Would bitcoin be transferable to that archetechture, or would some one have to code a new botcoin 2.0 for the new network. I hope I make enough sense about this idea to illicit a resonable response.

Consolidation, sideways movement, low volatility… but if history has taught us anything, it’s that **periods of low volatility don’t last.**\n\nThe question is: **Are you prepared for what’s coming next?**\n\n# 1. Bitcoin Moves in Cycles—And We're at a Critical Point\n\nEvery major BTC rally or crash has been preceded by a [**phase of accumulation and indecision**](https://www.forexcitysignal.com/sct-ofs)**.** Right now, we’re seeing:  \n📉 A tight price range with decreasing volume.  \n📈 Whale accumulation in key zones.  \n🔎 Liquidity building above and below the current price.\n\nThis setup screams **big move incoming.** The only question is—**which direction?**\n\n# 2. Retail Traders Will Get Caught Off Guard\n\nMost traders react *after* the move happens. That’s why they:  \n❌ FOMO in at the top.  \n❌ Panic sell at the bottom.  \n❌ Get liquidated when the market hunts stop losses.\n\nSmart money, on the other hand, **positions itself early**—while the market is quiet.\n\n# 3. Will BTC Explode Upward or Crash?\n\nNo one knows for sure, but the signs are clear: **a major shift is coming.** Whether it's a breakout to new highs or a liquidity grab before a deeper correction, one thing is certain—**t**[**his is not the time to be asleep at the wheel.**](https://www.forexcitysignal.com/sct-ofs)",

    "selftext": "Let’s be real—most traders don’t fail because the market is too hard.  \nThey fail because they refuse to do what works.\n\nThey keep looking for the **“perfect” strategy** instead of mastering one.  \nThey risk **way too much** per trade and wonder why their account disappears.  \nThey let **emotions control their trades** and blame the market when things go wrong.\n\nSound familiar?\n\n# 1. Stop Jumping Between Strategies\n\nOne week it’s price action, the next it’s indicators, then it’s some “secret” algorithm you found online.\n\nThis cycle never ends because you’re chasing perfection—**but no strategy wins 100% of the time.**\n\nThe real question isn’t **which strategy is the best?**  \nIt’s **can you follow ONE strategy with discipline and let probability work in your favor?**\n\n# 2. If You’re Risking Big, You’re Gambling—Not Trading\n\nBlowing your account isn’t “bad luck.” It’s bad risk management.\n\nA professional trader knows that one loss won’t kill them because they never bet the house on a single trade.\n\nIf you’re still risking 10%, 20%, or even 50% per trade, let me be blunt: **You’re not trading. You’re just rolling the dice.**\n\n# 3. Emotions Are Killing Your Profits\n\nFOMO, revenge trading, hesitation—these are account killers.\n\nTraders who make it in this game **trust their plan, not their feelings.** If you can’t remove emotions from your trades, your results will always be random.\n\n# So, What’s the Fix?\n\n✅ Pick one proven strategy and master it.  \n✅ Use strict risk management—protect your account first.  \n✅ Trade with logic, not emotions.\n\nIf you’re tired of struggling and want real, structured guidance, it’s time to trade with precision.",

I’ve decided to go with Independent Reserve as I am from Australia. \nHowever, their withdrawal fee is 0.0002 BTC which is currently about 26$. I can’t find any better options than this which to me is a problem as I don’t want to keep more than $1000 in the exchange but if I withdraw it to my cold wallet they are taking 2.6% every time. I feel like this is a lot. \nSo my questions are:\n1. Is it okay to leave $5000+ on an exchange (in particular independent reserve) in order to lower the withdrawal fee?\n2. Is 0.0002 BTC an okay withdrawal fee (I haven’t seen anything better in Australia and even if there is better ones like maybe Strike then I get fucked with conversions from AUD to USD)\n",

It remains scarce as a by product of it being a payment technology.\n\nYou cannot have one without the other.

The second unit was even worse—the right button was completely jammed, causing the device to rapidly scroll through screens on its own.\n\nAt this point, I was frustrated but still wanted to give them a chance, as they told me their team had identified the issue with the right button and that multiple people were experiencing the same problem. They claimed to have fixed the issue, and to their benefit, they did. But with that arose a different issue—now the middle button doesn’t respond properly, and on top of that, the Jade rattles.\n\nThree Jades, three defects.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been thinking about a plan to increase my financial sovereignty and reduce reliance on traditional banks and credit card companies. Here’s the outline of my strategy:\n\n1. **Move Crypto to Trezor**: Transfer my bitcoin from Coinbase to a Trezor hardware wallet for added security.\n2. **Convert Fiat to USDC**: Move money from my bank to Coinbase, convert it to USDC, and then transfer the USDC to my Trezor.\n3. **Get a** [**Crypto.com**](http://Crypto.com) **Card**: Apply for a [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) card to use for daily spending.\n4. **Load the Card with USDC**: Pre-load the [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) card with USDC from my Trezor (in set increments) for daily expenses.\n5. **Spend USDC**: Use the card for purchases, where USDC is converted to USD at the point of sale. Since USDC is pegged to the USD, I avoid volatility risks as much as possible.\n6. **Earn Cashback**: Take advantage of the [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) card’s cashback rewards, which I see as a way to earn a small return on my money, similar to what I might get from a traditional bank (though admittedly not as much).\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n* I plan to keep around $5-10K in my traditional bank for emergencies and liquidity.\n* I’ll still have credit cards but plan to use them only in case of emergencies.\n\n**My Goals:**\n\n* Increase control and ownership over my assets.\n* Reduce reliance on banks and credit card companies.\n* Earn cashback rewards to offset the opportunity cost of not earning interest in a traditional bank.\n\n**Questions for the Community:**\n\n1. Is this plan realistic and safe? Are there any risks I’m overlooking?\n2. Are there better alternatives to achieve similar goals?\n3. Has anyone else tried this approach? If so, what has your experience been?\n4. What tax implications I should be aware of when converting fiat to USDC and spending it via the [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) card?\n5. Any tips for minimizing fees or optimizing this strategy?\n\nThanks in advance for your insights!",

And I had missed some opportunities because of that.\n\nAnyone could give me some advice on how to get the news earlier than news website? I used to build a crawler for twitter but it seems hard to get the list which I need to follow, could this work?",

After that, I would open the app and generate the seed phrases for my cold wallet.\n\nDo you think this would be a viable way to create a long-term wallet, perhaps even as secure as a hardware wallet?\n\nFor me, this approach is much cheaper and more advantageous since I've had this phone for a long time (I even perform maintenance on it, such as battery replacements and other repairs).",

This cycle we got a huge amount of new money and got a mini speculative bubble within this first year, and now a mini crash. But looking at past cycles 11 months in, being up roughly 20% is in line with previous performance. \n\nUltimately, I think the general prediction of 180k by September-October is not out of the question. We are just now coming back in line with the traditional cycle (that is more muted each round) and the early 109k ATH was an anomaly. ",

People NEED to be spending money for the economy to even function, let alone thrive. \n\nSo how will the world work if most people holding Bitcoin never want to actually spend it?

People were bound to get burned chasing easy riches.\n\nI was already annoyed in 2017 when the shitcoin wave took off. Not just because of what it meant for Bitcoin in the short term, distracting from its actual purpose, but because I knew millions of people were about to financially ruin themselves gambling on hype. The worst part is that many believed Bitcoin at one thousand dollars was too expensive and chose random scams instead.\n\nAnd here we are, years later, with endless posts of people losing everything on meme coins and garbage projects that were always doomed to fail. I hate seeing it happen. If only people did not fall for these scams, everyone would win in the long run.\n\nThankfully, the trend is slowly shifting. Bitcoin dominance hit its lowest in 2017 and has not dropped that low since. The shitcoin casino is still open, but the house of cards is gradually collapsing.\n\nStill, it is painful to watch this cycle repeat.",

I do think bitcoin is a great asset as it’s scarce and provides a store of value against inflationary currencies with transactional value as well. The thought experiment is comparing the returns of bitcoin against other financial assets long-term.\n\nFor example when I buy a share of Amazon I am buying a share of the future cash flows in the company. Sure those future cash flows are denominated in USD now but they are currently yielding 3% with double digit earnings growth YoY and have historically far exceeded inflation. Additionally, maybe someday those future cash flows will be denominated in bitcoin growing at a rapid rate. ",

Right now gold is about 3% of the total, while Bitcoin is about 0.4%. But if Bitcoin becomes an essential structural asset, you might predict that its relative market cap should increase before it stabilizes.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoins remain a rally yolo asset, it is hard to see its structural value. That's why I am interested in whether it might gravitate towards being a safe haven or diversifying asset instead.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’ve been thinking a lot about Bitcoin’s future and I keep running into this concept of the \"death spiral\" after the last Bitcoin is mined in 2140. I know there are a lot of people who are super optimistic about Bitcoin, but I wanted to ask the community – could this \"death spiral\" actually become a real problem for Bitcoin?\n\nHere’s my thinking:\n\nBitcoin mining is currently incentivized by two things: block rewards (which decrease over time due to halvings) and transaction fees. But what happens when the last Bitcoin is mined? With block rewards being non-existent, the system will be relying solely on transaction fees to pay miners. That’s fine for now while Bitcoin’s price is high, but what if the price stagnates or even falls?\n\nIf transaction fees become too high, it could discourage regular users from making transactions, which would reduce the overall usage and value of Bitcoin. Miners may then find it less profitable to continue mining, and we could see fewer miners in the network. This could lead to a death spiral where the network becomes less secure and the value drops, causing even more miners to leave, and so on.\n\nIt’s also worth considering that Bitcoin’s energy consumption and mining difficulty are going to keep increasing, which makes it harder for new or smaller miners to stay in the game. As we get closer to the end, won’t only a few big miners be left? Could that lead to further centralization and make Bitcoin more vulnerable?\n\nI get that the idea of Bitcoin failing seems far-fetched to a lot of people, especially when you’re hearing from maxis all the time about how Bitcoin is \"digital gold\" and its scarcity will drive value. But isn’t it possible that the system might break down if things don’t play out as expected, especially as we near 2140? Could the current design be a flaw waiting to happen?\n\nJust wanted to get some thoughts from the community. Are we really overlooking a potential issue here with Bitcoin’s long-term sustainability, or am I just being too skeptical?",

    "selftext": "There is a book called the 4th turning published in 1997. \n\nIt discusses first, second, third and fourth turnings in American history. \n\nThe Crisis (Fourth Turning) is a period of upheaval, where institutions collapse, and society undergoes major transformation, often triggered by wars, economic collapse, or revolutions. This is where the authors argue America is now (starting in 2008 with the financial crisis). It’s a time of struggle that eventually leads to the rebuilding of institutions and a new High.\n\nWhere Are We Now?\n\nIf the theory holds, we are currently in the middle of the Fourth Turning, which is expected to last until the early 2030s. According to Strauss and Howe, this phase typically brings major conflicts (economic, political, or military), followed by the emergence of a new social order.\n\nThe book is often cited in discussions about current events, including economic instability, political division, and global tensions, suggesting that we are in the midst of a defining moment in American history.\n\nIn past Fourth Turnings, financial systems have been restructured like the gold standard changes in the 1930s and 1970s. Bitcoin could be a part of the next monetary reset.\n\nBitcoins role\n\nBitcoin aligns with the historical patterns of the Fourth Turning challenging the old system, thriving during economic chaos, and potentially becoming part of the new order. Whether it emerges as the “\nnew gold or something bigger depends on how this Turning plays out.\n\nDo you see Bitcoin as a hedge for personal wealth during this crisis, or as something even bigger—like a foundation for a new financial system?",

I would like to buy a whole coin, but my budget is around 55k EUR (60k USD), given the period is it possible that Bitcoin can reach that low? If so, is this similar to a 2022 crash situation in any way?\n\n  \n2. Given my intention to buy once and just kind of leave it there, is Kraken or Coinbase better? Can I just buy pro for either to get lower fees for the big transaction and never renew it?\n\n  \nThanks!",

Ex: say you first bought BTC back when it was 20k and then DCA'd all the way until now. It's now hovering at 80k, and you make a small sale worth $200. Well then instead of being a tiny gain/loss, if you use fifo, that means the sale uses a cost basis of 20k... meaning that after maths, that translates into a capital *gain* close to the *full* $200!! Now repeat for every small sale and well...damn.\n\nHowever, if we're now doing wallet based accounting, once you move the money to a new wallet, the cost basis resets so if you had done the same from a new wallet, the gain/loss on that sale would have been small.\n\nSo... what this tells me is that if you plan on doing something like options trading (where you frequently buy/sell) or use a DEX to fund other wallets, then do it from a wallet that has a very small (or zero) crypto balance.\n\nSo... wallet based cost basis may actually be a good thing, since with FIFO, the original cost basis doesn't follow you around. \n\nUnless i'm misunderstanding how this wallet based cost basis works.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I have a € (Euro) emergency fund, and now I thought it would be a psychological good idea to build a (from my normal long time btc savings seperated) Bitcoin hobby/fun fund. A fund that just exist for the purpose of making me feel good, that I know that I always have a fund that I could use for anything I like if I wanted (but probably wont), like buying a gaming console or other stuff, while still having the potential to grow in value in the time I dont use it.\n\nBut here is the important part, a normal bitcoin wallet is not the best choice for such a \"Use it when I feel to\"-fund, because having to calculate taxes and send it to the financial institution of my country every time is a pain in the ass, not worth it for random hobby purchases. \n\nThe good thing is, in my country, brokers/exchanges that operate from within my country are required to automate the tax process, they automatically calculate the taxes for you and even send the money you owe the goverment to the goverment. So every time you close a position with profit, the taxes automatically get drawn away from it and only the money you can keep stays in your account. \n\nSo I thought I d just make a small 1000€ Btc fun/hobby fund on such an broker/exchange. What do you think about this idea? Its mainly for psychological reasons.",

It’s been a journey, and this Saturday, we’ll be celebrating 44 women graduating from our [Bitcoin for Beginners](https://bitfiasi.org/bitcoin-for-beginners/) program, a big leap from the 16 in our first cohort! \n\nThe response has been incredible. More people are already reaching out to be part of the next cohort, and it’s clear that the interest in Bitcoin among women in Ghana is growing fast.\n\nBeyond the classes, I’ve also managed to take Bitcoin education to 4 senior high schools, running workshops to introduce students (especially young women) to Bitcoin, financial sovereignty, and digital assets. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and it’s exciting to see more women eager to explore Bitcoin for savings, business, and long-term financial security.\n\n[This Saturday’s event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bitcoin-the-future-of-money-what-you-need-to-know-tickets-1271382020849) will have over 100 people attending, and it’s already creating a buzz among those looking to start their Bitcoin journey.\n\nI’d love to hear from this community, how do you think I can make this even better and also get support to reach a wider audience? Any ideas on improving outreach, structuring classes, or engaging more women in Bitcoin?\n\nWould appreciate any advice, and happy to share more about what’s working so far!\n\n",

I’ve been in crypto since last bull run and have been aware of auto buys but it just never really occurred to me to do it myself. I guess I just thought I wouldn’t auto buy enough for it to make a difference. But I figure now that something is better than nothing. I plan to continue to let it buy for the foreseeable future (next couple years). Only thing that bothers me is that CB charges a dollar every purchase so my $8 turns into $7 and I pay Coinbase $365 per year to do this. CB advertises Coinbase One and says I can avoid fees by signing up, however, it’s $30/month which is the same as I’m paying anyway without the subscription. I guess I’m just trying to find a better way to purchase daily. I like using CB because it takes it directly from my bank and I don’t have to fund the account. I want to make it as easy and mindless for myself as possible, which is also why I’m doing small daily buys rather than larger weekly or monthly buys. I won’t miss the $8 everyday but it will bother me to see $56/week or $240/month to come out. I’m also curious what your guys’ thoughts are on such small purchases, is it even worth it? I mean, at this rate it would take me decades to reach a whole coin, granted the price never went up. I’m involved in crypto in a lot of other ways and have a substantial portfolio relative to my income, just no btc at the moment. Hoping you guys can suggest better ways I can do what I’m doing and just hype me up on the whole plan in general. Thanks in advance!",

Yes I know, \"Keep stacking, keep doing what you can.\" \n\nPeople are asking this question, at least in my opinion, because they want to dream that they are just in time for complete financial freedom. \n\nOf course BTC will, if all trajectories are true it will definitely make life a little easier. Despite all the scarcity and inflation protection, I think people get caught up with multipliers. I'm guilty of it. The 4k Bitcoin days are long gone, but it gave those who invested a 25x gain, from 4k to 100K. If someone does own 0.1 BTC now that same multiplier would (assuming BTC had a current value of 100K) turn ~10K to 250K. \n\nThis is if Bitcoin is at 2.5mil per coin. For anyone dreaming of complete financial freedom, say randomly a 5mil goal, the price of 1 BTC would need to go up 500x to 50mil. \n\nSo my question again, those who own ~0.1 BTC, are they actually early enough for financial freedom?

Bitcoin crashed down to as low as the 3,000's (USD), prices of goods soared such as eggs and toilet paper, supply and demand was absolutely wild in those times. Housing prices have essentially doubled since then.\n\nHow do you expect bitcoin to keep up with that long-term? Eggs are $8 a dozen now. My house that I bought in 2019 for $160k is now worth over $300. But the sad thing about bitcoin is that every 4 years, it is destined to crash back down again. It crashed from 19k in 2017, it crashed from 69k in 2021, and 2025 is the fourth year of the so-called \"cycle\" so guess what it's going to do again this year?\n\nHow many more cycles until it crashes from 7 figures? Are any of you even paying attention? And what about the suckers who bought bitcoin BEFORE it crashed? Those greater fools stuck holding the bag from weeks before COVID hit probably bought in around $10k, maybe even higher than that, if we're being honest. How do you expect bitcoin to hedge against inflation when it's only between 700% to 2,000% higher than it was 5 years ago either right before or right after the market was pulverized by COVID?\n\nInflation is supposed to be around 2% PER YEAR! That compounds over the years, you know. So just you wait and see. You'll find out the hard way that in just TEN YEARS that 2% inflation will amount to nearly 22% inflation. Try looking me in the eyes with a straight face a decade from now and tell me that bitcoin won't crash from the high 6, or even 7 figures. We'll see how smug you all are then, eh? Good riddance.",

    "selftext": "A wallet provider, Braavos, has introduced a new feature designed to simplify cryptocurrency payments by allowing users to make instant transactions using STRK (with other tokens to come, like stablecoins) at any vendor that accepts Lightning Network payments. This feature integrates directly into the Braavos app, enabling users to scan a QR code and complete payments within seconds, without the need for additional setup or separate accounts.\n\n# The Significance of Lightning Network Payments\n\nBitcoin was originally envisioned as a decentralized digital currency for everyday transactions. However, due to network congestion and transaction fees, Bitcoin has primarily been used for long-term holding rather than daily spending. The Lightning Network was developed as a second-layer solution to address these issues by enabling fast and cost-effective transactions. However, traditional Lightning Network usage often requires users to set up accounts, manage liquidity, and navigate technical challenges.\n\nBraavos aims to remove these barriers by offering a seamless payment experience, and bring in a new existing user base to the Bitcoin ecosystem. With its new feature, users can make Lightning Network transactions with the ease of a conventional payment app.\n\n# How Braavos’ Lightning Network Feature Works\n\nThe feature utilizes the Atomiq bridge, a non-custodial solution that facilitates Starknet-to-Lightning conversions. The payment process consists of four simple steps:\n\n1. **Scan the QR Code** – Users scan the Lightning Network QR code at checkout using the Braavos wallet.\n2. **Choose Your Token** – Payments can be made with STRK, eliminating the need to hold Bitcoin.\n3. **Instant Conversion** – The Atomiq bridge automatically converts STRK to Bitcoin and processes the transaction.\n4. **Transaction Completion** – The vendor receives the payment instantly, similar to any other Lightning transaction.\n\n# Key Differences from Other Lightning Payment Solutions\n\nWhile Lightning Network payments have existed for some time, Braavos offers a more integrated and user-friendly approach. Key advantages include:\n\n* **No Lightning Wallet Setup** – Unlike many Lightning payment solutions that require separate Lightning wallets, Braavos handles this process automatically.\n* **No Need for Liquidity Management** – Users do not need to pre-fund or manage channels, as liquidity is available on demand.\n* **Support for Multiple Assets** – Unlike traditional Lightning wallets that require Bitcoin, Braavos enables payments using STRK, with other tokens to follow.\n* **Low Fees & Fast Transactions** – Transactions are completed in seconds with minimal fees, facilitated by the Atomiq bridge.\n\n# Transaction Fees\n\nA small fee is included with each transaction to cover the costs associated with:\n\n* Asset conversion via the Atomiq bridge.\n* Ongoing maintenance and support to ensure a smooth user experience.\n\nDespite these fees, Braavos’ solution remains a cost-effective option for Lightning Network payments.\n\n# Availability\n\nThe [Braavos](https://braavos.app/introducing-lightning-network-payments-via-braavos-fast-easy-and-cost-effective/) Lightning Network payment feature is available now. Users can utilize it for various transactions, including retail purchases, service payments, and online shopping, wherever Lightning Network payments are accepted.",

Is Coldcard the better option? What would you do?\n\nI’d like to add that a couple of buddies of mine had the original Jade. One of them dropped it on their tile floor, and it ended up breaking.

    "selftext": "# Celebrating the Evolution of Bitcoin: From an Idea to a Global Financial Force\n\nBitcoin has come a long way since its inception in 2009. What started as an experimental digital currency, outlined in Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper, has evolved into a revolutionary financial asset that challenges traditional banking, reshapes global economies, and empowers individuals with financial sovereignty.\n\nIn its early days, Bitcoin was misunderstood, dismissed, and often linked to niche internet communities. Its first real-world transaction—10,000 BTC for two pizzas in 2010—seemed insignificant at the time but now stands as a historic milestone. Bitcoin’s value has since skyrocketed, proving that decentralized finance is not only viable but essential in an era of economic uncertainty.\n\nOver time, Bitcoin has weathered volatility, regulatory challenges, and skepticism from the financial elite. It has transformed from a peer-to-peer digital cash system into a store of value, often referred to as \"digital gold.\" Major corporations, institutional investors, and even governments now recognize Bitcoin’s potential, integrating it into portfolios and national economies.\n\nBitcoin’s impact extends beyond wealth accumulation. It provides financial inclusion to millions in countries with unstable currencies. It enables borderless transactions, fights inflation, and ensures transparency in a system controlled by code rather than central authorities. The Lightning Network has further expanded Bitcoin’s usability, making instant transactions possible while reducing costs.",
