Especially when its FINALLY being embraced by wall street. This potential ride could be INSANE, its not a guarantee, the SEC could reject it and it could all go to hell, its a possibility, but i'm gambling that they are going to approve it and the price appreciation will be life changing. But I would still never sell. I'm just going to borrow against the value of my portfolio.  Let's say bitcoin goes to 100k, if I sell I get a massive tax bill plus I lose control of the underlying SCARCE asset that generated that very return. I would rather borrow fiat dollars at a interest rate and let the bank take on the risk but  maintain control of the asset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRICH people borrow against their assets they don't sell them.

    "selftext": "A few hours ago Antonopoulos posted a [tweet](https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/432635743794507777) regarding the sentiments that a few members of the Dogecoin community have towards Bitcoin. Ordinarily I would defend the Dogecoin community as being a generally happy and jovial bunch, even if quite silly on more than occasion. People are having a good time, and in the past few weeks I've come to appreciate the unique blend of kitch, investment, child-like wonder, and generosity.\n\nHowever, recently I've noticed the same shift Antonopoulos has. Whereas before the Dogecoin community was open to outsiders and new ideas we seemed to have lost our way, instead reveling in our own success and becoming quite arrogant. Perhaps we are becoming resentful of others who do not seem to understand us?\n\nI suppose the new attitude is that [we don't need Bitcoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x54xi/embracing_the_bitcoin_community/). (I posted that a few days ago. Not a single reponse or vote.) The same day [I posted some ideas](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x2mp2/making_a_userfriendly_dogecoin_experience/) on making a more user-friendly Dogecoin experience. 69 vote score and 50 comments. Now at least we can see how much r/dogecoin thinks of itself and no other.\n\nSo after a few days of thinking about this I posted, \"[Why does the Bitcoin Center welcome Dogecoin but /r/bitcoin does not? (Rant)\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1xekel/why_does_the_bitcoin_center_welcome_dogecoin_but/) in order to open a dialogue about how an increasing number of Dogers seem to feel about Bitcoin. Again, no response (as of this writing). No upvotes or downvotes. If we think Bitcoin is so bad for whatever reason, why are we beginning to act worse than we think they are?\n\nI would rather post something like this in r/bitcoin and at least get some feedback and constructive criticism than be ignored in r/dogecoin because they can't be bothered to think about anything serious for a moment that doesn't involve charity. I'm almost inclined to suggest a joint charity drive with Bitcoin to promote solidarity but I already know what kind of response that would get in the Dogecoin community. We now seem to have *charity for vanity*, and it's not a good thing. How can rational thought possibly compete against [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1xcnpy/how_to_draw_a_doge/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x4xiz/test_gif_please_ignore/) in such a community?\n\nI was strangely attracted to r/dogecoin at first, when exploring the trivial and making money at the same time was entertaining. But no more. I'm going to excuse myself from it, sell my ~22MM shares, consider putting half into [Karmacoin](http://karmacoin.info/) as a more reasonable, more future-proof alternative with a similar concept (and a dev that doesn't surprise) along with putting half back into BTC as it makes its way up again.\n\nWhen the DOGE price takes a significant hit we seem to pretend that we're in it just for the fun, and downvote others who talk about price. A great many of us are, indeed, and continue to tip like there's no tomorrow. The price begins to climb again the past day or so and I can't count the number of posts exclaiming how great it is and how good they feel. We're even beginning to think that the community's financial resources [can do just about anything](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1xg186/emergency_we_must_fund_2_audience_members_to_wear/). I don't know how corruption and unethical behaviour begins but I'm willing to bet that it begins when this kind of attitude starts cropping up. The choice of the mascot was prophetic, because so many of us [from the mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x6vhr/at_5pm_est_someone_from_4_paws_for_ability/) on down are starting to beg like dogs. A community that encourages begging soon becomes overrun by voluntary homelessness, lethargy, and scum. A jerk that begs whilst smiling in your face and laughing is not good company. I really hope r/dogecoin doesn't reach that point.\n\n(If anyone from r/dogecoin is reading this, I'll still honor the contest I created but I find it really telling that a user with [200 million Dogecoins](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x84j3/i_have_200_million_dogecoins_ask_me_anything/) (around USD$300,000 worth) could [delete a comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x9322/giving_away_200000_doge_to_10_people_that_upload/) after saying he donated 400,000 to the official video contest and I asked if he could donate 200,000 to the winner of mine if it received over 1 million views. Surely there must be a better way to say no?)\n\nLooks like I won't be going to the moon this time. Mom, dad.. I'm coming back home.",

    "selftext": "(I submitted this post yesterday, but I think it got lost amongst the thousands of MT GOX posts in a thread. I think people deserve a chance to see it and decide on what I've presented for themselves. I'm the Blockchain Avenger. I don't like Reddit much, but when I post my findings here I am SheepRoadReloaded2. I'm a forensic bitcoin accountant. When I work for the public good, I use wallet  1AhYNAoMxDPD7bnNvxuSY9FB1CDviEuqzZ)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nI don't think they've just \"found\" them. I think I \"found\" them, so they decided not to steal them. Or it jogged their memory. There are at least 120 wallets, each containing 10,000.000777 BTC.\n\nHere is a typical one:-\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/1LfV1tSt3KNyHpFJnAzrqsLFdeD2EvU1MK\n\nThe 10,000BTC was moved into each wallet in February, then the thief marked them all the same day with a 0,000777BTC payment from a phone wallet:-\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/12Nxd2X12WZeYSjUcbtm5NpS3d81Yh8sKh\n\nI sat on the discovery for a few weeks, then discussed it with a bitcoin forum moderator and posted it a few places. It was ignored.\n\nThen I emailed Kolin Burgess. He's the guy who did the protest outside Gox, then organised a group action.\n\nClick on any of those red arrow \"777\" payments. Who could possibly stash half a billion $US of bitcoins in early february? Satoshi, the Winkelvii, or the Mt GOX owner. T\n\nwo of them looked smug, one looked confused in his driveway, and one was sweating like a shifty-eyed pig.\n\nI think the phone wallet (now empty) was used to record the public keys (wallet addresses). The private keys would have been printed off and stashed in the same order between the pages of a book or something. A private key on its own is useless, and not evidence unless somebody tries to unlock every wallet in the world with it, and gets lucky.\n\nThose malleable transactions, eh?\n\nBollocks! Bitcoins started being stolen in 2011 if you look at the oldest wallets.\n\nI was working on another job, and just checking out big chunks of bitcoin moving about. I always mark suspected stolen bitcoin wallets with a \"666\", or a combo of 3s, 6s or 9s depending on my level of certainty. I kept noticing these 777s in piles of bitcoins and I wondered if I'd done them when I was drunk or something.Seeing my own marking method being used for crime instead of philanthropy pissed me off.\n\nSo I \"666\"ed that wallet. I 666'd it up good, using my 1Ah \"blockchain avenger\" wallet because he was obviously familiar with its work\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/tx/5988729edfc4871c7b5668394b9175f1b15219d3776255287e19e8222df5465a\n\nThe first time on 16 Feb, I didn't put 2 and 2 together to make Gox. I did some more poking about when I finished my paid job on the blockchain, posted a few places, but not here. I don't like Reddit.\n\nMaybe the wallet owner noticed 666's in it and knew the gig was up. \"Oh! Here they all are!\".\n\nLets see if those wallets start having transactions now. We've got that phone owner bang to rights. It can only be a GOX employee\n\nApologies for the long post. Just to remind you of the sums and dates, here is a typical 10,000BTC cashpile again that somebody stashed and marked\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/1LfV1tSt3KNyHpFJnAzrqsLFdeD2EvU1MK\n\nOver a hundred of those \"777\" marked ones alone. He market other wallets with other numbers, but haven't worked out his code.\n\nPlease satisfy yourself that there is half a billion dollars of bitcoins in 120 wallets, moved in, then marked by the same android phone wallet in early february, and base your comments on if its factually correct, or technically flawed. Sometimes you can point at half a billion dollars, and Reddit users talk about your finger. \n\nI'm quite busy at the moment, and don't intend to come back to answer questions or teach people how to use blockchain.info or reverse taint analysis etc\n\nI asked Kolin Burgess to buy me a nice sponge cake if his group get their bitcoins back. If you are a magic the gathering victim and get some or all of your bitcoin back, please make a donation to a charity of your choice\n\nThen put your bitcoin into an address on the blockchain administered by a wallet on your own PC or phone, use localbitcoins.com in future, and think about what happened here today. **The entirety of bitcoin is just YOU and THE BLOCKCHAIN.**\n\n**Be very suspicious of anybody who tries come between the two of you offering a service.** \n\nBitcoins don't exist. They don't \"flow\" through the internet like emails, can't live in cold storage or a vault. They don't even live in a wallet. If I \"send\" you one BTC, my blockchain address has -1 added to it. Yours has +1 added. No bitcoins move. Nothing does.\n\nThey are just an idea. All bitcoin thefts are accountancy tricks in a database called the blockchain. the stolen bitcoins haven't even moved an inch.",

    "selftext": "# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Sticky FAQ\n\nMaybe you're here because you've received a tip on social media, or maybe you've just been hearing a lot recently about Bitcoin and are wondering what the big deal is?  The following videos are a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little bit about its long term potential:\n\n* [Video 1: What Is Bitcoin & Why Should You Care?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSQdhxnvCc)\n* [Video 2: The real value of bitcoin and crypto currency technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVAluSL9SU&index=1&list=FLqnDHJBl3xGTosMjyXc4-0A)\n* [Video 3: Bitcoin Is Independent Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzFOwFXlR48)\n* [Video 4: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4)\n\nFor lots of additional video resources check out the [videos wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/videos) or /r/BitcoinTV .  Peer-reviewed, research papers can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg) and [here](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger).  Developer resources can be found [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-for-developers).  Lots of Bitcoin statistics can be found [here](https://coin.dance/).\n\n## Where can I buy bitcoins?\n\nYou can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank account.  A good list of exchanges sorted by region can be found on the [exchanges wiki here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/exchanges).\n\n**Note:** Bitcoins are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitfinex/btcusd/1hr) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Here are a couple useful sites [[bitkoin.io](http://bitkoin.io/), [preev.com](http://preev.com/btc/usd)] that shows how much various denominations of bitcoin are worth in different currencies. Alternatively you can just Google \"1 bitcoin in (your local currency)\".\n\n## Securing your bitcoins\n\nWith bitcoin you can \"be your own bank\" and personally secure your bitcoins **OR** you can use established companies which have secured wallets where they hold the bitcoins for you and provide insurance.\n\n* If you prefer to let bitcoin banks manage your coins, try [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Circle](https://www.circle.com/).\n\n* If you prefer to \"be your own bank\" and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, there are many software wallet options [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/wallets).  If you prefer easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.bitcointrezor.com/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/), [Case Wallet](https://choosecase.com), or [KeepKey](http://www.keepkey.com/) is recommended.\n\n**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** \n\n2FA requires a second confirmation code to access your account, usually from a text message or app, making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.\n\nGoogle Authenticator | Authy\n--------------------|-----\n[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en)\n[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8)\n\n## Tipping\n\nUse [ChangeTip.com](https://www.changetip.com/) ([/r/changetip](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip)) for tipping people on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr, Google+, GitHub, Slack and more! (you can even use [custom monikers](https://www.changetip.com/tip-amounts) to tailor your tip to the discussion or add a bit of humor).  Read more about ChangeTip at their reddit [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/index).\n\nGo to [/r/FreeBits](https://www.reddit.com/r/freebits) to get a few bits to practice with and then tip them forward.

UK residents can find a comprehensive directory of shops, pubs, websites and other places in the UK that accept bitcoins at [wheretospendbitcoins.co.uk](http://www.wheretospendbitcoins.co.uk).\n\nThere are also lots of charities which accept bitcoin donations, such as [Wikipedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Ways_to_Give#bitcoin), [Red Cross](https://bitpay.com/520663/donate), [Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org/), [United Way](http://www.unitedway.org/content/splash_holiday2014/), [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/) and the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/). You can find a longer list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/suggestions).\n\nAdditional resources can also be found at [TheBitcoinPage.com](http://www.thebitcoinpage.com/)\n\n## Merchant Resources\n\nThere are several benefits to accepting bitcoin as a payment option if you are a merchant;\n\n* 1-3% savings over credit cards or PayPal.\n* No chargebacks (final settlement in 10 minutes as opposed to 3+ months with credit cards / PayPal).\n* Accept business from a global customer base.\n* Increased privacy for your customers.\n* The payment processor can convert 100% of the sale to the currency of your choice for deposit to your account which means there is no need to hold bitcoins and no exposure to price volatility.  Alternatively, you can choose to keep a certain percentage of the sale in bitcoin if you wish to begin accumulating it.  \n\nIf you are interested in accepting bitcoin as a payment method, there are several options available;\n\n* [Bitpay](https://bitpay.com/bitcoin-for-retail)\n* [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/merchants)\n* [Coinify](https://coinify.com/merchants)\n* [Coinkite](https://coinkite.com/faq/terminal)\n* [Snapcard](https://www.snapcard.io)\n* [GoCoin](https://www.gocoin.com/)\n* [BitMerchant](https://github.com/tchoulihan/bitmerchant)\n\n## Can I mine bitcoin?\n\nMining bitcoins can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. \n\nIf you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can run a full node [using this setup guide](https://medium.com/@lopp/how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-full-node-2dd1c09763d3). You can view the global node distribution [here](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/).\n\n## Earning bitcoins\n\nJust like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoins by being paid to do a job.\n\n* [/r/Jobs4Bitcoins](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins)\n* [Coinality job board](https://coinality.com/)\n* [Bitgigs job board](http://bitgigs.com/)\n* [Find Bitcoin Jobs](http://www.findbitcoinjobs.com/)\n\nYou can also earn bitcoins by participating as a market maker to allow users to perform CoinJoin transactions with your bitcoins for a small fee (requires you to already have some bitcoins)\n\n* [JoinMarket](https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket)\n\n## Fundraising\n\nYou can use [Lighthouse](https://www.vinumeris.com/lighthouse) to crowdsource fundraising initiatives with bitcoin. It's similar to Kickstarter, but without intermediaries or exorbitant fees. You can participate in project discussions at [/r/LighthouseProjects](https://www.reddit.com/r/LighthouseProjects), and watch the progress of fundraisers at [lightlist.io](http://lightlist.io/). \n\n## Bitcoin Projects\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/projects) is a **short** list of ongoing projects that might be worth taking a look at if you are interested in current development in the bitcoin space.\n \n## Bitcoin Units\n\nOne Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of ¬£/$/‚Ç¨) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:\n\nUnit | Symbol | Value | Info\n---|:---:|---|---\nmillibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for milli i.e. millilitre (mL) or millimetre (mm)\nmicrobitcoin | ŒºBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for micro i.e microlitre (ŒºL) or micrometre (Œºm)\nbit |bit| 1,000,000 per bitcoin| Colloquial \"slang\" term for microbitcoin\nsatoshi |sat| 100,000,000 per bitcoin| Smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor\n\nFor example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $500 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:\n\n* 0.02 BTC\n* 20 mBTC\n* 20,000 bits\n\nIf you want to use 'bits' exclusively, just remember that there are 100 satoshis in 1 bit, and 1 million bits in one bitcoin. For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).\n\n---\n\n**Still have questions?**  The friendly folks at /r/BitcoinBeginners would be happy to help you out, or stick around for our weekly Mentor Monday thread.

    "selftext": "Nothing ever happens quite how we expect, but I think that the next bubble is virtually assured at this point.  The timing is the only wildcard, along with what the peak will be.  \n  \nWe saw the bottom come in at $150, and the rush of true support flooding in to punctuate the end of the latest bear run.  Now we are in the slow froth and churn that marks the beginning of the next exponential expansion.  \n  \nWall Street is getting fired up, as are funds and banks.  The \"do not sell before\" embargo sticker has been lifted off of bitcoin and our street date has arrived.  The most prominent minds in the world are teeming with possibilities and the bitcoin venture space looks a LOT like the Internet in the early nineties.  \n  \nBasically, we are at a situation where bitcoin is becoming a precious, desirable, and scarce resource...  But people just haven't realized it yet.  \n  \n----------  \n  \nAnd when they do, it won't be a slow and steady March upward.  It will be a monumental movement that will leave our heads spinning.  One day we will go from $300 to $350, and we'll all be smiling and patting ourselves on the backs.  üòÑ\n  \nThen in a week we'll be at $500, and positive news stories will start to flow.  The public will take notice.  \n  \nThen $800.  \n  \n$900.  \n  \nThen $1300.  New all time high.  Now comes the euphoria and panic.  üòÆ\n  \n$2000, $4000.... Wonder, new paradigms...  How high can it go?  OK...  It's crashing, finally...  Down to...  Whoops.  Nope.   \n  \nNew money flows in, and people begin to believe in bitcoin in earnest and there is a rush to own an asset that is rising every single day....  $5000, $7000.  üò∞\n  \nThose of us who own at these levels will be freaking the fuck out.  Should we sell?  Is it going all the way up?  I mean, the news is abuzz about bitcoin.   Everyone's talking about it.  All your relatives that you've been 'preaching' to for a year now are freaking out and asking how they can buy some 'bits' as fast as possible, while bits are still less than a cent apiece.  \n  \nMany panic and sell on the way up...  And truthfully I don't know how high the next bubble can take bitcoin...  At $10k the \"market cap\"  will be about $150 billion...  That's a lot, but about the valuation of a single large company.  At this point people will be screaming about how this is a financial revolution.  We may get all the way to $28k before the major correction, but you bet your ass if we get that high people will be imagining that we are going all the way up, to a million dollars per \"coin\" asap.  \n  \nPerhaps a financial crisis will hasten the rise.  Perhaps not.  \n  \n-------------  \n  \nI know this, bitcoin hasn't moved in a stable predictable rise yet, and there's no reason to think it will start now.  It has moved in exponential bursts, each preceded by a pessimistic retraction period.  \n  \nThis will be the sixth such time we have done so, and we are growing increasingly efficient at it.  \n  \nI want you to go ahead and start thinking about what you will do, and how you will act when the 'unthinkable' occurs.  Because the unthinkable is always right around the corner.  \n  \nThe rest of our lifetimes will be filled with 'unthinkable' moments.   The next bitcoin bubble (due before the end of 2016) will be one more such incident.  üí•\n  \nMainly I want you to think about the world events that will have to happen to make this true... And then what would have to happen to cause a major correction in the price from $25k per bitcoin back down to $2000 per.  \n  \nWisdom is recognizing that history repeats itself, and there's nothing new under the sun.  \n  \nWealth is the end result of taking a calculated risk based off your acquired wisdom.

Comprehensive post after I lawyer up.\n\nEdit: Due to some angry Gox depositors, I've been advised to disclose that Karpeles was overstating the fact that he had \"lined up\" investors.  The truth is, in a move of desperation, Mark asked several investors for a bailout, all of which seemed to have immediately notified the authorities once they learned the extent of the fraud, negligence or incompetence at Mt. Gox. \n\nThat is to say, my leak did NOT cost depositors their investments.  There was no chance of a bailout.  Please direct your anger at Mt. Gox, and please do not blame me for your losses.  Even if you disagree with my reporting, there was nothing to gain by continuing to cover this up, but much prolonged agony for Bitcoin and perhaps additional damage for new depositors. \n\nThank you for your support and understanding. \n\nUPDATE: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z2aht/twobit_idiot_the_mt_gox_europe_business_plan/\n\nUPDATE AND EXCLUSIVE: http://two-bit-idiot.tumblr.com/post/77988833128/the-final-goxing\n\nreddit thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z2fzp/twobit_idiot_exclusive_the_final_goxing/",

There are statements like these:\n\n  \n1.\n\n\"Bitcoin may not necessarily be the solution, but blockchain is brilliant.\"\n\nSo, he prefers data being centrally entered into a decentralized database? Then why not just run a regular database on AWS?\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\"The inventor of Bitcoin surely wouldn't have wanted warehouses full of ASICs consuming more electricity than some major cities.\"\n\nBut at the same time, he ignores that Bitcoin mining can also have positive aspects:\n\nCoinDesk article: [https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/06/bitcoin-mining-is-good-for-the-energy-grid-and-good-for-the-environment/](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/06/bitcoin-mining-is-good-for-the-energy-grid-and-good-for-the-environment/)\n\n\n\n3.\n\nOr consider the following statement:\n\n\"The prices of graphics cards are so high because of Bitcoin miners.\"\n\nBut he ignores the fact that graphics cards are not used for Bitcoin mining...\n\nFor example, if you engage in graphics card mining with NiceHash, you mine some random altcoin and get paid in Bitcoin through NiceHash. But just because you're paid in Bitcoin for your computing power doesn't mean you're engaged in Bitcoin mining.\n\n\n\nHere's the link that likely proves Linus hasn't really spent 10 minutes delving into Bitcoin, why bother when bLoCkChain is supposedly better...\n\nYouTube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ1JE43L9mI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ1JE43L9mI)\n\n\n\n**I would like to see a debate between Linus and Michael Saylor. Linus' arguments would be rendered useless within 10 minutes, as they would be refuted by facts.**\n\n",

Thru sleepless nights of countless research, hark work, luck, thousands of trades, motivation from the subs, Adderall, consistent DCA, and a bit more luck, I was able to turn a paltry $1.18 into a current respectable $20,000. \n\nThe journey wasn't easy and was by no means all my doing. The blessing of the ETF approval definitely deserves alot of credit, as it brought not only a ton of institutional money, but has made it more credible to former doubtful investors of its legitimacy, including myself (unless you're a Buttcoiner). \n\nIt's also important to note that Bitcoin wasn't the sole catalyst for the increase. While Bitcoin is the most stable and trustworthy, the several altcoins I've invested in yielded far greater profits, albeit took far greater losses on the downside. My plan for DCAing out on the alts during 25%+ increases and putting profits in Bitcoin has been working tremendously, and I only look forward to nothing but great things in all our futures. \n\nP.S. I'm aware of self custody and Coinbase. I plan on getting a hard wallet now that I've hit the 20k milestone. \n\n\nTldr; Bitcoin is gonna change your life.",

    "selftext": "Ethereum recently had an apparently mostly-\"successful\" hardfork, which demonstrates the extreme danger of not having an economy that is sufficiently backed by full nodes. 99% of ETH owners used EWallets, so miners + a small handful of \"major players\" were able to completely change the currency, even despite significant objection within the Ethereum community. It's possible to argue that the hardfork was itself good in some ways, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. A hardfork can change *anything* about a currency, and this incident showed how even things that might be considered unthinkable at one point in time (confiscating and redistributing coins) can eventually be justified and pushed through. In hardforks, everything that makes Bitcoin special could easily be destroyed. Bitcoin's *largest advantage* over fiat currency is its large degree of immunity from human tampering -- it's an emotionless, absolutely fair, incorruptible judge --, which hardforks by their very nature subvert. It is probably the case that Bitcoin must very rarely undergo hardforks in order to efficiently evolve, but they must be *extremely difficult*. If the rules of Bitcoin are easy to change, then Bitcoin doesn't really have any solid rules, and then what's Bitcoin's value?\n\nThankfully, this sort of hardfork probably couldn't happen in today's Bitcoin because a sufficient chunk of the economy is backed by full nodes. If miners + the top five exchanges tried to do a hardfork, there would be a clear and automatic split in the currency between these people and ~everyone else, since full nodes will never follow a hardfork, and enough of \"everyone else\" is running full nodes. I don't think that 5-10 exchanges would have enough economic strength to have a good chance of outweighing everyone else running a full node and pushing through a hardfork. In today's Bitcoin, many independent merchants and users run full nodes, and they all contribute to Bitcoin's economic strength.\n\nHowever, there is a disturbing trend away from this sort of robustness. Significantly increasing the max block size would make it more difficult for normal people to run full nodes, of course, but another huge concern is that a lot of businesses are relying on centralized APIs such as BitGo and BitPay to handle Bitcoin payments. For Bitcoin to be undefeatable, we should strive to make running a full node *easier* than any centralized API so that each merchant enforces the rules of Bitcoin independently, securing both themselves and Bitcoin as a whole.\n\nRelated:  \nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node#Economic_strength  \nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/validation",

They believe we should lobby it, we should cozy up to regulations, we should co-operate and educate government. They believe government is not inherently bad or good and that we ought to make it better.\n\nToday I'm here to say that you should wake up from this dream. Government is here not to protect you, it's here to keep you a slave, unaware of one's own bondage. They take not only your money in the form of taxes, they take time out of your lifetime by conscripting you to be part-time accountants, they take your freedom by forcing you to obey laws you don't believe in, they take your aspirations and dreams by regulating and licencing the shit out of every move you make, they take your dignity by throwing you a useless bone in the form of voting, as if it can actually change things. Most important of all, they deprive you of your most important asset: your own ability to think clearly about the way things are. It can do all that, because it controls money and is able to finance the force it has. Those things it does to you cannot be done at no price.\n\nThat's why government hates Bitcoin to the core. It hates it with all the mighty of its dark sociopathic soul. It will never tell you that in the face. And oh, there will be a fight, because it doesn't want to die. The time has come to pick sides. I can't blame people who don't understand what's going on - those who are dependent on the system and know nothing about Bitcoin. But you, who knows how Bitcoin works and why it was invented, you don't have to be a slave. You don't owe anyone anything, just like nobody owes you. And because some people think you do owe them, there will be a fight. And they are going to lose. The choice is yours, however, how soon they lose and how many more lives they take.",

Some older people still refer to the internet as the world wide web because thats what everyone called it in the 90s.\n\nRight now we have this luxury of refering to whole bitcoins but that wont last forever. Soon one bitcoin will be worth so much the only way to effectively refer to amounts of bitcoin will be using sats. Sats just makes so much more sense especially when one bitcoin is above $100k.\n\nOnce sats become the main currency term used bitcoin or bitcoins will no longer be used when talking about the currency. Bitcoin will be the name of the network and sats will be the currency everyone owns and uses.\n\nYou will ask a kid in 2035 if they have bitcoin and they will say I dont have bitcoin I have sats. Looking back there will have been this tiny initial 15 year window where we all called the bitcoin currency \"bitcoins\" but after that initial window for the rest of bitcoins existence the bitcoin currency will be called sats by everyone on earth.\n\nIn 2035 if you say you own bitcoin or you want to pay using bitcoins kids will laugh at you and tell you that you sound old AF. Everyone will save sats, pay with sats, transact with sats, use sats, send sats, and tip sats. The name of the network will be bitcoin but the monetary unit will be known by everyone as sats not \"bitcoins\" and if you try to use the term bitcoins you will be considered ancient and out of touch.\n\nOnce one bitcoin (sorry, 100 million sats) is worth more than $100k im going to stop saying bitcoins and im going to only refer to the monetary unit as sats from that point on.\n\nBitcoin is the name of the network, sats is the name of the money.",

Our view is that if you don't engage regulators early, they will regulate without consulting you...forewarned is forearmed.\n\nSo Ask Us (almost) Anything!\n\nedit: posted earlier thread link\n\nEdit2: post was stickied while I was in dentist chair.  Will start going through the questions.\n\nEdit3: ok, after coming back for 2 more hours of questions, I'm going to watch John Oliver.  There was one outstanding question I will ask Thomas tomorrow.  \n\nEdit4: answered for another hour.  Two items to check with Thomas.

    "selftext": "Thank you for taking the time to click this. Allow me to briefly introduce myself and then I'll get straight to the meat and potatoes of the matter:\n\nI work for a small bookstore iaccepting bitcoin n Austin Texas, and am host to a radio broadcast which focuses on currency, technology and anarchy. As a result, I've had the pleasure of personally getting to know some of the biggest players in the spheres. I've been invited to sit down in interviews alongside guys like Jeffrey Tucker and Kristov Atlas (they cancelled last minute in favor of putting a female face in the mix).\n\nI've persoanlly sat down and interviewed Amir Taaki, and Cody Wilson (not to mention chased down the guy who stole his wallet while in our store... yeah, we caught him. And Cody gave the dude some cash since he was hard up enough to be stealing wallets).\n\nIn short, I've been at the center of one of the bigger activity hubs for Libertarianism, Anarcho Capitalism, Bitcoin, etc.\n\nAnd, I've sat down with Lyn Ulbricht who is Ross Ulbricht's mother, and just a terribly sweet woman overall. If you're not familiar, Ross Ulbricht is being acused by \"government\" of being the man known as Dread Pirate Roberts, the man behind the popular online free market known as The Silk Road.\n\nWe've covered his case at length. And the more I've looked at this thing, the more I realize how increasingly likely it is that he could be acquitted of all charges against him. I've also come to realize that this could be a HUGE precident setting case, and the implications if he's found guilty could be really bad for everyone.\n\nWe're talking future of the internet. Future of freedom of speech. Future of how money laundering charges are handled in the courts. This is a pretty big deal when you examine this more closely.\n\nSo....\n\nLast night we launched an Indiegogo campaign to raise $20k for his legal defense fund. WIth the assistance of the Alliance of Austin Agorists we were able to get Ross' parents to join us live via Skype to discuss the situation. We also had our friend Cody Wilson join us live via Skype as well to talk about the importance of the case. (There should be YouTube video up shortly of the event, and I'll circle back and post it in an edit when that happens). We also had a mail to jail campaign where we filled a good sized box with letters for Ross to help keep his spirits alive and well while he's in a cage.\n\nWe're going to have a variety of perks for this campaign, including but not limited to:\n\nFree Ross T-shirts\n\nButtons\n\nNecklaces\n\nRaspberry Pi privacy browsing bundle known as Onion Pi\n\nAnd last but not least: A Replicator 2.0 Makerbot 3d printer, signed by Cody Wilson himself!\n\nWe managed to raise almost $2k last night! For some reason we're having a little technical troubles getting the website to accept the next donation we have to put towards it but we'll get that worked out soon enough.\n\nBut now we NEED your help!\n\nWith your support we plan to not only raise the funds neccessary to prove his innocenece on all charges, and set him free. But to go the one further and make him a hero and symbol of free markets everywhere!\n\nPlease check out the Free Ross website at:\n\nwww.FreeRoss.org\n\nand make whatever size contribution (and score some cool stuff in the process) that you can by going here:\n\nhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/free-ross-free-the-market-a-legal-defense-fundraiser-for-ross-ulbricht\n\nAlso... one final personal little thing. The guy that put this together is one of my best friends. He has selflessly put this project together and is pouring himself into it. This is in spite of his fathers battle with cancer, and a laundry list of other shit that's on his plate... a list so long if you saw it, you'd feel compelled to put together an Indiegogo campaing for him. He truely is one of the most unsung heros of freedom that I can think of.\n\nHe is all chips in on this and so as you can imagine there's some emotional stock riding on it for him.\n\nBut he's not just one of my best friends. He's also my boss. And Co-host. And Landlord. And soon to be roommate.\n\nSo... as you can imagine. If he's not happy, then pretty much everyone of relevance in my life is pissed off. And that shit just sucks.\n\nSo if for whatever reason you don't do it for Ross and his family. If you don't do it for the markets and to give a huge finger to government. If you don't do it because your conscious compells you. Do it for him, and fucks sake do it for me!\n\nIn all seriousness though...\n\nThank you in advance for your contribution. Thank you for spreading the word everywhere you can think of about this campaign. Thank you for sacraficing some small part of yourself for this cause. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nAnd remember, the Silk Road played a HUGE element in why Bitcoin is where it is today much the same way the porn industry playe da huge roll in the internet gaining the popularity it did back in the day.\n\n\nEdit:  A number of people have asked for detailed reasons we think he'll be acquitted on various charges.  We went into at length on our 5-28 epsiode of our show which you can listen to hear.  (at present it's just a lot of shit to hash out via the keyboard and a hell of a lot easier to just post a link to the dialog)\n\nCheck out the 5-28 episode in the archives links on the right.  There's also an episode where we intrerview Lyn Ulbricht somewhere down on the front page as well if you want to check that out as well.  [www.TheCryptoShow.com](http://thecryptoshow.com/)\n",

I attempted to do that at least 10 times, but it simply says \"please wait...\" for over 2 hours.\n\nNext, I sent 3 different support tickets asking for help on this topic, but it has been 4 days already with no response at all.\n\nI have about 60 BTC on this account, worth around $25,000 at this time.\n\nIn conclusion, Coinbase is not to be trusted and has most likely experienced a major hack.\n\nAttached is proof on my coinbase account: http://imgur.com/AK8lCgF\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUPDATE 05/26 6:30PM EST: someone else just posted about this.

The survivors are grouping together and are creating fortresses all around the world as protection against these machines.\n\n* In 2027, the biggest human military group manages to take over one of Bitcoins major military research facilities.\n\n* In 2028, they've managed to figure out that one of the facilities allows for the Time Travel of micro-information: sending small digital data back into time through self-generated worm-holes.\n\n\nThis is not a test.

    "selftext": "We have been dating over three years. I met her in Uni when I did a semester in Scotland. Some people search a lifetime to find someone like her. Our paths collided at the exact right moment for us both and we quickly became inseparable. Truth be told its a cosmic anomaly that I landed a girl like her. I am gangly and goofy; a real nerd. She is a beauty with a swimmer's body. But I digress.\n\n I have never had a ton of money. But I was VERY early to BTC and accumulated almost 3 coins by the time we met. My first purchase was at $909, so it was a lot easier to stack back then. \n\nDoes she understand BTC? Not really. She barely understands money at all TBH. She looks at it as a hobby of mine. I see it as the keys to my (our?) financial future. \n\nSo COVID comes along and totally wrecks her career (she is in tourism) and my income is down as well. We are borderline struggling financially but I was still DCA monthly. Not as much as I before, but still working my way towards my goal of 4 BTC. With prices at $48k, my $500 DCA wasn't much but it was steps in the right direction.\n\nHere is where she doesn't understand money. With this economic uncertainty, and prices going up (HELLO INFLATION!), she wants to save CASH to make her feel more secure. She wants $$ in the bank. I have shown her websites, papers, and so much data about how BTC is deflationary and where we need to be positioned. She tunes me  out, and if I press the issue it turns into a verbal row and she ends up skwawking at me and disappearing. Believe me if she doesn't want to be found, she won't be. \n\nI had to make a decision. Do I want 4.0 and no GF, or 3.5 and the love of my life? After a few days she came back but she was acting very strange. She did sleep in the bed with me, which I didn't expect. I watched her sleep. I snuggled up behind her and nuzzled her slender neck, admiring her smooth skin in the moonlight. She pulled away from me. \n\nI turned on the light. It was time to clear the air. \"I have decided to not buy any more BTC until we are financially more stable. I am sorry I didn't respect your wishes. These are decisions we should make together.\"\n\nI immediately knew something was wrong. She then gave me the bad news...\n\nShe had taken my Trezor and thrown it in the lake. \n\nI RAGED. I am not violent but damn my fists were clenched in rage. HOW DARE SHE?!?!? I threw things. I literally flipped a table. I am not proud of how I reacted but there were YEARS of my labor in that device. At some point she slipped away.\n\nI heard the safe clank open in the other room. My mother fucking keys are in there! There she stood in the door with the paper holding my 12 words in her mouth. Her eyes were full of tears. \"I am so sorry. Here, you need this\". She had just climbed out of the lake and was dripping wet. The water rolled off of her and onto the paper, leaching the ink off the paper and destroying my only copy of my backup phrase.\n\nYOU BITCH! HOW COULD YOU?!?!?!?!??!??!\n\nDO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH THAT WAS WORTH?\n\nI saw anger flash in her eyes as she lifted herself to her full height (about 15 feet tall). She issued a low guttural growl, bared her teeth and said \"About tree fiddy\".\n\nIt was then I saw her for what she was; a plesiosaur from the Jurassic Period.",

A block size increase (of more than the current consensus of 2Mb) is just a hack, not a solution for the scaling problem. It is a hack even if you make super optimistic assumptions on bandwidth and computing power increase over the years.\n\n- The Bitcoin Core roadmap addresses the scaling problem with the Lightning Network, maybe the best way of integrating off-chain transactions right into the main chain, and adds instant transactions.\n\n- The Lightning Network is open to everyone and there are several teams working on it (not just Blockstream), which goes in line with the open source model that have managed Bitcoin since the very beggining.\n\n- About the RBF drama : 0-conf transactions are insecure NOW and have always been, also they won't work EVER. No matter the amount of hacks you throw into it. The only secure and smart way of having instant transactions with Bitcoin are Payment Channels and the LN.\n\n- The LN network will also allow for privacy enanched transactions (transaction anonimity), something that is currently only possible with some easy to ban/attack HACKS like mixers.\n\nBitcoin is changing the world, mass adoption is happening and the fee market can have some additional pressure added while all the above gets deployed.\n\nAre you in a hurry for a half baked very short term solution ? Then go for some AltBitcoin.\n\nEDIT: Please feel free to comment after down voting :*",

    "selftext": "Okay I asked chat gpt the following and I know it‚Äôs bad at math but I think this looks right:\n\n\nSay I bought $1000 worth of bitcoin when it was worth $.25 a bitcoin then every time I doubled my money I took out $1000 and kept my original $1000 invested in bitcoin then as bitcoin goes up in Price again and again and again each time I get to 2000 I take out 1000 and I‚Äôm left with 1000.How much money would I have now? Given that bitcoin‚Äôs current price is $65,000\n\n\nLet‚Äôs break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Purchase**: \n   - You bought $1,000 worth of Bitcoin when the price was $0.25 per Bitcoin.\n   - Number of Bitcoins you own initially = $1,000 / $0.25 = **4,000 Bitcoins**.\n\n2. **Doubling Strategy**: \n   - Every time your investment doubles, you take out $1,000 but leave $1,000 invested.\n   - For this, we need to track each time the price of Bitcoin doubles, how many Bitcoins you withdraw, and how many you keep invested.\n\nLet‚Äôs walk through the price doubling steps, starting at $0.25 and doubling up to $65,000.\n\n### Step-by-Step Doubling:\n- **$0.25 to $0.50**: \n  - Value of 4,000 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (2,000 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$0.50 to $1.00**: \n  - Value of 2,000 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (1,000 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$1.00 to $2.00**: \n  - Value of 1,000 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (500 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$2.00 to $4.00**: \n  - Value of 500 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (250 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$4.00 to $8.00**: \n  - Value of 250 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (125 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$8.00 to $16.00**: \n  - Value of 125 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (62.5 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$16.00 to $32.00**: \n  - Value of 62.5 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (31.25 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$32.00 to $64.00**: \n  - Value of 31.25 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (15.625 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$64.00 to $128.00**: \n  - Value of 15.625 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (7.8125 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$128.00 to $256.00**: \n  - Value of 7.8125 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (3.90625 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$256.00 to $512.00**: \n  - Value of 3.90625 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (1.953125 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$512.00 to $1,024.00**: \n  - Value of 1.953125 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (0.9765625 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$1,024.00 to $2,048.00**: \n  - Value of 0.9765625 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (0.48828125 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$2,048.00 to $4,096.00**: \n  - Value of 0.48828125 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (0.244140625 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$4,096.00 to $8,192.00**: \n  - Value of 0.244140625 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (0.1220703125 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$8,192.00 to $16,384.00**: \n  - Value of 0.1220703125 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (0.06103515625 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$16,384.00 to $32,768.00**: \n  - Value of 0.06103515625 Bitcoins = $2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000 (0.030517578125 Bitcoins remain).\n  \n- **$32,768.00 to $65,536.00**: \n  - Value of 0.030517578125 Bitcoins = ~$2,000.\n  - You take out $1,000, leaving **0.0152587890625 Bitcoins**.\n\n### Final Calculation:\n- Now, at a Bitcoin price of **$65,000**, your remaining **0.0152587890625 Bitcoins** are worth:\n  - **0.0152587890625 BTC √ó $65,000 = $991.82**.\n\nSo, after taking out $1,000 repeatedly whenever the value doubled, you would now have about **$991.82 worth of Bitcoin** remaining. However, along the way, you would have already withdrawn **$19,000 in total** (since you took out $1,000 each time your investment doubled).\n\n### Total Money:\n- Total withdrawals: **$19,000**.\n- Remaining Bitcoin value: **$991.82**.\n- **Total = $19,991.82**.\n\n\nSo a great outcome but not life changing. \n\n\nHODL",

I bought the marketing hook line and sinker myself.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \nI know, this might be a very controversial take for this subreddit, but these companies' marketing has been pretty damn pervasive.\n\nToo many times on this subreddit I see people recommending these products as something secure, as almost foolproof.\n\nUnfortunately, that's  just their marketing at work, and it's sadly working.  Take ledger for example:I'll copy my comment from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zatcbe/comment/iynjkh1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n>The company has leaked 273k people's data with 0 recourse,Due to shitcoin support, bitcoin was sent instead of shitcoins [source](https://decrypt.co/37651/ledger-exploit-makes-you-spend-bitcoin-instead-of-altcoins).If you use ledger live instead of something like electrum, it phones home to ledger's servers.Which if said servers are down you cannot transact [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/jurv7w/ther_server_could_not_handle_your_request_please/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).It's also closed sourced so who knows what the hell it's doing under the covers.Not to mention it's not airgapped.  \n>  \n>Imo coldcard is much better as a solution.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso to quote MisterRGnome, if you MUST use these devices, do NOT use their bundled in wallet software, use something like electrum, blue, sparrow, ANYTHING else to handle your signing/transacting.\n\nTrezor is similarly bad, maybe slightly less.\n\nthey're open sourced, but [They have been hacked if you have physical access to the wallet](https://www.coolwallet.io/kraken-hacks-trezor-in-15-minutes/).You'd think a company that sells itself on security would you know, revise their hardware to make this impossible, but they haven't!\n\nThere are myriads of issues with so many hardware wallets.\n\ncoldcard comes closest to being good, but they're not without fault either.\n\nTheir recent mk4 comes with NFC support that flies in the face of what their philosophy was. They're appealing to the masses and trying to get your money, making their device less secure in the process.\n\nif you're serious about being safe take a look into something like [Glacier Protocol](https://glacierprotocol.org/).",

However, I'm sure that he will continue to use his Bitcoin hashtags and saying his new platform is \"ledger agnostic\" to try to get the true crypto enthusiastic Bitcoin-ers to rally behind him. \n\nWhat he will come to find out in the near future is that any centralized ledger is always mutable whether it be by the companies' specific intent, a rogue employee or a hacker. \n\nI'd recommend no longer giving up your bitcoins to his company and start ignoring all of his pro-bitcoin statements while he secretly works on his own private databases to maintain the status quo with the only difference being that he will gain control of the equities/stock markets rather than large banks or brokers. \n\nAt this time I think the best alternatives will be Nasdaq using the Open Asset Protocol (colored coins) on top of the Bitcoin network and/or counterparty. I look forward to seeing more news from them as time goes on.",

He was scoffed and laughed at. \n\nI want to echo that sentiment and state: every single household in the world needs to be active in bitcoin. This computer is the first practical hardware device towards that goal. In 5 years now, every single mobile phone produced will have a bitcoin chip linked to the blockchain.\n\nToday on September 22nd 2015, the world stock markets are plunging.

    "selftext": "Bitcoin is not \"crypto\". Bitcoin IS the breakthrough. \"Crypto\" (tokens, alts, all that) are only possible because Bitcoin showed it was possible.\n\nBitcoin is a network, a protocol, and a system of digital money that made one of the biggest breakthroughs in history - the invention of digital scarcity. It allowed a digital thing to be tied to the real world through quantifiable expenditure of energy (PoW). Bitcoin is a public utility that has no owners, no rulers, no backing of any state or corporation, and a conception that can never again be repeated in history.\n\n\"Cryptos\" are \"projects\" that tackle \"use cases\", raise funding, have employees, ceos, board members, foundations, and can easily be censored by a state. 99.99% of crypto is created to enrich the creators, with retail as exit liquidity. All of them will trend to zero against Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is an alternative to central banking/modern monetary policy run by volunteers and can be used by anyone and everyone. It does not discriminate. It is a public good like the internet is for moving and storing information. The Bitcoin network is for moving and storing value.\n\n\"Crypto\" is not much different from fintech companies except they use a slow and expensive database and print their own treasuries at the push of a button. Sure there might be some interesting use cases, but literally all of them can be done without a blockchain.\n\nUnderstanding that Bitcoin is not crypto is just the first step. The deeper you go into that rabbit hole, the more questions you ask, the more you put Bitcoin under a microscope, the more mind-blowing it becomes.\n\nBitcoin is **not** \"crypto\".\n\nEdit: What happened to this sub. Personal attacks? Pretty sad. But what do you expect with 4.4 Million subscribers. Thanks to all the decent commenters that encouraged healthy discourse. The keyboard warriors that are sending ad hominem messages, go nurse your 4 digit \"crypto\" portfolio that's down 80%. HFSP.",

This thief-hacker transaction, which I will remember forever, just taught me last night to not trust any service provider anymore. \n\nhttps://blockchain.info/tx/c81520e658a013332889a2e62d3215ba96bc5264b0806ec72f5933106f65d10d\n\nI created a private key from Bitaddress.org on 2017-08-08 and imported my private key into Blockchain Wallet (Blockchain.info) which provided the SMS, 2nd password, and confirmation by email for its security procedure. \n\nBut last night around 3 am GMT+7, my wallet got stolen. The thief transferred out everything with no access through Blockchain.info wallet at all. So it seems like the thief some how hacked and accessed to my private key which allows him to make a transaction manually with the third-party broadcasting tool.\n\nThese past few months, I never aware of this risk since many tutorials suggest me how to make a paper wallet via Bitaddress.org and just simply link it with Blockchain.info wallet.\n\nI realize it‚Äôs my fault to not create and keep my Bitcoin in a real cold storage. I would like to share this story to be a lesson for our Cryptocurrency community so everyone can be aware and start taking the security issue more serious.\n\nI want to say that I am Thai, many people think this is a lie. For me, I have to admit that the money is gone. I use google transate to communicate with you. My language ability is terrible Do you see the problem? Why the money is gone Because i read less I agree that I think wrong. What makes it safe? And to put money in. Blockchain.info, which is a hot wallet. If this is the case for everyone else, I want to make it. I think that making 387 bitcoin for my fool is not possible. But it is already. I'm a programmer who bought this bitcoin 3-4 years ago, and it's not expensive. At that time, I could spend only 200,000, which is not very difficult to buy.\n\nEdit: This is answer for some reply\n\nStill, people do not believe that I'm really stupid.\n\nYes It's real. And I try to tell you SMS, 2nd password, and confirmation by email for its security procedure.\nWhy I don't get any access log.\n\nThis is my missing 2/3 amount.\nNow I have bought a Ledger nano S. Do you think this is the best way to keep Bitcoin and it will not disappear anymore?\n\nI'm stupid, do not rush to buy hardware wallet before being hacked.\n\n(1) What is happening is real. Fools like me\n(2) I added a transfer because I did not know that already hacked.\n(3) My English friend wrote this message to me, ignoring the Crypto Safe Project, and I bought the hardware wallet.\n(4) I'm trying to find out why I got hacked. And I'm trying to find a way to save the rest.\n(5) I'm still a Bitcoin investor. Although 2 million dollars are gone, I bought it for only 200,000 and I do not want to make Bitcoin look bad. I do not want it to happen to anyone else.\n\nIt reminds me of Edward Snowden Do not trust computer when it connect internet.\nMy $ 1.7 million dollar memoir must be memorable, and I will tell everyone I love. About this lesson.\n\nAddress : 1EENuimoixhyn6k67UgeYo2mFFhRfEYots \n\nMessage :\nThis address belongs to reddit.com/u/gamezxz, today is 10/30/17. \n\nSignature : IExWjk6+Lfn4kJOYAX7vbOr1WfiYF2NkumurUo68FJgyPgACxdXL9CP1pKRzZstUIT5c7MEiq6ynG/qtQCiqqtQ=\n\nNow I thought I'd never get it back again. But at least I would like to know that after this financial route, how to use money laundering. Will there be some way to get it back?\nAfter this, I still have enough money left for my distribution.\nI will continue to live. I'm a very negligent programmer. I've bought a hardware wallet and now I'm thinking of something that Edward Snowden is not comfortable with and vulnerable.",
