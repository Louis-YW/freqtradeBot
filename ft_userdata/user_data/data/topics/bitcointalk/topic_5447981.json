If you are planning to invest in bitcoin and you have been thinking the price is high already, then you are wrong, I believe bitcoin price is still low and this is another great opportunity to invest in bitcoin, if you can HODL for long term then bitcoin price is still going to pump hard in the future, we shouldn’t lose another opportunity this time by not investing in bitcoin, so that you won’t endup regretting later in future why you didn’t invest now, to me bitcoin price is still low but if you are investing, you should be ready to HODL for long period of time.I will be showing the chat which shows bitcoin price history since 2010 to 2022, then you will know bitcoin is still going to pump hard.

      "body": "Some people thought Bitcoin was a joke until it crossed $1000 in 2013, and most people did not believe that Bitcoin was real until it crossed $19,000 in 2017, before many people began to invest.People that think they are late to Bitcoin are those that have not checked the price history or Bitcoin. In the past 14 years, a lot of people have made fortunes from their Bitcoin investments. Making profit in Bitcoin doesn't necessarily mean they must make billions of dollars; perhaps profit is made from investment based on the amount invested. Anybody who invests in Bitcoin in this current period is not yet late to the game because if they buy now and hold for another 10 to 14 years, of course Bitcoin will experience another bull market, and if they hold for that long, they will also make a lot of profit depending on the amount they invest.",

That's a good thing; it means you are famous in your society. Those who think it's too late to invest in Bitcoin should be guided properly that Bitcoin is still low in value and it will rise to higher values in the future. If they have decided to invest in altcoins, that's their choice, but try to guide them to invest in only reputable altcoins such as ETH, BNB, and LTC. You are right Bitcoin price is still meager as it in the future, its price will reach way higher levels. I agree with your statement that this is the time to invest in Bitcoin, and HOLD is for the long term. Bitcoin will pump to way higher levels in the future. In this case, it would be an intelligent choice to HOLD Bitcoin for another decade to earn tremendous profits from your initial investments.",

Go back to a few years ago and we've got the same thoughts and even I when I was already holding a few bits/sats, I've thought that it was too late for me. But little did I know, I was still one of the earliest folks to come in here and bought mine and never was a wrong decision.",

      "body": "What should matter if you are thinking of entering crypto investment is your overall state; no matter how low the market price be, if you are not ready to endure market price changes and losses, you won't be ready at any price point. Make an entry once you are okay with the market behavior and once you know to yourself that you can ignore and avoid selling if things do not go according to your expectations, in an instant.So basically, there is really no 'best entry point' in this industry.Quote from: Ndabagi01 on April 07, 2023, 09:46:26 PMThe price of bitcoin has risen significantly since its inception ten years ago.

This is where problem arise often; persuading people to invest because of the long term expectation and not considering the short term price movement. Its market price is simply below 50% of its ATH, and this should also be an enough caution that things are just uncertain in this industry.",

The bitter truth is that majority of us think that sweet mouthing without undoubted evidence to buttress their claim is enough to convince people into their own idea. This Bitcoin prices prediction is not second to accurate and that's why it's called predictions mostly driven by speculation.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is one of those cryptocurrencies that are worthy of lining your wallets just because of the positive uptrend of its value, so no matter how high or low the current price is it would still be safe to assume that bitcoin would still be profitable. Although still, this shouldn't be taken as a postulate as if this is what's going to happen every time. There are major risks involved with investing your money. It's not always rainbows and butterflies. And although I think you are well-meaning, the basis for your argument is weak and could be debunked by anyone with half a brain to dissect it in front of you.

It's a good thing if let the risk befall them, so that makes your friends will learn from their mistakes. And, It's a bad thing also if you give investment advice to your friend, If the price drop and dumping, your friend will blame you or more extremely, they will ask for compensation.

The way a person joins the bitcoin market can differ, some invested and was unlucky and others were lucky to gain in bitcoin. As we know, humans get encouraged by profits, those who profited from bitcoin after investing would continue staying in the market even if it gets red, while their counterparts who lost money wouldn't like to stick in the market.

I also believe that in the future the price will go up, as I think we all do in this forum, but you make the mistake of thinking that the future is going to be like the past and that is not necessarily the case. In fact, the price predictions for 2022 assumed that and then what happened was a disappointment, because the future often departs from the patterns of the past. The problem is that past price behaviour is one of the few pieces of information we have in the short history of bitcoin to base our predictions on.Quote from: Iranus on April 08, 2023, 02:54:39 AMIn my opinion, when you enter is not as important as how long you stay in the market.
