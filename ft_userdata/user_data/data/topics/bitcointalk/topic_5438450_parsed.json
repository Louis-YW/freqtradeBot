If we want to get the best out of his forum it must be controlled by written or unwritten rules. We are even privileged to have good members that volunteer to enforce these laws, thereby keeping the forum clean. I read in the beginners and help section that you must have thick skin to excel in this forum. Just be patient and adjust to the rules, and you might end up becoming one of the renowned members of the forum. This forum is voluntary which means you can stop visiting if you are uncomfortable with the rules.",

Don't let the door hit you on the way out.maybe it can be considered that the moderator is included in his circus. namely, his alt account goku88 has been banned (we assume some mod did it). forum rules say that it is not allowed to have alt accounts in case of a ban, therefore, here we need one more reaction from the moderator to ban this riskyduck24 account as well.in the end, he himself admitted:Quote from: riskyduck24 on February 07, 2023, 06:40:23 AMi troll ya all i lied.   but not to scam someone like i have been accused. I did it for my own entertainment.",
