      "body": "Do you mean how many Bitcoins to keep them invested generating passive income, or to hold them inside a hardware wallet, using them along the years after retirement, until they finish?Let's consider the second case. It's hard to estimate an amount, because economy is out of control. Prices of goods and services are skyrocketing, while Bitcoin's price is pretty volatile. Talking about current rates, and what I consider to be a comfortable life for a person alone, each Bitcoin would last for about 36 months, so let's say 3 years.For how long does a retired person is likely to live? Another 15 or 20 years? Then I would need 6 pieces of Bitcoin.",

But it's difficult for those people to answer this question who are retiring after 15 or more years. At the time of retirement we are old and need finances to cover our medical bills, pay children higher education and more. I can say I have 15 to 20 more years to work before getting retired and I am not sure what will be price of Bitcoin at that time. But if I am retiring in current year with Bitcoin price of 100k then for me 2 Bitcoin will be good enough to live rest of my life.",

      "body": "I’d say it’s tough to figure out exactly how much you’d need. Bitcoin’s price is all over the place, and there’s a lot that could change in the next decade or two. If I had to guess, I’d want enough to cover at least 10–15 years of decent living. So, maybe around 5–6 BTC? That could change if Bitcoin sees a huge surge or crashes. If I were retiring now, though, I’d probably aim for about 2 BTC, assuming Bitcoin hits 100k by then. But honestly, it’s more about making sure you have enough to be comfortable and not rely on anything else.",

We won't know how much BTC is worth in the next 10 - 30 years maybe the price will be even higher... if we start from now to collect retirement then it will be quite difficult to 1 BTC if only relying on a fixed salary when still working... So my dream is to have more BTC, even 5 BTC is what I want... but I don't know if this will be achieved or not, I will just keep trying to collect it.",

In many parts of the world 1BTC will be good enough for a comfortable retirement now, not to mention how much it can be worth in 10-30 years. In some others you may need to be aiming for at least 3 to consider yourself relatively secure.Higher than 5BTC should be enough anywhere in the world and for anyone retiring in 5+ years.- Jay -",

      "body": "Actually yes 10 btc is unrealistic if it continues to rise, but since I'm terrible at math and don't feel like having fiats anymore, I'd rather consider how much it would take to live off retirement first and make a guesstimate of btc. Let's pick a 20-year period, for example. I took two 10-year periods, the first with a minimum income of 2,500 euros a month (i.e. 300,000 euros) and another of 3,000 euros a month for 10 years as well (360,000 euros). In 20 years, that makes a total of 660,000 euros. This is the minimum income for a single person living in France. In the end, these staggering amounts can be even more so in large cities. So if BTC reaches a million, that's more than enough, although you still need to be able to resell your satoshis. And that's no easy task.",

However, the economic situation in my country is very bad and due to the rising prices of goods, it may be difficult for me to live on 1 Bitcoin after retirement. However, if one Bitcoin is worth 250k dollars after 10 years, then it should not be a problem.

There can be different reasons - a technical error, force majeure, bad memory, imprisonment, death, and so on. Each lost Bitcoin forever increases the value of those coins that remain in circulation. The price of Bitcoin will grow over time. Even in the current bull period, I expect the price to be $ 200,000. This is quite enough to live comfortably for many years. Of course, I would like to have more coins. After all, a bull period always follows a bear period. However, in my opinion, even one Bitcoin is a great result. I would like to own 1 Bitcoin! And 2 Bitcoins - even better!",

For me, 10 BTC is unrealistic for me considering how much i DCA every month. Though am still young of which it will take me like 30 years to reach my retirement age and i don't know if i will still have a stable job to keep DCAing in the future but let me not be greedy. I can own up to 5 BTC before my retirement age, it can still be more than that but since i will also be using part of my money to invest on real life assets, i may or may not exceed my target of 5 BTC before my retirement. And this will be on the ground of consistent DCA, but if peradventure due to unforeseen circumstances in the future that may cause me to pause my DCAing at some point, i might not own up to that 5 BTC.",

I also have a dream of having atleast 10 Bitcoin. I would not say it is impossible for me to have but I know it will be very challenging because of the price of Bitcoin but I can work towards achieving it even though it takes more than 10 years. The goal is for Bitcoin to help me when I am retired and I would not be retiring anytime soon therefore I still have enough time to continue to accumulate Bitcoin and that is what I will be doing. I can do more jobs to gather more money to keep buying Bitcoin and I can take profits at times to buy more amounts later.",

What I'm thinking about right now is to buy some properties aside from saving Bitcoin then create a for rent establishment business since we can possibly get a passive income with this option.",
