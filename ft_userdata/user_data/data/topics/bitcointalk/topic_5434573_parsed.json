  "content": "yogg was very known trusted user in this forum, he was once a Chipmixer participant, but he choose to leave it and promote his project [ANN] Coldkey™ -- Secure cold storage wallet cards. There's no problem about it until this thread was created My Cold Keys Just Got Swiped! All Halving Sets!!, this user lost all of his coins since yogg was swiped his funds, there's a user said yogg was saved the private keys of at least one specific series of pre-funded coldkeys.What can we learn from this story?1. Don't trust anyone including the most highest trusted user in this forum! 2. Don't buy cold wallet/hardware wallet from second hand user e.g. not from official seller.3. Only buy the popular, open source and secure cold wallet/hardware wallet e.g. trezor.4. If you buy or get collectibles in this forum, just use it as a collection.5. Don't need to worry and afraid if you think the firm/company which created the cold wallet/hardware wallet will save your seeds or private keys because it's generated randomly Seed Generation in Hardware Wallets.Is there anything else I missed? feel free to give any suggestions",

Pretty much like trusting a person/manufacturer to generate a paper wallet for you? Yikes.It is. But the manufacturers pretty much try to sell them like art (imho). There are unloaded and DYI ones which imho they make much more sense, but the loaded ones bear much higher premium, plus the owner will think twice before redeeming the \"paper wallet\" because it decreases its value more than just with those bitcoins it was holding.But yes, at the end of the day, they're just nicer paper wallets made by somebody else.Even more, while 95% of the cases the manufacturers can be trusted (at least until now), the more hands the collectible pass on, the bigger the chance somebody has found a way to unseal it and copy the private key for \"future use\".As minerjones said it very good: Quote from: minerjones on January 13, 2023, 02:53:16 AMOur \"hobby\" of loaded coins is inherently a bad idea and against everything bitcoin stands for!!!",

I consider trust to be flexible: someone who's trusted now may not be trusted tomorrow. With collectible coins you have to trust someone long term, and they could always be building up for an exit scam. As they say: opportunity makes the thief.

There is no perfect solution.That's correct. Imho if one wants to keep that DYI like forever, then he loads it; else (or if unsure) it can just stay unloaded as a DYI \"kit\", no biggie.Of course, a collectible that's not loaded doesn't also hold the bigger and bigger premium over time.

Bitcoin is decentralized, which means we need not to trust anyone but only ourselves since it’s a self generating system. If you think you are not capable to secure your wallet, or not responsible to manage your bitcoin, then it’s better that you should not let other person too to do it for you because you are allowing third party to control your bitcoin. Otherwise, you should force yourself to learn on how to protect your bitcoin because that’s the only way you’ll never be scammed and never end up losing.",

My point is that users need to understand this risk, and if they are willing to take it because they like the product, that's okay, it's their right. But there needs to be full disclosure about the risk when such product is advertised/recommended.
