Any help would be much appreciated.",

      "body": "If the point of your issue is this \"Voltage read fail. Will exit.\" Then possibly your PSU is not giving enough power which is why all 3 hashboard fail except if you only run two hashboard.You almost tried all mod firmware except Braiins OS. Would you mind to try the Braiins firmware and then go to auto-tuning and enable it then set the power limit to 1500w. Let's see if all 3 hashboard will run fine if it did you can increase the power limit to test if the PSU can handle higher power than 1500w.",

Will exit.While the kernel log is incomplete, you perfectly posted the most important part, your 3 hash boards show 65 asic which means nothing is wrong with any of them, the last part which shows voltage read faill is simply trying to tell you that the firmware is not happy with the voltage readings in the EEPROM, this mostly happens due to putting different hash boards from different miners in a single miner, these hashboards come with voltage settings stored in the EEPROM and since there is only a single psu-busbar the feeds all three boards the voltage must be the same across all hash boards.have you just bought the miners in used condition? Have you switched hash boards between them? I'd guess one of the answers is a \"yes\".However, this does happen sometimes when trying to flash a different firmware, the hex file will get corrupted on some of the hashbords and thus the voltage settings are no longer there.Options:1- Get the tool from Zeusbtc.com to extract the hex file from one of the hashboards and then write it on the rest of the hashbaords' EEPROM.2- Use custom firmware that doesn't need/read the voltage settings stored on the EEPROM.Both Vnish and BO+ will work. Quote I would be fine leverage a different mining software if there is something decent out there, but so far I have tried Asic.to, Awesome Miner, NiceHash, and VNISH without much luck.  Aside from Nicehash all those are essentially different VNISH distributions, for all we know, Nicehash could also be a different form of VNISH, try BO+ and see if the Dev pool works fine.If not, you are going to need to figure out WHY does the dev pool fail to connect, router firewall, ISP blocking those IP addresses? you need to spend some time to troubleshoot the issue, and then depending on the distro you use, you can request support, if it's AwesomeMiner, you are going to need to contact Patrick, ASIC.to you are going to need to contact Marc, both are fellow Bitcointlak members and will be willing to help (tho i'd start by posting on their thread rather than PMing first).An alternative for the Zeusbtc.com tool may use something like pickit 3, I know pickit 3 works great on S9s and I was able to read/write the hex file, I don't recall if it works just fine on the 17 series, but a bit of research will be enough to figure out the answer.",
