So it basically stopped out all the leveraged longs and reversed.The fact that it completely engulfed the previous breakdown candle is very bullish.

I speculate like this because apart from seeing resistance and support levels, I also see a little difficulty in passing $30K even though it could be passed by Bitcoin this month if the increase in prices like yesterday continues.",

Bitcoin barely managed to keep $30k for a day almost two months ago, and now we only get negative news connected with Bitcoin so far. I would be happy if we manage to surpass $30k by the end of this summer and start a slow crawl towards gaining several more thousands by the end of the year. Since the beginning of this year, Bitcoin has already gained from $17k to $27k. That is already a huge achievement for Bitcoin this year.",

Its last highest price I remember is $31000. I was thinking bitcoin will make it up to $34000 - $37000 before any big drop again, but it started to drop at $31000 and not going beyond that price. It is very possible that $30000 may be the big resistant price until halving, no nobody yet knows.",

Still we are already on middle of the current weekly candle which means that there’s still a possibility to close low since the price is being dumping on smaller time frame. This weekly candle is very bullish if the current weekly candle will close on this current price since it will confirm that price support at 25K is strong.We might really see 40K on coming months as preparation to the upcoming Bitcoin halving. I believe SEC FUD is not enough to turn the bullish trend into bearish in long time frame.",

I think we will see $30k sooner then most people think and hope $40k by end of the year.  Investors are buying now because they still trust bitcoin and it's not yet the end of the world for these 2 exchanges, the process for this kind of thing is going to be long so no definite decisions/verdict yet. Or this is just a power play by the SEC to tell these 2 exchanges who's the boss. For me though, I would probably wait a little bit more to buy bitcoin because if this legal battle might take long and negativity will affect the market for awhile.",

Binance is going through a serious accusation that has massively affected the market. Bitcoin even went as low as $25,000, which is a huge difference from what the OP is speculating. Thus, I don't think that it'll happen anytime soon, maybe towards the end of the year or at least the summer, if things with Binance don't take a sudden turn for the worse, which will have detrimental effects on the market. It's already quite bad, if you ask me.Hopefully, on the other hand, it's a great opportunity to take advantage of the significantly lower prices.",
