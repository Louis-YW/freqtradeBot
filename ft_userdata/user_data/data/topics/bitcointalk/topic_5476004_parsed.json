I consider it a big deal cause requiring money to enter kinda gatekeeps the platform. Mirror post: https://zora.mirror.xyz/LTBHZHk9zAQiK4n-CxPi_g_PjQ8jjGnArfZ_UJz0ILMPost: http://zora.co/createSince this doesn't cost anything, it may be wise to give it a try, just upload something!",

Certainly right, but if one doesn't have funds, posting something on Zora I recommend bare minimum. Quote from: malcovi2 on November 30, 2023, 06:26:45 AMthey have stated many times that there won't be any airdrop though.Ah! I don't heed that statement. Because, many projects say so to avoid being farmed and eventually launch a token.",

You will not see mirror post anywhere..Oh I didn't mean to mint mirror post, it was linked there to read Zora's latest update, that you can interact with their platform without having ETH, and I speculated that since you don't need any funds, you may want to interact with platform as its free and may make you eligible for airdrop.

It seems like that there may be another metrics to be used once zora will launch its token. more precisely it is possible for participants running zora nodes, if on the other hand without having to perform bridge interactions. Indeed, most people have to make a transaction to detect the wallet address. Or maybe there is another way for Zora to be the wallet chosen for the airdrop, such as connecting to Discord or social media. like aptos airdrop",
