      "body": "First of all, how do you define financial pyramid? 'coz it has various definition such as the context of fraudalent scheme and the other one is a strategy to efficiently make use of your money as you get older. Ofcourse the market price of Bitcoin will depend on the demand since there's nothing to regulate its value unlike other assets. Lower supply means higher demand but that depends if the asset would really be creating a demand to its consumers or users. Not all things which has low supply will automatically have a demand.And if this is about investment pyramid, then Bitcoin would more likely fall to high risk speculative assets simply because of its high rate of market price volatility and its usage across majority of countries.To make it simple, Bitcoin is simply a currency and an investment at one and that is because of its characteristics with regards to its changing market price.",

Demand is what makes the price grow because any token with great feature will not grow the price if there’s no real demand on it. On Bitcoin case, Bitcoin is the only real decentralized project that starts the use of Blockchain. This makes Bitcoin in demand to reach the current price. All your explanation about supply can be easily copied by fork coins or any shitcoins since supply can be customized by the creator.

The same principles work in the traditional stock market, but for some reason no one shouts that this is a pyramid scheme, right.And if you take the banking sector. Any bank. Investors together bring money to a bank, for example, silicon valley bank (all coincidences are random). At one point, panic begins and investors begin to take their money back. As a result, there will not be enough money for everyone, but only for those who first thought to take the money. The last investors are left with nothing. Isn't that like a pyramid?What am I talking about? And besides, structurally, the work of bitcoin is almost no different from traditional financial instruments, and therefore, it is ridiculous for me to hear such accusations against bitcoin that it is a pyramid scheme. If their are have the courage to call bitcoin a pyramid, then let them call the entire stock market a pyramid too.",

      "body": "Let's start with what a financial pyramid is, and here I'm relying on my understanding plus Investopedia. A financial pyramid is a centralized project where those closer to the top can benefit by taking the money of those below them. It relies on promising unrealistic returns, and people who fall for it become the victims. It eventually collapses when no new victims (or not enough new victims) are found.Bitcoin is decentralized, not a company, not recruiting anyone. When the price goes up, all investors benefit equally (if it's a 10% rise, it's a 10% rise for everyone). I don't think that new investors are necessary for the price to go up, even though it generally helps. More demand can be generated within a given number of users, and an increase of users doesn't directly lead to an increased price.'Cryptocurrency' is a very general term, too broad. Some crypto projects may be scams, perhaps even built as financial pyramids. But it doesn't make the whole market or a concept of cryptocurrency a pyramid in any way.",

But that doesn't mean that the amount of money in circulation will make bitcoin prices rise.Indeed, this will certainly affect the price of bitcoin, but it will not have too much of an effect. Because it doesn't mean that a lot of money will have a big effect on the price of bitcoin. Even though a lot of money has been circulated around the world, in every country, it doesn't mean that people who have money will directly buy bitcoins. Because everyone must have what is called the necessities of life, so surely people will prioritize their needs first. Even bitcoin investors, I think, will definitely prioritize their needs first. Moreover, people who don't know bitcoin, are definitely most likely not to buy bitcoin.So it's best not to make a benchmark, that with lots of money circulating in the world, it will make bitcoin prices rise, things like that won't be guaranteed.",

It does need demand continuously to exist and survive, but it doesn’t require a continuous loop of more investment today than yesterday to exist. Most “Bitcoin is a pyramid” theories come from the presumption that without a new investor tomorrow, Bitcoin dies. It doesn’t. It can live without new “victims”.When I said others would continue buying too I was talking about others who already are Bitcoin investors. I meant to say there’ll be demand even if the price doubles because we all get it, the supply is just getting scarcer. Remember I said BTC doesn’t need increasingly higher demand to exist. Because typically, pyramid schemes need more money today than yesterday, more investors today than yesterday etc until they finally can’t do it anymore. To me BTC is just in no way close to the definition of a pyramid..",

Demands outweigh the supply.",
