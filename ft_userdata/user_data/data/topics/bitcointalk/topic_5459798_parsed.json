  "content": "Pepi is the female counterpart to Pepe, behind every successful man is a woman.This token derived from a fair launch during June 30th, 2023 on the Ethereum blockchain.It's a derivative project with the focus on Pepi as a symbol of women's empowerment and women in crypto.The mission is to spread awareness on women in crypto with the theme of Pepi and Pepe's true love as a beacon of harmony coupled with financial and spiritual freedom.As a pure community token, the concept of equality and equity across holders regarding distribution is mitigated by a maximum wallet cap of 1 million tokens (1%).The community controls all aspects of marketing and operations with a close relationship to the anonymous developer.Pepi will push this message of women empowerment in crypto and true love using the power of memes.Currently the option to buy Pepi is on Uniswap in a locked LP, CEX listings are in the pipeline for the future.",
