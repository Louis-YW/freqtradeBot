But you probably haven't heard that Binance has got their office there, and they're the first exchange to receive a license from the government there. Anyway, you'll be required to have some verification though and if that's what you're trying to avoid, might try the suggestions above. And it seems like you like a meet up trade but I don't think that many are going to like that setup if you can do that online, and for their personal reasons like safety although Dubai don't have that much of a problem AFAIK.",

It should have been called like the first step/phase of owning a license there for exchanges. I guess Dubai is just being too careful on this one and wanting to make sure that their citizens will be in Binance's hand so they're taking more security measures and steps for asking more from Binance. And rain seems to be really the best as per checking it, hopefully OP could give some feed back.",

The exchanged mentioned by Bitcoin_Arena are the top ones and I think you should use one of them because you need no kyc in these exchanges and all these exchanges are trust worthy so far. besides these I will also recommend to check non kyc exchanges Thread created by Ratimov and you will find many exchange with fee and minimum withdraw detail etcQuote from: Bitcoinpoly on September 09, 2023, 03:14:53 AMYou can easily do that by swapping Bitcoin to USDT, download Bitget and send your Btc there, then you can swap it into USDT, a friend of mine used it and equally confirmed to me that Bitcoins get delivered to wallet very fast on Bitget unlike other exchanges especially when sending through PayPal.

Please stop spamming the forum using Bitget. I searched your account and the last 20 replies contained the word Bitget in more than 10 different topics.Bitget has opened an office in downtown Dubai and plans to hire employees and explore a way to obtain a license, but there is no news about them obtaining a license, and all that is being talked about are plans and there are no clear confirmations.For citizens in the Emirates, their best option is still what I mentioned above or peer-to-peer trading (I do not recommend it for amounts larger than 10,000 dirhams or 3,000 dollars).https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/20/crypto-exchange-bitget-opens-dubai-office-plans-middle-east-expansion/QuoteBitget said it has started recruiting for the new roles, with several members of staff already hired for middle- and back-office positions.“We hope to scale our Middle Eastern team rapidly to support business growth, with between 30 to 60 hires over the next two years,” Gracy Chen, managing director, said in a statement.The company has already started exploring license applications in order to operate in Middle Eastern markets. The expansion follows Biget’s launch in Turkey earlier this year.",
