Shiba From the coins listed here I see Shiba and Flux may or may have not potential to become popular in price,in fact Shiba just needs to get to 1 cent and I believe it will make huge money to their holders but the nr 1 and 2 listed from you it is the first time I see such coins exist.I think you don't need to add more,just keep mining again and now switch the payment to Bitcoin only as that is the king of crypto which undoubtedly will skyrocket again in the future.",
