It just beats me how people do not realize making new coins no longer makes sense.If you will look at their site, it seems to me as experimental project of a 3rd grader. I may be exaggerating here, but don't know if people are still falling from this kind of project. A doge clone under BSC network, now, who will support this? More than likely, those who are only after for quick gain, but wonder who will buy, unless the team themselves showing that someone is buying this token. I think, better abandon this project this early. Before they will screw up naive users.",

For those who do not understand, this means that the founder of the project undergoes KYC in an audit company via video conference, where questions will be asked. Why is this necessary? This will give future fans of the project a guarantee that there are no anonymous people behind the project. Also, in case of fraud on the part of the project, the audit company unilaterally posts this video in the public domain.",
