The time needed is also fairly fast and short when making a deposit transaction on a casino site.You also don't need to attach your personal financial information data first when making a deposit.",

Idk much about it though, I myself personally never had any problems with it, but you might want to search more about it. On one hand though, instead of the card, it might be better to find a better casino instead? Since the problem in the first place was security. It might even be other sources that were the cause of the attempted hack in the first place even.",

I know most sports books accept fiat, but I choose to deposit in crypto despite the fact that it might take a long process but to be safe, I'm doing it. Also, it's easy to deny that you are gambling if authorities will ask you (in case gambling is illegal in your area) because you don't use your card and your personal information in gambling.",

Some of them use virtual cards (too). The most known is Revolut, but it really depends on what country your residence is in. (I don't know which of them support well the online casinos and sportsbooks, that's up for your further research).Plus, from what I know, even Google Pay/Apple Pay hide your card/bank information, exposing actually a virtual card (I don't know how or if it can be used online, not that much experience in that).However, as the others said, why don't you just use the online services that accept bitcoin/crypto? This should be much safer and better.",

FYI sometimes it could be that there is a cloned site you use and hackers could have phished this card information hence best solution have a dedicated account for gambling and stuff. Quote from: Davidvictorson on January 08, 2023, 08:46:36 AMCould you kindly recommend virtual cards that online sportsbooks and casinos will accept for deposits and withdrawals without revealing my bank information?Virtual cards are a good alternative to the actual cards but the problem comes in when the casino asks you to complete KYC with a photo of your bank card which means card verification is already a fail here. But if you are still in need of a VCC try CoinPayCard ==> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5432781.msg61537447#msg61537447",

I doubt there is any that can serve your purpose at all, or they may be but the casinos that will accept them will be limited. In crypto, you will not have to worry about your banking information being phished. Just send the money over to the casino and wait for confirmations. After that, you're ready to go. Casinos that allow the use of credit and debit cards run the risk of getting attacked by hackers for the cards' information. Better be safe than sorry, and since you already know cryptocurrencies, just buy crypto and use it to gamble.",

You're using that even the reloadable card won't need a KYC verification. How did you manage to do that and what changed?2. On the site, you're saying that the user can use \"any name\". That doesn't safe at all, does it? What happens if you're required to ask the user to verify his ID due to some suspicious activity?3. What's the difference between \"reloading a card\" and \"funding the account\"? It says 0$ for the former and 5% for the latter. Which one actually takes place when I want to add more funds to my card? 4. Are these fees real? 15% + USD for withdrawing funds to PayPal, SEPA, or anything else is just too much. Why would anyone use that instead of going to a non-KYC P2P exchange and changing his crypto for way lower fees?5. The reloadable card is also pretty expensive. 65$ for issuing a virtual card?6. You said the cards can hold up to 4000 USD. Does that mean you can reload the card as long as the overall balance doesn't exceed that amount?Hi thanks for the questions,1. We used a different bank that we had previously. They were more open to the idea, and they are a neobank. So I'm happy!2. Short answer, we will never ask iD.3. So before you can purchase a card, you will need to fund your account with crypto or perfect money when funding your account you will need to pay that fee. After that you can use your account balance to load or buy cards.4. We have that option right now to be able to withdraw from your account balance. However, that's not what we want because it's very time-consuming. So that why those fee are high. We are not an exchange. It it's possible that we will disable that feature in the future.5. We only make a little bit of money when you purchase a card, so if you buy a reloadable card, you can reload that card for free and don't need a new one until you hit the threshold of 4000 USD. So in order to keep it fair and square the cost of the reloadable cards are 69.00, but keep in mind we are the only service that provides this. 6. You can reload the card up to 4000 USD after that you need to buy a new one. BestP.s. Also we will have a referral system where you earn 3USD for every card your referral buys. Also we will give 4 free cards to users on this platform to test cards and leave a option. It seems that the Virtual Card that @LotusHedel is talking about is suitable if you want to use it.Notes:Before you buy the Virtual Card that @LotusHedel talked about, you first ask about the features or systems you want to know about, before you use them.For example: bank or casino and sportsbook information, if you are satisfied and get an answer, then you will consider buying or not, I will only provide the information that I know to you, the rest of the decisions are yours.",

If you really insist on using that cards activate and  use 2FA, even those devs cannot access your account if you have 2fa also be careful to those website you will access soon, maybe try using amex I don't know if alipay is good.",

I believed even the casino site you inputted your prepaid card details is not genuine. A legit casino site doesn't attempt to hack customers bank. You should be careful when using you bank details to register for an online sites or depositing on any online payments. For the depositing of the virtual card to fund your wallet. You can used PayPal, 2FA, and also from from your BTC wallet then you forward it to your casino wallet.",
