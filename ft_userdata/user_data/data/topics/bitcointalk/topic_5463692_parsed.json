Community, floor control, social signals, narrative, etc. Every day there are calls, VCs, twitter spaces and content being pumped out from team. Like the price consolidation here. Poised for a breakout I reckon.Do yourself a favor and go check out how stupid and hyped their community is. Think this one is special too. Happy to see it mentioned on here.Cheers, Michael",

And with that, there could only be one Pepe in my opinion. And it's hard to follow on that footsteps to be the biggest one for this year.Maybe we can see some pump in Spurdo, but it can reach the popularity of Pepe as usually the prime mover is still going to be the best and no one can duplicate it even if there are lot thousands of copy cat meme coins.",

It is the sad state of the crypto market specially with this meme coins.But the problems is that there are individuals who still invest even though the sign is there in the beginning that this project is nothing but just a meme and pump&dump projects.",

Can't you simply say that it is a meme coin created by an individual merely to get some profit from the investments it might get and the value of it is totally dependent on the response from the community since it doesn't have any value itself nor can it gain any value organically? That would be a more precise and on-point description for a meme coin.I keep wondering if people actually invest in coins like these, that would totally be just a waste of resources that could be used in something much better. Giving the money to a needy person is far better than investing them in a project like this because this will totally be wasting that money.",
