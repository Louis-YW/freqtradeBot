      "body": "This can only be discovered by the available statistical numbers of miners at a particular given time competing for the block rewards, since it's approximately 10 minutes or less for a new block to be mined or rewarded, if the mining difficulty increases then the hash rate reduces and same applies if the hash rate increases the mining difficulty reduces.QuoteThe network calculates the total time it takes to mine the last 2,016 blocks. The ratio of the standard 20,160 minutes (10 minutes x 2,016 blocks) to the time it took to scale the last difficulty epoch is then multiplied by the most recent difficulty level. The calculation yields a result that will determine the required percentage change in the mining difficulty that will bring the block time to the desired 10 minutes.https://www.coindesk.com/learn/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-everything-you-need-to-know/Mathematically 60 mins make one hour 10 mins average block time60-10=5050/10 =5My answer is 5 minutes for average time and5x20160x10=1008000 difficulty adjustment [Edited]",

What's the difficulty once it adjusts after epoch C?In order to arrive at the difficulty after epoch (C) we should first consider the relationship between each epoch difficulty and the average block time, from the hypothetical scenario, we already know that the lesser the block time, the more the difficulty reduces and vice versa.So if the average block time of epoch (A) is 10 minutes and the difficulty is around 42 trillion, and epoch (B)'s average block time is 8 minutes, the difficulty increases in order to maintain 10 minute average block time.So if the average block time of epoch (C) should increase to 1 hour due to uncontrollable factors, like the US government deciding on seizing all the miners, the difficulty should drastically decrease significantly in order to be able to maintain 10 minutes average block time.I stand to be corrected, but I think that if this is the case and epoch (C) is over 6 times higher than the target average time which is 10 minutes, the difficulty should be reduced by a factor of 6.Since the initial difficulty (42 trillion) would be reduced by the factor of 6, the difficulty after epoch (C) should be decreased to around 7 trillion.",

Now the network protocol tries to make sure that the average time for solving a block doesn't exceed 10 mins but rather is within 10 mins. Therefore to calculate the mining difficulty of the present Epoch C we have to first find the mining difficulty of Epoch A and Epoch B keeping in mind that the ratio for Epoch A is the standard value (20160 for 10 minutes).After solving for Epoch B difficulty I then used it to find that of Epoch C by rationing their average time of Epoch B and Epoch C and multiplying with the difficult of B.",

The trick of this quiz was the knowledge of difficulty adjustment restriction to a factor of 4, as shown in here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4a020ca443ba370bf41583962d16aa8551876f53/src/pow.cpp#L54-L59. The reason we do not allow difficulty to grow beyond 300% or drop by less than 75%, is to achieve a middle ground between resilience in network disruption and quick response to a genuine change in the hashrate. For example, in the extreme scenario that the US government shuts down large mining farms, and reduces the total hashrate by 83.3%, these miners can migrate their infrastructure elsewhere within the next month. Difficulty adjustment restriction is another way to say \"something really bad or unusual has happened\" and respond respectively. I had checked ChatGPT and it did not produce the correct answer!",
