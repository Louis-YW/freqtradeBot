  "content": "Was it true? Or was it an Another Myth Again, it is a real myth for it own. I started hearing this story since when I was a child in the fishing camp. Elders were using the event as an \"African Night Entertainment\". In the evening all the children would gather in the camp square and listen to stories from elders and peer group. So this India vs Nigeria football match was also narrated that India played a football match with Nigeria and scored Nigeria with 99-1. That means India 99 - 1 Nigeria. And that made FIFA banned India from football till date. Recently the story as started trending on social media again. Then I made some research to know the truth and when I tried to find out from online, I saw different narratives but the particular date the match was played is not mentioned in any of the articles. So I see the story as a myth and fallacy.Â  When I was a child, I believed the story to be true but no more. I will want the Nigerians and Indians counterparts say something on their parts of the story.The Real Truth Behind India Vs Nigeria Match 99-1 - Sports -https://www.thehistoryville.com/india-nigeria-99-1/https://www.google.com/amp/s/dubawa.org/nigeria60-did-india-really-beat-nigeria-99-1-in-a-football-match/amp/I like to hear from you.",
