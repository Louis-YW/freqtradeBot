  "content": "Hi All -This is unfortunate to be writing this - on 8 September, I made the switch from Stake to Duelbits after getting another measly level up reward and decided to give Duelbits a go. My Duelbits username is ImPoor.On 10 September, I won some money (after losing thousands) and previously was able to withdrawal 2x without issue (see screenshots below). After a long session, I was in the green and attempted to withdrawal $4.5k across 2x transactions but they were stuck in Processing... to which I immediately contacted support who stated my withdrawal was being investigated but Support continues to refuse to give me any reason or ETA.I did not break any rules, TOS, cheat, or do anything wrong. My winnings are legitimate and it seems to me it's no problem to lose money to Duelbits, winning ANY money and attempting to cash out seems to be a problem.It has been 36 hours since I've attempted to withdrawal from Duelbits and I still don't have any ETA or explanation as to what is going on. There is no transparency into what caused this, nor what the process is and how long until I'll have access to my winnings. $4.5k is a drop in the bucket for Duelbits and I don't know why they would be willing to risk their reputation on such a small amount. Consequently - I work in cybersecurity as a blue-teamer - anomaly detections and technical investigations are my bread and butter. I get it - new account with winnings, it might've triggered an alert (this is the only likely scenario I can think of as to what would cause this chain of events). I understand that this may happen from time to time to ensure the integrity of the platform but to go 36+ hours without access to my funds without an explanation or ETA is absurd. I've even offered to KYC but was told that KYC was not required.I have included screenshots below. Any assistance anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated.Withdrawal: https://imgur.com/a/Q3VP1AgScreenshot from help.duelbits.com: https://imgur.com/a/jFXAyCAConvo1: https://imgur.com/a/7k3I9YAConvo2: https://imgur.com/a/oJKaCBSConvo3: https://imgur.com/a/PJHkSH9",

      "body": "This happened already before usually takes some time to process. Let the investigation finish and be patient for the result. Though if you want to expedite this one, you contact again the support and not the bot one. I’m pretty sure Duelbits will release your money if they didn’t find any suspicious with your account, you can also raise this concern on their main thread here they can help you expedite this just cooperate and you can be good.",
