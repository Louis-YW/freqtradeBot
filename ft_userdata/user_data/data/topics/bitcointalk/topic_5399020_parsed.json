This is why I want to list some of the reminders about crypto investment and I hope every beginners here won't do the same mistake.CRYPTO INVESTING - SHORT REMINDER1. DON'T USE YOUR SAVINGS FOR YOUR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES - Use your separate funds if you are going to invest on any market and make sure that you are ready to lose that money because investing is not a guaranteed way to make profit, so have some funds for this.2. DON'T BORROW MONEY - Many still do the same mistake like this and when the market turns to negative, they are also drowning and the situation will get worst simply because they use the money which is not them. If you want to become profitable, save for your capital first.3. DON'T BE GREEDY - If you already lose money, you should stop for a while and study again so you can know what's wrong with your strategy and start analyzing again so you can do better next time.This is just a short reminder since I want to highlights the important things you need to know before investing.There's a lot of news about suicide incidents because of losing money on their investments, and I don't want you to ended up on the same path so please do your own research first and again invest only what you can afford to lose.",

Since you know that what you are embarking on is via risk, so borrowing to run investment is not bad.Quote from: Scripture on May 17, 2022, 12:23:03 PM3. DON'T BE GREEDY - If you already lose money, you should stop for a while and study again so you can know what's wrong with your strategy and start analyzing again so you can do better next time. when you say greedy is universal, because anybody what to get rich and more richer in all ramifications, what makes people to lose is inability of not detecting when is time to go out of the market, so this is from my perception",

You can further divide your savings into separate funds. A share of it may go for Bitcoin or crypto investment. The rest may go to your emergency and other miscellaneous expenses. My point is that invest in crypto with your savings, funds that are not intended for anything else.This is the opposite of investing with borrowed money or any money that is not really yours.But I guess newbies should be outright told to stay away from altcoins. If they do, they should be warned that their money is in a very risky situation and could perish anytime. Forget about indirect pieces of advice. Sometimes, they just couldn’t leave a mark. It is better to just say it straight, loud and clear.",

However, for a smart investor, he should only invest on his extra money and on the amount he can afford to lose. Otherwise, he will make temporary profits but in the end, he will still suffer from losses because of the pressure thinking how to repay the debt or how to bring back his money savings.",

I don't know what went wrong with LUNA but personally, I won't invest that much on any coin better to diversify it.

I have encountered many Filipinos on Facebook who are either one of these three (and maybe all of them) because they are getting FOMO’d not just on LUNA, but in any other project before until today as they are not doing their own research.But most of them I have encountered is that they’ve spent all of their life savings into LUNA and futures trading without doing much research, no to very less experience, etc., that results for them to being greedy and losing everything. There’s one stock investor I have encountered who is going all-in on LUNA and futures trade. He was suppose to get married with his long time girlfriend, but ended up losing everything of his life savings because of this decision. We just simply can’t do anything about it anymore except learn our lessons, reflect and move on.",
