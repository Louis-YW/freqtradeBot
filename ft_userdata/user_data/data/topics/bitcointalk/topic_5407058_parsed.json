So when copying a wallet address one has to be careful. If it is me, and I copied Wallet address, I would check it twice before leaving it because if you do not checked and you keep it like that and one digit is missing, you do not have to blame the sender. Really I have not seen or heard anyone type wallet address but that not withstanding people might type it if the device the person is using can not copy the address. Devices like small Nokia and Itel. If you are to type the address you better be careful and cross check the numbers, figures, signs, and letters both big letters and small letters. The worst of them all. When you are manually typing the characters and you mistakenly type another character and you send it then the person send the coin and coin entered another person address then your fund is gone.",

If you mistype one or few characters then you will high likely end up with an invalid address. Any decent wallet software will notify the user if the checksum fails and will not let him create the transaction.Even if you use a faulty wallet which will let you broadcast a transaction that sends coins to an invalid address, the network will reject it. So, the chances of losing coins because of this are really tiny.Double-checking addresses before hitting the send button is a must, though.",

I've never seen anyone type manually the recipient's address. It just presents bigger risk than just copy and pasting it. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible so a single mistake will be a huge regret to the sender. For copy-paste malware issues, your device won't easily be affected by that as long as you are careful when downloading files or opening some links.",

Isn't that like unnecessary? Anyway, I think anyone attempting that has ample time on their hand and wants to waste it needlessly. Besides, mistakes are even likely to happen while typing. Again, even copying it without scrutiny can lead to errors too. So, in copying an address I've make a point of checking the first few letters, the middle letters and the last four letters. Taking one's time in doing that isn't a waste of time. It's good to crosscheck details and not be in a haste while on financial transactions. I tend to treat my financial dealings with the precision of a defence lawyer in a murder case. Errors of omission shouldn't be allowed.",
