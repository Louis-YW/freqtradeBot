  "content": "Hey there fellow reader!To begin with... I've got interested into a crypto day trading back in 2021 September-November. Basically at the end of the 2021. Most likely like the most of the traders I watched some YouTube scalping strategy videos and decided to try it myself. And yes, I burnt my entire account. It wasn't much, only like 50$, but I realized that it's not that easy as it might look like. Of course, I was using high leverage 20-50x. And after a few tries I quit and a few months came back to crypto trading with the idea of becoming financially independent and I actually really enjoy learning process. Been watching YouTube videos, analyzing market, paper trades etc. I even start to read a book called \"Money Psychology\". But whenever I put some money into my trading account I keep burning all my cash. Basically I try to learn leverage trading 10-20x, I know some of you might say it's pointless to use leverage, but it's not about that. This whole thread is about something else. I know the reason why I keep losing my money, but I can't cope with that: rage trades, back-to-back revenge trades, the idea of making money ASAP and so on... I believe I'm not alone who keeps losing cash over and over again over trading and I thought... Maybe we have here on Sythe some experienced traders who could share some tips or couch a little bit? Also, would someone be interested to make a Discord server together and do analysis, learn and improve in trading together? I believe that would be easier. Even if I lose my entire account over and over again I keep coming back in a crypto trading, because that's the only thing I'm really curious and passionate about.If someone wants to chat in private, please add me on Discord: Enj100#2242",

For bitcoin, I use 3 to 5x leverage, for altcoins I use 2x leverage. When I started to trade, I use too much leverage just like you, and I lost money quite often.Quote from: Enjoy100 on December 05, 2022, 08:22:03 AMAnd after a few tries I quit and a few months came back to crypto trading with the idea of becoming financially independent and I actually really enjoy learning process. Financial independence is not what is easy to talk about in trading, although it is possible but most likely not possible for most traders. Trading is not gambling but just see it as gambling, it is risky, thousands or millions of dollars can be lost in just little period of time. You need to learn, continue with just $50 for months and do away with emotions. Do not expect to gain what you can not afford to lose. You need more experience. Quote from: Enjoy100 on December 05, 2022, 08:22:03 AMBasically I try to learn leverage trading 10-20x, I know some of you might say it's pointless to use leverage, You are still using high leverage. You can use leverage, but if it is getting higher, it brings up emotion and resulting to making wrong decision and making liquidation risk to be higher.Quote from: Enjoy100 on December 05, 2022, 08:22:03 AM I believe I'm not alone who keeps losing cash over and over again over trading and I thought... Maybe we have here on Sythe some experienced traders who could share some tips or couch a little bit? Use low leverage like 1x and not more than 2x first. The best teacher is yourself if you have known chart and indicators. Look for the strategies you think is the best for you to make profits and minimize losses, the more you trade, you will develop these strategies.The mistake most trade has is that they use high leverage Quote from: Enjoy100 on December 05, 2022, 08:22:03 AMIf someone wants to chat in private, please add me on Discord: Enj100#2242Not advisable, people will only lure you on how they can make money from you without being cared of you losing money, be careful, what they will suggest bare trading signals which will not help you.",

      "body": "The majority of \"traders\" take huge bets that don't pay off or continuous ones until their balance goes to 0. I don't know why everyone rushes into using trading as a way to gamble without taking some simple things into consideration - such as risk management.There are ways to do well with trading but if you haven't spent a while watching the markets or scalping the spot (for at least 3 months) you can't expect to be good at trading with leverage - or even maintain your balance over a long term.If you've got a way to access your account history you could look at what you're doing wrong. If you're constantly getting stopped out you're either overleveraging, taking less optimal buys, or not zooming out to see a bigger trend that might go against you (for example).",

Leverage trading is the single element I find concerning about you that hasn't changed. Trading with high leverage of 20-50x with only $50 will only get you burned. How about you trade with an amount that enables you to implement a respectable stop loss. Or simply reduce your leverage to a level that offers you some room to absorb when the price is not moving in the direction of your analysis if you continue with a $50 capital, which is fine because we should be starting small anyhow.",

Build a strategy that will work for you, gain confidence ,use money/risk management with small leverage of 1%-2% of your trading account , use stops and tps, and lastly practice over and over again and check your results, if there's an improvement then you go back to live trading.",

Good effort buddy to keep learning in trading, because you won't be able to immediately experience the same profits as other professional traders when you just become a trader. That is something I can say as close to impossible. It sounds like you should try out a demo account before actually jumping right into the real trading.If I may give advice, don't put too high leverage especially if you are in the learning stage, and also you have to adjust it to the capital you are going to trade.",

You no the reason already that you are losing your money. The market doesn't know who is losing or gaining so if you are trading with anger because you are losing, you are making a big mistake on yourself and capital.

Apart from that, you also need to familiarize yourself with analyzing price movements, which are bound to change rapidly.

I have experienced many defeats.And what I learned from my mistakes is that at that time I still couldn't control my emotions. even though I can't control my fear and greed in my trading. Luckily I noticed it early. and I can finally fix my mistake.before when I did futures trading I always wanted a lot of profits quickly. so sometimes the margin I use is 10% of the total capital so of course this will make the distance to liquid closer. let alone added lagerage high.But this year I prefer to trade casually without rushing. I use more time to analyze before finally entering the trade.The margin used is only 1-2%. so we are not too worried about being hit by liquid.But before entering futures trading, we must first master spot trading. if we've been able to consistently earn enough profits in the spot market. then it means we are ready to enter futures trading. and if our trading in the spot market is still chaotic. then I suggest avoiding trading in the futures market. because believe our decision to enter the futures market when we are still not consistent profits in the spot market is an emotional based decision. and that's not good.because even to be able to master spot trading we have to master basic analysis such as technical and fundamental analysis well. we even have to know the basics of such chart patterns and fake patterns and so on.",
