  "content": "A year ago, Bitcoin's use cases primarily focused on store of value and occasional payments, mirroring Satoshi's vision. Even during the 2020 DeFi boom, Bitcoin remained largely uninvolved. Mentioning \"Bitcoin DeFi\" often conjured images of scams capitalizing on both trends. However, with advancements in technology and the emergence of Layer-2 solutions, Bitcoin is unlocking new possibilities, including DeFi applications. Platforms like Stacks and Rootstock are reintroducing smart contracts, enabling the development of DeFi DApps on Bitcoin[1].Bitcoin's total value locked (TVL) has grown to 2.34B USD[2], surpassing established chains like Polygon, Avalanche, and Optimism, and currently ranks sixth overall[3]. Additionally, Tron is developing a Layer-2 solution to integrate Bitcoin with its DeFi ecosystem[4].Furthermore, Binance Labs recently invested in Babylon, a novel protocol facilitating Bitcoin staking on PoS blockchains. This innovation presents intriguing opportunities for both BTC holders and PoS ecosystems, offering passive income without complex solutions[5].As a Bitcoin enthusiast actively implementing DCA, I personally favor storing my BTC in my own wallet. The complexities of DeFi protocols, particularly regarding security, raise concerns. While the potential for sizable profits through DeFi participation during a potential \"summer\" is undeniable, the risk of entrusting my Bitcoin to fledgling protocols in the face of evolving cyber threats outweighs the potential rewards at this stage.I would like to know your views on Defi on Bitcoin:What are your thoughts on storing BTC?Do you believe DeFi represents an evolution for Bitcoin?Are you interested in participating in DeFi with your BTC?Refenrences:[1] Bitcoin’s Expanding Ecosystem: Layer-2, DeFi, NFT[2] DefiLlama: Bitcoin Total Value Locked[3] DefiLlama: Total Value Locked All Chains[4] Tron founder unveils Bitcoin layer-2 solution as BTC DeFi breaks $1.2 billion in TVL[5] Binance Backs a Bitcoin Staking Solution: The Next Big Thing in Crypto?",

I think Bitcoin is the ultimate storage of value. And the best, really. Especially when you compare it to traditional stores of value and their past performances as well as their criticisms.2. DeFi was always part of Bitcoin. It was just limited due to the way Bitcoin works. Although many could argue that the limited part was the lack of DeFi innovations for Bitcoin. I would agree on both statements. It was a bit of both. But that is changing.3. Oh yes, I am very interested. I atomic swapped Bitcoin for Monero the other day. I realized we need more Bitcoin-compatible altcoins.",

Also they are not new, they've been around for a long time and they have not attracted that much attention because they are not hype-based projects and token creation is a scheme that requires hype to survive which means shitplatforms such as ethereum are the choice for token creators to create their useless junk.Quote from: Vincom on February 29, 2024, 07:22:57 PMFurthermore, Binance Labs recently invested in Babylon, a novel protocol facilitating Bitcoin staking on PoS blockchains.

      "body": "I got no problem with DeFI getting built on Bitcoin through higher layers and side chains. Just don't clog up the blockchain. If these things open up new use cases for Bitcoin, and the vast majority of their activity happens on the other layers/chains, only hitting the bitcoin chain occasionally, that's fine.But I think the main value to Bitcoin would be adding services to the Bitcoin ecosystem, not tokens. Tokens are the mistake people brought to Crypto, as the focus just becomes speculation on get-rich-quick tokens before they bust, rather than on the actual services associated with these things. So building DeFI services on top of Bitcoin to integrate more economic activity into the Bitcoin ecosystem is great. Just don't flood Bitcoin with useless tokens and NFTs and don't clog the limited blockspace with this other activity.Anything useful being built in the Crypto world should ultimately move to primarily being used on Bitcoin rather than in Crypto, as Bitcoin is the primary thing of value in the entire cryptocurrency world, and is likely the only cryptocurrency that is ever going to go truly mainstream. But there are plenty of things in Crypto that are not actually useful, so I don't want to see people bogging Bitcoin down and degrading its reputation by bringing everything Crypto to Bitcoin. Bitcoin only needs the useful things.",

The main difference between the two is the fact that a second layer is built on top of first layer so it depends on that layer for existence. While a side-chain only has a vague link to the other chain but is independent. In other words a second-layer can not exist without the first layer while a side-chain can continue to exist even if the main chain ceases to exist. This is why you can create a separate coin with any supply in a side-chain (eg. with a 1:1000 ratio) but you can't do the same in layer 2.Other things mentioned here such as speed, fee, security, etc. are not characteristics of these two concepts.
