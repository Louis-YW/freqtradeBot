  "content": "So guy's yesterday I was so bored I have no friend to call me or for me to call and gist all the love talks. I was so worried and I was led that love is not all about having with opposite sex but by demonstrating happiness in the lives of others.Just that moment I made a withdrawal order from my bitcoin wallet of $400 asap and it drops immediately, my mother's village is not far the town where I stay. So I thought of putting smiles to our mother's who bears the pains of nurturing children giving a them a token of $20 dollars each, though my own mother is late but I was excited to remember her yesterday.https://i.ibb.co/QmX9b4y/Screenshot-20230215-080559-2.pnghttps://i.ibb.co/q53rhnb/Screenshot-20230215-080130-2.png",

Here people any little out of kindness because it extends smiles and happiness to them.",

That is wrong disposition to have about Valentine's Day. There are people who need are in dire need of love and acts of kindness and Valentine day is really a perfect day to show those people that love really does exist. You have done really well visiting to give back to women who needed it, posterity will remember you for it. As an extra way to help and show love, you can choose to organise a class or a seminar to educate the children of these women about bitcoins, that will go a long way too, in addition to the financial support.[/list]",

Rather than wasting your time in a club or bar drinking to stupor or drinking till you're no longer yourself, I think we should all just try to show love to those around us, after all we are in the period of valentine, a period to show love to everyone around us.",

But from the picture, I can tell that these women are not wealthy and they cannot pay you back for these kind gestures. $20 can feed a family of five for one week in the rural communities in m country. You have done well brother. Keep doing good because one day your reward will come. But I have observed that all the pictures posted in this forum are either blurred or covered keeping the people's identities private. Maybe you could do the same thing to hide the identity of the people.",

If is West African it could be a Nigerian and 20$ in conversion today is aboutÂ  NGN 15,000 which can be used to feed for about 2 to 3 days in Nigeria depending on the family size thereabouts.",

You've done well I must commend and encourage as this plays a significant role in helping others to appreciate there neighbours.The valentine's day in many ways have been more of a sole thing, a spouse thing or someone dating relationship/familiar thing butÂ  the narrative isn't supposed to end at that. People are going through a lot and a little show of kindness, that there is love in this world, that people really do matter and are noticed could be the difference between life and death, crime and good virtue.In all, love shouldn't be a one day thing but, something you give when opportune and so, we need to be filled with it.
