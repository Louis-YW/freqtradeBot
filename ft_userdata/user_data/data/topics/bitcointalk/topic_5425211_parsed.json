  "content": "When I thought this was an anxiety disorder, of course consulting a psychiatrist was considered appropriate. but it turned out to be in vain. then I think this is a kind of phobia in the past and of course consulting a psychologist is the right thing I think. and still neither psychologists nor psychiatrists really satisfy me. I feel much better when I get closer to worship and pray to Allah SWT.to a double personality or the whisper of a supernatural being. I do not know. but everything gets better when praying to Allat Swt.do you believe that interference from supernatural or astral beings can affect the psyche?",

      "body": "I am a Moslem. and in my opinion, if you are hit by anxiety or sadness that drags on without stopping, and I don't know where the sadness comes from. Just know, Allah really longs for you to draw closer to Him.the only answer if you don't want to be nervous and just want to cool off. So always remember Allah SWT. because only by remembering Allah, your heart will be calm.this is from my experience, when you are far from allah you will feel anxiety. so try to change, and from now on let's get closer to Almighty Allah SWT.In the past, I also thought it was all interference from supernatural beings, but now I think that's not the cause. that is, you can get distracted. However, you also shouldn't forget this one word, namely \"don't overdo it\" if you do something excessively, especially in a negative way, it will only make your life full of suffering due to your own thoughts.Don't make life a burden. This life is taken to be enjoyed, but the hereafter must be serious.and don't think too negatively, if you always think negatively about a situation. then, you have prejudice against Allah SWT. this is just a suggestion for me and for all of us.",
