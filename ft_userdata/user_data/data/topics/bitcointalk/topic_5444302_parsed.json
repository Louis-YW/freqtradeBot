  "content": "This our country don dey become crush oo. The government and CBN never really let us know where we dey go with the naira especially 500 and 1k wey government been announced say don seize to be legal tender. Since 3rd of March wey supreme court don finally rule on the application of the states wey drag government enter court, say the 5h and 1k go still be legal tender until 31st December of this year, the status of those notes still dey cause problem among naija people because some dey refuse to collect them while others dey collect and with condition say you go either buy costly on their own price before them go collect the old 5h or 1k and some self go refuse to give you change. I understand say those states wey carry the matter go court dey use the old and new notes together without ish but some states no be like that and for such state say bank dey dispense old notes but dem no dey gree collect am. Na this confusion make me say either government or CBN need to update Nigerians on the status of the old 5h and 1k.So how the matter of accepting the old 5h or 1k notes be for your end?",

Na the simple question be that wey I like make we focus on and no be supreme court judgement. Baba, I greet you special, make I contribute my own opinion on this question! -On Monday 06-03-2023 I visited access bank amino kano crescent Wuse II Abuja to make a withdrawal from my account, and the cashiers were distributing old ₦‎1,000 notes to customers and when it gets to my turn I was given ₦‎ 10k with and instruction that I can not deposit the same old note into my account through the bank unless through CBN, that spark my thought and as a smart guy, I know the bank was playing a game so I deny the withdrawal and walk away relying only on cashless means of payment as usual. -The point I am trying to make is that of what use it is to collect money that I can't use for payment and the central bank has declared its usage illegal and seized to be a legal tender, I pity Nigerains that are waiting for the central bank or the president to make any announcement. -When the president wanted the recirculating of the old ₦‎200 notes he addressed the nation on it and gave it a 60 days legal status, so I don't see why the bank should act otherwise based on what the Supreme court said.",

I was in the bank some days back and truly, old notes are being giving over counter to those who come for withdrawals. I even bought icecream out of joke today from a local vendor using the old #500 naira note I had left.As people are getting the hang of the cashless economy by doing transfer for transactions, most don't see the need to either accept the old notes or even use it for transaction.

Ever since Buhari took over power has he ever spoken to address the people on critical issues going on in the country?What I see in this Nigeria case, is that the court who is the hope of the common man has sols their right and power to politicians for money and can no longer perform their duties anymore. Court should place an order than whoever refuses to collect the old money be it individual, business firms,financial institutions should be arrested and send to jail for not obeying the supreme court judgement. In a community close to mine, last week Friday on their market day,the community came to police to arrest any trader that is denying the old naira as a legal tender.

Baba let me tell you one thing, Both the CBN and the federal vs the supreme court are all playing a game, and don't get it twisted everything that is happening right now is part of the game plans so they're just acting out the script.-Yes the re-supplying of the old note in the economy will help eas the suffering of Nigerians, but the fact is we will not still see the cash in circulation this is because all the old note deposited into depositing banks have been moved to CBN and CBN governor stated earlier that the old notes have been destroyed, so my question now is were is the resupply of the old note going to come from the answers is simple.-1: the old note in circulation will come from individuals who failed to meet the CBN currency swap deadline of 15th February 2023.-2: the pocket few old notes left in the commercial bank volt.- this leads us to another question of will the available old note in existence be able to serve Nigerians' need for cash.-what is it percentage acceptability and supply strength?-This and many more will explain why we may not see much impact of the resupplying of the old naira notes.",

After all these hurdles of naira swap buying and selling of naira notes and people spending heavily just to get cash and the untold hardship Nigerians have gone through the latter was still the end result of it. Where is the conscience of our leaders in this country, why making the masses go through this untold hardship just for their selfish interest,....May God help us in this country.",

The countries wey dey do redesign already get better economy but Nigeria wey me and you dey no get economy to talk about. No basic amenities wey we know like electricity, road etc and no economic growth because na only consume we dey consume, even agriculture wey we suppose dey do well, boko haram and cattle no gree farmers breath, which one we go talk? The economy engineering of the society is in shabble, na the matter be that.
