I'm not sure this was fully proven as apparently companies have been listing excess job adverts to make it seem the market has more places available (for their own stats).It will be a thing though as more people have probably retired early from the pandemic and people would've started their own things during it if they couldn't apply for a job at the time (like people who work in bars, restaurants, airports and retail) or didn't see a need to.",

      "body": "We cannot generalize what you say to all sectors, but there are sectors in particular that have changed radically. For example, shipping, you will find that most skilled workers have not returned to work, especially since it has become clear to them that they can be abandoned easily, so they either continue the sector or retire or work Different sectors were more profitable, and today the market is unable to find skilled workers like them, so you will find that salaries in that sector will increase in a linear manner.Source:https://www.statista.com/chart/10922/parcel-shipping-volume-and-parcel-spend-in-selected-countries/https://credendo.com/de/node/526",
