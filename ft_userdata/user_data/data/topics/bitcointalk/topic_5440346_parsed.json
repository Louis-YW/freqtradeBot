Why is there so much drama about this election? Is this the first time we are having a presidential election? Somehow this election has been painted to be one that will cause civil unrest whichever party that wins. In my opinion, I think Buhari, CBN governor and their puppets made billions of naira from this deal, and were only concerned about filling their pockets. The politicians are not affected by this new policy, they were the first to change their old naira notes. Iâ€™m yet to see anyone who can explain to me how this new naira policy will stop electoral fraud.",
