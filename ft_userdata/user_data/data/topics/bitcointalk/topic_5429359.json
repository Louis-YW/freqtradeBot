Someone born 50 years from now have almost zero chance to own 1 bitcoin while there will be people holding thousands.Does that mean new generations will have the motive to start bitcoin over again and start spreading the same way Facebook did? Starting from college students and get mass adopted later on?You know, the simple fact a coin is called Bitcoin doesn't make it worth a lot. See all the Bitcoin forks.Also a newly made coin may or may not become valuable, see the altcoins, in huge numbers being disappointing for the investors.And, as a bottom line, the fact a coin (like bitcoin) worth a lot doesn't mean the world/the people get rich. No. Only few of the investors.This being said, creating a new bitcoin may not make sense, especially if it'll be just a clone. I'd expect people will work in Satoshis in 50-100 years to overcome the price rise, but not much else.So creating a new coin can (only) make sense if it brings something really new and useful to the ecosystem. And that's not related to the price of the competitor coins. Also that can be done now too, no need to wait 50 years. Again, see the altcoins, some did bring new useful features and some of those are going pretty much OK.",

You don't have to wait 50 years for that, people have already done that thousands of times.

Also, there are thousands of altcoins and new blockchains are popping up now and then with their own coins. But none of them has come close to BTC in price point.Why can't they succeed? (there are few successful projects!) If someday BTC falls and went out of existence (just imagine), which will be its successor?....And if one could replace BTC, will it provide the same features, or will it be improved?

Forking new coins would be similar to Ravencoin (RVN), which claims to be a Bitcoin fork with a different supply. It has no monetary value, unlike Bitcoin. Or another type of fork, such as Bitcoin Cash, which is a waste of time for the community. None of them are competitive with Bitcoin or anything similar. Rather, I believe that when the next generation learns about Bitcoin, they will develop a different currency than Bitcoin. It will not harm Bitcoin's existence.",

Starting from college students and get mass adopted later on?Younger generations should start with bitcoin like the previous ones. The search for an improved bitcoin has already lead many investors into losing money to pump and dump schemes through altcoins. And if they continue thinking like this, younger generations are going to lose more money yet.",

Â This history will discourage new generation in forking Bitcoin because most of these Bitcoin fork happen to have short success and then goes down the drain. Â Besides, Bitcoin isn't just a code anymore, it has already an established economy Â and community that will try to resist any changes greedy developers wanted to implement for their personal gain.",

Someone like Roger will claim it to be the real bitcoin keeping some legal players. This is common as everything is connected with money. The generation needs to understand about blockchain and later they won't think of cloning the bitcoin network so to own a single cloned bitcoin.",

Starting from college students and get mass adopted later on?Just take a look at al the forks and altcoins which have existed over the years and you will see that such a thing does not matter at all, at the same time your argument is really weak because if that was enough of a reason to reboot bitcoin then why not do the same with the whole economy? After all now most of the wealth is concentrated in a few hands and some may think of this as unfair and yet we do not do it, so while I can see why some may think it is unfair other users have so many coins when they have almost nothing, this is not enough of a reason to do this.",

There are a lot of people who were not part of the early part of bitcoin and try to join in on the newer altcoins in case they grow to be huge, like if something you got in when it was 10-20 million marketcap became 10 billion in marketcap, that is good enough forever for you, you will never need more money ever again. That is what people are banking on when they are investing into crappy shitcoins that come out everyday.I personally feel like there is a good chance people will keep doing that, but forking bitcoin will not make the real one gone, it will just create another altcoin.",
