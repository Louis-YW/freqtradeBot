  "content": "Hi all!I will tell my story about my experience of playing on the project bitsler.comAbout 2 weeks ago I decided to try a new casino (before that I played on stake.com) because I had a big loss, about $50,000. I settled on the bitsler.com project.The project has been launched for a long time, I saw that there are some disagreements between the players and the project, but I thought that this would not affect me. (Wrong)In the first days, I deposited $33,000, of which I made withdrawals of $9,000. I always play at the maximum bet, it varies from 50 to 200 dollars.After taking a short break, I returned to the game again, deposited about $3,500, and I managed to recoup a little, I withdrew $43,000.After waiting a bit, I decided to continue the game again, deposited $4,000, and lost. After depositing $2,000 and being able to go up to $30,000 with Endorphina, the stake was $200. Continuing the game, I went down to $10,000 and bet everything on withdrawal.Well, this is where the fun begins. Withdrawals are not processed, I was told that my game will be reviewed. I reacted normally to this, and began to expect, in my understanding, the verification takes several days from 1 to 3. The withdrawal request was created on July 21.Today is already July 28, and there is no news from the support, every time they feed me breakfast. I believe that this was done on purpose, in order for the player to leave the project and not sell the game to them. Their task is to make the most uncomfortable conditions for the player, so that he leaves the project. But these are just my thoughts.In fact, from 2 deposits of $ 6,000, I withdraw $ 10,000 of which $ 4,000 is winnings.I don't like waiting and I have already suggested to them that they return my deposits of $6000 and I can withdraw $4000 after verification, I think this is fair. But they don't agree to it.What is my fault if they decide to cooperate with such a provider? Why should I sit and wait without the possibility of returning even my deposits from which the winnings were received?I recommend that you ignore this project, because if you win, you will only get problems here.https://imgur.com/a/6Sr7hl9",

I think you should read the description more carefully, I talked about the total deposits that were made before the big win, you can recalculate the amounts yourself. But instead of this, without understanding, you are in a hurry to say that everything was not quite right.",

However, you may have to wait until they have concluded with their investigation, which I believe is being done by the provider.",

Bitsler support said that they are waiting for the response of the slots provider. Have you tried to reach the support team of Endorphina to know the progress of the investigation?Bitsler will pay your the withdrawal if you haven't done anything wrong. Bitsler is a reputable casino, they won't ruin their reputation just for 10k USDT.",

There was a case about duelbits as well and that guy waited over 3 weeks, but he was abusing a bug. Probably different scenario for you, but Bitsler is not a scam from my experience. If you broke no terms, you shouldn't have an issue once they complete their investigation.",

That being said, we should also develop a culture of extensively reading TOS before signing up and playing in a casino. Why would someone sign up for a casino, yet they are not sure if Citizens from their Country are banned from using it or not?",

I cannot say this is a fact, just something I read in a scam accusation against another casino. You are probably talking about the case of bambolina and LTC Casino. That investigation took over 3 months and the player has finally been allowed to withdraw their winnings bit by bit.@ggalllowI would advice you to stay patient and give them the time they want and need to carry out whatever checks they are doing. I understand that having to wait for your money might be frustrating, but all casinos have these hidden TOS where they can basically freeze your money and investigate you if they have a suspicion that something might be wrong. Registering an account with such a site, you agree to those terms whether you like it or not.Take a look:QuoteBITSLER reserves the right to restrict the service, payment, or withdrawal during this procedure, or for any other reason in BITSLER's sole discretion. Whenever they have a concern, they can freeze your account and investigate you. That's what that means.Quote6.4. BITSLER reserves the right to block or to cancel any transaction or profiles which would be realized in a prohibited wayhttps://www.bitsler.com/en/tos",
