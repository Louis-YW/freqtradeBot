  "content": "K33 Research dataI have long had a desire to collect statistics on where bitcoins are located in order to try to analyze further events in this market.I found a recent report from K33 Research that said there are 1 million Bitcoins in ETPs, ETFs and other funds.I would like to find data on how many bitcoins are currently on exchanges, how many have been confiscated by the authorities of different countries and other official data in order to understand how many bitcoins have known owners.There is also data on bitcoins lost forever, but we see that sometimes large wallets come back to life after 10 years.If someone has already done this before me, then share the result so that I don’t have to start everything from the very beginning________https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5487893.msg63804282#msg63804282Actual U.S. government balance $17.4B.https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/usg",

In the same article while discussing Cryptocurrency exchanges its mentioned that exchanges act like banks and there's a warning too, leaving your coins on an exchange can go wrong though. Most interesting is \"Unknown whales\",  A Bitcoin whale is someone who holds more than 10,000 bitcoins in their digital wallet.  A loose estimate is that large whales account for about 8% of all bitcoins.8% that's far less what I used to think... and I remember how it was used to be reported that how whales control the price... this has been proved wrong.Last coins \"Yet to be mined\", There are still only about 7% of coins yet to be mined.People, 50% of all bitcoins are held by the general public about 10.5m bitcoins. River estimated that Bitcoin had 81.7 million users as of June 2023, or 1% of the global population.Lastly there's a very important point, that this latest surge in the value of Bitcoin is not coming because individual retail investors , Analysts say whales like the big banks are pushing up price and demand. Yes that's true you can only imagine what happens when retail investors turns to bitcoin? Remember still on 1% of global population is holding bitcoin what if that percentage turns 10%?I believe this would be helpful for you and anyone interested in this",

      "body": "You'll probably only see the data of confiscated bitcoins by the authorities in estimate I think because even though there are some news headlines that are talking about the amount of bitcoins seized in an operation, there's other operations out there that aren't newsworthy so they don't get headlines or just plain covert so the numbers aren't accounted for, only way that you could know for sure is if you've got some deep level access in the governments that have seized bitcoins or have a contact that would provide you that numbers.Quote from: Amphenomenon on March 07, 2024, 09:23:58 AMQuote from: shahzadafzal on March 07, 2024, 05:21:13 AMsnipI believe this would be helpful for you and anyone interested in this If this is true then wouldn't this be a good thing because there's more in crypto exchanges than any other groups out there?

      "body": "It's good to have such data and to monitor how influential investment funds are actually getting. There's a clear surge of Bitcoin accumulation in 2024, most likely due to the SEC finally approving ETFs. One million BTC is a very big number, especially considering that a few million BTC that count as 'circulating supply' might actually be lost forever or are at least not in active use. But that still means that they're very far from managing the majority of BTC. I do agree, though, that this data should be combined with info on exchanges and other forms of centralized storage of BTC to estimate how much is actually held by people in non-custodial wallets. From what Amphenomenon shared, it seems that the majority of BTC is likely to still be decentralized and held by people themselves (or at least outside major centralized platforms). That sounds like good news to me.",

      "body": "This is indeed a good way to somehow analyze the possibilities in the market. I hope you will come up with the bigger picture that is more or less accurate. It is elating to know from the previous post that around half of all Bitcoin is being held by Bitcoin supporters in non-custodial storage. It is certainly troubling if this much Bitcoin is being kept by centralized custodians. That signals a big risk in the market.My hunch is that when you finally put all the pieces together, you'd find out that there are actually more coins than the actual supply. And it's because of these centralized services which produce hollow numbers, paper Bitcoin, or IOUs.",
