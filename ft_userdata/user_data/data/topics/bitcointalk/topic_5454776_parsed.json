I think the only possible way is you need to create view only wallet [1] and make sure you import all the key images, because if you not do this, your view only wallet will not show the true balance due to lack of outgoing outputs.Quote from: https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/monero-GUI-guide.md#send-monero(5) Key images: This section allows you to export the key images from your cold wallet into a file, as well as to import this key images file into your view-only wallet. When your view-only wallet has the key images for all outputs, it can display the true balance. In order to import the key images into your view-only wallet, you must use a local node or be connected to a trusted remote node (you can set a trusted remote node in \"Settings\" > \"Node\" page).

Can you help me please ?You can do this by downloading the app of Ledger live, you can see your holdings through this app and get update to its current value from time to time. Though of course if you are going to withdraw it, you'll have to connect your ledger. Deposit monitoring can also do, this is the most convenient way to monitor your holdings, aside from checking your address in the blockchain explorer.",

      "body": "As already suggested above, you can use a watch-only wallet, or within Monero terms a view-only wallet, as thus, you could able to view any of your incoming balance without connecting your hardware wallet first. In regard to how to create the view-only wallet, the pointed referred link by @Apocollapse should suffice. If you were not able to extract the key, take a look at https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/xn0hfa/ledger_view_only_wallet/ thread, where it leads to: HOW TO GET MONERO PRIVATE VIEW KEY FROM LEDGER.There is a tutorial about how to do it, just some caveats, make sure you understand it may reduce your privacy and be sure to research on your own about the tool that is required to be used in that article.",

But it's not quite clear to me why you would want to check your wallet balance often. The coins are stored in a secure Blockchain and belong only to you. There is no need to check the balance regularly.",
