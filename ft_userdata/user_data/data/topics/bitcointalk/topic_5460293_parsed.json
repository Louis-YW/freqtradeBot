Withdrawals that are flagged for manual review are typically reviewed within 1 hour but may take up to 12 hours.SourceDid you contact support? If not then contact them to find out why it is taking so much time. I feel your withdrawal has been flagged as the winning amount is big.",

Which one exactly because I don't get it.That's a lot you deposited on an online casino you've never used before, anyways Duelbit is not a small company in this space, and their rep is quite good too.What is the customer representative saying? Have you get in touch with them before creating this topic? You should have done that first before coming here.It's sometimes normal when a gambler win a big amount of money and the withdrawal is been delayed, get used to it now because it happens a lot.

Crypto withdrawal on crypto gambling sites are very fast, unlike the fiat gambling sites. The withdrawal supposed to take less than 24 hours (Duelbit even said withdrawal is instantly). But you said it is more than 24 hours now. Better to contact their customers care as soon as possible.",

The withdrawal should not normally take that long, but it is possible that your case has been flagged for manual review due to their regulatory requirements. Has the casino asked you for KYC? Sometimes, the verification of KYC documents can take some time. There was a recent case from member BitcoinHunt3r who was waiting for verification for about 9 days. If that's the case, you have no other option but to wait until your KYC is verified and the withdrawal is approved.edit: Apologies, I read your last reply afterwards. It seems that KYC is not the issue, but rather your withdrawal has encountered their manual verification process.",

Have you followed all the Terms and conditions? Check that players from your country are allowed to play in Duelbits. If everything is fine, then you don’t have to worry, I guess. Keep messaging the support team about the delay in the withdrawal and, if possible, update us with the status of your case. Duelbits is a reputable casino, so I don’t think they will ruin their reputation for only this amount of money.",

If there's no problem will be seen then for sure they can release it immediately, but if there's something suspicious found maybe it will take some time before they get finish on possible investigation so best to talk with them to get a clear answer regarding on this delays.",

I’ve seen the thread about the 500k win but that’s on another level.That is very strange. If customer support itself has told you that they do not know the reason for the delay then perhaps something went wrong? Did you check to see if you withdrew to the correct address? I always triple and quadruple check, especially with such large amounts of money. You need to be 100% sure you withdrew to the correct blockchain, as well. Was this USDT address a ERC20 or A TRC20 or some other blockchain?Duelbits is a very well known and trusted online cryptocurrency gambling casino platform so they would not try to lie or scam you out of your money.Have there been any updates since the customer support last contacted you?",

I mean anyone in your position would ask them why they need to for their reply? What exactly is going around with the withdrawal request? Did you ask them those questions or never ask them such questions? As the amount is big I would have asked those questions. In most cases, if a new user makes big they do all those multiple manual checks to verify if the win was legit.",
