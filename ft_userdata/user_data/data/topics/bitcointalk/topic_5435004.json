A clean and modern design with a simple navigation menu would make it easier for users to find what they need. High-quality images and graphics would also add a professional touch. Another feature that would be useful is a search function that allows users to quickly find web hosting providers that meet specific criteria, such as location, pricing or features. This would allow users to filter through the providers and find the best one for them.I understand that you created your site with simplicity in mind, but but this does not mean that it should look outdated. I would recommend checking out some of the design trends to get an idea of what your site could look like if you updated it with a fresh and modern design.",

You might want to use that website as reference, even though that website have very minimalist design.Quote from: cryptolist on January 16, 2023, 07:44:35 PMOur website, BuyVPSWithBitcoin.net, lists a wide range of hosting providers for those looking to pay with Bitcoin and BuyVPSWithMonero.com for those looking for Monero VPS options.We also have Bitcoindedicatedservers.com for those in need of dedicated servers with Bitcoin.IMO it's unusual choice to own multiple domain when one good domain (such as RentServerWithCrypto.com) can do the job. Anyway, i'd recommend you to mention existence of other website on each website.I was inspired by bitcoin-vps, i purchased a similar domain to rentserverwithcrypto.com to turn it into a fully-featured website, but it takes time to create a professional website, i'll take the website suggestionQuote from: hugeblack on January 25, 2023, 07:48:30 PMI expected that there would be comparisons and tables that would give detailed information with the price and user comments, then the benefit would be greater, and the classification by country is not as important as the price, Do they accept bitcoin directly, through BitPay, or through a third party.Bookmarked it and will check it later for more details, and I hope until then that there will be a comparison table between these services.This will be done but later onQuote from: bnbstorm on January 25, 2023, 09:03:29 PMQuote from: cryptolist on January 16, 2023, 07:44:35 PMAttention all crypto enthusiasts!
