That's why I always advise anyone using app to be very mindful with the kind of trading app they go about installing just in the name of involving themselves with a trading bot.",

Which countries/regions are available?IEARN BOT is a global company. The United States, Britain, Japan, Ukraine, Germany.Singapore. Nigeria, Turkey, etc.You would trust somebody that claims to have developed some magical AI trading algorithm but can't decide on the correct punctuation?",

I don't believe that among those 800,000 victims, there are many more experienced traders. Honestly, this is the first time I've heard that a trading bot requires sending money/coins to a third-party platform. Usually, everything ends with permission to open and close a trading position.",

These days, chatGPT and artificial intelligence (AI) are becoming popular, and once more, criminals are utilizing them to deceive greedy and ignorant individuals. However, I am skeptical that a single fraudulent trading bot could defraud 800,000 people. That number was only used as a marketing ploy to get more people to join because it already has a large number of investors worldwide. Despite the fact that the trading bot had already failed to pay its investors, some individuals deposited an additional 30% of its withdrawable amount. It was not hard to tell that the fraudsters were attempting to milk its investors once more.",

Hoping to make a quick profit, crypto users look for a variety of shortcuts, which quickly make them victims of scams. Because if a crypto trader does not know the details about something, then he faces big problems in the future. A trading bot is not something that guarantees huge profits for no reason.",

Bots don't have emotions and can't feel anything of concern. Even when it's obvious that market patterns and changes are sporadic, a bot may not be able to quickly make that switch. Also, there are bots that trade relatively well with up or down trend but performs poorly when the market is ranging.– Leaving a bot to trade for one is making one vulnerable.",

Then when withdrawing the deposits they were asking for 30% fees, these same people were paying the 30% fees too. How stupid it sounds?QuoteIn some countries, such as Nigeria and Colombia, local leaders were pushed by iEarn Bot mentors - with whom they only ever communicated on Telegram - to organise recruiting events.https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64939146It sounds like ponzi scheme. The greed drives these leaders and they keep recruiting more people who want to become leaders too. Leaders everywhere but no one is getting paid except hope to get paid.Quote\"[People] took loans to invest. They used money from other sources, many people were affected,\" says Andres. \"As the local leaders did not have answers, people started to get angry.\"Very common in ponzi stories.",

I have seen adverts in my country that assure investors that bots have 95% accuracy in trading which means profits are guaranteed if they invest. People are just lazy, greedy, or desperate to make gains without reasoning how real these lofty profits are. I feel sorry for those that lost their money but they have also learned the hard way.",
