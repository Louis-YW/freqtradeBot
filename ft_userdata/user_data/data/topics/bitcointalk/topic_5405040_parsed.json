  "content": "Do not use Bitshield wallet, or you will lose your bitcoinAn user on this forum complained some weeks ago when he imported the seed phrase he generated on Bitshield wallet to another wallet (Electrum wallet), the seed phrase has different derivation paths which should be a good reason not to use the wallet.You can read about what happened and the reason any Bitshield user can lose their bitcoin: Re: trouble with bitshieldAnother example of such wallet: is AbraWhat is most concerning about these wallets is that most of them are not open source, people using the wallet do not know if their coin is actually stolen or not by the wallet developer. It is good to use open source noncustododial wallets with standard derivation path.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631151.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5288971.0There is nothing bad to ask which wallet to use on a forum like Bitcointalk rather than just going to app store to download just any wallet, there are many scam wallets on app stores.",

I think it's safe to say that most people getting into Bitcoin will likely use a mobile wallet, rather than doing their research, and then deciding. Since, a lot of the time it's more of a jump in the deep end, and figure it out rather than having the due diligence. I think even most veteran users here will admit they didn't consider Bitcoin something they'd be using as a daily currency when they got into it. So, we need to figure a way of preventing these sort of users from getting compromised in this way. Unfortunately, we can't rely on Google's secure scan on the Google app, as that's rather generic.",

Since bitcoin in other words is money, they also need to know which wallet gives them a good sense of security to store their assets instead of directly downloading them from playstore or app store.The sticky thread has actually answered what they needed to know, but many beginners don't read and prefer to start a new thread. I remember about my first post on the forum: About Wallet. So, actually bitcoin users just need to be more aware that their bitcoin are always being targeted by scammers out there in various ways, including fake wallets or something.",

What's alarming is that it already has over 10K downloadsWhen reporting, it's funny how Google play does not even have a slot for \"fraud or scam\" but they have one for \"Hateful or abusive content\"",

Many relatively reputable wallets use custom derivation paths, examples can be found here: https://walletsrecovery.org/That some cryptocurrency wallets use non-standard derivation paths isn't necessarily a bad thing and doesn't mean they want to scam their customers somehow or prevent them from shifting to competitors' wallets. I mean, as long as such software wallets are fully open-source, reproducible, and transparent about their derivation paths and other similar staff, it is totally fine for them to use whatever derivation path they wish. However, if the devs aren't transparent about what they are doing, if they hide software behind the curtain of closed-source code, if they use custom derivation schemes without disclosing the actual content of these algorithms, only then can we certainly claim that they are totally unsafe for exploitation and storing considerable amounts of money. The case of BitShield is quite clear: they either deliberately deceive their users by trapping them inside the unusable wallet, to which it is possible to deposit money but impossible to withdraw from, or they have come up with not a very smart idea of how to compete with other wallets disallowing users to restore their funds with another wallet. Either way, it is unacceptable behavior.",

Many relatively reputable wallets use custom derivation paths, examples can be found here: https://walletsrecovery.org/But you did not disagree with the OP itself, Bitshield do have a recovery tool, you can not import Bitshield seed phrase on another BIP39 wallet or on wallet that is highly recommended by the bitcoin community which is Electrum. If they have those, I wouldn't have created this thread. Lastly, I indicated how the wallet is not open source which is the most discouraging reason not to use the wallet.",
