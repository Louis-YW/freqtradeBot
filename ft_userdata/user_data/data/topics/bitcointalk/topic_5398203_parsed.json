  "content": "hello there,I try to get 5500xt working under ubuntu (to mine etc) but I seem to hit a dead end ... I mean lshw shows that amdgpu is used, lm-sensors show allkind of info ... everything seems to be working just none of the miners find the card ... I use the same rig to mine with old r9 390 and it works perfectly ... amdgpu is installed with --opencl=legacy,rocm ... so in theory it should be just plug it in and start mining but like I said none of the miners recognize the card ... what am I doing wrong ? am I missing something also rocm-smi do not know that there's 5500xt ...thank you for any hints",

      "body": "If your ubuntu setup sees R9 390 with ease then its a driver issue, mind updating that first and drop a feed back later? Because that RX5500XT is a newer graphics card compared to the R9 390 so @sxemini is right.",
