Even though he seems to have the support of the youngest generations in Argentina, he won't be able to keep that support if he suddenly withdraws all social help and programs who many are counting on to keep going and face their dire situation...The youth from Argentina voted for him not only because he managed to appeal to them, but also because voting for the other candidate (Massa) was voting for a continuation of the current administration and they are going so bad, they were wiling to give Milie a chance, regardless of his behavior and quite exotic ideas.",

If I'm not wrong then that guy is strictly against central banks or he shows that he is against central banks. That guy won the game because he was against the central banks and citizens supported him in his stance. His was against the banks and he shown the negative picture of central banks to the public of Argentina because in that country the Argentine peso has seen huge inflation in a year and that allowed him to get trust of the public. That guy has shown that Bitcoin is the solution to solve the economical problems of Argentina and it will be a useful asset to fight against the inflation but the guy hasn't made Bitcoin a legal tender yet in Argentina, however I believe that if he stick to his words then maybe in few days to few weeks he make Bitcoin a legal tender for the country. The guy has vowed to shut down the central banks and replace the Argentinean peso with US dollar and may support the idea of decentralized finance in the country. The guy supports Bitcoin but we can't neglect his libertarian views and that's something worrisome for many citizens of the country. Although the guy is a libertarian but he's not posing strict policies himself but is trying to get votes in favor of his libertarian views. Here's a good article about that guy written by Susie Violet Ward Source",

And then now he has been elected President. I think this is really a great achievement. But looking at his educational background and who he was before entering the world of politics, he, who is better known as an economic expert, because it maybe he should indeed be able to make economic improvements there. Although there may be a big change there and of course various pros and cons will occur. But all this seems to have to be done. Because inflation is starting to get out of control and has reached high inflation levels (hundreds of percent) of course it will require slightly unusual handling. He is famous for his quite eccentric style. Maybe the leadership style will be a little the same. To be honest, this reminds me a little of the president of the Republic of Indonesia who also had an eccentric or distinctive style and later in his leadership he still maintained that style and apparently this also made him closer to the people. And now in the country where I work, namely Indonesia, the economy seems to be strengthening. In fact, several large mines that were originally controlled by foreign investors have now managed to have their shares fully controlled by this country. So, when I saw Javier Milei's style, I immediately remembered the characteristics that also exist in the president of the country where I work now.",

He has 2 ways of approaching this. Either he remains 100% true to his words and starts doing as promised, in which case they're going to label him a nutjob and attack on all fronts, or thread lightly and try to slowly push as many ideas as possible, starting from the most acceptable ones. He has to cut expenses and save money, but not at the expense of jobs. Argentina is rich in natural resources, so there's a way to make money and people will judge him on what he managed to improve. I'd love to see him make bitcoin profits non-taxable and encourage mining. Make Argentina a safe haven for cryptocurrencies.",

But in this space, hands are tied and I wish the best for Him and the Argentinians, I also wish him a good stay all out his four years tenure and hope he eradicates poverty from the lives of his citizens.You can take a look at one of the headlines from BBC: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67470549",

What I have observed here is that Javier Milei, was voted for mainly because of his stance against his country's central bank's practices that has affected their currency negatively. I'm happy that he has interest in bitcoin, hopefully he makes it a legal tender in Argentina, and with the right policies to back it up, the citizens will see the beauty of decentralized digital currency, in comparison to the centralized authority that they have been used to. I wish the new president, all the best, especially as he's hopefully bringing bitcoin, onboard his new administration, this will surely increase bitcoin, adoption in that country.",

Milei also has to juggle demands from the more mainstream conservative bloc, whose public backing was key to him winning the run-off election last week....",

Javier Milei is more like a showman someone who has much charisma and is willing to use it to reach a political mean, it is similar to what Trump achieved back in 2016.On the other hand, Bukkele does not intend to exploit his charisma, is not a showman, he jumps right into action and applies politics which are supposed to increase the security and the standard of living of the population in El Salvador. He had proven himself to be very tough against criminals in his country. One can only hope Milie will soon stop talking too much and shows some of the same strength Bukkele has, for the good of his people.",

Your feeling about his words is warranted because the western media is mostly sensationalist when it comes to the truth, if they feel like it's too boring then they just have to hype it up a little to generate more reactions be it positive or negative.",

The person adopt bitcoin because he or she wants to change the narrative of the economic situation in the country. Therefore, for Javier Milei, he has a good plan for the country.

I'm not very familiar with Argentina, and I've only read a handful of articles on Milei, so my knowledge is only surface-level.Regardless of how Milei pictures himself, his agenda is a classic Austrian & Chicago schools of economics, not a libertarian.Argentina is over the top with debt, they are in hyperinflation (depending on your definition of choice for that) and is a country that is balancing precariously the need to pay in dollar with el \"cepo\" to the exports (yes, you are reading correctly, a country which taxes exports... what could go wrong). El \"cepo\" forces to buy pesos with US dollars at an unrealistic change rate.He has moderated the song - victory was not that surprising - but the general direction of travel is:- Get quick cash nationalising the jewels of the crown, such as YPF (oil company). - Slashing through subsidies and handouts to nearly everything, including the massive transfers to the \"provincias\" (provinces).- And the biggest gamble: dollarising the economy and pretty much removing the Central Bank of Argentina.My view: Argentina needs to do something. Years and years of unproductive spending and massive public debt are creating all short of problems - a country that should've been rich, has around 30% of poverty, that includes people who work and are still poor.Will Mileis programme work? If it is implemented with a mastery that I am not sure Milei's team can muster, it will probably start correcting the economy, but even in that case there is a social hell to pay. His presidency can end very quickly if he doesn't get it surgically right.Still, correcting Argentina will take more than one mandate. His bet is an expansion of the economy, but that does not happen instantly and frankly... anyone investing in Argentina should know that... well, is \"kind of risky\".https://youtu.be/H0Ff3nESRH0Edit to add: For those that think that removing the Central Bank is a good idea, notice that dollarizing the economy does not shut down the Central bank, it just outsources it to a foreign central bank. I wonder if that is \"freedom\".",
