That is some sensational thinking and without any evidence to support the claim, there is nothing to think about. There are so many personal opinions, but that should not guide your investment decisions.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on January 08, 2023, 07:03:44 AMRight now some people are still waiting for more downside without any DCA so far, this is a very big risk if you ask me.Timing the bottom is irrelevant if you plan to hold for the long term. We already have discounted prices and with DCA can steadily grow our position.Your investment decision is yours to make, and is independent of that of others.- Jay -",

Bitcoin price falled in 2019 too, also in 2018, getting to some prices above $3000 but not below. During the pandemic, bitcoin price increased too. People only link what is happening to what is causing bitcoin price fall without doing more research about the actual cause. I will advice you to have a positive thinking, some people will always just have negative thinking about bitcoin price until they are finally seeing themselves missing the bull market.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is cyclical, its price movements and other whatnots happen in cycles, thus the past history is always a good focal point to predict the present and future, it doesn't mean that things will happen exactly the same way, but more often than not history somewhat always repeats itself one way or another.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on January 08, 2023, 07:03:44 AMFast forward to 2023, someone I knew is expecting some kind of a new pandemic to put pressure on the world once again, he believed that the last pandemic was intentional, what do you think? It is of no use discussing the propaganda of the pandemic here since the discussion is about Bitcoin. Yes, the pandemic will prolly go down as one event that slightly affected Bitcoin in the last couple of years, though the effect was pretty minimal. Mind you that a similar event in the form of another pandemic doesn't have to/wouldn't happen to prove that history repeats itself, what that axiom means is that when we are in a bear market, events that hamper the price of Bitcoin occurs, and when we are in a bull market events that cause an appreciation in Bitcoin price occurs.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on January 08, 2023, 07:03:44 AMRight now some people are still waiting for more downside without any DCA so far, this is a very big risk if you ask me. I wouldn't call it risky because anytime is a good time to invest in Bitcoin, the only thing is they could miss out on some good ROI through investing pretty late.",

When bitcoin even falled to $3900 in 2020, it took only 1 hour to increased back above $5000 and later in increased back to $7000 and even above. Some people will fail to understand that people are strongly waiting for halving which will lead to another significant bull run while no or no much further fall this year.",

Well, this is wrong to think that another pandemic might happen soon but if that's his opinion, he's entitled to that. I'm not thinking that another pandemic might happen just to make the market better. It's too odd to think about that because we how most countries and poor people and even the rich ones have suffered from it.",

One guy who I won't mention by name here but his initials are G.S. (if you watch some youtube crypto you know who it is) goes from one channel to another as a guest and every few days pops up with the same bearish prediction. I saw him in 2022 saying that bitcoin would go to 12k before Christmas then before New Year, now he's saying that bitcoin will go to 9k in 2023. He's wrong but doubles down every time. Every time I see this guy I say to myself \"get this idiot out of my recommendations once and for all\"Bottom line, don't believe in any forecasts. Those who sold will tell you that it's going lower. Those who already bought or are holding will tell you it's going higher.",

However human psychology is the same and does not change with time and it is the most important factor to help history repeats itself. Pandemic is a borrowing reason (one of reasons) to dump the market.

Intentional or not, we can not say and need investigation but I'm doubtful that we will have good reports about reasons of the 2019 pandemic. I only know that the global markets including cryptocurrency market were dumped intentionally.A most clearest example is rude oil was dumped to negative price.Oil prices dip below zero as producers forced to pay to dispose of excessQuoteRight now some people are still waiting for more downside without any DCA so far, this is a very big risk if you ask me.
