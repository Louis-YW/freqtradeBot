  "content": "Hi guys. Check this!Please read from bottom to top - in that order. They never closed the match, so markets kept being open despite that match already was ended.. I did place a bet and found out that this bet would be 100% void.. could not contact them so because i wanted to bet on something Else i cashed it out.  If they really are that stupid, they would maybe have paid full winnings? I guess not. The 3 F’s in their slogan doesnt match here. Fun = nah, Fair = 100% No, Fast = not with figuring out their website often have matches open even they are finished. Its a handball match with 2 half of 30 minutes. I was sure this request would have taken 2 minutes but they keep bullying. This is the problem with Sportsbet.io. They have so many errors on their website but they act like its the first time they hear about this issue. 02:23You can make screenshots to your heart's content.Me: Can i get a copy of this chat?02:22We have double-checked everything and given you a detailed explanation with sources, I will close the chat now.02:21Me: Your own website showed the final result before i cashout my bet. Can’t you see that somewhere?02:21If you have no other requests I will close the chat.02:19This is the final say.In circumstances where there are conflicting statistics between data sources, we reserve the right to settle at the discretion of our trading team and the provider.(Link removed)02:19Me: Here is the official sourceWe settle bets at the discretion of our trading team and the bet provider.02:18Me: Betsapi is not official. They get their data from betting providers. No handball match is open for 8 hours02:17Is there anything else I can assist you with?02:16Our team double-checked and provided you with a source as an explanation for bet settlement. This is our final say regarding this matter.Me: By a mistake you had the markets open or the match reporter forgot to close the match..02:16Me: I placed my bet almost 3 hours after the match started02:15Me: My bet would have won, but the result was known already.. If i didnt cash it out, you wouldnt have paid me either since the result was known.Me: its a handball match 2 half of 30 minutes.02:14Me: Your own website even showed the full result when i cashed out the bet02:13Sir, we have provided you with a source.02:13Me: So according to you, the match lasted for 7,5 hours?02:13https://betsapi.com/rs/bet365/6889296/Viborg-HK-Women-vs-Team-Esbjerg-Women02:11The match started at 3:00 PM local time, ended at 10:30. You  placed the bet at 5:46.I'm double-checking with the team.02:07Me: I placed the bet on 1st half. Its a league match from my country (Denmark). I opened the television few minutes after the bet was placed and could see the after match interviews and could see the final score. The people who just looked into this, missed something02:06Me: What time did the match end, and what time did i place the bet? You must have timestamps02:03I did, this is our final answer. Is there anything else I can assist you with?02:03Me: the match was ended 20 mins before i placed the bet02:03Me: do your job02:02Me: PleaseSince I have not heard from you, I will now close this conversation. If you have any other queries, feel free to contact us again. Have a nice day!02:02Hence the cashout will stay in place and it will not be voided, sorry.02:00Thank you for waiting, our Sportsbet team looked into the matter, but did not detect any issue with the bet placement and the markets were accurate at the time of the bet.01:55Me: Tried to contact you before i cashed out but there was an error that didnt make the chat window pop up, so i took a Quick decision to cash out01:55Thanks01:53Ok, I will look into this.01:53Me: i believe in all fairness that this bet would have been void and that my cashout loss should be refunded, since the bet was not valid01:52Me:I placed the bet, but found out later that the match was already ended and that it was a mistake i was offered the option to place this beti then cashed it out for 60 USDT less01:51Me: this bet 654669a24149c60001c5bbcd01:51Hi",

      "body": "I got a little bit confused reading your chat log and not sure if I understand them correctly. Did you take screenshots of the conversation like what their live support said? Maybe things can be better understood if we read them in screenshot, it serves as a better evidence as well compared to a \"manually typed\" chat log [for the sake of technicalities, although I know you copied them either from emailed log or from their chat box].I'll PM someone from sportsbet to address this issue. Meanwhile, correct me if I'm wrong, the situation here was: you placed a bet, turned on your TV after placing that bet, and saw that the game is already finished. You... lose that bet and cashed it out with $60 less [because you're losing that bet] and argued that the bet itself should be voided because you placed them after the match ended and you being able to do so was due to a bug in their system?",

      "body": "Hi. Yes sorry i know its better with screenshots. You understood it totally correct. They claim the match was still going on at that time i placed the bet, which it wasnt. They first removed the match 7,5 hours later from the platform and claim that it ended there.

It asks me to sign in then it redirects me to the home page!Obviously, there is something wrong as a handball match can't last that long. The support agent should have known this and double checked with the team to figure out what's going wrong instead of rushing to close the chat without providing any logical explanation.In the other hand, you said \"you would have won\", so why did you cash out? You could have waited and you would either win or get your money back in full if the bet gets voided.",

You could have waited and you would either win or get your money back in full if the bet gets voided. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I agree with you. The reason i didnt wait was that i have been on multiple travels with this casino and i want to be on good terms with them. It turns out i maybe was too kind, since i should have done as you said.",
