  "content": "I am pretty confident enough to believe that my comment here (As quoted below) was never in any way off topic, nor was it garbage. I am not a professional trader, but I have carried out trading before in both crypto (future trading and spots, as some CEX will call it) and forex. I have gathered some good experience that can help me now, even if I wish to start trading again. From the experience and education I got in trading generally, I still try to pass it on to some users here.I have practised very well on a Demo account and even made a lot of successful trades, but after I switched to a real trading account, I was not making as many successful trades as I did on the demo account, even with the fact that I was just using a low leaverage. My comment below (on the quote) expresses that you can make successful trades in a demo account, but when you switch to a real trading account, there is every possibility that you might not be making as many successful trades as on the demo practise account.If the comment was not off-topic or a wrong statement, then what was the reason for it being deleted?Â Oftentimes, I also see that some of my comments were being deleted but I don't receive notification for it, I only realize that my post count has reduced by some number of post, my question is why don't I receive notification for every deleted comment? I appreciated a moderator's reply. Thanks.Quote from: Bitcoin ForumA reply of yours, quoted below, was deleted by a Bitcoin Forum moderator. Posts are most frequently deleted because they are off-topic, though they can also be deleted for other reasons. In the future, please avoid posting things that need to be deleted.QuoteQuote from: greengrassis on July 02, 2023, 08:13:29 PMDefinitely yes, although more likely even styles, not types. Before starting to actively work with the broker from Amarkets, I worked quite actively on a demo account in order to improve my performance.No matter how good your performance is with practising your trading ability on the Demo account, even after you switch to the real trade and use a very high leaverage, like the OP said he's been using a high leaverage of 100, you will likely encounter some significant losses any time the market takes a slight turn against you. Using a high leaverage means two things are involved: either a huge loss at once or a huge profit at once. So, if you get lucky with your strategy and the trade is successful with your High leverage, that means your profit will be huge.Cheers ðŸ¥‚, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘º",

After a day I received a message that your post has been deleted, and after that I never replied to post even for warning others. It's always recommended to reply those posts which are active and there have been replies in those posts in last 30 days because those posts are useful and can be helpful for other forum members.I don't think that it's necessary to bump very old threads unless you're the original poster of the thread. To @OP, I think your post was deleted because it was a reply that bumped a very old thread and that's why your reply was deleted, and there isn't any problem with your reply other than this. I think it's always better to reply current posts instead of the old ones because for them the best place is archival board.",

You have no right to question the judgement of the moderators.I disagree with you on this, and this kind of response looks unprofessional to me. This forum is a place where we are all allowed to speak out our minds on whatever topic or situation we find of interest. We are all humans here in the forum, and the moderators are also humans too. As humans, we all make mistakes sometimes, and the moderators are not immune to that. So long as the question is not in any way insulting to the moderators, the OP has every right to ask for clarification where it might seem confusing to him.Â I have come across similar cases here on the forum where the OP seems to get some kind of punishment they believe they did not deserve, and you being such a member without asking questions will never understand what you did wrong in order to avoid such in the future.Â By creating this thread by the OP, both the OP and others who could have made a similar mistake of commenting on a long dead thread or quoting someone whose entire post is junk, which will lead to comment deletion, will definitely learn from this.Quote5. Don't proof you know everything or you're above mistake, accept being corrected and move onI guess this is the major reason why such a thread is being created: for clarification purposes, to stand to be corrected where mistakes have been made, and to know that no one knows it all.",

My comment got deleted; it was not off-topic; it might not be of a very high quality like @MK4 said, but since it's not a shit post, I was just asking for the opinion of others as to why it was deleted. which I also said that I would appreciate if any moderator responded to it. Remember that I did not say only moderators should respond to me; I did not even make it a must that a moderator respond to me. So in what sense are you saying I should write to theymos?Just imagine that you log into your account any day and you see that you only have two posts, two activities, and two merits on your account. What will your reaction be? I believe you will create a thread demanding to know what really happened to all your earned merit, activity, and posts. By creating such a thread, why will you want to question the forum moderators if they decide to reduce your merit and activity for only the reasons best known to them? Â   @348Judah, just chill, okey? Â This thread was not to question the judgement of anybody, but just to know what resulted in the deletion of such a comment. Now that I have been cleared on the matter, I think I need to lock the thread. Thanks for every response I got here; it was all helpful apart from the attack I got from you, @348Judah, but is fine, I didn't take it to heart Â .At least next time I see this kind of comment being deleted, I should know the reason behind it.EditedQuote from: Poker Player on July 12, 2023, 03:01:11 PMCould it be that it happened because he was citing a post that got deleted due to necro-bumping or some other reason?
