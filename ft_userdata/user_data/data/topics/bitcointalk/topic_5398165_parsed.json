I've never used any of the dozens of casinos that are advertised here, nor do I know how they work, but I think this: What's better for a casino than to evade every kind of income tax with electronic cash, and have set this business up anonymously? And the niche is, unfortunately, very similar. Most see bitcoin and cryptos in general as gambling-investments-opportunities-whatever.",

I think we should just enjoy the incentives until it lasts on this forum, be it from gambling or not from gambling. As long as those gambling sites are paying, and others like Chipmixer and Bestchange, we should enjoy until it lasts. But our focus should be about bitcoin boards and other board existing on this forum in a way to keep it quality and clean. Just my opinion.",

Perhaps this online gambling industry suits the crypto world which makes gamblers gamble in the easiest way and the reason gambling businesses exist and saw that they have a potential here to make money and become a popular gambling casinos they need to market their brand name here.",

Since forums are for them on the top of the channels to use (with social networks) it's normal to see them here more than other business types.Ranking in Google's SERPs can literally cost you half a million dollars for the gambling industry (without a guaranteed result). Gambling, loans, and forex are the more rewarding but the most difficult niches to rank (hence all the SEO spams on the www).In a forum, they have the targeted audience they're looking for and the ratio of money/return is quite good for them.

In Spain online gambling was regulated in 2011, in Italy in 2010, and in France the same year. If we see that bitcoin started in 2009, it is not strange to think that what was operating under the table before those years moved on to gambling with cryptocurrencies. I haven't looked into it recently but I doubt very much that most of the houses that advertise here are 100% compliant with the licensing and player acceptance laws of certain countries with strict online gambling laws.As the oldest and largest bitcoin forum, it is not surprising that cryptocurrency gambling houses found it an ideal place to advertise apart from other reasons that have already been discussed.",

      "body": "Quote from: Ratimov on May 11, 2022, 10:54:52 AMI'm not sure if this issue hasn't been discussed before, but I'll try anyway. Why is gambling advertising delayed more often than others on this forum? I now mean advertising in signatures. For 10 new campaigns - 9 from the world of gambling, casinos, bookmakers, etc. Other services come across very rarely, and if they do appear, they exist for a short period of time and then leave this forum. The BestChange and ChipMixer campaigns are rather an exception to the rule, advertising non-gambling services that have existed here for years. Everything else is gambling.Even in 2021, when the industry attracted a huge amount of funds, an insane number of services and projects were opened, but all this was not on the forum, again, almost the same casino advertisement. One might think that the forum is simply not attracted by advertisers who would like to advertise their product in this format, but gambling projects feel good here, they are regular here and can last for long months, unlike advertisements for mixers, exchanges, tokens, etc.The short answer...  Online casinos in crypto are making a fortune off those seeking riches.  I'm sure a majority of the users in their campaigns are probably also addicted gamblers looking to give away their signature earnings at the chance of a jackpot.  So you have to wonder how much is really leaving these casinos due to these campaigns.  You could even make the argument that signature campaign users eventually turn into loyal customers.  That makes the signature campaigns as much about getting new users to try their service as it is paying them to advertise to others.  As far as the money laundering operations...  There are lots of scammers here and they are constantly pestered unless they use alt accounts and mixers, so that's where their cut of the pie comes from.  Personally, I think at least the gambling operations aren't benefitting from scams here and are providing some entertainment.",

Everything else is gambling.If there are exceptions to something, then it means that the other possibility exists, that is to say that if there are projects besides gambling related ones that thrive off marketing on the forum (could be one or two), then there can be more regardless of the idea that the forum users are more interested in gambling or there are better marketing options for non gambling related projects.Maybe if those other projects take a page from BesChange or Chipmixer play book then they could get quality advertisment on the forum and reach out to the right audience through quality marketing.",

This is why gambling signatures last longer than any other campaign because they produce results and generate a lot of money.Take a look at Bitlucy, which launched a few weeks ago and received 4k new registered users from BTT alone, demonstrating how many positive outcomes these guys are receiving. I'm not sure why they decided to stop, but I'm a new user and I really like their market options.I don't think Bestchange and Chipmixers have that many users from here using their services; I believe they make their money from sources outside the forum. I've used Bestchange a couple of times to exchange BTC to PayPal funds, but I'm not sure how frequently users from here use their services compared to gambling sites.",

And I am sure am not alone  In fact, even Bestchange, the first time I got to know about it and used it to get an exchanger with good rates was after they had launched a signature campaign here. I was even more surprised to discover that the exchange monitor was more than 10 years old, and I didn't know it before.",

Google ads/websites is more strict since they need some requirements of laws, licenses etc of the casino, in this forum you only need enough money to advertise. Mixer however isn't a company and some people see it as illegal, moreover most people doesn't care with privacy (less clients). Due to less clients, that's why only few mixers want to launch advertisements.Quote from: igehhh on May 11, 2022, 10:25:29 PMthe majority of the users here are gamblers, with only a few exceptions. I tend to disagree, even we've seen gambling boards is really crowd and people were discussing about sports, slots, poker, casino, etc. But actually most of users there aren't really a gamblers, but their sole purpose is to fill the campaign requirement to post in gambling boards. If the campaign didn't ask they need to post minimum of 5-10 to gambling boards, I believe most users will move to Altcoin discussions since it's more easier than gambling boards.",

Mixers are seen more clean than using it to mix bitcoin that was received by scammers. So I see this in another way, I believe this forum have many users and friends to this forum users that have high amount of bitcoin they do not play with in a way they are having the correct practices in a way they just have to use a mixers to maximize their privacy means of holding and using bitcoin.Quote from: igehhh on May 11, 2022, 10:25:29 PMI don't think Bestchange and Chipmixers have that many users from here using their services; I believe they make their money from sources outside the forum.

This is about crypto based casinos and we really think that there is quite a bit of money circulating there which might come from forum users believing that they will get good privacy without involving banks to gamble.On average altcoin projects don't pay their campaign participants with bitcoin, they pay participants in token or coin especially when their project is successful. They don't need to have capital to finance the promotion because actually they will only pay with tokens or coins at the end of the campaign. I can say that most altcoin projects don't have much capital to pay campaign participants for weeks in bitcoin and it makes sense why not many altcoin campaigns pay them in bitcoin.Quote from: The Pharmacist on May 12, 2022, 06:34:55 AMObviously dark market operations aren't going to advertise here (even if they were allowed to), so what does that leave you with?  Casinos, mostly, so that's precisely why most of the sig campaigns are gambling-related.  And yeah, there's tons of money to be made so those casinos kind of have to advertise themselves in order to get their name out in the public.  There are so many of them that if one didn't advertise, they'd probably be forgotten unless they had a dedicated user base.The promotion of a campaign about casino or gambling is also considered to be one of the most serious as compared to an altcoin campaign. The large cash circulation in the casino has been able to benefit the owners which in the end they can run the campaign longer than some altcoin campaigns with bitcoin payouts.",
