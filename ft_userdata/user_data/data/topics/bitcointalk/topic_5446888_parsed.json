I am happy to pay for a tracker but want it to be worth it - thinking of going for the number 1 pick on the list below, it is £11 per month which is fine with me as long as it does everything I want it too.https://geekflare.com/best-crypto-portfolio-trackers/",

It will require you the hardware wallet itself of Ledger Wallet and you have to download and connect it to your HW and it does the tracking. I've been using it as soon as they've updated it and I find it convenient. It has the desktop and app version.",

      "body": "Many cryptocurrency investors do pay for apps to track their portfolio. It's important to find an app that meets your needs and preferences. It's great that you are willing to invest in a paid tracker if it has the features you want. However, before committing to a paid app, you might want to do some research and try out different free and paid options to see which one works best for you. Some popular paid apps for tracking cryptocurrency portfolios include Blockfolio, Delta, and CoinTracking. It's always a good idea to read reviews and compare features before making a decision",

There's no risk of losing your funds as long as you're giving them read-only keys (keys that don't allow them to withdraw or trade your funds).But then, there are some privacy concerns. Can one really trust these services with such data? Probably not, regardless of what their privacy policies say.",

      "body": "I currently use Coingecko and it is not bad but their 'total cost' is incorrect. For example , I buy £100 of a crypto at £1 and then sell it all when it reaches £2 - it says £100 profit which is correct but it then says total cost is £100 but it should be £0 as I have nothing left in the investment. This is just an easy example, it is confusing when I have multiple transactions in an investment - the profit / loss is correct but the total cost is wrong and that is big deal for me as I like to know exactly how much I have in an investment after all my buying and selling.",

Some users might prefer paid options for better features, support, and user experience. It's great that you found WalletNow to be worth the token purchase, as it offers various features like tracking NFTs, multiple EVM chains, custom farming pools, and Binance API integration.As for the number 1 pick on the Geekflare list, CoinTracker, it's a well-rounded crypto portfolio tracker that supports 300+ exchanges and over 10,000 cryptocurrencies. It offers real-time market value tracking, cost basis accounting optimization, and tax-loss harvesting support. CoinTracker also provides performance charts and daily portfolio updates. If you're willing to pay £11 per month and these features align with your needs, it could be a good fit for you. Ultimately, the choice depends on your personal preferences and requirements. It's worth trying out a few options, both free and paid, to find the one that best suits your needs.",

As i wasn't active trader and just watching portfolio can be fun but at the same time very opposite of relaxing.Automatic wallet tracking on multiple wallets etc sounds cool but there were lots of little bugs at the time that made it pointless to pay more for features that weren't really ready.I would still recommend free version of Delta App to check it out, and who knows, maybe they got their gliches fixed already.",

While other offering paid service I mean if we need more data It always good to purchase the paid subscription.",

But if you're not as active as you may seem, I don't think it's worth it. Those features that you're gonna get upon the paid version could be helpful in your monitoring purposes. However, if the free version is enough, I don't think that it's needed to spend a few bucks for a monthly subscription not unless you're totally okay with it and you can afford it. Usually with these paid subscriptions, there will be a time in your life that you'll have to cut it because of your busy schedule and you're not getting anymore of the worth of what you're paying for.",

But for others, I dont think its worth a money subscription. Maybe could use free one like coingecko and coinmarketcap. These are free and only needed email to put up a monitoring for tokens. Unless you wanna connect your wallet with it. Its not that the same or live but the delay isnt much difference.",
