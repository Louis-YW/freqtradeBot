If you want to start a trading service on the forum, you will need to move the topic to currency exchange board and then send money for escrow, or at least go first to trusted members. However, if you have any things that prove that you are reliable, it is better to submit them.",

World is small and info not so safe even here the Admin has the info of all the users.Belive me If too many people start losing and people who use this kind of services has some money then i assume they got some power and contacts they can find you.Don't forget many things people been frauding online for example cloud mining and they been visited in their homes and not a nice way and they been making \"free will agreement\" to pay back and more the money they took it.World is small and everybody knows everybody and every person background and contacts are quite visible.Everything will be good until you mess round with trust belive me many people who have stole from the wrong people wish now they would't doing that but it's too late and let's learn from other people mistakes not making the same mistakes what others did.btw...we need service like i discribed here we want freedom and privacy and borker who can really get things done meeting with people and helping them and sometimes it's not about crypto alone but also there is many other services or help what people might need but there is nowhere to turn to get some help.For example it's not maybe the best idea but in USA a lot people need a plumbers but when they make phone call they just wait probably there is some skilled plumbers but they are not in contact with each other and this is the biggest problem in the world now.So let's start you come to us you tell what you need then we collect all the requests and start making database so we will put together the \"demand and supply\" And cryptocurrency is best way to do that.Quote from: CryptSafe on November 28, 2023, 10:08:58 AMWriting such a lengthy article would not get you what you want here but what are your track records, do you have the reputation established already to handle such here.

I don't think they will do that so my service will be different and special and fully dedicated to partners and customers with their needs off course we don't provide services like buying fast food to you or some other silly request it's not a fun service its a serious service",

In database no names no other info then just the request and description of need or service of the partner clients.Only number or Code we all have just the Code you need to know your Code your name will be number.Well it's pretty much like the secret service operating no names only the number or Code.And very similar system with how the goverment have nuclear codes system sometimes it doesn't need to think everything ourselfes we see what works allready and we might just copy paste someone else actions. We just look how the secret services and spy groups operating \"copy paste\" and we do it good they use those methods for power and influence and for money but we will use for privacy and helping out the people in need.",

There are laid down procedures long in existence that must be followed and courtesy demands that you do the needful if you must be in tandem with the community. And lastly, I heard you mention serious service and not fun service and I am happy you mentioned that because the last time I checked your announcement thread it looks like one not serious about their service they render but  rather a poor coordinated introduction with no identity to reckon with. So now who is making a silly request here?",

There is no information about the stages of completion of operations, the fees charged, or even the size of the business to be managed.Even with the availability of information regarding the identity of the work team, and even after verifying its credibility, this remains insufficient to fully trust the business because their qualifications to manage this business must be proven by learning about their experience in the field and the reputation that they have.",
