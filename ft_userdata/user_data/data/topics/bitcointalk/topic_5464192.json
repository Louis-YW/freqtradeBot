Market can have a short term shock which will do affect all market and Bitcoin trading, price and volume will be affected too but in long term, Binance will be like one piece of history. If Binance goes away, another exchange will replace it as a new biggest one and the cryptocurrency market will keep operating.",

I don't think so since the majority of bitcoin users and whales are not on centralized exchanges, but the news and shock will create a move that can make a little difference on the market considering the worth of asset that will be laid off due to this ugly scenario if it ever happened.",

This has a chance to happen if they are putting their eggs only in one basket. For sure it will be a collapse for some time but it can recover if someone were to take its place. For sure there are the majority of users of Binance that will find somewhere else, probably with a decentralized exchange now which is getting more popular. I hope people would get a hang of handling their own BTC.",

The people who are going to face the most troubles are those who hold their funds in binance and the users who hold too many shitcoins.Binance collapsing means people using the exchange as a bank are going to lose their funds, and many shitcoins are going to collapse out of the market with it, BTC has its many usefulness and this can't affect the network in itself, but because there are so many people using BTC on binance, the price of BTC is going to drop temporarily, so you can buy more coins if that happens. Shitcoin holders and people who don't hold funds in self cusody are the ones that this is going to affect the most if it happens.",

With Binance's high trading volume, its challenges might lead to caution, causing short-term dips. Traders might shift to other exchanges, influencing prices.It will definitely affect the entire cryptocurrency space because we can’t deny the fact that most naive people have come through binance to cryptocurrency. Just like what _act_ pointed out, bitcoin will definitely bounce back after it will have face a long period of uncertainty in price but as for Alticoins they are some that will definitely collapse because most of this exchanges are where there are stored so many will lose this coins totally. Also the adoption rate will be affected for a bit because of the name binance has created for itself. The biggest losers will definitely be traders using the exchange.The positive side will be that many people will be looking for new exchanges and That is where the advocation of decentralized exchanges will come into play and probably will grow its adoption. Overall the market will experience almost similar scenario like the Mt Gox collapse",

And I am also agreed on some of your points that fall of Binance would bring fall of temporary fall in market. As in many of the previous events we have seen that Binance has great impact on the market. So, there is no doubt in your topic. We should not only be aware of the changes happening with Binance but other exchanges too. Because sometimes, hype of one exchange is just a cover for another. I am talking about Houbi exchange.",

Remember, this is just speculation, not financial adviceIf Binance faces trouble then market will also face trouble. We have seen many past events in which market was dumped but the news or I should say bad news coming from Binance. For example a recent news of not getting withdrawal from Binance in Europe using SEPA or Euro is also troublesome for the users and one user who was getting replied from a bot then corrected by human support that these deposits and withdrawals are working and will work for 25 September and Binance announced by then they will find an alternative to it.But the point is in the journey and in thus tension many other people stuck and many transaction got struck. AFAIK. If I am wrong then please correct me. But stucking and halting the withdrawals in BTC become a huge headache for the market too. And this is not something new as in May when a huge amount of transactions were halted due to Ordinal problem then at that time Market faces a lot of pressure and due to less demand and more supply price fluctuated highly. And after that the US sued Binance. And that sue case also made market so volatile.",

It was learned that during the collapse of the FXT exchange, the crypto market was under pressure because of that, and that got Bitcoin and crypto projects to fall badly because of the FXT collapse. Bitcoin went from $21k - $16k in the following weeks. And all the crypto projects fell by 22% in less than a day. Having said that, if FXT exchange can have bitcoin fall in price from $21k- $16k, and other crypto projects fall in price by 22%. what now happens if the number one exchange \"Binance\" collapse? It will be a big catastrophe in the crypto market that the whole world won't stop talking about how bitcoin price fell drastically.",
