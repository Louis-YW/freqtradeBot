  "content": "A look at the stats shows that the month January could be the best since 2013, or the best since Bitcoin exists. I mean only the months of January. In 01.2013 with +44.05% and currently at about 43%. There are still a little more than two days to go, so it's possible.

Based on the growth that have taken place through the month we're to cross $25k. The resistance level seems to be at $25k. Growth percentage of bitcoin is on a cycle and now it is getting repeated. Based on which we can expect good bounce in the upcoming months even though the halving is scheduled for the year 2024.",

It was so close... But the 24,000$ mark couldn't be surpassed yet. Then a little correction came and brought bitcoin to the price you mentioned above. Investors just need to put some more pressure on their buy orders and they can overcome the 24,000$ wall.Everyone else just have to keep holding. Without short trades, we increase the chances it's going to happen in the next 48 hours, so this month will be a historical one!Quote from: AmoreJaz on January 29, 2023, 09:33:07 PMthough 40k level is still far from happening, but we are only one month over this year. It's true. It's only the first month of the year, what means bitcoin is just beginning.",

We are not yet sure whether this industry would be able to fully recover this year given that the anticipated increase would be on next year thru Bitcoin Halving. But I am still glad that after months of this market being down, we again saw green marks over this industry and that is a good indicator. More likely, if there would be good things to happen in this industry, we may see atleast half of their ATH price to be reached before this year end. Still a long way to go in the first place and many things could still take place as this year continues.",

This time we are already on profits mergin, but not being a short term investor is what motivates our current standing as none DCA inspired bitcoin holders and at that the price of Bitcoin doesn't move us any more. But also we can say that it is too early to start predicting a bull run and pahaps we should take this current market situation as bitcoin trying to rebound back to a significant price high, that will sustain it future events and making a push to an ATH when the market have enough liquidity to sustain a new high.",

But that's okay, bitcoin still has time to rise higher, and this is proof that bitcoin will go up slowly.Be patient, everyone, hold on tight to your bitcoin and hopefully, in the next month, the price of bitcoin can penetrate $ 24k and $ 25k well and continue to slide up. This January, the bitcoin price has attempted to increase from $15k to $23k, and there is still plenty of time for the bitcoin price to keep increasing. And we can still buy bitcoin at the current price. And it could be that $24k will be closing this January, so in the next month, there is more opportunity to increase the price again.",

What do you think?It quite doesn't matter what I think because prices can go up or they can go down and such a short period of time is not possible to predict: until end of January are just 2 more days. For such a short period of time, it's somehow like 50% chance each for increasing prices or decreasing prices. Maybe a bit more chance to increase in value because Bitcoin's fundamentals are designed like that (numbers go up) but it's not possible to make an educated prediction when just 2 days are left. We can say one thing for sure: A very positive (green) January is an extremely bullish sign for 2023, especially since Bitcoin's next halving is only 1 year away.  Quote from: MinoRaiola on January 29, 2023, 08:59:41 PMQuelle: https://de.cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-sees-worst-monthly-close-in-2-years-as-traders-watch-16-7kWhat's Quelle, do you mean source maybe?",

And it seems the current trend is upward. I think the price would easily surpass $24,000 within this month. Even if the month closes at $24,000 only, the record is already broken. Coingecko's price of Bitcoin on January 1, 2023 was $16,600. If the month closes at $24,000, that's already above 44.05% of growth. That's a new record.",

It is a difference but too tiny.And it's better if you compare between two bearish years or between two bullish years. 2013 and 2017, 2021 or compare 2023 with 2019 and 2015.Lastly Bitcoin volatility looks to be shrinked and less wild than past few years and early years since it was tradable after 2pizzas event.The Mayer Multiple Chart shows this https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-mayer-multiple/",

Maybe at the end of 2023, we will see Bitcoin around $30,000 after it recovers from the correction.A big bull run will be in a halving year so 2024 will be a very great and exciting year for us.I am not worrying about how Bitcoin will move in 2023 but I am focusing more on my plan to DCA Bitcoin. I don't want to miss a 2024 and 2025 bull run.https://dcabtc.com/",
