      "body": "The main reason why the bitcoin miners are failing is the electricity price all over the world. Especially the European and US miners are hit by this constant surge in energy price. But it's good to know that their bitcoin mining business is still cash flow positive. I am not sure how long it will remain the same. It's always unfortunate when a company has to file a bankruptcy. But here the only silver lining is that the bitcoin mining is still profitable. Hopefully they will be able to pay back their debt through mining. The chances are slim but worth a try!",

Futures contract in electricity then! But if things will change in 2023, the situation may become even worse it seems. Energy price is constantly showing an upward trend so in 2023, if the miners need to renew their contract, that will be much higher than the existing price. So the industrial miners will then have to face further issues with their cash flow. From what you know Franky, do you think 2023 is going to be bumpy for crypto market?",

One of the positive aspects of crypto mining is it being very mobile and able to locate anywhere on the globe with an internet connection. This made it well suited to target surplus forms of renewable power. Which in turn helped fund the expansion of renewables around the globe.This issue is much bigger than crypto mining. And carries a potential to negatively affect many separate industries.",
