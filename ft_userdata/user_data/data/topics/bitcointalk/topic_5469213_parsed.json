But some tips:1. NEVER use a script that sends your seed to some web page. THEY CAN STEAL YOUR FOUNDS!2. Don't try to program anything if you don't know how to.3. Don't use code generated by an IA. Just look for some tools already done.",

It's better if you trust those experts and their tools rather than trust AIs.Trust or not, like LoyceV warned you, use those tools offline.If I use those tools, I will only use it for a word in problem, not use it for all of mnemonic seed phrase because other words are fine, no need to test and take risk unnecessarily.Rather than going to the list words for like BIP39, I can use those tools to save my time with less words for one or two letters typing for search. Then I would like to manually use those possible words when I testing manually with wallet import.",
