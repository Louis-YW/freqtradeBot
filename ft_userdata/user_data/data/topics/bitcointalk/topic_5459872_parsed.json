You will reach a point where you really need to update The firmware, and Ledger Live, which may mean that you agree to Ledger Recovery in one way or another.If you do not trust HW to install all new updates, it is better to buy a new hardware wallet or use AirGaped system.",

      "body": "I doubt any Ledger user here still uses Ledger Live, or even Ledger products. I assume you're well aware of their latest recovery fiasco, so just use Electrum if you still planning on using your hardware wallet or move on to another one. I do recall somebody claiming their Ledger failed to connect with Electrum properly with outdated firmware. While there is a solution I'd second the suggestion to look for other options other than Ledger as of now. CMIIW.You can also build your own cold wallet setup with Electrum. It takes some time to learn but it is worth compared to risking your funds to some unverifiable firmware update that might expose your seed without concern.",
