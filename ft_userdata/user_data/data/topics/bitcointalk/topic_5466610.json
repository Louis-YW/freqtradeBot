Apple has just unveiled iPhone 15 which is estimated to cost about 0.031 BTC with the current price. Comparing the price of previous iPhone to bitcoin, you'll see the important of investing in bitcoin than buying assets that depreciate in value overtime. Of course, the risk of investing in bitcoin can not be overlooked just like any other investment but the bitcoin risk is worth taking.This image below was taking from Coingecko comparing BTC needed to buy iPhone over the years.Imagine holding the BTC that you used to buy iPhone 4s till the present day and see the number of iPhone 15 you can acquire with it. If you have not started investing in bitcoin, this is the right time to start.",

This is because they compare Bitcoin with USD price, not stick in Bitcoin equivalent.",

One thing I believe in life is, nothing is risk free but how to manage and maintain the risk is the most important thing. Investing in bitcoin is always the best than materialism.",

The 64 GB version had a price of $399, this was what was what they call now as iPhone Pro Max. The newly launched iPhone Pro Max in 2023 has a price of $1,199 in the US. So after 12 years, it came around to an annual inflation rate of 16.7%. Whereas Bitcoin as we all know inflation is not an issue with Bitcoin as seen in the chart posted by the OP. I am wondering now what will happen after the next halving. Next year iPhone will again launch a newer version and that might well cost less than the present one. BTW, the new version has a powerful chip that you can play games that need a console. This is the first batch of iPhones that will have, Made in India marking on them.",

Imagine you would make it in terms of rice. A metric ton is around $500, which means you could buy 50 tons of rice today with 1 Bitcoin whereas in its very early days you would just have gotten a few kilograms for 1 Bitcoin. I think the funniest meme will always be the pizza meme because it's easily understood and also funny because it's food and however long it took that person to eat the pizza, one can put themselves in the shoes of the pizza buyer and think about every bite he took back then and how much it cost him to chew those bites.",

This is a matter of finances, where the responsibility for one's financial condition lies with the individual. In other words, even if you advocate that Bitcoin is superior to traditional banks, you cannot be held accountable for those with weak hands; it's not a solution, is it?Influencing others' decisions to join us, yet not taking responsibility for their financial well-being, makes us appear callous.Let Bitcoin attract its own true investors. Those who purchase Bitcoin should ideally be individuals ready to face the risks and stand proudly with Bitcoin, even if their goals aren't met.

If you have not started investing in bitcoin, this is the right time to start. If someone was smart enough to hold that many BTC then that person could buy more than 5225 iPhone 15 in todays date, but there are only few people who really hold more than that amount in Bitcoin and they aren't interested in Apple devices. iPhone is just an example we can compare that rate to many other things and the answer would be similar because the ones who hold their Bitcoin don't really spend them on things like iPhone or anything else. Only few people knew that Bitcoin could grow so high in value after a decade and that's why creating threads like this doesn't really make much sense to me. But, if someone really invested in Bitcoin even after 2015's then that person would be a millionaire this day if he/she has hold his/her Bitcoin till this day. I agree with the final part of the thread if someone hasn't invested in Bitcoin till this day then that person should start investing in it with further delay.",

What are you going to use 15 that you can't use 14 for? I will tell you why, its going to be a symbol, a brand, \"I have the latest iPhone\", nothing more. That is why people will buy, and its not just a few people, I mean billions of dollars, with a phone that worths a thousand, so think about how many people that is.

So just imagine if instead of buying them an iPhone, you chose to accumulate them overtime, then you could have bought a lot of property by now because of the highly expensive price of bitcoin. At least you’d know that property’s value won’t depreciate in the long run, unlike an iPhone that gets to decrease its value overtime.",

On the other hand, I think a lot of people choose luxury and buying expensive phones due to their kind of business some may consider investing on Bitcoin as a waste of time and money since they believe they can make use of their phone to run their business andake more profit within a short time other than investing on Bitcoin when they don't know when it will be due for profit.",

So, with $750, I buy bitcoin and got a profit when sold it on the next month. Actually, a cheap cellphone (Android at $250) is sufficient for our needs, Bought iPhone is just for style which can be covered by only a cheap phones.",
