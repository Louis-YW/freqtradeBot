Happy SundayEthereum has come to stay but what is of concern to me is all these newbies coming out now and thinking all these big cap projects are going to give them a life changing profit. You need to look for low market cap projects that can give them 20X to 100X return on investment. Ethereum and co have made people millionaires already you need new project that can make you million unless you are a millionaire already, just like the Doge, Shib, Pepe etc millionaires were made because they got in early.",

There’s no miners of it so the hype on this token is not that strong compared before when there’s a lot of interest to the project because of it’s mining profitability.

Happy SundayI agree with you, because Ethereum is the best altcoin to make a long term investment and with the current market conditions, this is a good opportunity to buy Ethereum at a cheap price, because I believe that in the future after the next bullrun occurs, then we cannot buy Ethereum at the current price and of course now is the right time to invest in Ethereum, so that we can get a lot of profit when the bullrun occurs.",

In your comparison, how do the ETH whales on POS differ from huge mining farms we had in POW? POS even has slashing to keep bad actors away. I haven't yet encountered anyone who has answered me about this. Maybe i am just ignorant but i would like to know, because right now if i had to guess this fud just seems to be coming from miners that are out of jobs.",

The price of Ethereum is still $1,743 in the market, and it will be favourable for anyone to buy and hold like 4 or 5 years before he or she can sell, because the price of Ethereum will reach $20,000 before the end of the 5 years.

In these five years many coins lost their trader trust but Ethereum is still most powerful altcoins and perhaps it is second after btc I will suggest for every long term holder. In the bull season Eth rised up above 4k$ to create ATH and after bad market situation its dumped to 1k$ also but if we see the current price then it is looking so healthy. Ethereum strong utility and usecase is the key to make it Trusty and coin for long term. i am holding in small quantity but in future looking to increase time hy time",

Etheruem has really been under estimated or under priced given that it has coins under its blockchain which is suppose to be a boost in price for it.
