  "content": "This is rather strange for me or maybe I really don't understand fully well how the systems truely calculated the activity of a user account. I have been here a short while but I have been very curious to seek for answer to anything I don't understand and recently I just noticed that the activity of some Â users in the forum don't pop exactly when its suppose to (2 weeks interval). I came to notice on my account and some other user of my same rank with same activities like mine haven't pop up yet as it is suppose to do so yesterday which it normally does or there are reason why it hasn't reflected yet and please I would like to know how this truely works. And please correct me if I have asked wrongly just wanting to know more, my curiosity just keep getting at me.",

I guess it was immediately after you did a post today that your activity changed. What that means is that you have to post at least once in a new fourteen-activity period for you to get the activity. If you don't post anything within this period you will miss that two weeks activity. The activity change is to a large extent perfect.

If I'm not mistaken.In addition, the number of posts that each one makes during these 14 days can be different.14 day time frame is same for every one which is an alternative Tuesday so if someone registered before the next session even before few minutes they can get extra 14 activities if they managed to make 1 successful post and activity. In long run this is completely negligible so users no need to give attention for unnecessary things. In fact I bookmarked the activity session period years ago but can't able to find it in mobile so hopefully one of forum AIs will post it sooner.",

For instance, if my activity was to increase on Wednesday but I didn't appear online on Wednesday and Thursday. On Friday, it will also not increase till I made a post.Op must have discovered that their activity did not increase, but after making a post about it, the activity later added. So, on the day of activity increment, you must be able to perform activity that day for the increment to be effected.",

Your activity equals minimum (post count, 14*n), in which n is the number of two-week activity periods in which you have made post. As long as 14*n is lower than your post count, your activity equals 14*n and that's why your activity doesn't increase with making a new post.
