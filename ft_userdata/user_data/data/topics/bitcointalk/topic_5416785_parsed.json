Not so large as to be unwieldy in the hand, but still of a size to command instant attention, as well as to afford a comfortable grip. The Belliver is balanced using a solid brass barrel liner to offer just enough weight for the pen to sit easily in the hand without becoming tiring during long periods of writing. The cap is lighter in weight, allowing it to post securely on the end of the barrel if you so choose. The section is gently tapered to bolster the comfort of writing with the Belliver.The Medical Sciences is crafted from hand made resin with an exclusive engraving covering the cap and barrel.A Latin inscription by the Greek physician, Hippocrates, “Ars longa, vita brevis” is engraved on the solid 18 carat gold cap band. This is the quote that Hippocrates wrote in the opening line in one of his book. The full quote is as follow: “Ars longa, vita brevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium difficile.” That would lead us to interpret the meaning of “Ars longa, vita brevis” as ‘it takes a long time to acquire and perfect one’s expertise (of medicine) and one has but a short time in which to do it’. Here we are reminded that we must continue to acquire and perfect the craft in the chosen field of medicine.The Medical Sciences Limited Edition is a perfect accessory for professionals in field of medical sciences as well as the appropriate gift for colleagues or clients who are wine connoisseurs and appreciate the art of fine living!Please refer to the review of this Conway Stewart pen on The Fountain Pen NetworkPlease refer to our other vintage fountain pen collections.https://pastpens.com/shop/conway-stewart-medical-sciences-limited-edition/",
