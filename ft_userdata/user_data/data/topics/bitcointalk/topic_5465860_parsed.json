Do you know that there is an unofficial rule that says \"No trolling?\". If freedom of speech is what you think it is, why will such a rule apply?Calling an idiot an idiot is not trolling. A bit more context:Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PMHowever, trolling isn't allowed. If a user is habitually posting obviously false nonsense (\"obviously false nonsense\" to an outsider, NOT to someone who follows or is involved in the discussion) just to stir up trouble, then it's considered trolling, which is prohibited. Such cases should be thoroughly documented in the report though (There are tons of reports that just say \"trolling\", but moderators don't have time to look through each user's post).To quote myself on the subject:Quote from: LoyceMobile on December 30, 2019, 09:29:27 PMJust recently, I saw several posts saying: \"I hope I'm not offending anyone\", and it's been on my mind for a while now.I only recently realized why this is so common in English. In Dutch, \"offended\" and \"insulted\" are the same word (\"beledigd\"). But lately, it seems like people treat the word \"offending\" as if it's \"insulting\".I'd say insulting isn't needed and makes you look bad, but being offended is a choice of the receiver, and honestly I'm offended by people who want to limit their own freedom of speech out of fear that someone might get his feelings hurt on the internet! Oh noes!It's okay to offended people! Offensive jokes are often funny. Don't let SJW decide what you're allowed to say or even think!Trying to be nice doesn't hurt you, but don't let someone's made up feelings stop you from speaking your mind.Quote from: LoyceV on July 08, 2020, 11:14:21 AMQuote from: muslol67 on July 08, 2020, 10:24:28 AMI can't agree with you. You can also gently criticize a person. To insult is only to insult, nothing more. And it is not right to talk about freedom of expression while insulting a person.I am insulted by the very fact that you think you can have freedom of speech without being allowed to insult someone. So by your own definition you're not allowed to say that!Luckily for you, you actually have the right to say pretty much anything you want on this forum. And as a Thick-Skinned Gang Leader, I can handle anything you throw at me.QuoteFor example, I insulted you and you did it to me. What's the matter here? What did the forum gain from this? When viewed from the outside, the forum is seen as a place where racism, neopotism and swearing are falling.It's the internet, I couldn't care less about your race. You can claim to be a Smurf if you want too. It can't be checked anyway, so why do you even care?I think I'm usually pretty friendly, and I usually don't try very hard to insult people. But I can understand why others do that, and I highly value their right to do so. If someone, especially in an anonymous environment, treats others badly, it tells you a lot about them. But how you handle it says a lot about you.QuoteDon't you really see these kinds of statements make the forum look bad?No. It's what makes this forum great and unique! If you don't like it, you may want to go to a heavily censored SJW forum where your fragile feelings are protected. Bitcoin is about freedom, and you can't have freedom to say what you want without other people having the same freedom to say what they want. Grow a thicker skin or choose to have a fragile ego hurt.I'm pretty sure there are already texts that you don't like embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain. It's okay. You don't have to read it. Why would you even bother to read things on a website if it insults you?Quote from: Zoomic on September 06, 2023, 01:10:50 PMHow about if the admin filter some keywords(foul words), such that when you use them, you will be handed ban. Such as 7days ban, few days signature ban, read only mode etc. This will promote peaceful co-existence and curtail to the barest minimum any form of bullying, unfriendliness, acrimony or as the case may be.I'm offended by your suggestion. Now you deserve a 7 day ban You should spend 2.5 minutes to listen to this guy: the only proper response to someone who says: \"I'm offended!\" is: \"I don't care!\".",
