  "content": "Apparently this is a true live event happened in my State this week and almost everyone is talking about it. About a young man that killed himself after a gamble loss, he even left a message for his family and friends before taking his life.  But I wonder why should someone take his own life  just because he lost  #2.5 million to gambling an amount  equivalent to just about $3k. I can relate to his loss but taking your life is something unimaginable and unjustifiable to do. No matter the regrets suicide isn't an option to be taking as a solution , you are only leaving bigger pains  behind for your loved ones.This is just another reminder to we all gamblers that no bet is sure and guaranteed, don't ever use an amount of money you are not comfortable to lose just because you feel convicted in your mind that the game will play as predicted. There's no such thing as sure bet in gambling.Question: Is there any amount lost that can make you commit suicide?If yes, then don't ever use such amount to gamble.",

It’s indeed a sad story, I’m pretty sure that he could have been done better things that would have helped him make more than that amount that made him commit suicide. Quote from: letteredhub on December 12, 2023, 11:29:30 PMQuestion: Is there any amount lost that can make you commit suicide?This is the same as asking someone “what amount will they sell their life for?” No amount should be worth one committing suicide even if it’s not related to gambling, we have seen billionaires turn into poor overnight and yet they are still alive trying to survive with the few things that they have. That’s just to say how priceless one’s life is.",

So before we blame it all on gambling,  let us also first of all consider the other factors that could have lead him into gambling and from the look of things,  it seems that the guy have issues with gambling addictions for him to have staked such an amount that he can't afford to lose,  but even at that,  the situation is not up to what should have lead him to take his own life for whatever reasons.",

No Matter what you loss you stand a chance to get 10x of it if you're still alive I lost an amount I can't afford to lose before though not in gambling but I felt depressed to some extent and one day I thought of otherwise but remember i have some many things i have not enjoyed.

The guy is a coward and selfish.  I feel sorry for those relatives he left since these people will bear the burden this guy had done.  This instance should teach us that too much gambling can lead to mental pressure that can lead to death.  Only gamble what we can afford to lose.

That is how some people are. People need to think not about the profit only but also if it would be loss. People should just not see gambling as a way to make money, it is a way to ruin oneself life if using it for money making. Gambling can not be used to make money. It takes than give.We have read and heard of stories like this and this may not be the last. People need to think of what will happen to them if they lose the money they want to spend on gambling before they gamble with the money at all.",

People have lost money much more than this and they maned up and face life along the way things changed for a better for them. Why lose money and also lose your life. The painful aspect about suicide is that it's the family of the person that bears the disgruntled pains you gonna leave behind for them. Losing money is never the end of life.",

I can relate to his loss but taking your life is something unimaginable and unjustifiable to do.I'm sure his life worthed much more than 3000$. Actually, life has no price. It's not possible to put any material price on life, because it transcends the material. It's so valuable that we don't even have words to say how valuable it is. For that reason, it's really sad to see people getting desperate and taking extreme measures like that. I understand he couldn't support the feeling of having lost the money, and he just wished to cease that aversive emotion, so he shutted off his own life in order to do so. Suicide is the most extreme measure to escape from an aversive situation.Now that his soul may rest in peace, and that his story can be useful for people in your region to promote mental health discussions among the youngsters and to teach them how to deal with emotions in a healthy and rational way, so stories like this don't repeat in the future. Lost money can be recovered, and that is not really the biggest of the problems. There will be always an opportunity ahead to make more money, but life is precious and unique, so let's preserve and maintain it in first place.",

The answer is no. There is no certain amount or specific amount wherein a person will kill themselves or commit suicide just because they lose such money in gambling; it will depend on the emotional state of the person. I think this guy in the article cannot take such losses. Maybe because the money he used is important or has something to spend on, but sadly he loses it in gambling, or really, this person is emotionally and mentally weak. I don't discriminate against the guy; I'm just saying that maybe he has weak emotions and mentality, and that's why he can't take the loss and result in suicide, which only weak emotions and mentality can do.Anyway, this should serve as a lesson to everyone: those who know for themselves that they can't take the pain or impact of losing such money should never ever think of playing gambling. If the money is very important to you, then don't enter this field because gambling is all about the risk of losing money.",

Unfortunately, some people cannot deal with the consequences they have caused and for them the easiest thing is to \"cease to exist\".Some cannot find the courage to take their own lives, and so they choose the world of abandonment, begging, and running away from their family.In any case, we can't judge people like this, the most we can do is sympathize with them and whenever we notice something similar in a relative or friend, offer help.",
