TBH, I don't think this project is a legit project due to its development time and ambiguity.Just like you, people in my country (Indonesia) have also started trading (P2P) this Pi coin, because of the unclear track record of the Pi coin, I also asked them, why would they want to buy a coin that doesn't even have utility and clear use case. Their answers also surprised me quite a bit that they also believed this Pi project to be an obscure project, but now that Pi is getting the Hype, they are taking this opportunity to take advantage of the idiots.Overall, buying and selling Pi coins is a Monkey Business (IMO)",

This is a fraud on people, it's also obvious that most people who don't know anything about crypto are being fooled in this matter.

Then, let's assume that this mining apps, why does it need to take the data of a user when it has no real value in the market? Something bad will be done to users' personal data information. But this is just my opinion @OP, don't be angry or offended by what I said, I hope you can understand it because I used to download it, but when it came to the point where KYC was required, I had second thoughts. until I decided to uninstall it from my mobile phone.",

There are some in my country who are trading Pi coins with each other and there are some who are using it to buy some goods like rice or anything in the store.I mean that's pure stupidity if you will ask me. The project has been there for a long time, users of the Pi app in android are constantly mining and until now, the coin has still no value yet. These so-called miners who aren't really mining at first place are the ones who are setting the value of that Pi coin which is worst than memecoins if you will ask me. I wonder how many Pi coins have been mined virtually by these so-called miners. I still remember the time where there are some users in Facebook saying that this Pi coin will reach 100$ in the future and in the end of their post, they will post their referral link . I'm curious why there are still people who are constantly believing that this Pi project will be a successful one .",

I don't think with Pi Mainnet have good future or not because still find with new way adapt kind of network between BSC or ERC, how ever with Pi Mainnet still not have planning will listing on market, maybe they try to make monkey business how Pi Mainnet reach expensive price one day later.",

Then what do you say Sir, the sale of pi is only for those who have passed KYC? what about those who saved pi before but didn't want to pass KYC because it's so difficult that you give the private KYC with no guarantee that it will be valued in the market, and the funny thing is, there is no market yet and there is a value of 0.3 $? what's up, it's not like we're fooling around here.",
