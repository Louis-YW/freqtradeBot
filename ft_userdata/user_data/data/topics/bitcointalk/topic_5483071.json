Just got to still keep some back up funds with you due to some expected expenses or unexpected ones.QuoteCyptrocurrency is a decentralized digital currency that is not accepted in most countries as a legal tender.as time goes on this won't longer be among the stuff that differs fiat from cryptocurrencies. Because cryptocurrencies are gradually evolving and more region are now involving in it. So a time would come when cryptocurrencies would finally accepted worldwide and bitcoin is helping in speeding that process.üòÅ",

Knowing fully well about this, it is easy to understand the differences of both currencies lies on one advantage or the other, that they poise to improve both of them at a point in time.1. Unlike cryptocurrencies that operates in an open-source cryptography technology which makes it extremely difficult to be controlled by cabals in the financial institution, the fiat currency is absolute issued and controlled the government and in the hands of the cabals in the financial institution. To a large extent these are the guys that move the market 2. Cryptocurrencies can also be refers to as the much needed alternative that was a monumental thought by the founder Satoshi to bring about freedom.

Because, in terms of security, cryptocurrency is prone to technical exploits and is based on encryption, whereas fiat is safeguarded by government rules and infrastructure.",

However, this is not a perfect thing most especially in the applications of it in the real world well just like the fiat currency under the control of the entity or the government behind it. As for fiat currency, you don't have to know many things before you can use it all because it is physical you bring in the paper money to any store, to the bank and you don't need to bring anything else to make a transaction. Compare that to cryptocurrency, here you must have some basic knowledge with technology behind it otherwise you run the risk of losing your coins or tokens.",

For example for fiat when you use the banking system it could actually be extremely high specially for high amounts. However it could be extremely low when you use bitcoin since the only cost is the on-chain fee and it is calculated based on byte size not the amount meaning you can transfer billions of dollars worth of bitcoin with only a couple of cents worth of fees.As for destruction, cryptocurrencies can be destroyed too. Look up burning coins and there is even something called Proof of Burn. There is also people making mistakes and losing their keys which is practically the same as destroying coins.",

I mean if you take payments via credit cards you depend on the credit card companies to accept your business model, there are long lists of business model that credit card companies don't support.With Crypto your business model is not relevant, it is really only between the seller and buyer.",
