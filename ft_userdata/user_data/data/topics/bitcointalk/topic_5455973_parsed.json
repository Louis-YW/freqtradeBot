I find it interesting to socialise with people who have similar interests to me. It’s obvious when you meet somebody if you click with them. It’d be weird if we all had the same personalities & views on life.",

      "body": "This classification will help individuals to understand why people behave the way they do and also assist to relate with them based on their unique temperament. But it is also good to state that some individuals exhibit two or more types of these classifications based on certain situations. Human behavior can be complex, dynamic, and unpredictable so to reduce conflict we shouldn't just rely on this proto-psychological theory as propounded by the Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen. They can portray a temperament today and tomorrow they will show something else based on certain conditions. Humans shouldn't be handled based on certain classifications because humans are too complex to be boxed into a group.",

      "body": "This is what makes human behavior beautiful because everyone is unique and has their own character. I'll never be the melancholic type of person because I know myself better. And with the characteristics that you've mentioned, I've got a few from it but a few of it as well doesn't belong to me. You'll start with your family and you'll see on how oriented some of them into what has described for the type of temperament that they've got and also with your friends and that's why when we know things that they don't, we would adjust. But some wouldn't mind adjusting after knowing the people they're dealing with.",

      "body": "the world itself is loaded with individuals of absolute different characters and this is as a result of their different goal orientation and their personalities.   Most of us have character swap just to adjust to a given situation, let's take for instance introverts will tell you how much they enjoy their privacy and all that because of their emotions, While the extrovert will joyfully tell you how much of life's adventure  they enjoy and really explore while engaging with other people. You will agree with me that it takes only a charismatic fellow who of course knows how to mingle with these two individuals (introverts/extroverts) without dangling with their emotions.       Be it as it may, let us all note that excessive exhibition of the above mentioned  individual trait always have a consequence whether we like it or not.       As a private individual we all at some point need other people but then how well   can  we cope better interacting with others regarding our emotions ?    While as a public person our excess interaction with people can equally take a wrong tole on us because we may not know when we are gradually selling out ourselves to the wrong people.   Conclusively I will suggest that individuals should watch and minimize their excessive character traits.",
