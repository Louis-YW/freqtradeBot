Is there a trading platform that has stable and reasonable fees?It depends on what is the exact amount reasonable and unreasonable for you because most of the CEX has a minimal in terms of maker and taker fees unless you have a problem with 0.0xx%ish then you need to increase our trading volume to get high tier trader status on exchange since exchange has a VIP system that usually cut those fee if you are contributing much on volume. I just saw this https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5396048.msg59966588#msg59966588 thread when searching about this  topic. He provides maker and taker fee on top centralized exchange.",

Depends on the exchange it self.If you're trading with top crypto, feel free to choice other exchange as alternative until you found a exchange with a good fee. Unless, you're token only can be trade on that exchange you cannot do anything.",

Is there a trading platform that has stable and reasonable fees?Fees on withdrawing your crypto should depend on its network, there’s a lot of network that offers a small fees for your withdrawal. Which exchange you are using that ask for bigger fees despite the network is cheap? Feed are not that big honestly if you do trading, just make sure you monitor it closely because you might make mistake on your transactions if you didn’t pat attention to the fees, some incidents before about paying huge feed higher than the transacted value, so be careful with this.",

Is there a trading platform that has stable and reasonable fees?Actually, the fees of trading both maker and taker are reasonable enough moreover in the top exchanges. If you find out unreasonable enough, it is better to move the assets to other top exchanges. Afaik, most top trading platforms like Binance, FTX, OKEx, Kucoin, and others have reasonable trading fees. However, if we are talking about withdrawal fees, sometimes, it really makes us super dizzy because of high fees. And this is commonly almost the same in all exchanges. High fees on the ERC20 network (Ethereum network) are commonly the ones that really require the holly high fees. Moreover they also commonly need a high minimum amount to withdraw. Except if the exchanges provide other networks to withdraw such as BSC, Tron network, SOL, and others. They are more reasonable.",

You may enjoy the low fees but you also have to suffer the slow transactions from low and mid tier buggy exchanges. A simple withdrawal that usually takes five minutes tops could take an hour because of liquidity issues or it may take you ten clicks to place an order because of bugs when you could normally do that on the first try on top CEX.",

Yes, although fees are important, we shouldn't focus on them so much that we overlook other services or select the wrong exchange for our needs. With today's leading exchanges such as binance, houbi, kucoin... in general, withdrawal fees are appropriate.In addition, to save you should avoid withdrawing tokens on ethereum networks and networks with high fees instead, you should choose networks like bsc, sol, tron… will help you save significant costs.",

For the Withdrawal Fee, you need to pick the right coin and network, for example if you want to Withdraw USDT with ERC-20 on most exchange the fee will be at least 1% but when you withdraw USDT but using BSC you will only charged for about 0.3$. Currently I think coins that used BSC network has the cheapest withdrawal fee, especially in Binance",

Is there a trading platform that has stable and reasonable fees? Take a look at the different trading platforms commonly used by citizens of your country, you can find them in the local board of your language. That way you will know which one is the majority in your local and use that more often. Withdrawal problems and all become more easier to cope with when you know your fellow countrymen might also be suffering from the same and it usually works out nicely. Besides, dont cheap out on fees, most of the well known exchanges have some fees which are reasonable enough, unless you are doing dust level transactions.Stable, yes the fees do remain fixed for most. Reasonable, that is a personal question, to me an exchange is doing a service, so they can fix a fee for that, but I will prefer ease of use and quick customer support and solution than being fussy over a couple of satoshis in fees.",

In general, the most famous and most liquid exchanges, on average, commissions are about the same. At least I did not see a straightforward difference in withdrawal fees, the commission maker, taker, etc., due to the fact that exchanges are constantly competing with each other. If you are not satisfied with the commission of large and well-known exchanges and you try to find where the commission is cheaper, then be prepared to expose themselves to additional risk, which will not be discovered immediately, but much later.",
