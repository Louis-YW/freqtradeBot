  "content": "GameGuru, the First Crypto Marketplace for eGift cards and Digital Gaming ProductsGameGuru aims to be the first crypto marketplace for eGift cards and digital gaming products. Digital card sales are a multi-billion-dollar industry with massive growth expectation: a turnover of $698.2 billion is expected worldwide in 2024. (Source : https://cdn.mageplaza.com/media/general/US3y9Xa.png)We have been in the e-gift cards business for many years as a vendor in various online marketplaces and we have seen the many limitations of the current system. Traditional marketplaces offer overpriced products, fraudulently obtained game keys (Labelled ‚ÄúGrey Marketplaces‚Äù) and, in most cases, none-instant delivery due to the high-risk of chargebacks and payment reversals.GameGuru, by relying on its own GGT token (BEP-20) as the only payment method, will be able to provide :Lower prices by waiving the commission of marketplaces such as G2A (6 ‚Äì 10% discount). The remaining profit margin (7 ‚Äì 12%) will go to the GGT token holders.Zero-risk products from vetted European wholesale suppliers.Instant goods delivery guaranteed through crypto transactions‚Äô irreversibility and API integration with the suppliers.We are currently working on our whitepaper and the development of the crypto-marketplace. As for the project website, we will launch it the next few days.Regarding the crypto-marketplace, we have already secured one of the biggest European suppliers and have already started integrating their API in the crypto-marketplace.Important Update :Thank you guys for the outstanding support.

Regarding the first CEX listing, we have already signed an agreement with Coinsbit.io. So, the listing will happen around late October ‚Äì early November.As for the marketing, we are negotiating with one of the top crypto marketing agencies in the market ( tokensuite.io). We are very invested in this project and will do everything we can to succeed. Unlike other crypto projects with private rounds and huge presales, we're investing our own personal funds into this project.",
