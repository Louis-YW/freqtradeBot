So he's announcing publicly! This is just to create attention to himself after these many years of being an ignoramus! Good sign though ðŸ˜€",

      "body": "Larry Fink is just one among many. We'll probably expect more conversions over the years. And I guess this is normal. I myself thought Bitcoin was a Ponzi. How many among us Bitcoin supporters immediately embraced Bitcoin the first time they encountered it?Many of us probably have this skeptical approach when confronted with something like a new currency or a new investment asset. We often start with a doubt. That's a helpful defense mechanism. It's because we have yet to thoroughly understand it. But as soon as we delve deeper into it, we get that it is indeed truly something. The most important thing is that Bitcoin is winning. There will definitely be more Larry Finks in the years to come, and the sooner they convert the better.",

That's a good sign of a businessman. Unfortunately, Mr. Warren Buffet is still holding onto his negative views on cryptocurrency. But that's understandable as he has reached an age where the learning stops and you start thinking yourself as the most wide man in the world.",

So just like Trump, he doesnâ€™t understand it and so he says something negative about it.Reminds me of when I first heard about Bitcoin. Basically I also assumed it was a scam. Because most of the headlines I read about it back in 2012-13 were negative. Then when I read about it and learnt how it actually works and why itâ€™s important, I started to change my mind.

At the time, Larry Fink was a staunch opponent of Bitcoin.It's laughable to be with an opinion that Bitcoin used for Money Laundering is \"bad\". Money Laundering by nefarious entities in itself is bad, yes, but the fact that Bitcoin can be used for Money Laundering effectively merely shows that \"Bitcoin\", as technically designed, actually WORKS. We should be comforted by the fact that our magic internet coins work as advertised.

Will it make a difference when people like Larry Fink are bullish and optimistic about Bitcoin? I don't think so.Some members of the rich elite are pro-Bitcoin, while others are anti-Bitcoin. This will never change and Bitcoin would never receive total recognition. Bitcoin will become a truly dominating financial asset(and a currency) when the \"average Joe\" starts using BTC everyday, not when people like Larry Fink, Warren Buffet or Bill Gates share positive opinions about BTC.",

So to do that, they have to change their statements first.Just like larry did here, and the 2017 statements is way old I think he would have got the lesson of not going against BTC in 2021 when many booked huge profits while he could do the same but did not availed the opportunity. But as of now, everyone wants to avail the opportunity so that they could make huge money.BTC will gain huge value afterÂ  the halving is done and the ETFs will be approved and when the people like larry who were latecomers and did not availed the opportunity, will also adopt BTC or will change their mindset just like larry did whenever in the future they will understand the potential BTC Have.",

It could also be that he has little or no information about Bitcoin as at then. Bitcoin standing the test of time has made him a believer and a bitcoiner.
