The newbie should invest small amounts of money for now even though they have money it still better to invest little amount to master the practical aspect of it. Newbies should not be carried away about the higher you invest the more the profit likewise should not forget that the higher the money the higher the risk involved, so is better to take cautious and they should also know that everything happens with time and they should never regret any opportunities that pasts them, they should be patient, focus, and never lose hope.",

DCA should also be done with a small amount from your income so that you don't buy bitcoin with your emergency funds and end up selling when bitcoin price goes below the amount that you bought.Bitcoin investment is a risky one, this is why you don't use big capital that you will need in the short run to invest, because it is not a get rich quick investment. Anyway, it all depends on your cash inflow and the responsibilities that you shoulder, that will determine the capital that you will use to invest in bitcoin. Personally, I only invested with the money that I don't need for a long time.",

Investment depends on your plan and strategy.No matter how much capital you use to own Bitcoin, if you don't use free money, it will be difficult to achieve your target. in the sense that investment must achieve your investment plan. If you suddenly need money and sell your Bitcoin at a loss, it is also considered a failure in investing. although it all comes back to your goals when buying Bitcoin.",

But don't forget to look at investing in cryptos as gambling somehow, more than what we traditionally mean by investing.",

It's not late though to invest in Bitcoin, you still have like 6 months or so before the block halving. However, even after the block halving you can still continue to accumulate base on your capital.Or used the DCA strategy, maybe it will work on your end. Just remember though that is going to be mentally tough to accumulate with small amounts and it might take sometime. So have the mental fortitude to hold and wait for the eventual bull run.",

You can have all your material capital in your home. Let's say you have a house valued at $300K and you have paid $100K on the mortgage. You have no other loans or assets. The $100K of equity you have, how are you going to invest it in Bitcoin? Are you going to ask for a HELOC? I can tell you are thinking only about money but there are many forms of capital, like if all you have is farmland, or a pension plan or a combination of these, which is usual.The ideal percentage to invest in Bitcoin for a person depends on many things, and should be included in an overall wealth-building plan and ignore bullshit like your advice.",

Wanted to know how things works and how can you make things happen. I will prefer you to do paper trading, or back testing trading. But these methods will not give you an experience of buying and selling but only test your strategies. To test your strategies along with real experience, you should prefer demo trading at start. Many exchanges like Kraken etc. provide the opportunity of doing demo trading. Once you get the idea of how things works, then you can move onto real trading experience. If I took the meaning of your post wrong, as I think you might be referring to the fact in which people wanted to buy at least some amount and wanted to have some portion of btc. If that's the case, then you should not invest 20% or 40% of you capitol because that's a lot of money. You should consider to buy with 10 or 20 dollars only.And before making any investment you must have some profit and time to hold expectation in your mind. In other word, you should know that what types of investment you are going to make, either it's trading or holding. Because both have different strategies.",

As a newbie, you are still learning and have not come to full understanding of the crypto market so you should be cautious. You should avoid investing in altcoins at all cost, do not fall into the trap of diversifying your portfolio, you may end up accumulating shitcoins that will amount to nothing in the future. Investing in only bitcoin will help you minimize the risk of losing your money to market fluctuations. Lastly, invest only what you can afford to lose.

You are right, when investing capital is one of the most important factors to put into consideration but it doesn’t always matter the amount you start up with because investing in bitcoin doesn’t have an end date and you can always invest again and grow your portfolio. As a investor it’s even advisable to start with smaller amounts until you understand properly how it works.
