  "content": "Time management, in my opinion is a skill. A skill that comes naturally to some, while others would strive to attain. Time management skills are valued by employers on a recruitment drive and are always on the lookout for such a skill. There are always things that are needed to get done and with so little time. That is where time management comes in. Time management could be defined in a variety of ways. We could safely define management as a process of planning, organizing, directing, controlling of human and material resources to enable the objective achieve its aim/goal. Time management involves planning, organizing of your tasks, activities and objectives. Time management is critical and needed to safely achieve the goal set by either an individual or an organization. In an organization, it has been confirmed and proven that being able to effectively manage time has led to an increase in productivity and it’s general output. Here are some strategies for the effective management of your valuable time. 1. Set a goal: Personally, I like to write down my goals(either short or long term goals). Having a goal would set and prepare your mind and helps an individual to focus on the tasks ahead 2. Plan: Planning is vital when doing literally anything. More important when you want to limit or prevent time wastages. With a plan, you could set and follow a well defined course. 3. Have a scale of preference: Having a scale of preference shows your wants, needs and tasks. It  lets you arrange your tasks in order of importance and highlights your priorities. Having a scale of preference also helps keep you organized. 3. Break larger tasks into smaller ones: Breaking larger tasks into smaller ones helps make the tasks more achievable and easier. It also helps keeps you organized and focused on the tasks4: Delegate: Delegation is very important in an organization and it helps keep things moving smoothly and quickly. It also helps eliminate time wastage in the workplace. 5. End procrastination: With procrastination, you’re never going to get anything done. You would keep pushing things to do at a later date until they pile up and become a huge problem later on. 6. Do away with distractions: Whatever that doesn’t contribute to the attainment of a set goal is a distraction and should be dropped. All unnecessary things that doesn’t help you achieve your goal is a distraction and distractions greatly help waste time. Time is a valuable resource that when lost, can never be recovered anymore.",

As can be learned later, these are the things that a person can gain with the influence of the environment in the development of his character. You can find many courses on these on the internet. But don't forget those courses are just a small piece from cake. You have to get that lessons and idea and put it your life style and whenever you have chance you have to practice on it. If you apply the strategies given by Iroh on this subject to your life in a week, you will see the difference. You will find first that your routines that took a long time from you will be shorter. Then you will start to accomplish more in a short time.",

Just like the op aptly observed, effective time management helps to achieve a lot of things. There's this rhyme that we usually say when we're kids: \"tick says the clock, tick tickwhat you have to do, do quick\"This duly emphasizes how important the use of time is as it waits for no one.

If you don't plan with time you have not started on anything good. \"I think there is a saying that he who fails to plan has already planned to fail\". This just buttress the point that timing is good because if you get old without having any skill or knowledge to sustain you to feed yourself at old age you now see it that the person didn't utilize the time to plan very well. This is why they also say time is money in the making, if we plan very well with our time we can have a success story. When we talk about time is not only our personal time but the global time in the scheme of things. The world has changed, the time we are now is different from what it was 100 years ago or 15th century ago. Therefore some of the things we do, use or are happy with then have all metamophose, the cars, electrical gadgets, to culture and social living etc.",

It might not be as accurate as you've planned but it will be better having something to rely on or follow, because it will serve as a guide. If you'd miss some of the tasks on your list, atleast you'd be able to do others based on your plan than do not do anything because your schedule is not organized. Then eventually you'll be used to being organized and systematic with your time. Then domino effect; you'll be efficient with your investments.Actually this idea would be beneficial not only to individuals but to the society in general especially if many people would do the same thing. One of the problems in work industry is lack of plans which makes employees and also the company not as productive as they should be.",

Yes, I completely agree that procrastination is what makes any of us unable to manage our time and therefore cannot achieve our goals, so ending procrastination and starting right away is the best solution. When you manage your time, the pressure on you will be reduced and you will be able to do more work with ease, and you will be able to work with more productivity, so we all have to if we want to manage our time and take advantage of all our time to make a list of daily tasks and works and we must have a calendar of dates and periods for each task we want to do.",

These two factors seem to be related to each other. But this happens as a result of us not making a schedule for each of our daily activities. when time schedules for work and other activities have been made and adjustments are made so that work and pleasure do not conflict. then the problem can be solved. so that we become calmer when working and we also become more able to enjoy our vacation time. so that's where the importance of managing time and making a schedule that has been adjusted.",
