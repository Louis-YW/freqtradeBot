Based my research bnbstrom's CEO based own claim profile. Able to post a cool thread with an images..reserves to canceling people / banning users is more sense, than team able to change add remove deny(make it straight: if my project competition not reached / success I will reject them).",

This is first time and if we thought deadline is too short we may allow current participants to participate with entries in next competitions too. But if people manage to fulfill competition requirements in given time then we will not allow these participants in next round.Quote from: Zoec on January 31, 2023, 12:58:26 AMQuote from: Royse777 on January 30, 2023, 04:18:31 PM⚔️SellDefi.com team is responsible to send prize money.SellDefi.com team reserves the right to change/add/remove/deny anything.⚔️If you not responsibility with funds or part of team, why you post them?

If your product is worth $30 or above and you made sales 10 or higher you will be eligible for prize. You have to decide which prize you want to claim because 1 product can claim one reward.Royse777 posted our game topic because they are also handling our signature campaign with escrow funds. We thought their profile will have better reach so we asked them to post this topic for us. We are thankful to them for posting. Next round we will post announcements ourselves.",

You can sell multiple type of files including music, video, images, project zip files etc. And we allow multiple files option with custom duration of sale and custom amount of sales.
