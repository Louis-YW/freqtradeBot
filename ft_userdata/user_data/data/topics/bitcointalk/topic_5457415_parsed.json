Good luck to all participants, and may fortune smile upon you on the first day of August 2023!I can smell the aroma of a scam, and that's why I warn all members of the forum to be aware of such type of scams. The OP is asking to submit Bitcoin to his/her account so that he/she will select a participant who will get $10,000 for the entry. It's just an old school type of Ponzi scheme where a lottery program asks users to send money first so then they could add them as participant of the program, and later on they can run away with the money of the users. In such type of schemes, the innocent users won't get anything because the creator will run away with all of the money. There is nothing fair in such kind of program, everything is already planned, and the innocent users can lose a lot of money by participating in such programs. I'm again warning all members of the forum to not send any bitcoin to the address that OP mentioned.",

Good luck to all participants, and may fortune smile upon you on the first day of August 2023!Wow this looks very funny and I don't know who must have advised you into doing this but mehh this is very  poor and I don't want to conclude that this is a scam because we've seen similar cases as this but I would want to know who holds the money if you guys have any escrow  or so and mind you, you're account is still very new and you shouldn't expect  anyone to treat this thread with any form of seriousness not even yourself.I will advice that you get a copper membership and also get someone to help you design a very good ann for you and be also ready to spend some good money to prove your legitimacy and the test of them.This your thread also made me remember a random guy was chatted me on telegram with cliams of getting my handle from forum and well I had to give him a listening  ear and he was telling me that, his a moderator for a lottery and he can help chose my name as a winner and all I had to do was make a deposit and he will automatically choose me as winner and I couldn't stop laughing  because I knew it was a cheap scam and I asked him to make the deposit for me and if I win, I will give him 70%of the winnings and that was the end of your conversation.Please don't let me relate your post to this incidence.",

I also was about to ask the ops the same question as to what the name of the website is or he should share a link to their site,  and instead of making lentty replies it better to make a few line that contain the needed information we have so many lottery platforms that use this place to create awareness for their business and if ops want to do same he should at least share some details that could help lead potential customers to the lottery site. Let's hope ops is going to make that information available soon for a better understanding of what the platform looks like and what their operation entails.",

He uses the same wallet maybe because he is lazy or he is only not wise but that made him get busted really quick. Sometimes scammers are so dumb. They lack in planning but they only rush on their main objective and that is to scam people in the hopes of earning a quick buck. So what now @OP? We are still ready to hear your alibi's.",
