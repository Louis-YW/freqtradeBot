  "content": "Hello,I'm domain seller but this time I couldn't make a single sale and I'm broke.I've $90 balance in NameCheap.com which are good to purchase domains and hosting.But I need a fast cash, So I will purchase a domain from you for $60 on NameCheap if you can send $20 to me in Bitcoins.After $6 commission, You will have $54 as a collateral on NameCheap. I will send you $30 ( + your $20 = $50 ) within a 10 days via bitcoins.And you will release that $54 to me or at least the half. #HappyEndingYou can use Paxful if you only have PayPal to send bitcoins to me.Let's do it. Only for trusted members. We will do the transaction in two steps either.I'm grateful.[ FYI: There's an internet shutdown in my state, That's why I couldn't make a sale and wasted my money in the process to move to another state. https://www.zawya.com/en/economy/africa/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-in-amhara-region-as-clashes-surge-kbpyllre ] [ I'm not begging anyhow, I'm just telling my story so you guys could be able to do the deal with full information.

      "body": "Good deal, but there is always a what if. What if you default the loan, which is also a big possibility, how does the lender recover his money. No one wants to go through the hustle of looking for domain name buyers, especially if that's not their business.I mean you could have just sold the domain name you are going to buy for a cheap price but the fact that you are opting for a loan instead and making it collateral means that it's hard to sell off some domains names, it could take months, years.Domains names are not considered valid collateral, perhaps that's why you haven't received a response for over 48 hours.",
