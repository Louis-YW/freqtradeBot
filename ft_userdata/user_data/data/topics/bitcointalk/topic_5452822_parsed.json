On their twitter, I saw some people complain about their funds as well until they gave up. I don't think they are coming back.An exit scam perhaps because if they wanted to stop the business, they should have announced it and made people withdraw their funds.",

Anyway there's no way to recover it, before with people who offer service to recover your coins because it's scam.This is what im trying to say because if we do talk decentralized exchange platforms on which this would really be in between users kind of trade where if you do buy or sell orders then cant be sure if those would be automatically be closed up position when a DEX closes or shut down or would really be hanging out on limbo? How you would be able to say on such condition or situation because we know that once you do put up a certain order then it suddenly closes or shut down then i dont know on what do actually happen.@OP, Just on what most people been saying on here that consider those coins to be lost forever, there's no way on retrieving them unless if you do able to contact themvia other contact mediums which it would really be depending whether they would be giving out some response or totally ran away on whatever they hadbeen able to snipped into.",

Well, that's pretty much it and you just have to accept that it's gone and will never come back.Quote from: carlfebz2 on May 16, 2023, 08:23:38 PM@OP, Just on what most people been saying on here that consider those coins to be lost forever, there's no way on retrieving them unless if you do able to contact themvia other contact mediums which it would really be depending whether they would be giving out some response or totally ran away on whatever they hadbeen able to snipped into.I think even if he contacts them, as long as they've got a policy that they've notified everyone to withdraw or cancel or any activity that a user should have done before their shutting down, they can't also probably help.",

If the code truly works, it should only require a few modifications. That is why I shared it as a starting point for you in the first place. If the OP truly did it successfully, it also means that you also have the chance to recover it.I also found out that it might seem as their frontend(website/platform) codebase, where you can run on your own computer to access the website. Again, it requires some basic technical knowledge in order to access it from the source code: https://github.com/saturn-network/ring-simple. I suggest you take a look at their README.md explanations.",

      "body": "Dear OP, first of all I'm sorry to hear that. There is no other way than withdrawing your funds from the wallet. Check your smart contract address where your ETH is locked. You can use a blockchain explorer such as Etherscan to look up your wallet address and search for relevant smart contract interactions. Withdraw your funds as soon as possible. You can use a wallet like MyEtherWallet or MetaMask to do this and use phrase or private key to backup. One more, make sure to always save the phrase or private key for your backup wallet.  I think Saturn Protocol is a scam.",
