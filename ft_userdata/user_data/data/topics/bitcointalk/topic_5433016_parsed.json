      "body": "Happy new year to you and the entire fortune team. Congratulations on your new project and welcome onboard this platform. I see you have a good website interface. If I may ask why requesting for customers mobile number upon registration when you already have email address option. I am of the opinion that you either remove the phone number spot or you make it optional while registering because I do not see any reason why one would need to fill his phone number there or you have restrictions on countries from getting registered? Another thing I would say is that you will have to register a copper member account as your account is a new bie so you could be able to make pictorial upload here for prospective participants to see and know what you offer because that attracts them to reading your post and picking interest in your casino.Â  Lastly, as a new casino project in other to getÂ  the attention of participants onboard this platform I would advise you seek the service of a good signature campaign manager with good reputation here who will do a perfect advertisement job for your project. I believe with these opinion you can scale through with them",
