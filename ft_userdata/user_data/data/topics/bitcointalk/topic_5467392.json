The best way to start contributing is by engaging in topics you are familiar with and comfortable discussing. You cannot contribute meaningfully to a discussion if you lack knowledge about the subject, right? When it is a general topic, feel free to share your personal opinions. However, avoid giving incorrect or unverified information on specific issues. In such cases, it is better to read others' comments and ask questions if you are interested in learning more.Regarding acceptable comments, as long as they adhere to forum rules, they are acceptable. Nevertheless, it is a good practice to follow general netiquette guidelines. At least until you gain a bit more experience and reputation in the community.",

Are the sentences difficult to understand because the terms or synonyms are different in certain countries? In various countries, there are differences in the way language is conveyed, especially in jargon or satirical sentences. However, if what you mean is terms in bitcoin or crypto in general, maybe you need to read: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5466905.0But as you said, you will be more active and contribute to the forum, so you will immediately understand all the terms and sentences there. It's quite confusing at first, but it will be interesting if you start to understand it. Welcome to bitcointalk, I hope you quickly get to know bitcoin and everything related to the crypto world",

You will learn what words like Blockchain, transaction hash, wallet, mining, SegWit or private key mean. Tuturtinular already gave you a great link above, where such words are explained. If it's for a normal discussion, we might have some strange people here, (also trolls), who don't talk like normal people and are just here to troll. But like said before, we would need a few examples.  You (and we) can talk normally, like we talk every day and in my opinion, it's also very important to talk normally because it's easier for me, you and other people here to understand a written text. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.",

What's needed is just to communicate using any language that you best understand, and then you will be fine. Even if there are questions or opinions, there is no way that you are going to present them so that people won't be able to understand your statement. Here is a forum, just like other social media, where we are entitled to our own opinions and word usage. Others may be talking too seriously in their area of specialisation. If you see anyone in the technical section, you will see them using technical language to breakdown technical things. The same is applicable to the mining section and also to the wallet and other general boards. You might miss out due to some language that is uncommon to you, like open source, hardware wallet, noncustodial and custodial, etc., but with time you will know the meaning of each and you will have to understand the right place to use each of them.",

This is what have been my major worries in the past,  but as at now that I have started interacting gradually I am overcoming that phobia gradually. Beginners' worries on forums usually relate to choosing topics that they don't have much knowledge of. So there is a feeling of inferiority in commenting, most people think too deeply, which makes them not confident in what they want to convey. this is self-limiting. but thank goodness you can let go of that kind of thing.There are many people with different language backgrounds on the forum, so it's very natural for you to see vocabulary or sentences that might sound strange. Because you've read a lot on forums, you're definitely familiar with it.Just a suggestion, follow a topic first that you really like. or maybe if there is a local board from your country on the forum you can discuss it there first. I'm sure the people on the local boards will be friendly enough to guide you.",

I mean for sure that was pretty normal since there are a lot of things that you dont understand yet here in the forum and as well as on the cryptocurrency terms. You could pretty much make a conversation here the way you make the conversation easily where we could understand everyone but for sure it is just normal since you still doesnt have enough knowledge so something like DCA, or ETF terms might get confused easily. I was pretty much the same when I got started here in the forum since I dont know a lot and doesnt have enough knowledge especially if you go to some other threads here like serious discussions, mining, etc. There are things there that were really difficult to understand if you dont have some initial ideas or doesnt have an idea at all what they are talking about, it was just the same if you going to talk to someone but you dont know what they are talking about. I mean you just need some time here in the forum for sure, You are still a newbie here in the forum so you gonna get that feeling but as time goes by you going to learn slowly and you could pretty much understand everything. Just so you know members here are already made thousands of post and it will reflect on how they make there post and if they know what they are saying.",

This is my first time hearing something like this. This forum use English language as an official language of communication in the general board although, there are some local boards that discuss in their local dialect. Regarding your case, I guess you engage yourself in the board or thread you have little or no knowledge about and I think that's why you're finding it difficult to understand and communicate. If that's your case, I would advise you to distant yourself from such thread or you can simply ask questions on what you don't understand. It's not necessary you comments and engage on the issues you have no idea about while there are numerous post here on a daily basis to engage yourself with.Acceptable comments are the ones not deviating from the topic of discussion, devoid of troll or offensive and abusive. I believe by ethics, you know the difference between what's acceptable or not in a larger society. Forum is not a prison yard where you should be afraid. Feel free to engage. Enjoy your stay!",

Engineers speak with numbers and drawings, Geographers speak with maps and the list goes on. So, there should be a way of speaking that will resonate with reasonable number of users here. Like it has been stressed several times, it does not really take too much to start here if you are not frightened by others. Just endeavour to know what Bitcoin is used for and how it differs from other currencies, then try and know how and where to buy, how to send & received and how to protect your assets. I feel these are the basic knowledge... others will come naturally as you continue to interact with others here. In addition, the forum have various boards that discuss other things other than Bitcoin. There are the local boards, Politics & Society, Gambling and even off-topics. If you put effort, you will understand that the board is well structured in a way that you will always find your interest while keeping in mind the importance of owning Bitcoin. So, feel at home, don't be scared to ask questions and endeavor to read the suggestions of others... the answers you seek might just have been revealed.",

Why is the terms, words and some sentences that are made in bitcointalk seems different and strange to newbies like me to understand, You're on a Bitcoin (cryptocurency)! forum so you don't expect us to speak like we're having a normal discussion, our choice of words has to be related to cryptocurency and that's where the terminology comes into use like when we use words like pump and dump, ATH, DEX, HODL etc. These words aren't that technical to understand but because you're new to the crypto world that's why it's looking difficult for you to understand what is going on.

You not knowing the terminology doesn't mean you shouldn't write on the forum as you can also participate in discussion with the terms you know and keep learning more crypto related terms as you get more familiar with the forum. This forum is for learning purpose so just because you don't feel among yet doesn't mean you should be discourage from writing on the forum.",
