For how long actually?Could you advise someone to buy used Asic miners too? Or newer is safer? Does new or used matter? Do new asic miner have problems in the short term too? Buying used ASICs can be a great thing, depending on the opportunities you have. To a large extent, it all depends of the ASIC model and the reseller.I've bought all kinds of used miners and never had a single problem with them. Some have been running continuously for years, without ever having had the slightest problem. Some models are less reliable than others, and I personally wouldn't buy some used S17s from some batches, or, for example, I'd never buy a used S9k, because even when they were new, they were complete pieces of shit ASICs.But the model doesn't tell the whole story: I've bought 90 L3++ used (from a good reseller) and never had any problem, apart from a few PSUs that failed, but that's perfectly normal.Another time, I bought a dozen L3++ from a random seller on Ebay (a seller located in China), and out of the 10, only 4 kept all their hashboards in a good working order. I had the first problems after 4 days of use, and this went on for 1 year.For example, the S19pro is excellent and reliable, as are certain Whatsminers. But that doesn't mean I'll buy one of these from a random reseller : choosing your seller is very important.The reputation of sellers is an important thing to check. Never rush out and buy the cheapest on the internet, it's better to take your time and analyze what you're buying, and who you're buying it from when it comes to used miners.",

Antminer 19 series have 6 to 12 months warranty.It is safer than buying 2nd hand units that doesn't have a warranty and you don't know if the unit is well-maintained.",

Antminer 19 series have 6 to 12 months warranty.It is safer than buying 2nd hand units that doesn't have a warranty and you don't know if the unit is well-maintained.I completely agree with your message; however, can we say that Bitmain's waranties are a good plan?They take a long time to manage your ASIC once they receive it, sometimes several months, not to mention the high fees if you're geographically far from them. The problem with Bitmain is that even if a single hasboard is broken, they'll tell you to send the whole unit back. Whereas Whatsminer, for example, will accept that you send them only the defective part, and will generally process the swap more quickly. This greatly reduces shipping costs and turnaround times, and in the case of a defective hashboard, you can continue to use your ASIC without the said board during the process time.",

If this is your first experience and you do not have a trusted partner who guarantees the quality of the equipment, then it is better to buy a new ASIC. I don't know how good a price you were offered, but there are a lot of circumstances in such a case. I would not give advice until I found out the cost of new equipment and the condition and time of operation of a used ASIC.",

Yeah, I know I didn't ask. Which, brings up the point of should we have 1 common heavily moderated post of people who do repair work and their locations. It is entirely possible that there was a discussion about this person and I just missed it.-Dave",

For how long actually?Could you advise someone to buy used Asic miners too? Or newer is safer? Does new or used matter? Do new asic miner have problems in the short term too? In my opinion, I'd rather invest in new ASIC miners because they are generally considered safer since they come with warranties and support from the manufacturer. And since they're new, they're likely to be more efficient in terms of hash power and power consumption.The only downside that I can think of is they are more expensive.",

For how long actually?I bought a dozen of S9s in 2019 and they lasted for years without issues for the most part, but I am sure as hell if you buy them now they will start falling in no time, everyone's exerpince with used gears is different, how long have they been mining for? how did the previous owner/s treat them? it's a lot of questions, the end result is \"all depends on your luck\".You can make things slightly better for yourself by not buying gears that are known to have a high failure rate like all the Antminer 17 series.QuoteCould you advise someone to buy used Asic miners too? Or newer is safer? Does new or used matter? I'd stick to new gears if are available at a good price unless the ROI difference between new and used is 8 months or so, then ya, i'd take the risk with used gears, if it's just 3-4 months, I rather take less risk. If you make up your mind and decide what gears you want to buy, you can reach out to me and I'll send you a quote, keep in mind that nearly all used gears are sold as is, you get a video showing the SN of the miner and it's hashrate, the moment it's shipped -- it's all on you, with new gears, you get a 1-year warranty.",
