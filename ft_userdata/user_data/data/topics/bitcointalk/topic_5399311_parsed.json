      "body": "Cooperative investment in the case of the crypto is completely superfluous. You can invest at least $10, at least $500 - it doesn't matter. Bitcoin divides very well, so if you don't have enough money to buy a whole bitcoin, you can easily buy part of it: 0,1-0,000001 BTC. This way you will be your own controller and manager of your investments. It will also save you from the problem of trust in your partners and controversial situations that will definitely arise during cooperative investment.",

Example: I got a tip that in Sweden there is a big source of Potash , i propose we build a mining company there.... I make proposal , other subscribe to proposal ,we explore and find as much information as possible, and if good investment ,we pool together.Step 1: Make proposal Step 2: Research and exploreStep 3: Analyse data / find costsStep 4: Create business plan Step 5: Pledge to pool if you like business ,pay law firm feeStep 6: Hire big law firm to collect the money ,deposit money to law firm Step 7: Set up company / law firm sends stocks Step 8: Board members will take over company management Step 9: You wait for dividend or for company to become listed ...",

      "body": "You should try pool staking if talking from cryptocurrency perspective. Find a coin that allows staking and then find a staking pool to invest in. That's a perfect example of cooperative investment. If you are looking to invest in startups, there are couple of programs available in my country. But not sure if they allow foreign investors or not. Check for WINT in Google. But such investments are quite risky, I must say! You can earn as much as 25% return if you choose right but you can also loose all your investment if you choose wrong.",

I have tried to do something like this for real estate, because buying a land, and then building a building on top of it costs about 1 million dollars in my nation, and you could build one big apartment with 16 flats in it, which costs about 300k each, in that case you could divide it to 16 and each person would spend about 60k give or take, and would have a house worth 300k. Then they could repeat that as much as they want, you could literally do it 5 more times if you do it just one time. But, unfortunately people are never trusting others and the people who will be leading that cooperative.",

( no stock market / to create new businesses i mean )This is nonsense really, but I guess it can depend on what country your in and the availability of investing tools / brokers in your country. You jump from having $10 to invest in one scenario, which apparently is nothing, to having $500 in the next scenario which means you have a sizable amount to start investing? What sort of weird logic you've used. Nobody should expect 20% per year returns when the stock market average is around 8%, the only way you'll get such high returns is through years of practice and learning how to pick investments by yourself, rather than relying on any kind of pooled money which is open to all sorts of additional risks. One thing that you do need to learn is consistency and sensible reasoning skills.",

This is very similar to investing in things like a new crypto in the market as well, you can always check the Altcoins section and learn more about it, they are always looking for new investors to kick start their projects.",

Brokers pull in huge number of investors, use their money to invest into share market and returns the x% at the maturity.
