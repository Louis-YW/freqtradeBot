Investment in Bitcoin is not only to buying and holding for the long term you can use the price movement action in the short term way, example if the market price drops you will secure to buy opportunity if you see the market will possibly go down sell your asset and secure again another position. Spot trading is ideal with this current market state for beginners if you have the capability to trade in futures it's good too because with volatility you can set your positions.",

      "body": "You can sell and then wait for the price to correct before buying back. In this way, you've got a bigger amount of Bitcoin. However, this is essentially trading and it has risks. What if the price increased a lot more after you sell? What would you feel? It is possible that you imagine the price rising more and therefore fear that you'll miss out on more profit. Your next step could be that you're forced to buy back at a higher price for the sake of more profit. But it could happen that after buying back the price corrects. What will you do? Would you stick to your Bitcoin now that the price is falling? It is possible that you will sell thinking that the correction isn't over yet. You will buy back at a much lower price. But then the price could rise instead. This is the hardest obstacle: predicting with accuracy. But then the price of Bitcoin is highly unpredictable. My experience tells me to remain hodling. Unless there is a need to convert, my Bitcoin remains in my wallet in bearish and in bullish times.",

      "body": "When it comes to investing, it is good that you plan to invest for the long term, but sometimes you must use your brain. Suppose you plan an investment for one year and accordingly you invest after holding the investment for six months and you get the expected profit, after getting the expected profit, do you need to hold the investment for the remaining six months? Or you could see the market gradually going down after making some profit, what should you do at that time? If you ever find yourself in such a situation then what you should do at that time is to sell your investments and refrain from investing until the market normalizes. If you can use your knowledge to invest in this way, your investment will never be stuck at the same level. So definitely invest with a specific plan and try to hold your investment or sell it by understanding the market conditions.",

Newbies in this platform like me could gain insight from your past experiences.Well I have only one strategy which is Holding and the biggest formidable obstacle in achieving that strategy is market and economic situations. If they went soft on me then I will be able to hold for longer period of time other wise not. But still, to make a decent profit you first have to calculate all the possibilities of course no one could predict all but at least the ones which makes sense. Let's say you invested \"X\" amount and wanted to book profit at the price of $100k but when you see the price is increasing (means let's say buying price is $30k and it increased to $60k). So, you might think that your portfolio is doubled now and its the best time to book profit or at least the investment but believe me that's the biggest mistake one could ever do.We should not fall prey to market sentiments instead we should try to control them.",

Let's say you set out to buy $100 a month in Bitcoin for 10 years. It can also be indefinite, like the one that makes DCA for retirement and eventually leave it to your heirs. But the thing is that with the modified DCA strategy I take advantage of low points in the market to buy a little more, as I did at the levels below $20K that we had recently and for the next cycle I plan to make partial sales above $100K, but always making sure that I keep a good amount of Bitcoin for the future. If you want a more detailed and sophisticated explanation, ask JayJuanGee, who has very long explanations on the subject.",

Asking about the advantages and disadvantages, for me, the advantages will be gained if we keep calm and patiently wait for the bull market. In addition, we should stick to the original strategy path, do good management, and have reserves to buy back. If you are too afraid to face the bearish market, then take a break and do not open the market. Definitely don't do anything stupid by throwing away the holdings you hold at a loss. A bearish market is a sign that you should go shopping, or if you have some spare funds do some quick trading or scalping. Make sure every up and down gives a little profit.",

From my experience, there is nothing wrong with securing some profits, especially after a bull cycle because the next run the price of your coins is likely going to plummet. I think believing that you'll eventually make profits when BTC hit $100k or something is way worse than having multiple plans along the way.",

I'm not gonna be like the others that put all of their money in it and some of them took loans in order just to invest in bitcoins, that is not a recommendable way because stress and anxiety will hunt you when a bearish market occurs and you won't have any peace of mind since you have nothing to rely on in terms of your financial needs.",

If there is a turnaround in the market, like you said, the price of Bitcoin cannot just boom to $100k this year, even within the range of two months from now, which means that my next sell target has not yet been reached. The only tempting price at which I would love to sell some fraction of my Bitcoin is around $100k and above, and until then, I wouldn't be selling any. If the market begins to recover, it might not suddenly surge to $50k, and if anyone sells by then, they might not also have the opportunity to buy at $25k again this year. I believe that if the market goes above this price, I might not come down to $25k again till the year runs out.",

To get profits, investors usually invest by applying an annual pattern as has happened in the 4 year timeframe such as 2017 - 2021 - ...?.The calculation can also be seen from the timeframe from 2013 to 2017 and 2021.If you sell annually, the profit you get through price-recovery may be small.Quote from: Thehallows on August 22, 2023, 10:53:31 PMWhat proves to be the most formidable obstacle in executing this strategy?The biggest obstacle as well as a challenge for holders in doing so may be patience.",
