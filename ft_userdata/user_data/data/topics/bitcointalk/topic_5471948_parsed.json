  "content": "After two years of battle between Kraken and the United States federal government over data sharing. In June, the battle was lost by Kraken. Federal judge ordered Kraken to share customers trading information with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). According to Kraken, information of those with over $20000 trading transactions would be shared with the government, data from 2016 to 2020 will be shared.QuoteThe company, specifically, will share information regarding cryptocurrency transactions above $20,000 made by Kraken customers between 2016 and 2020. U.S.-based users who made such transactions will have their account history sent to the IRS along with their name, date of birth, Tax ID, address, and contact information.Kraken will share it by early November which is some days away.https://decrypt.co/203507/kraken-warns-users-bitcoin-trading-data-irs",

We know that cryptocurrencies that are decentralized like Bitcoin may not be available for such regulation and third-party forces from the government such as this if the Bitcoin is being held in a self-custody wallet,  but then its services such as exchanges are the most targeted and only window through which authorities will get access into users/traders information,  although I still don't know what the punishment will be for those in this category that is those that have traded above the said limits,  without tax remittances.",

Had this been specifically stipulated in the terms of service upon sign up, many would probably have opted not to proceed. This latest development is rather unfair. This is another proof that whatever is agreed between a centralized platform and a user upon sign up is almost pointless. The demands of the government or the court always prevail. It's like an exchange saying they won't implement KYC or that only this and that data are required but once the government orders them to collect such and such information, they have no choice but to comply and whatever was agreed earlier between them and their clients will go to the trash bin.",

I believe most users must have created their accounts and have been trading with it before the government came up with their tax. I guess data sharing is generally captured in the terms of service. In the first place, how can Kraken comply with AML/CFT policies if they won't share collected data with the appropriate agencies? I guess this part is widely acceptable. The fact that a user complies with compulsory KYC is more or less an expression that he/she accepts it. But I don't think that includes the willingness to share how much one trades. That's another thing because surely a lot of users aren't declaring everything to their tax agencies. QuoteBased on the situation of things right now, I don't think deregistering one's account will be of any good since the user's data will still be captured on the compiled list that will be sent to IRS.

But some people have no option than to make us of these CEX, because they are traders and they trade often. But for people to have privacy, centralized exchanges should be avoided.",

I wouldn't bet that tax collectors in the whole EU will ever be at the level of the IRS, because each country has its own rules, and our areas are still far from the efficiency of Western Europe.

Now, they will be allowing internal revenue service to access public information, who knows if they don't keep that details under their watch.The more I see centralized exchanges gives you comfort in some part of their features, they are always dangerous to use, one or the other do violated laws and they always expect the users to do the same. If it's were customers that violated this rules, they will not only suspend your account, they will also ban you and restrict you from having access to your funds. Trust them at your own peril.",

Others are fine with the massive profit and like this country and support it and feel paying taxes is their patriotic duty to support the country.Others, (DaveF) are just too lazy to bother and pay more in their taxes then they should since the cost of time and effort of tracking every buy and sell is not worth the time and put everything in at $1. If the IRS wants to come and audit and find out that taxes were overpaid and give a refund that's fine too.-Dave",
