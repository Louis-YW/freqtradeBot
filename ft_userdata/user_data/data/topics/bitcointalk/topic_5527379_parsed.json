If you lump sum during the bear cycle, then you should be having the first image. In DCA you buy both the lows and the highs thereby smoothening the effect of volatility on your investment. The first chart has no representation of the volatile nature of Bitcoin across your DCA, there should be some downward and upward movement of the chart during your investment moments and then another line that attempt a straight line to provide a smoothening effect on your investments.Another consideration is the supposed length of your investment. If you intend to go for a longer period of time, then you don't have a problem lump summing, but I'll advise from experience that you should divide the bulk money into three, lump sum with a part, use the second party to follow up your investment with DCA and keep the third part to buy the dip and Hold.",

Those of us who have been doing this for years know that it is the opposite, doing DCA implies forgetting about the ups and downs, buying regularly. And if you want to contribute a separate lump sum (if you are already doing DCA), better in a market downturn. On the other hand, if you are starting to think about investing now and you have a lump sum it is best to buy right now regardless of the price (as long as you believe in the great future of bitcoin in the long term), because you can not time the market, and it is better time in the market.",

      "body": "That's why DCA is better than lump sum. If the price falls after you make your purchase, then your next purchase might be cheaper. If the price rises after your purchase, then your earlier purchase is already in profit, although you will be buying at a more expensive price after that. However, it doesn't mean that lump sum is a strategy everybody should avoid at all cost. The point, after all, in Bitcoin investment is to hodl. It's designed as a long-term investment. So, it matters a little that you bought at $100,000 and not $95,000 when the price has already hit $300,000 or $600,000 or $1 million.",

Either you do dca or you buy all at once, the market can either go low or go high. It is just what it is. Some people might end up making assumptions based on this and conclude that if you do dca, you will experience market dip less. It's not true. Personally I have not experienced this. Even if I do dca method, sometimes the market rises and sometimes it doesn't but I typically do not care because I hold for the long term anyway.",

Because they already understand about the market at acceptable level, and prepare their mentality about market dumps, bear market time, as well as what can happen during bearish months like a lot of FUD.It's helpful for them to have strong mentality, and diamond hands to DCA bitcoin and hold their bitcoins, in meantime of upcoming bull market and new ATH.QuoteThere is once catch though, if you go with lump sum and somehow don‚Äôt do anything stupid in the first 3-4 years of your journey, you‚Äôll probably make more money. It is not an easy task but often more rewarding.If they don't do stupid things like buying bitcoin, then trading it.If they don't do super stupid things like trading bitcoin in margin or futures trading.If they don't do these things, they can hold their bitcoin and after 3, 4 or more years, they will have good profit. One market cycle is about 4 years, and hodl camp map shows that if Bitcoin holders can hold their bitcoin for a little bit more than 5 years, profit comes.https://hodl.camp/",

You can follow the general principle of buy low and sell high, you can also follow the lump sum method.

In my estimation, no one is better than the other and it is not a one-size-fits all approach. It is the out outcome of doing your own research that you should follow and if it doesn't work for you as much as you thought it would, you can change it to the one that works better for you.",
