      "body": "If my research is correct (and I think this is an unpopular opinion/conclusion) the main reason that Russia began the war was due to Ukraine's talks to join NATO. Ukraine pursued, Russia followed on its word. Would I start war in this case? No. Putting myself in the presidents' shoes, I am already allied with the great sleeping lion that is China, I am already one of the most powerful countries alongside the US and China, why not instead increase defenses instead of starting war in case Ukraine joining NATO is malicious? In saying that, everyone thinks they can decide better than the current leaders (even me sometimes)...we don't know all of the factors behind their decisions though. It is unfortunate that the world is in a state where these leaders conclude that war is the only way to go.",

As President, would you engage in a war to achieve any of these positive outcomes?We have to agree that fighting wars have no benefit because any event that leads to the loss of lives and property is not acceptable. The death of young children and others supersedes all the benefits or gains of this senseless war.This war has thought both parties a big lesson. Russia thought this war will last for less than two weeks but they have learned their lessons. Russia is now well aware that Ukraine is not militarily weak. They are now aware that with little support from Ukraine's allies, they can withstand the military might of Russia. NATO and Europe are also aware that Russia is a military and economic powerhouse. Even with NATO's support, Russia has proved to be militarily strong and taking more territories in Ukraine. European nations and the US also believed that sanctions will cripple Russia's economy but they have discovered that the Russian economy is to a large extent sanction-proof.Ukraine has gained transfer of scientific and military technology from the US and NATO because the Ukrainian military has been gaining technical and operational knowledge through training. The emergencysector like the fire service and the medical sector has been exposed to different situations. And they have also gained some skills from some international organizations like Red Cross. Some doctors and medical personnel have also received advanced training from other countries.If I were the president I would never engage in this war to gain these advantages. The lives of my citizens are worth more than these benefits. And these benefits or gains can be achieved without fighting. I don't also see how the war has reduced unemployment, it even increased it.",

This is the old dilemma of fight or fly. Flying would mean that the country would have been in disarray or someone would have taken the reins and lead the war or that Putin would have seated another despot and millions would suffer for it. Fighting (self-defence, no \"engaging in war\") means that you accept there will be loses and suffering during a not known period of time and the outcome could anyway be bad.Zelensky and the other members of government chose to defend the country, as at least if offers some hope for the future.Quote from: OgNasty on February 14, 2023, 04:31:06 PMI guess it would depend on what sort of agreements I had with the Biden administration.

Because once the country is invaded, we cannot sit idly by and let the enemy come to kill us, even if we surrender, they will not leave us in peace. The other side will think that we are afraid of them, so they look down on us even more. My country was invaded by America, and they still kill our relatives even when we are civilians.This war will not end anytime soon because self-determination is not in the hands of President Zelensky.

I'm appealing to Putin and Zelensky to end the dispute for humanity sake.The Russian side has presented unacceptable terms.Peace talks can only be held after the Russian army withdraws from Ukraine or is destroyed in Ukraine.This war will not end until Putin's army is pushed back out of Ukraine.The peace talks will be held long after Putin is killed or commits suicide.PS. If I were Putin, I would gradually withdraw my army and prepare the public for a \"victory\". Everyone in Russia will be more than happyto have him end this war. He might even sell it that he is a national hero, long-term strategist, genius chess player, etc. Whatever.If Putin and Russia withdrew, gave the land back to Ukraine, and ended the war,In a few short years (but maybe only months) Ukraine and Nato would be attacking Russia to break her up for US enterprises to take over.Now, that might not be a bad idea, but it would be a foolish idea for Russia. Until Zelensky withdraws his military, Russia needs to fight to remain a viable, prosperous country.If Zelensky turned his military off, and if the US withdrew from Ukraine, Russia would back off, as well... though not right away. The treaty of Minsk was supposed to do this kind of thing by not letting the war happen in the first place. But the US and Ukraine broke the treaty. Merkel even said that the treaty was meant only to hold Russia back so that Ukraine could build up its war armament for this war, which they would have mounted against Russia for nothing except conquest.",
