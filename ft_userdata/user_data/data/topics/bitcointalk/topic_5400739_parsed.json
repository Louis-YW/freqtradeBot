  "content": "My Gekkoscience Newpac USB miner is giving me an error like \"GSH 0 failure\". This has only happened since I updated to the latest cgminer source code from github. I was told by a pool owner Kano insisted that I need to upgrade to this new code if I want to continue mining using his pool.Keep in mind I'm not overclocking. In fact, because the room temperature is 80 F I'm actually underclocking.I was initially underclocking to 50 MHz, which caused frequent errors and \"zombie\" status.That's weird because the latest cgminer is promoted as fixing zombie status.Then I tried underclocking to 80 MHz, which is more stable. But I still get the occasional overheating without zombie status.Can someone let me know how to fix this?",

Non cooled sticks are subject to thermal runaway where heat will trigger increased amperage draw increasing heat in a cycle until the unit fails.So make sure you have enough air moving over it.Also, make sure that the heatsink is tight. Heating and cooling over time could have caused the screws to back off a bit.-Dave",
