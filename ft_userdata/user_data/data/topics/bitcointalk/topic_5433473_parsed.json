E make sense. I like am because the previous date nor been dey feasible at all.The collection of permanent voters card extension was very necessary because many people are yet to collect theirs due to large populations at INEC’s office, they had to send some voters card to respective polling unit for local government for collection. Even at that, some PVC’s are not yet ready for some voters to collect and they’re asking them to check back on a later date. QuoteI been wan ask those people wey change polling unit - like from one state to another. Would they need to go to INEC's office to collect a new card?Since there was no option where to collect your new voters card during registration, I think they need to go to the state dey deployed to in order to collect their PVC. INEC won’t keep your voters card in a state you won’t vote in.",

The ongoing collection of PVCs nationwide will therefore continue and end on 5th February 2023,” Okoye said in a statement on Saturday.“This is the second time the Commission is extending PVC collection nationwide and this will be the last extension of the exercise. The collection period has further been extended by an additional two hours and will start at 9 am and end at 5 pm daily including Saturdays and Sundays.”Source: https://www.channelstv.com/2023/01/28/just-in-inec-extends-pvc-collection-deadline/This one na good news ooo as many persons never still collect their PVCs, so this extension make sense as e give electorates more time to get their voters cards and prepare themselves for the forthcoming elections. But that one no mean say make we relax because according to this informent, dem no go extend am again.",

QuoteThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has extended the deadline for the collection of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to February 5, 2023. sourceWith this development, People have an extra week to get their PVC to vote the candidate of their choice. This is very impressive from INEC, choosing to extend the date because If they had not done so, many eligible voters would have been denied their rights to vote and that will be widely seen as a move by INEC to favor some candidates that know that they can only win by rigging the election.",
