Non of my brothers or sisters dey do yahoo yahoo, but I don't no why dis new generation people need quick money in a wrong way, and if u look at it very well u will discover dat is only lazy family dat is encouraging their sons and daughters to continue doing dis tin u called yahoo yahoo. If u have any brother or sister wey dey do yahoo yahoo just try to encourage dem by  refer dem to some areas were dey can get BTC books to study so dat dey will have knowledge of BTC and it will also help dem to quit from such bad attitude in d society.",

Na wetin still dey go on now,kidnappers,ritualist,Arm robbers all bad means of getting money wey boiz dey do,them go put am for yahoo because them see say the society no see yahoo as bad thing since government no provide job for the citizens. Even if enough job dey,some lazy people go still commit all those crimes wey I mention above because them won get quick money. Everything wey dey happen now don happen before na just only the name them change to yahoo. Nothing new dey again",

Many of us get brothers or even sisters wey dey into this matter, and I no think say dem go stop anytime soon.You can’t generalize it that everyone has a brother or sister that’s into yahoo. If it’s persistent in a part or area of the state or country, it doesn’t mean it’s everywhere and every family will have a member involved in such act. As far as I know, they’re more youths outside that are not involved in yahoo than those that are into it now, even though the number is increasing everyday.Quote from: Hatchy on August 01, 2023, 03:48:37 PME get plenty reasons why dem enter this thing including1. Impatience2.greed3. Intimidation4.depression with many othersAll this that you’ve mentioned are part of everyday lives that you just have to make up your mind that they don’t get into you and control your emotions or imaginations. It’ll gradually kill your sense of reasoning and make you do things you’re not suppose to do as a human being. You’ll definitely go illegal if you can’t control yourself with the pressure of all this.Quote from: Hatchy on August 01, 2023, 03:48:37 PMMy only question now be say, as dem dey do all these things dey show the younger generations, which example dem dey set for dem? Because as e be now, yahoo don turn work for our country, and e no get how e go be, the new generation go still put hand for this matter. My people, abeg watin una see for this matter?They’re setting bad examples to the younger ones and until the government brings more stringent punishment for the culprits we might see a decline in youths involvement in that. The government also have to play a vital role in providing more works for the youths to engage in because lack of work and lots of depression can lead one astray.",
