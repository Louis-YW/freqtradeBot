  "content": "I've been following some threads and I've gotten so much interest in the good works they've done to bringing in tye knowledge of Bitcoin to their various communities either in churches or schools or even a local gathering and I also took the same route to getting more of this crypto knowledge to my local community through my local church.I have a personal charity foundation (not registered though) and we have been in function since 2019 and I think it will be nice to Introduce this to my family out here too and I was able to hold a local gathering yesterday in my church and despite yesterday being a week and working day, people were still able to turn up and I intend running my foundation on two major goals which includesCORE GOALS~ impacting primary knowledge of Bitcoin to the community~ helping improve lives through Bitcoin.These are the major goals I intend to build my foundation in and I could get some way to help as you will never know what the next person might be going through except you give a listening ear.My address is on my profile for those who will want to help and full details if everything will be given at the end of March to enable us distribute whatever we could afford to those in need of it.Thanks in advance and the thread is open for suggestions and contributions to how best we could run this together.Below are pictures of the meeting we had and the people wanted medical checkups on blood pressure, blood sugar level, eyes, malaria & typhoid, HIV & AIDS, pregnancy test and the rest of them and we also concluded that we'll share some sanitary pads and toiletries and these were out agreement and we hope to bring this to success by the end of March or even before them if we have the means.",

I don't understand the pics you are showing us,where are you in the picture, you are suppose to sit in front or stand in front to address your church members, instead I can only see an empty space and your church altar.Did you sit behind the people you are teaching about bitcoin. Secondly, why didn't you show us your the write up of what is on the paper one of the members held. I am only seeing a paper with your name and not your write ups. Take note of all these and next  time, you should do better than this.Keep it up.",

I'm so sorry for the pictures mate and I will try to get someone to assist me take pictures rather than doing it myself and beside this was a picture taken before the commencement of the talking stage as I felt that was the only time I might have to take pictures and we were able to discuss some important issues and I'm already working on how possible I'm hoping to run this and I will glad if you're also open to support see the vision come to a smooth manifestation.Quote from: hugeblack on February 08, 2023, 06:16:10 PMIs this Nigeria?Yes this is Nigeria and this post wasn't really intended for a show off as we really wanted to run all this things without bringing it online as I have always believed that charity work isn't a mandatory work and someone else shouldn't be bothered over making any donations but I do think most of our people truly needed help but had no one to run to and I'm trying to create first an enabling environment where one feels safe to express themselves and outside the exercise we want to embark on now, were also hoping on skill acquisition before second quarter of the year if things works out well.Quote from: Frankolala on February 08, 2023, 05:06:15 PMDid you sit behind the people you are teaching about bitcoin.

Why have you not tried to register it since then?

From the pictures shown and charity stuff, these are people you are rendering help to some of them don't even have browsing phones not to talk of any money for investment. The intention wasn't actually directed towards introducing them to Bitcoin but rather to discuss the pressing issues affecting the local community around me and this was a meeting comprising of both the old and the young and we wanted running a free medical checkups and give out free drugs but the recent financial crisis in the country didn't permit such, so we had to take a break and re-strategize and come up with something tangible and we also concluded on visiting the orphanage home and I'm planning on using the earning from my signature campaign to give back to the society and I wish people can turn up to assist me accomplish this.Thanks and hoping to get more people have Interest in helping out.",
