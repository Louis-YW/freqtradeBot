  "content": "Compared with USA or europe in UK no rules.It's kind of business wild west when markets and money making the rules there not the goverment.Quick peak in banking.Also UK Banks working so good you can Do bigger transactions Even with personal bank account like Barclays and loyds tsb Compared with canada you can only send up to 3k-5k with Banks like td trust and rbc personal accounts.The online Banks working quite flawless compared with canada and USA.The Europe Banks off course are better in some ways but UK Has the biggest transactions limits for personal accounts becouse UK banking is prepared for the rich people who have needs to send big ammounts off course Even for rich ones it's pocket money there specially in London.And off course UK Has some most relaxed debt rules compared with other Western countries.Also you have a lot ways to play with limited company scheme the company House system is quite flexible and you can play with that not direct like in the europe where everything is so strict.Money makes the rules in UK and you can get big loans and good credit cards.Also the privacy IS very goood Banks don't interupt much you for example you can Even add money on the account with just sort Code and account number and your own name IS not required Even not your id document what i like most i can walk in to bank branch with bag of full of money and add to any account without names or other bs nonsense info all i need is just sort Code and acc number.If UK Queen is Queen but the only king is money there i been many times in UK i been in USA i been in all over the world i been using every bank account of the Western countries and i can tell If you are Money person then UK Banks Are one of the best ones for dealing money.Also the cash is king in UK still and it's one of those countries when indviduals have big load of money not just in business accounts but Even in personal accounts.Also in UK there a lot ways to play to make money without actual work you can optain borrowing funds easy So by any means UK are compared with USA or canada the financial freedom.The worst financial freedom country would be Norway over there the Banks Are most difficult and your bank limits Are low and they ask you too many questions and everthing IS so restricted and difficult over there.So no financial freedom in Norway they both are royal countries but the way how different they Are from each other it's just insane.Also prepare yourself for that If you don't have debit card you cant get money from the Norway bank branch just becouse you have your id document like pasport.The other Nordic countries the best Banks are Nordea and Swedbank and SEB... You better Avoid finland own Banks they just Are short of liquity and not much connected with global liquity pool other then finland local liquity pool.Those things are very important when you deal with money and no wonder why many russian oligrachs or latin america wealthy ones or rich asians tycoons or people who are super wealthy choose UK their home and they keep their money and assets there becouse in UK whoever got money and wealth Are king there and it's most easy to deal with financial matters there.Also UK been covering most easy money lost of the bank frauds or thefts from the accounts that can not be said to USA or canada Banks when a lot money was stolen and frauded years Ago when Western countries had fraud and theft season then UK banks and financial instutions got biggest hit compared with USA and Au and canada but they did complain less then others Even they been getting bigger hit they still very wealthy and they did recover funds most and they still don't have problems of those thefts like stealing and frauds it was nothing for UK finlancail system So that show's how strong they are and how well insured UK finlancail system Are against Even the big losses like big Banks libor scandal when a lot money was Lost.Why i praise UK ? Becouse all that losses the UK still stand strong and no problems much becouse UK banking system have huge reservers.So it means UK are serious about business and money becouse If u Do business you got to have reservers to cover no matter what happens and UK dont complain they just cover all the losses not like USA or other Western countries who cry like baby.UK is good example how to be wealthy and insured against anything and how the rich people knows there no matter what happens in the world any occassions they remain wealthy.Off course second good money place are Dubai but Dubai banking system can not be compared with UK banking UK banking system is just so good that it feels like extasy",
