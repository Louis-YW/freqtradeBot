I have always been wary of these so-called investment platforms and this just confirms my suspicions. @OP, just wanted to suggest that maybe the Bitcoin board isn't the best place for this particular topic. It might be more helpful to move it to the Beginners & Help section. Just a thought!",

Most especially the part where the man was asked to invest more so he could gain back what he has lose to scam trading, it's more like they were asking him to chance his loss.They really did a very nice job in the documentary.Quote from: cafter on April 22, 2023, 07:14:29 PMyes, some days ago I also came across this type of scam in telegram, I first applied for a job on linkedin then someone contacted me through whatsapp and shared a telegram group for job.after joining telegram group there are 200 members in that group, and they were posting that they received payment after investing. the offer was like this: invest $500 get $750 in 10minutes, the group was so convincing that anyone who has knowledge about this scam may be also get trapped I was going to invest a small amount to test it.

When it comes to telegram one must be extremely careful because telegram is more like the den of scammers pretending to be parts of the company since it's very easy to wear the profile of the company and it's also easy to wear the company name and unlike linkedin and most other social media where you can see the past history of the account you're dealing with.That's why it's advisable to always make sure you disable the options that allows unknown numbers to be able to contact you on telegram, that way you won't be receiving PMs from those possing as member of some known company/projects.",

Always remember they're getting paid for it and may not do their own due diligence before accepting the offer not to mention, not everyone can do a proper research and assess the risk involved. Who knows maybe their \"research\" is looking up trustpilot reviews which are easily filled with fake reviews.Pointing this out cause the fake exchange appears to have gained credibility after sponsoring a known sports team. It's perfectly fine to become a fan of someone but we should all know our limits and not give in to weird parasocial attachments.",

It's important to always do your own research and be cautious when it comes to investing your money. Remember that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. If you ever have any doubts or concerns, it's always best to seek advice from a trusted financial advisor or do more research before making any decisions.",

This is the reason why they would create a telegram group or watsapp group and lure their victim into the trap. The moment you are in their midst,sorry for you,if you are not smart and greedy,you will fall for them. I have been a victim to these scammers,where I was trapped in their middle,and I even spoke with one of them before I realized myself,it was when I have already sent the funds. After five minutes, was when I woke up from my slumber. From that day I have never trusted anything from people I don't know on the internet. Actually,I fell for them because I was in a mess and was eager to get money.Quote from: GeorgeJohn on April 22, 2023, 10:15:49 PMIf everyone should know that this is the tactics scammers use to scam people I think many people will escape from scam. The funny thing with these scammers is that they will find another way again when most people have known their tactics. Greed and lack of contentment lead people to fall for them.",

These are the types of people who are susceptible to persuasion because of their logical thinking, and those who are unaware of the tricks con artists employ also end up as victims. The truth is that everything you mentioned is true—there is no easy money anyplace, especially online—and that you must work hard for it.
