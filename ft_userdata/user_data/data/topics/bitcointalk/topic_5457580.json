Even if you try splitting and using many addresses, it would still be detected by specialized algorithms. Bitcoin mixing provided by specialized services uses coins of many individuals at the same time and they make algorithms for tangling their transactions specifically to counter the tracking algorithms. But mixing doesn't make coins anonymous, it breaks the connection between the coins that you sent to a mixer and the ones that you received. You can still screw up and break your anonymity, for example by using the mixed coins as input together with non-mixed coins that are connected to you.",

No, it is still going to be traceable based on the input and output, and that's not how mixing works (as this seems to be your goal in the beginning, based on your definition).So it's better to just used bitcoin mixing or tumbling services to achieved anonymity. You can find a lot of them here, some of the forum community even carry bitcoin mixing service signature.",

As in, not being able to be traced back to the original KYC exchange, or in the case of \"tainted\" bitcoin, that? As others have already stated, the simple answer is no.If you care for coin anonymity, you should check out mixing services. Ideally open-source wallets with so called whirlpool features. See the wallet section of this forum. This is a good start: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5457078.0On the topic of why you can't just send your funds to a few new addresses that you own to create anonymity, search \"chain-analysis\".https://cointelegraph.com/news/antonopoulos-chainalysis-is-helping-worlds-worst-dictators-regimesGenerally I would recommend to check out Andreas Antonopoulos as a first resource to get informed about some Bitcoin fundamentals.https://www.youtube.com/@aantonop/videos",

As in, not being able to be traced back to the original KYC exchange, or in the case of \"tainted\" bitcoin, that? If you sending your bitcoins back and forth between different addresses in one wallet, it does not make sense. All transactions will be linked to that wallet. Do you mean back and forth by sending your coins to your used addresses? It is bad because the recommendation is don't reuse your Bitcoin addresses.If you have ever read guidelines to use Coinjoin transactions or Mixers, you will see they emphasize the importance of Inputs and Outputs. You have to choose Inputs, Outputs and Anonymity set properly to have good anonymity. If after a Coinjoin transaction or mixing process, you use Outputs to send back to your used addresses, it does not help your anonymity.",

The best that can be done is to use a mixer, coinJoin or to convert to a privacy coin like monero and convert back to bitcoin. But sending bitcoin through many hops before getting to the target addresses is also a good option if the transaction is done at different time like days or weeks in between, using many addresses and also better if you divide the coins into different addresses in the process.",

Using privacy tools like mixers and conjoin services are good because it would at least slow down the tracking process. They promote privacy because it will take a quality advanced tracing algorithms to track the movement of the funds. But I don't need to be scared if mixing coins will be appropriate as much as my coins are from a source clean. One of the biggest misconceptions about mixing and conjoin services is that they are mostly used for money laundering, illegal narcotics, computer fraud, and identity theft. But is this is far from the truth. I just learnt about the output and input principle of using mixers and it became clear that it is important to keep learning in this community.",

And you would spend a lot of money trough fees moving those Bitcoins around for nothing. On another note, Bitcoin is already anonymous since no one knows who is the real owner of the Bitcoin but it is always traceable trough the blockchain.My advice is using mixer services - they can break the connection with your starting address and you receive untraced Bitcoins. And of course, you should check for scams - use only services proven to be fair and real. Personally, I have never used such services/sites but you can surely find a respected one here on the forums.

The best way to stay anonymous with your bitcoin transaction is to make use of the mixing service, it will not allow the linkage of the bitcoin wallet address you're receiving or sending to, the mistake people make is that they thought rebroadcasting of their funds on multiple wallets will make it anonymous to track, but the real idea is that it may increase the difficulty in making the linking but not making it anonymous, the best way to achieve privacy is to make use of bitcoincore software for by running full node transaction on the blockchain.",

There are factors like which node is being used to broadcast the transaction, and other network related factors which debunk that this strategy in any way helps your anonymity. However, what it does do (if you do it with more sophistication than just moving it between your own wallet) is that it can potentially increase the ambiguity of whether or not the coins are still yours, or if they are now someone else's.
