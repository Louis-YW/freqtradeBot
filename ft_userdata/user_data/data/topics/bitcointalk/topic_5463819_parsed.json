Similar to the market capital of the Coin. If you want to manipulate the market you need the supply at least a reasonable amount as in the case of BTC if you want to manipulate the market in situations like now you need at least 20K BTC to 30K BTC.  For the answer to your query, I think no whales ever trade like that, even most of whales are considered as the long term holders.",

The point is variation follows a certain limit.

This is why we cant really be able to tell that its completely manipulation free yet whales+institutions could really make out some play here on this space.For crypto then it would be hard due to that decentralized aspect but if we do talk about stocks or forex then this is something that could really be seen but would really be that hard to be able to detect out when its happening. Futures trading is really that profitable in even just moving a few bucks with high leverage but something that would really be risky.For institutions then we cant really tell if they are doing this or not but i wont really be so shocked if ever they got caught someday.   Wait, is it possible? lol",

      "body": "Futures is like an agreement or contract to buy and sell your bitcoin or crypto at a specific price on a specific date hoping that you're right about the price when that time arrives and we know that the price of bitcoin is dictated by supply and demand and the spot market is where bitcoin and other crypto are sold or bought quickly depending on the market sentiments and how many people are currently buying or selling, now with that in mind we can surmise that if the prices are influenced by supply and demand then which means that the movement is pretty random which might may affect the result of your prediction of the price on your futures so yes in a way you can move the futures market with spot market but that's difficult to do and it's expensive for a company to do that not to mention that they have to be sneaky about their intent to manipulate the market to their favor because it's still market manipulation and insider trading to some degree. Just take the current price dump of bitcoin, I doubt that there's no insider who has a short position because they know that the prices are going to go downTLDR: If you have the money and influence, yes you can manipulate it.",

Typically, A sell-off happening on a single exchange doesn’t reflect to the general price of Bitcoin especially on future trading. Future trading market price is different to spot price for the sole purpose countering spot manipulation. Futures Market will not be affected in case someone sell-off on spot market while he has a position in the futures trading. The only way to manipulate the market is by doing a mass sell-off on multiple exchange to move the average price of Bitcoin which affects the future price.",

Now if any institution or whale takes an entry in a particular coin then they will try to think like this it is normal. But to move a particular coin to a particular target requires a lot of capital, especially in futures trading, pumping any coin requires a lot of capital. And manipulating the Bitcoin market is very difficult, running the Bitcoin market on your own is very difficult and requires huge capital. But yes the strategy you are talking about is possible but the most important thing here is that the trader has to have huge funds and the ability to control the market by himself.",

From my calculations out of 10, the type of whales you are talking about there will be 1 or 2 hard who are gonna behave like that in the market. Becasue most of the whales in the market always take their entry by particularly considering Bitcoin or any asset over a Long time frame, they mostly focus their analysis on the Fundamental and Descriptive nature.  Answering your question why not make more money, here Buddy I never said Whales don't Long or Short their positions, they do but as I said they don't really take part in the manipulation of the market. Their Long and Short Position is also for the Long term most of the time. Focus on the word Whale already having a 1K+ BTC would they like to risk their assets by risking in the day trade for some extra bucks? They would prefer putting their assets on collateral and buying more BTC from the Loan valuation mostly.",

Since institutions manage big funds and large amounts of money, every order they make creates a massive reaction in the fluctuation in price. They short in certain rice points and then also buy to regain back their losses. As their orders are pouring in, retail traders would also put up their orders that's where institution takes away the money of normal and retail traders.",

They are so smart and they can also manipulate in some point in the market. Manipulation usually happens in the cryptocurrencies with a low market cap. Meaning, the most volatile coins can be easily manipulated. You can see in the market in a candlesticks with long wicks. However, institutions can't always make the price go what they want because there are many institutions trade against them.
