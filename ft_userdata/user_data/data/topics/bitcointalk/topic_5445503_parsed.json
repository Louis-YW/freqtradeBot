  "content": "Hi, community!I am a beginner in blockchain and I want to build my own blockchain network, not for profit, to improve myself only. I simply know how Bitcoin work and I can explain it to anyone who does not know it.However, in blockchain development, I do not know how to start \"technically\". Yes, I can develop my own blockchain but probably it will not be similar to Bitcoin so I want to imitate Satoshi's mindset as much as I can, so I want to learn how Bitcoin work technically, not theoretically.I decided to follow the resources:-> https://developer.bitcoin.org/-> https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page-> The Blockchain Developer: A Practical Guide for Designing, Implementing, Publishing, Testing, and Securing Distributed Blockchain-based Projects by Elad Elrom-> Mastering Bitcoin Book - https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook-> Some Udemy coursesHowever, I wonder about your ideas about what should I focus on, first. How can I learn blockchain development the best? The time is valuable. Thank you.",

How can I learn blockchain development the best? The time is valuable. You could have a look on the pre-release version of BitcoinCoreYou can find the pre-release, v0.1.0, and v0.1.3 here, on the Satoshi Institute website : https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/code/It can give you a nice start and a source of inspiration.However, I see that you quoted Mastering Bitcoin book. This one will be more than useful for your project I think. But maybe just like an additionnal layer of help when it is required.If you aren't against the idea to pay for some ressources, as you already mentionned, you have plenty Udemy courses which are explaining how to start a Bitcoin-like/based blockchain from scratch. The issue with Udemy course is to find one which is not too superficial and newbie-friendly, A lot of them are only focusing on super basic things, and doesn't help a lot to increase your understanding of BTC once you already own some good knowledges.Finally, this book will give you the best starting point possible in my opinion : Programming Bitcoin- Learn how to Program Bitcoin from Scratch : https://books.google.bg/books/about/Programming_Bitcoin.html?id=OIuGtgEACAAJ&redir_esc=y(And maybe, you could use ChatGPT for that purpose, but I don't really know, I haven't tested it yet)Have a nice journey with Bitcoin programming !",

      "body": "QuoteAnd maybe, you could use ChatGPT for that purpose, but I don't really know, I haven't tested it yetNot really, because so far I reached only sources, where the whole program does not compile at all, or freeze on the first checked case (and it was for simple programs, like prime number generator, for more complex issues it was even worse). Also, even if ChatGPT has access to block hashes, it cannot just give it to you without modifications, you will reach invalid headers, and most computations are plain wrong. For example, when trying to use that for SHA-1, this chat claimed that 0x5a827999 squared is equal to 0x35a1e5a9ac99ab99, while the true answer is 0x1fffffff4d25fd71 (this is even worse, because ChatGPT seems to know that to get this result, using sqrt(2) is needed, it can give formulas, and all stuff, but it makes a lot of mistakes during most computations). Even in the latest version GPT-4, it is still terrible at computing, and I've got around 90% wrong answers for very basic questions. It is temporarily banned on StackOverflow, because those answers are completely wrong too many times.",

Thank you.Oh cool I'm doing the same thing. I just started learning Rust the other day and I want to work on learning blockchain dev and try to build a significant blockchain project in Rust. Eventual goal would be to do something in the Bitcoin ecosystem but I figure building my own thing even if just as a hobby project would be fun and help educate me on blockchain dev.",
