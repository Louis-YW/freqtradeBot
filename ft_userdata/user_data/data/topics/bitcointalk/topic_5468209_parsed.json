You can decide to go to land based casino to have some fun. The advice has been repeated countless number of time, that gamblers should have gambling budget and they should not spend beyond the budget. My gambling budget is 5% weekly if I gamble and lose in that week.",

Which other reason?Also, betting on different sports wont really be that somewhat entertaining or enjoyable unless if you do know all of those sports then it could be possible but if not then you are just simply trying out to be greedy and just dont mind whether you are knowledgeable on a certain sport or not, as long you do make out some bets then it is really something that you would really be having on mind on which you are really that betting for having that chance of winning knowing that results could really be only have two possible outcome which it is really that a win or lose since its only 2 teams/players which you would really be needing up to choose in betweenand some gamblers do think that its a 50-50% chance of winning but without even realizing that it is really that ideal that you should really know about the sports because if you dont then you wouldreally be seeing that winning chance is really that slim and wont really be making out assurance or guarantees.",

QuoteYOUR CHANCES OF LOOSING WILL INCREASE, BUT YOUR CHANCE OF WINNING MAY NOT INCREASE.This is a biased conclusion.  In probability, the number of try is the same number of chance of winning and losing.QuoteYOU WILL SPEND MORE TIME GAMBLING. Moderation is counter to this.  If a gambler moderate his playing time, then he will not have spend more time to gambling.At the end of the day, gambling can be moderated, it depends on the gambler whether he will gamble responsibly or just gamble away without any restrictions.  But of course if a gambler wanted to not get affected negatively he should gamble more responsibly.",

Which other reason?According to OP; I can sense that there is lack of strategy or organization. As a gambler, even while your sole aim for gambling is to make good amount of money; you need to have a strategy and a gambling budget one that you cannot exceed no matter what. If you don't have a strategy or a gambling budget; then you need to seek help as you are battling with addiction.Remember, set your gambling budget and strategy today!!!!!",

Which other reason?This is advice that I learned through playing poker and trying to up the grind by adding more tables. There are apparently people around the world who are able to master 4, 8, 12 or even more tables at one time and probably play a pretty tight game in order to achieve that. However even with a strategy in mind it requires intense concentration and can be super draining of your energy, even over short periods of time. It really depends on what game you're on about though, it's rather pointless playing more than one slots game at a time, as you're already losing on average for every single spin of the reel that you take. If you want to burn through your wallet faster, that's the only reason you should be doing it.",

Which other reason?There are numerous factors that should be stated; strategies are one of the groups that influence gamblers' decision-making. I completely agree with everything you mentioned here; gambling has a lot of obligations and risk factors. We're grownups with responsibilities; after all, we bear the risks and losses when they emerge. When it comes to addiction, it worsens when a gambler has nothing to depend on other than selling his properties to raise money to wager on games which is pretty terrible, no chance to be able to get back on our heel if we don't plan out steps.",

Well, those are the effects when someone gambles and that's known by most gamblers. If someone wants to gamble and can't stop himself, there is no problem with that.It is their money that shall be spent whether for gambling or a pastime that they've chosen. One thing here is they should maintain themselves for not being emotional. A gambler who's too addicted will realize that he's going nowhere and those that are just having fun, we're all going to spend time and money on it. So, expect that everything you do with either the need to have money to start will definitely make you spend both time and money.",

Which other reason?Or you don't have money lol. Gambling is an activity that requires it after all, I don't think anyone starts gambling with the mindset already that they don't want to be addicted or what, they're simply looking for a method to spend money and have fun, and gambling is probably one of those things. Now most of what you've said isn't actually anything bad, spend time? That's the same for any activity you want to do really. Spend more money? I mean if you have enough then why not? The thrill increases depending on the scale anw (just don't go overboard at some point). Chances are always set in stone, but a bit lower on your side due to the house edge. Addiction is eh, it's more of a condition that involves money instead of gambling itself, you can call gambling the medium instead really. That's really up to the person to identify and fix.",

You can still end up spending alot more cash on gambling by simply placing the same bets on different platforms...I dunno the sentiments behind placing bets on several platforms to see which one cuts; I believe if these are livegames, then it doesn't make any sense as the casino isn't even in position to manipulate the games - assuming that's the reason they chose to practice that pattern.Sandra 🧑‍🦰",

      "body": "When you buy bets on different sports, you need to know the analysis of many matches and the characteristics of many sports by not focusing on one sport. So you will need to follow the players, whether the players can play or not, etc. one by one and buy bets accordingly. It will be difficult to follow this and thus, as you said, you will have the chance to lose more money while spending more money. In such cases, you will need to focus on one sport or if you are going to continue to bet on different sports, you will need to allocate separate amounts to the sports. For example, you can allocate 5x to football, 2x to basketball and x amount of money to other sports. Of course, this will vary depending on which one you are your favorite and which one you follow more.",

Which other reason?I only gamble on football, and I don’t gamble on other sports, but I think I won’t agree with something’s you said. If there is proper planning, if you have a fixed amount of money that you spend on gambling or a limit that you don’t exceed when gambling, then I don’t think you will be spending more on gambling since you already set a limit for yourself, and I am sure that will also be able to solve the addiction problem. I checked some comments above, and some people said if you are gambling on only one sport, you going to get bored. It might be boring to some people, but let’s use football as an example. There are lots of leagues there, and you can gamble on different leagues, I don’t think you will get bored when gambling on different leagues.",

For the gambler's desire to be satisfied, he or she needs to bet on those casinos if possible and have the fun that they desire.It could also be possible that the game I predicted in gambling's A has a higher awarding bonus or is odd when I try it out in another casino, and I might want to try that out even if it's just for that particular game so that if the game enters for winning, I can be able to win some good money from both sides, and if it also doesn't, I can lose everything. Many people have reasons why they gamble in different casinos; they can still do that and don't become addicts.
