However, I believe these situations are not a threat whatsoever for the future growth of the Marketcap, one of the reasons is the deflationary nature of Bitcoin itself. Just my opinion, of course.

      "body": "The idea that fiat currency is going to be inflated away to being of no value is what makes a lot of people pick up a stack of BTC just in case.  I think we're still in the growth phase of BTC, but at some point when it's penetrated enough markets, it's value will be driven not by it's growth, but by the decline of fiat currencies.  It's hard for people in developed nations to really comprehend inflation above 100%.  Watching your savings disappear as banks won't let you access it anyway.  It's a nightmare that most people don't think it really possible for them.  Maybe it will seem more possible in the coming years as governments struggle with recession and war while Bitcoin becomes more scarce (and hopefully with more use cases).",

Of course, people will think now that the use of Bitcoin is somewhat a good way to escape from inflation but the question is if it is acceptable in our country and stores as we know that only a few had adopted it for now. It means that we still need to convert our Bitcoin to fiat in order to use it. Meaning we are still hit back by inflations.",

But generally speaking, Bitcoin could provide some level of relief for inflation because it isn't inherently designed to reduce purchasing power.Keep in mind, a consumer who only holds Bitcoin is going to be affected by inflation the same way someone with fiat would be if the inflation isn't induced via money printing but rather consumer goods increasing in price collectively due to external circumstances (ie a war). But with fiat, once new dollars are printed, it becomes difficult to remove them from circulation so your purchasing power will go down proportional to the amount of new dollars introduced.",

      "body": "There's this thing called inflation death spiral. When inflation remains at 2-3% people don't notice it. Goods and services don't visibly go up in price every month and people spend money when they need to. Situation changes when inflation hits double digits, at which point prices can go up month to month and you see it. That makes people spend more money to get rid of it, more spending means more loss of value for the currency and more inflation. Such event, like the ones in Venezuela, Turkey, Zimbabwe, make people dump currency for a better store of value and that includes bitcoin, so the price is and will be affected positively by inflation. On the other hand countries try to slow this selling of currency by adjusting interest rates and this can make some investors (mainly those who are now in debt, or who invested on credit) sell their bitcoin. This is a temporary situation though because in all possible scenarios bitcoin pumps in the end.Scenario 1: FED keeps increasing rates and crashing the markets. Traditional markets will dump and take bitcoin for a ride, but stocks can go much lower than bitcoin. Eventually people will start switching to hard assets like bitcoin and gold and make bitcoin decouple from stocks.Scenario 2: FED gets scared of crashing the markets and pivots. They'll go back to printing and realize that their target inflation levels are unachievable. Everything goes back up, bitcoin pumps for speculative reasons.Scenario 3: We get an inflation death spiral that leads to hyperinflation and a monetary collapse. Again people will turn into hard assets, bitcoin goes up.Scenario 4: people get scared of FED rates, stop taking loans, stop spending, inflation goes down, FED keeps the rates at current level to stabilize the markets. Bitcoin will remain stable and pumps after the next halving as difficulty rises.",

On the contrary, it is even possible that a cashless policy would somehow limit the people's spending to the point that the demand on goods and services is significantly reduced, thereby causing the price to fall. Imagine how much money that should have circulated if bank withdrawals in some countries were not reduced to a very low minimum.Inflation doesn't have a single effect on Bitcoin.

If you hold bitcoin from 2014 or 2017 to the present, even though the value of bitcoin has dropped 80% since ATH, it is still at a high growth compared to the price from 2014 or 2017.
