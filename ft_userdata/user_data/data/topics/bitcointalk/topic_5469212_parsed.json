      "body": "When you contacted the support, did they make any mention of anything relating to multi-accounting as your offence, or did they just lock the account without giving you any reason why the account was locked? I'm asking because I can't find their statement in your OP. Maybe you are assuming that because you are living in the same place as someone who has an active account with them, multi-accounting should be your case, but I doubt that can be the case considering the fact that you claimed you and your friend have already passed the KYC procedure to prove your identity and single ownership.Â Try reaching out to the support services and see their responses; maybe you will know the next step to take. They also have an announcement thread here and a representative, which should make it possible for them to also follow up on your case here on the forum.",

Basically because he is probably full of shit if ya ask me. There is no reason to ask anyone to delete anything if you're legit. @OP, the casino already responded to you. You had multiple accounts and were limited on 1 in their sportsbook. Instead of accepting that, you made another account and tried to break the rules surpassing the limits set on your 1st account. Before you go answering me crying saying you are 2 different people, I'm not buying it. I'm sure you had a friend sign up and make a separate account so if asked you could provide documents, but I think both accounts were likely in your control. I could be wrong but this is my feeling.",
