  "content": "I have read about Coinbase plan to establish a derivative exchange outside of US some weeks ago but now I know the company mean business. It is what Coinbase was not thinking about until the tough regulation from United States regulators. In United States, you can not even leverage. Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-derivatives-exchange-set-to-roll-out-btc-and-eth-futuresOn June 1, Coinbase revealed its plans to introduce Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts on June 5 through its Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated derivatives exchange. The futures contracts will be targeted toward institutional investors.Position that can be opened will be up to 5x and it is in BTCUSDC and ETHUSDC. Probably other trading pairs would be added later. Using USDC for it can be enough, as I know Coinbase to have been only supporting USDC stable coin.But why Coinbase not going for BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT contracts too? On some exchanges that I am using, like Bybit and OKX, you can see both USDT and USDC contract. While on others that I am using like Binance, Kucoin and Huobi Global, only USDT is there because it is the most stablecoin with the highest liquidity. Why Coinbase do not like USDT future contracts?",
