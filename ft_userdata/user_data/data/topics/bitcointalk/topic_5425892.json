This is sound advice. Not just unknown or newly created websites but also old known sites and bots.3commas had an API key exploit where lots of traders lots money not so long ago ----> Binance Accounts Exploited Due To 3Commas API Key HackWith this kind of threat, I think traders have to go an extra mile and all the API key to trade from whitelisted IP addresses",

This should be your priority, let's say you are campaigning what you are sharing here, you should show elegance first so that the community here will be attracted to you. I just suggest this to you, because if you don't do it, I think that no matter how much hype you do, you will have a hard time gaining the trust of people here on this platform.You should also have a free trial for your prospects here as one of the commenters said here, dude.",

It is not enough to advertise a new product and expect people to rush into it without trial.
