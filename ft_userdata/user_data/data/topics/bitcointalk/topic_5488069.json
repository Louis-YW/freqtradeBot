I believe that in the future the majority use will continue to be, as it is today, as an investment, as an enhanced digital gold. And, since not everyone has investments and not everyone has gold, I think the same thing will happen with Bitcoin. In addition, as with everything, there will be people who will own and others who will own less, as happens now.",

Also, the indicated amount is already incorrect, because several million bitcoins are temporarily (or permanently) removed from the general circulation.- Bitcoin price (as everyone knows) is very volatile.Therefore, for 1 dollar will give a completely different amount of satoshis per unit of time. Accordingly, each person (hypothetically) will have a completely different amount of satoshis in the same unit of time.These are all theoretical calculations and there will not be an almost uniform distribution of satoshis among all the inhabitants of the world, because a clear imbalance is already emerging when whales have hundreds and thousands of bitcoins in their possession (or even more), and ordinary users have hundreds and thousands, but already satoshis.",

      "body": "I like that metric. If you do the total supply (21 mil btc or 2.1 quadrillion sats) divided by current pop (8.25 b) you get about 0.0025 btc or 250,000 sats, currently.We should have some sort of unit of measuring bitcoin in which one unit is btc/population. So currently ~234,573 sats would be equal to one \"bitcoin-person\" or something haha. Then people could measure how much bitcoin they have against this metric of BTC per human.I have barely bought bitcoin since 2019 cuz I retired off my bitcoin in 2019 and so no longer earn an income from working, but I do trade crypto during the bullish years of the market cycle so I do make some income... I think I might try to start to DCA either weekly according to this supply divided by global population metric - 250,000 sats each time, close to one bitcoin-person unit. Weekly would allow me to accumulate 0.13 btc per year which ain't bad. Thanks for the inspiration OP!In fact, I just now started! Picked up my first new bitcoin-person (250,000 sats) at $68,900 just a few seconds ago.",

      "body": "Yeah obviously its kinda arbitrary, because its not like everyone in the world is ever going to own Bitcoin. And meanwhile there are a lot of non-person entities that are going to own a ton of bitcoin, replacing billions of people, like corporations, govts, investment firms, etc.Realistically we might say in the next 20-30 years maybe there will be another billion people who enter bitcoin and they are going to be competing to buy only a few million bitcoin.But for simplicity this is nice. Its meaning is just that if you get above this small amount of Sats you are already above what the average could own if everyone owned bitcoin equally. So if you get multiples of that number you can think of yourself as taking up more and more 'people' out of the population who could own Bitcoin, and therefore you are getting more and more of an advantage on the average person when it comes to this extremely scarce and extremely valuable asset. And right now its a small enough value that at least for people in richer countries it could be a good first buy-in for anyone wanting to tip toe in into the market. And it's nice to think something along the lines of:  \"oh Bitcoin is so scarce and I was lucky enough to get in fairly early so I already have 100 (or however many) people worth of bitcoin!\" And with how valuable a whole bitcoin is these days, its kinda of a nice usable unit of measurement for bitcoin. A Sat is worth basically nothing, and hardly anyone who hasn't yet started buying Bitcoin will ever be able to get a whole bitcoin, but there are hundreds of millions of people in the world who don't own bitcoin yet who could easily buy this amount of bitcoin.",

Oppositely Bitcoin price is updated real time.A big assumption is all people on the world will invest in Bitcoin, to make this calculated figure. This will never happen but this big assumption and the calculations give us a raw view on what will happen for each person if all world people will spend money to buy bitcoin.Fortunately, because many people have yet invested in Bitcoin, we are early birds and can take advantage of it and accumulate Bitcoin with cheaper price than when more people will join this market.",

In open societies that allow private initiative to drive the economy, have a strong legal system and low taxes, the distribution of wealth has been mostly a result of the effort, talent and dedication of each human being. Those who speak of an injustice in the distribution of wealth dream of totalitarian regimes like the USSR or China in the 20th century. If we want more recent examples, let us look at the example of Venezuela and we will see how this tale of redistribution of wealth ends. All this without taking into account that those who talk about this bullshit consider wealth as a pie, as something static, instead of something that is in constant movement, that is created or destroyed, so that global wealth has risen enormously in the last two centuries, just after enlightened people like Marx and Malthus launched their apocalyptic messages, so that everyone is richer than 200 years ago, rich and poor.",
