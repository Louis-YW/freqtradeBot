ChatGPT is a powerful assistant tool, but through my usage of it over time (I'm a copywriter, and I use a ChatGPT to help supplant me with ideas and new words to use and abuse throughout my works), I would lie if I say it wasn't useful, but it's not on par with how we work. ChatGPT, despite the fact that it is marketed as a conversational and human-like chat tool, still lacks a couple areas in authenticity which makes it stand out when checking comes around. So I don't think the tool will effectively destabilize or even replace white collar work, what I predict will happen is that the tool will be an aid to many people especially within the aforementioned white-collar-sector where it would be indispensable.",

There are some levels to which automated machines can work, but you still need humans to man those machines and make other supervisory roles. As technology advances, human beings strategies on role to play in companies and government agencies, that's why the labour force has all the knowledge any industry is looking for. So I believe, the white-collar workers will still be available to offer their technical know-how when ever the needs arises.",
