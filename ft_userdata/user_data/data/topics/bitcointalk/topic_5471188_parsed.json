If you check that address on any block explorer you will be able to see the balance of that 5$ but it is not showing on the wallet because that’s not the right wallet you recovered.",

      "body": "I have just tested this and you are right, but it is written that the password should be backed up for the purpose of recovering back the wallet. If you have finish setting up the wallet, no password would be require to open the wallet. But that can confused some people and it would have been better if Wasabi refer to is as passphrase because it is BIP39 passphrase and not a password.I tried to omit the passphrase that Wasabi called password, to open a wallet without the passphrase, but it displayed that it is downloading and processing bitcoin network data, which is taking longer time.The recommendable wallets that I am using are Electrum, Sparrow and Bluewallet. Edit: It is worth mentioning that you can use Wasabi wallet without additing the passphrase which Wasabi called password. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5471188.msg63035230#msg63035230But I will still mention that Wasabi needs to change that to passphrase for it not to confuse people.",

The wallet coinjoin which is no more recommended has been the reason I do not use this wallet, but this naming of passphrase to be password has been the second reason now.Exactly, even me I had to find out that it is actually a passphrase when I checked the GitHub link, although they had indicted the password as passphrase by putting it in parenthesis but it will still look cocky. Moreover I don’t get why it is a must to set it up when creating a wallet. The other wallet do ask where you want to include it or not but wasabi here is making it compulsory when creating a wallet which is not right although it add another layer of security to the seed phrase Quote from: robelneo on October 22, 2023, 08:22:02 AM he kept his passphrase but not the password associated with that wallet,What your friend kept was the seed phrase which was the 12 words, the passphrase would be the 13th word you added",

It has a default backup directory and all the wallet I created was seen after I installed back the wallet. Wallet 1, has the passphraseWallet 2, did not have the passphrase as I omitted it (wallet 1 seed phrase without passphrase)Wallet 3, new wallet seed phrase with no passphrase added.After I opened the wallet after I reinstall the wallet Wallet 1 that has the passphrase, displayed the frustration downloading and processing network date (above image). When I first set it up, there was nothing like that.Wallet 2 also displayed the image above as usualWallet 3 surprisingly did not displayed the image, although which was the first that I opened without data network on after I reinstalled the wallet. I on the data and it synchronized.I confirmed wallet 3 on incoleman BIP39 tool and it was correct (and without passphrase).So this leaves me with the conclusion that you can use the wallet without the passphrase. I mean if you omit to use passphrase and not include it while setting up the wallet.But the wallet was frustrating for me as that downloading and processing takes a longer time.After more than 30 minutes, wallet 2 without passphrase is also working now.",

      "body": "This highlights one of the bigger problems with bitcoin wallets and that is the lack of standard verbiage for some things. In this case, Wasabi is talking about a BIP 39 Passphrase but they call it a \"password\".Other wallets, like Sparrow Wallet, would call this a passphrase. A wallet password should just be something that encrypts the local wallet file but you can still recover your wallet if you have the seed phrase. Wasabi seems to have named their passphrase a password. That is not only bad for their user experience (since your friend lost their $5 of sats) but it's bad for wallet interoperability and the bitcoin ecosystem overall. I don't know much about Wasabi as I haven't used them in a few years and I don't want to just dump on them because so many others do but I would probably avoid using it if this is their user experience. I think you will find that Sparrow wallet is a much more feature rich wallet anyway. Food for thought.",

We are all acquainted with normal custom of keeping hold of the passphrase. Honestly, it's funny how we skip the manual and instructions on certain things and end up complaining when we encounter problems. Most of the problem will be avoided if we can take our time to be reading the instructions carefully. On behalf of her, thank you for the generosity.",
