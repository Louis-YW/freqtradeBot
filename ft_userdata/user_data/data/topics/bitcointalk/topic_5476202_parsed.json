  "content": "Well, we all know that Mixers Signatures will be ended by 1st Â Jan 2024. There are new rules being imposed regarding promoting mixers on this forum.Well, Theymos has given a grace period of one month, to wind up all these things including signature campaigns. Now the question comes whether we show respect to the theymos decision and remove our signatures as soon as possible for everyone benefit and to show that we respect the forum decisions or will you people will keep wearing the signatures till 31 December so that you earn every penny you can. Also it means that most users are not willing to let go mixers signatures as they keep them till the last seconds.The same challenge goes to the campaign managers to announce this or this current week as the last one to wind up things Â (in favor and agreeing to theymos) or still be willing to go till the last week of December",

Bear in mind that such decisions are not taken just like that, there are a lot of things that we don't know or realize, and someone who is in charge of everything will know more and he must be keeping a lot of things in the background just to keep us safe or avoid spreading panic all around.Changes come and go, things evolve, but nothing stops, the world keeps going and things start to look normal after a little while.",

Actually, Sinbad has been called so many times before this case opening, that it is being involved in money laundering, I read about its case around 2 months ago and from then I did not applied to this campaign, even though I have submitted my POA maybe 1 or 2 times but that's when I thought there is no confirmation (solid one) there as if the government would have solid proof two months ago they would have seized it then not now.AFAIK, most of the campaigns on BTT are about Mixers and this technology is really good and we all should use it for better use cases (I think before 1 Jan we can talk about Mixers but theymos has restricted us to). All I am trying to say is, that there should be no bad use of it and if one is caught doing it, a quick reaction should be taken against it.This way the fear among others will be placed and they will avoid such mistakes to Launder money. But the overall decision is hard to bear but it is what it is, Theymos has left no other choice for us and the situation has left none for him I think.",
