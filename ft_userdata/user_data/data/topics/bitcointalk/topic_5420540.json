The worst part is many news channel will pick up their news from ANI as it's their primary source and play the same thing repetitively without any fact-checking on their part as well, all this will spoil the name of crypto in India.",

They froze and seized the user's funds in the favor of ED after receiving the request from ED. But media is projecting it if Binance has made the default. Classic Indian media.On the different note, this case could be seen as a warning by the Indian traders. They consider Binance as a safe haven and think that if they move funds from Indian exchanges to Binance, the authorities can't trace it anymore. However, this isn't the case. As long as their identities are linked, the authorities have the rights under PMLA Act, 2002 to seek for such help from the foreign companies.",
