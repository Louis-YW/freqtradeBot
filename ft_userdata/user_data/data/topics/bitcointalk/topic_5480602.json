  "content": "Introduction In our today world, promotion has been a key contributor to the major success of almost everything that are on a verge to fulfillment. In other words, we can say that promotion has been the back-bone of several break-through. Whether direct or indirect promotion, it certainly have a way of raising curiosity that helps to attract large audience. We've seen it's effect on goods and services, music and movies, politics, etc. It sounds more true when we take a look at our place of residence and realize that almost everything we see went through a stage of promotion, from our home appliances to cooking utensils.This is quite unclear in the case of Bitcoin. Some crypto ethusiast don't think that there is a neccesity in promoting Bitcoin, while others think Bitcoin promotion is very vital and should be encouraged. Sadly, the internet space has manipulated us in thinking that more than 50% of the world uses Bitcoin so therefore there is no need in promoting it. This sounds true, but we've failed to realize that the internet space is a cycle that holds a certain group of people with same ideology that differs from the ideology of those who don't use the internet.I did a quick survey just around my environment. My survey was ideally meant to figure out those who have heard about Bitcoin and might possibly be a user in the future. I could easily draw my conclusion considering the fact that i know these people well. It turned out that 18/26 men, 25/31 women and 16/27 youths might not use Bitcoin in the future. My conclusions were based on internet illiteracy, ignorance, age, etc.Ideally, the above factors shouldn't be a problem only if we find ways to raise the curiosity of a none Bitcoin ethusiast. We don't raise their curiosity by telling them the benefits that Bitcoin offers. We raise their curiosity by putting them in a situation where they will be force to ask what the BTC logo stands for.Ways we can promote the use of bitcoin as individualsThe purpose of using this two methods helps to raise the curiosity of none Bitcoin ethusiast(NBE). These two methods are clearly indirect ways of promoting Bitcoin1. Social mediaSocial media has been a huge contributor to Bitcoin. Current Information keeps running every seconds which keeps the Bitcoin community updated. The regular/consistent posting of Bitcoin related matters on a personal social space is a great way of getting the attention of others. In a space of one year, your neighbour who happens to be a friend on your social space would be force to ask about the BTC logo.2. Our physical itemsThis is also a superb way of raising the curiosity of a none Bitcoin ethusiast. When Items like shirts, cups, stickers, etc contains Bitcoin logo, and it's present in major parts of your house/environment, it would certainly raise questions from the people around. Sometimes, it might happen that the none Bitcoin ethusiast isn't the social type, but when he/she continues to see something that isn't familiar, then curiosity is certain.How do we educate those that are ready to learn? Ideally, educating people about btc is also a way of promoting it. While educating, over exaggeration of profits should be exempted. This feels very exciting to do, but it shouldn't be encouraged. We must consider two aspect of discussion based on the criteria on ground. If the person who is willing to learn lives in a rural area, then Bitcoin investment  should be fitting topic, but if the person happens to live in an urban region, then p2p and investment should be well discussed.Urban areas is usually associated with certain commercial businesses that accepts btc as mode of payment, unlike rural areas where it is not common.In conclusionThe promotion of Bitcoin should be strongly encouraged among Bitcoin community individuals. This would certainly help Bitcoin get to the grass root, both in rural and urban regions. These are clearly my opinion.What do you guys think about Bitcoin promotion and other ways we can promote Bitcoin in our community?.",

Giving them the idea on how Bitcoin works will be one that we should consider because of it's importance in the long run.

Billboards, flyers, leaflets, seminars and also we can promote Bitcoin through fashion. Just do your thing, don't encourage people wait for them to ask you about Bitcoin.",

They get so excited to let people know about it and immediately tell them how juicy it is without telling the proper steps to follow I order to not fall victim of loss or any negative consequences in the market. How profitable bitcoin investment can be should be the last you should let a new person know after you’ve tell them how good the investment is, the pros and cons and what they stand to gain in the future after investing in it. Some people get carried away that privacy and security which is suppose to be the first thing to know about in bitcoin investment is neglected. No matter how good the offer is after the long investment, you should prioritize securing your funds first.",

To make it as normal as our morning coffee.Social media is like a voice for us online. So, lets take it to a personal level. Tell tales like \"My First Bitcoin Purchase\" or \"How Bitcoin Made Me Rich\". It is not about using academic terms; it is about getting to know each other as people. And guess what? People love stories. They stay with you like that song you cant stop thinking about.Now we'll talk about Bitcoin swag. Yes, cups and shirts. They make people want to talk. \"Hey, whats that cool logo?\" your friend might ask. You've got them hooked. And teaching those who are interested? Keep it simple and easy to understand. Wherever you live, Bitcoin is a lifestyle, not simply a currency.",

Another research also states that only 0.5% of the world's population owns Bitcoin. We have to always do our research to avoid believing fake news.QuoteIn conclusionThe promotion of Bitcoin should be strongly encouraged among Bitcoin community individuals.

These are clearly my opinion.What do you guys think about Bitcoin promotion and other ways we can promote Bitcoin in our community?.Promoting Bitcoin is by choice and not an obligation. If you have the opportunity to educate someone about Bitcoin, you could go ahead and expose the currency to the individual. But don't forget that Bitcoin promotes privacy. You don't need to show everybody that you own Bitcoin this is why I am not comfortable with wearing materials that show people that I own Bitcoin. There have been cases of attacks by armed robbers on some crypto promoters because they were promoting the industry on social media. I prefer to select the people that I inform about Bitcoin because of safety. Not to worry, Bitcoin will always find itself in news headlines because of its uniqueness. But like I said, if you have a platform to promote Bitcoin don't hesitate to do it because the currency needs more awareness and adoption.",

It no longer needs shilling marketing efforts, like we commonly see with alternate cryptocurrencies nowadays, to expand its adoption.Naturally, every four years, with each Bitcoin halving event, Bitcoin is mentioned more on social media and it will be exposed to new people. Some of them will become new Bitcoiners, new Bitcoin maximalists who will be tested with a consequent bear market. Who are strong enough to stay through one bear market will actually stay here for many years.The bullish case for Bitcoin.You can read it on Medium or buy a book from Amazon.",

Bitcoin can also be promoted in a charitable way by showing love to people in need.

Our physical itemsThere are pros and cons to this two method you listed but before I begin I want to support your initiatives of promoting bitcoin in the best way we can in our locality. Bitcoin isn't a new invention anymore as people already know about Bitcoin but percentages of people that know about bitcoin aren't using it as a currency because of many reasons but we won't be going into the reasons for this discussion but we can encourage the use of Bitcoin by providing people a means to ise Bitcoin provided why aren't breaking any laws of our country. For the two method, I'll prefer the physical store approaches than the social media. Social media will reach a wider range of audience but we'll be attracting only those that sees bitcoin as an assets to be used as store of wealth or to multiply wealth. There's nothing wrong in that but we need more people that'll give Bitcoin physical utility so accepting Bitcoin at our physics shops will help with that.QuoteIn conclusionThe promotion of Bitcoin should be strongly encouraged among Bitcoin community individuals. This would certainly help Bitcoin get to the grass root, both in rural and urban regions. These are clearly my opinion.What do you guys think about Bitcoin promotion and other ways we can promote Bitcoin in our community?.We all have to contribute to the growth of Bitcoin in its utility features, the little we can do will go a very long way. We're in a decentralized environment so everyone has to put hands together to achieve our aim but we shouldn't go against the governments of our nations to avoid jail time or huge fines.",
