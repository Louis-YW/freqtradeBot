  "content": "Hi guysI've finally managed to connect my new hardware wallet to my node via EPS.I'd like to transfer my BTC funds from my old (Ledger) hardware wallet to my new one, but I don't quite know how to go about it.First I'm gonna reset my new HW wallet. That way I get some brand new addresses that aren't linked to any of my personal information.Then I am going to link Electrum to this new wallet (offline of course).Then I'm going to use my ledger to send my funds to the new HW wallet.My questions;First of all, am I missing something in my summary above?Should I connect the ledger wallet to my node for the transfer as well? Or is only connecting my new HW wallet safe enough?Should I send my BTC to different addresses in the new HW wallet, or is it safe enough to send them all to one address?All of my BTC is KYC. Does this mean that I lose my extra privacy that I got with my node, by doing transactions through my node?I'm sorry if some information/questions aren't clear.English is not my native language, and I'm not really a tech guy so my understanding of BTC is still rather low.Thanks in advance!",

Or is only connecting my new HW wallet safe enough?I'm not sure what exactly you mean here.You need new addresses, from the new HW. After that, you definitely need to access your old Ledger wallet to send BTC to the new addresses. There is NO difference compared to sending anywhere else, here only you know that it is your new HW wallet.QuoteShould I send my BTC to different addresses in the new HW wallet, or is it safe enough to send them all to one address?It also depends on the quantity you have and your later needs, but I guess it's better to send everything to one address. He could use the transaction as a consolidation of funds if they were collected from several smaller transactions. It has nothing to do with safety if they are in the same walletQuoteAll of my BTC is KYC. Does this mean that I lose my extra privacy that I got with my node, by doing transactions through my node?If your coins are already \"KYC\" as you say, you've already lost your privacy there. If such a status suits you, then it is enough just to move the coins and there will be no significant changes in that matter. Anyone who knows that your address is A and all the funds on it is yours will certainly know that you sent them to address B and it will be easy to determine the connection of those addresses with your KYC information.In case you want to increase the privacy of your BTC, then when moving from old to new HW, use one of the mixer & tumbler services.Be sure to ask here before taking any more serious steps if you are not sure, it's better that way than to feel bad for you later.",

Moreover, there many countless ways to track and link bitcoin transactions. First of all, to reduce personal information when you want to buy bitcoins, you can take a look at decentralized exchanges such as Bisq. Or any other non-kyc solutions that are addressed on https://kycnot.me/.So, in order to regain privacy, you can utilize the mixing service. Mixing is a way to obscure your coin origin. It is like you sending your coin into a pool of coins, and then the pool would mix all the coins. In the end, since the coin is mixed from many user's coin, if done correctly, the coin you receive wouldn't be able to be associated with your KYC'ed coin.If you want to learn further about Bitcoin privacy, I recommend this compilation of resources: https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/privacy.html.",

If you do so, you will reveal all your addresses as belonging to the same person. If that is not a problem for you, go onOtherwise, split and console your old addresses accordingly to your privacy needs.For example, I try not to mix my addresses that i use in bitcointalk to other ones that I exposed my real Id",

Is it something that you consider \"necessary\" for future privacy?I consider it necessary especially if you're someone that is very particular about your privacy and it's not only used by someone that has something to hide, but by someone who does not want to have their information laying on the internet for anyone to exploit.Many people do not mix their coins and have not been doxxed yet, but if your privacy is already compromised it's something that cannot be repaired; your details would always be potential public information.There are also options to centralized exchanges that doesn't require KYC.",

Both addresses in this case belong to you, in two hardware wallets. It is an on-chain transaction so it will need some satoshi for transaction fee.QuoteAll of my BTC is KYC.

You can simply use your new HW to manage your funds as in the old one.Quote from: SleepyChemist on June 09, 2023, 02:09:45 PMFirst I'm gonna reset my new HW wallet. Why? Being new, you don't need to reset anything.Quote from: SleepyChemist on June 09, 2023, 02:09:45 PMFirst of all, am I missing something in my summary above?Yes, you don't need to do any transactions, let alone reset anything on a new HW, unless by 'new' you mean you bought it from Amazon or similar. Privacy you do not have, your bitcoin being KYC. The rest about privacy has already been explained to you. Quote from: SleepyChemist on June 09, 2023, 09:20:49 PMThank you all for your answers.I've read up on mixing and while it does seem great to have non traceable BTC, I think I'm not going to do it.It seems like you have to put a lot of trust into the organisation that runs the mixer and I'm not ready to give that much trust.In the future however, I'll only buy BTC from non-KYC exchanges and store them on a different wallet. That way I have a stash of non traceable BTC as well, just in case.If you are going to do that you will have to be very careful not to mix your bitcoin KYC with your non-KYC bitcoin. The best thing to do is, when the price goes up a bit, sell your bitcoins on the exchange you bought them from for fiat, create a new wallet inside your HW, buy non-KYC bitcoin and manage them with that new wallet (nothing would happen if you use the same wallet because new addresses are created but just in case).",

You will find this list with many alternatives that you can search and compare among them: https://wallets.thebitcoinhole.com/After choosing the wallet and comparing its features, you can prepare a mini-list of alternatives and ask here.Quote from: BlackBoss_ on June 10, 2023, 01:12:09 AMYou can use non KYC exchanges https://kycnot.me/Be careful, DYOR and do not use exchanges that are unknown or with low trading volumes.",

You require them to trust your fund and privacy. Besides, there is no verifiability of what they actually do.Another solution is to use CoinJoin, you did not have to fully trust the implementor(coordinator) since it works in a non-centralized manner. Though, the coordinator still has the potency to censor or filter coins. For example, Wasabi Wallet which partnered up with a blockchain analysis company.So you should take a look at an alternative CoinJoin coordinator such as Samourai Whirlpool.https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/mixing-whirlpool.htmlhttps://www.samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool",
