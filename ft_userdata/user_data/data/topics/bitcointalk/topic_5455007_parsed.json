A Non-Custodial wallet, Atomic Wallet, being compromisedThanks for letting me know hosseinimr93, I don't usually go into the board he posted (web wallets), so it went unnoticed for me, I am used to frequent this oneIf the moderators want to delete, move or lock my thread, it's fine, we can talk in that thread Â Edit: moderator already moved the thread of Wind_FURY, and since he made the post first than me, I'll lock my thread, it's fair",
