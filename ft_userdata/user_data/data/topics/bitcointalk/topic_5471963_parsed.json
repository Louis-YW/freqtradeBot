You will need to sign a message with the bitcoin address of your alt. I am talking about the bitcoin address that you staked or that you have used in a campaign.Quote from: cafter on October 28, 2023, 03:14:59 AMIs this a altaccount of someone who will get paid for a campaign in two weeks?Probably he is trolling is my guess.",

Good luck on the loan though, hope you will meet an angel forum user that's going to consider you which would be awesome cause it's unlikely to happen .",

My point is, if he/she required a loan urgently, then it would have been more appropriate to ask for a loan from family members or friends which may save interest and consume very less time compared to asking here.",

There are some people that do not have savings and need emergency fund. The last time I borrowed money, not on this forum, I paid back the following day. It was not up to 24 hours. I did not bother a friend about it because I knew I will be able to pay back the loan easily with the profit. There are sometimes that someone will not have an option.Although I am not saying OP that wants to borrow money is not looking for ways to scam.",
