      "body": "If I understand correctly, there is :PolyBitcoin (PBTC), StableCoin (USDB), PolyTdog (PDOG), StableCoin (USDG) coins and they are all free, and you can only trade with them on polydogswap, otherwise, they have no value in other exchanges, they not displayed on coinmarketcap or similar sites, you don't have your own website,and coins don't have a purpose only to be exchanged and nothing more.Very bad and confusing promo website. Good luck with the project",
