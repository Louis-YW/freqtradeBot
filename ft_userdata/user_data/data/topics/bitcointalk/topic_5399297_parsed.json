From their Terms and Conditions, it's weird how someone using a site without check and read the TOS first. Does you withdraw a huge amount money? if it's huge then it's very normal since most casinos will need to manual check the withdraw to confirm it's not cheated from their system. The Trustdice representative isn't active since May 12, you can only hope to their live support.Quote5.1 While Trustdice.win will endeavour to pay out withdrawals immediately, some withdrawals may take longer than others. Trustdice.win shall try to pay out withdrawals within 1 hour, however in some cases, withdrawals may take up to 24 hours.https://trustdice.win/terms",

Either 24 hours or more , there is nothing you can do now but wait , though i am not a user of trustdice yet there are no active case against this site so I guess all you need to do for a while is wait for their confirmation about your withdrawals.How much are we talking here ? though it is not important the amount yet if this involves big amount then some point must be consider .and Also Hoping for the best and fast action from the team .",

Customer service says same thing.  I've never seen anything like this beforeWithdrawal and confirmation time are totally different which is the first thing you need to understand, most casinos uses batch system for withdrawal and also bigger the amount the longer the waiting time can be because of the verification the request undergo by the security team if there is any violation. The longest I waited for withdrawal to proceed in a casino is 20 hours so its okay, if it still in the pending for days then you can start accusing them for their actions.",

The fact is that every casino has a different service. When you decide to play at a certain casino then you agree to all the rules. If you are not comfortable with the long withdrawal process, there are many lists of casinos with a reputation for fast withdrawals on this forum. There are still many casinos that you can choose from. Do not waste time until you complain about this and that.",

I think the Trustdice team is investigating this case because it concerns them the AML policy. It's just my guess for the longer withdrawal process from your account. Good luck!",

Maybe I am wrong but just imagine if you are the owner of the site. If there is anyone who wants to withdraw big money, will you allow that person to get his money without your verification and make sure everything is okay? I bet you would not do that because we need to make sure that we do not make a mistake by sending the money to that person. So I suggest you have more patience and let them work. If they are really legit, they will send your money to you.",

Your withdrawal is considered as a huge amount so it takes longer time to process which is common thing to happen.2. You made a deposit and made 2 bets only (1 lost, 1 won) then request a withdrawalThere are terms related to your cases above:1. Trustdice has a limit or max amount to withdraw per day which is $5,000, is your withdrawal more than $5,000?2. Trustdice has a term that deposit need to be wagered 1x before players request a withdrawal, have you wagered 1x of your deposit amount?",
