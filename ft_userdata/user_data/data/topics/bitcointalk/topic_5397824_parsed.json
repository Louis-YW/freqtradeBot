  "content": "Encryption comparisons that resist quantum computer cracking will become absolutely mainstream from 2022! By around 2030, all of today's trillions of dollars in crypto will be quantum-resistant.Because on May 4, 2022, the White House issued National Security Memorandum No. 10. It requires \"whole-of-government participation\" and \"whole-of-society participation\" across the United States, covering all government departments in the United States, and striving for the greatest possible and maximum amount of work within ten years after the release of the quantum-resistant standard algorithm in 2024, that is, before 2034. Implement quantum-resistant algorithms across the United States.The memorandum sets out requirements for all federal agencies in the United States to upgrade to quantum-resistant algorithms, with a time-limited, yearly update schedule, milestones, schedules, responses, and requirements.In short, the United States has launched everything from May 4, 2022, to at least 2034, to upgrade to quantum-resistant algorithms as much as possible. It's bound to drive all crypto-comparisons to quantum-resistant algorithms soon.In the next 20 years at least, there is only one algorithm that can meet the four conditions of long-term security, long-term stability, long-term efficiency, and the possibility of the world's largest consensus in all the various usage scenarios of encrypted currency comparison: multivariate digital signature.Around 2030, all cryptographic comparisons will be based on multivariate digital signatures. Just as almost all cryptographic comparisons today are based on an algorithm, elliptic curve signatures.Multivariate is gold! go! Let's dig for gold together!",

      "body": "It's extremely difficult to happen in reality! Quantum computer is not anymore a myth that we all know. IBM has already announced their breakthrough in quantum computing and Google is on the same way. However, It is highly unlikely for a quantum computer to be available to a random group of people in the next 100 years. For a company, whatever activities will be done through a quantum computer, will be recorded and I am sure a lot of governments will want to see those records periodically considering the risk it poses for national security. So even if a capable quantum computer is available to a company to ransack bitcoin algorithm, it is highly unlikely that the computer will be used for such task. It's fantastic to see that US government is way ahead of anyone else regarding security. It certainly will force new crypto companies operating from US, to upgrade themselves to become compliant with the norm.",

The second nist will announce the algorithm standard in the near future, among which the rainbow signature will exist as the most suitable algorithm standard for cryptocurrencies. Third Ethereum and Bitcoin are already undergoing upgrades. Sadly they chose hashing, which is going to be a huge problem for the next three years. So it is very necessary to deploy some rainbow-signed cryptocurrencies now.Quote from: ABCchain on May 09, 2022, 01:14:32 AMEncryption comparisons that resist quantum computer cracking will become absolutely mainstream from 2022!

Let's dig for gold together!Starting from the release of the No. 10 National Security Memorandum on May 4, 2022, and 12 to 3 years until 2035, the United States will begin to mobilize \"all-government participation and all-society participation\" to fully and to the greatest extent possible Almost all algorithms in the United States have been upgraded and migrated to algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer cracking.According to this \"National Security Memorandum\", almost all US departments will start from 2024 and update an annual report every year. These reports involve which algorithms should be completely abandoned and continue to be used from which year. . Several reports are published every year, and several times a year, all cryptographic goods must be upgraded and migrated to quantum-resistant computer cracking.In short, by the end of 2024 at the latest, global crypto entrepreneurs will see that the elliptic curve signature adopted by BitBee will be completely abandoned by 2035 at the latest, and there is a high probability that it will be earlier! Because the elliptic curve signature used by Bits is one of the most easily cracked algorithms by quantum computers.This will surely lead to the adoption of quantum computer-resistant algorithms from now on in all cryptocurrencies!",
