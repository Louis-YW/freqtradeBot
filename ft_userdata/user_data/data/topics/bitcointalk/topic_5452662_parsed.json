  "content": "Imgur to TalkImg - automatically fix your broken imagesQuoteImgur images don't work anymore, so you probably have lots of posts with broken images that look like this:For context: Imgur images suddenly became invalid?So I created a script that:1. Goes through all your posts looking for imgur.com direct links (.png|.jpg|.jpeg);2. Reuploads the image to talkimg.com (or imgbb);3. Edits the post with the new link.How to use it:1. Choose the image provider you want to use (change provider to imgbb or talkimg - IMPORTANT: all lower case).2. If you choose imgbb, you need an account and your own API key. Generate your API key here and put it on providers -> imgbb -> apiKey (example).3. Go to bitcointalk.org (any page).4. Open the browser developer tools on the Console tab (Ctrl+Shift+I or F12).5. Paste the script and press Enter.6. Leave the page open while the script runs and, if you can, do not use the forum (not even in other tabs) to avoid rate limiting errors.If a error shows up, please report it here and/or run the script again (the process will start over, but already updated posts will be ignored since they won't have any more imgur.com links).Script:- If you're using TalkImg, you are free to swap the API key to your own if you have an account there. Otherwise, there is already one provided by @joker_josue for this script.- You can change the startPage variable if you want to start the script from a specific page (i.e the script errors at page 300 and you want to restart back from there).GET THE SCRIPT CODE HERE: https://gist.github.com/ninjastic/36c14fb2eb1c4b750f40f332d408688fQuote from: TryNinja on May 17, 2023, 10:36:34 PM\"Single Topic\" versionGet the code here: https://gist.github.com/ninjastic/59bde80306c32153a5775b9a570b16b7Run it on any topic and all images posted by you will be updated.IMPORTANT: only images that are shown on the screen! This means that if you are on page 1, the script won't update the images on page 2. You can use the ;all page on the forum to make all posts show up all at once (probably won't work properly if the topic is huge?).Other notes:- This will upload and edit all imgur.com links found on your post history (even those inside quotes you made of other people).- Posts on locked topics can't be edited, so the recently uploaded images for them will be deleted (to save space on the talkimg server).- TalkImg max size limit is 2 MB, so some images may fail.If you have broken bbcode resulted from an old version of the script, run this fix: https://gist.github.com/ninjastic/d560848568339e5a2d7a25ddffb578d5",

      "body": "Hey TryNinja, first of all, thanks for putting in the effort to create this script. However, I don't think I'll be using it. No offense, but I'm not very experienced with coding or using developer tools in the browser, and I'm not comfortable with the idea of a script altering my posts. It's not that I don't trust you, but I don't trust myself to not mess up something.  Can we make the process less automatic for members who prefer to manually edit their old posts? I had an idea that you or LoyceV might be able to assist with. For instance, adding a search function for posts with images or Imgur links to ninjastic.space would make it easier for members to manually locate and edit their old posts without relying on an automated script. This could be an additional parameter in the search settings that only displays posts with images. Do you think this would be possible?",

I could create one zip-file per userID with all their images. All you'd have to do is find the name given by imgur. I can probably make a list of posts too, but I think TryNinja can do that much faster (and on demand).",

But for now it continues to work normally.Thanks again to TryNinja for this script, which will certainly be of help. But, I also ask for understanding for the fact that I had planned a gradual growth, and not a sudden growth due to a similar service going out of business.  Believe me, I've been making every effort to keep things running, and I'm already planning to reorganize the server.So far I've managed to keep everything working. Therefore, I appreciate your understanding if there are moments of instability (which I believe were very rare).",
