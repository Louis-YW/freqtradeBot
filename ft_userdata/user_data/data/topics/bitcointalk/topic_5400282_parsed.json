  "content": "[topic in progress]WOWswap is a fully decentralized, community-owned trading and lending protocol. It is based on a simple idea: liquidity providers can create pools, and traders can borrow from the pool to make leveraged trades. All critical protocol parameters are set by WOW token holders (DAO). DAO participants also receive additional rewards for their votes on protocol changes, in addition to staking. The guys created a protocol that uses all the strengths of decentralized exchanges. Its essence is that traders open leveraged positions on WOWswap, borrowing additional capital from community liquidity pools and directing trades through the most liquid exchanges such as Pancakeswap, Uniswap, SushiSwap, etc. Speaking of which, you can be sure that if you want to open a leveraged trade with a large capital, no spreads are a problem. This technology benefits all existing decentralized exchanges by increasing trading volume. WOWswap gets access to more liquidity, and traders get the opportunity to trade coins with leverage not available on any other exchange. WOWswap runs on 8 blockchains Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, IoTeX, Solana, Polygon, Avalanche, HECO and Kava. The number of coins available for leveraged trading is over two hundred, which is the highest among all decentralized exchanges.WOWswap has a strong background of investors and partners like Mechanism Capital, MetisDAO, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Zee Prime Capital and others. WOWswap is a secure decentralized exchange. It has been successfully audited by the independent company Hacken for smart contracts and also has integration with Chainlink Oracle for pricing channels.",
