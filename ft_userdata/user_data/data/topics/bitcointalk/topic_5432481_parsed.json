  "content": "I remember back in the day when Andreas Antonopoulos explained the \"killer app\" for the crypto industry as the DAO, and basically coined the term. This was I suppose in 2013 or 2014.It was right before the \"DAO debacle\" on Ethereum, around the time when the EVM was being discussed theoretically.The concept is making a comeback this year with a growing set of building platforms becoming available.So, a few questions for the public:-Do you think that a DAO will have a real world use case soon? if so, which one(s)?-Is DAO the new ICO?-Is DeFi always a DAO?-Threat of a centralized DAO?-Can a commit or code execution be forced through a DAO?",
