The mistake that OP is mentioning is he didn't checked that the token OP is depositing is currently suspended on Houbi. Its unfortunate to make this kind of mistake, The only hope for OP is to contact Houbi about his situation if the token he deposited is still recoverable since I believe it is deposited in their hotwallet. Houbi is probably doing maintenance with their hot wallet that's why it's being move but yeah I'm not a 100% sure about it. The best thing you can do is to ask them and wait for their response.",

I thought that huobi has access to your funds but since huobi BUSD deposit was getting maintenance and then you need to confirm whether your funds will be credited in your wallet after the deposit will be resumed or not. Some things that you can do that to make your problem even more easier to be solved are 1. Try to join huobi global telegram group and then you can start a conversation regarding your problem with admin (be careful with scammer)2. Send a ticket about your problem. I hope that your problems will be solved as soon as possible. $200 might be a lot for you.",

This can be a very worthy lesson that doesn't panic too much when facing any FUD and negative news. So that it will actually make us not focus on doing something, in making decisions. Panic will also make us lose money (more), indeed it is necessary to be vigilant, but not panic. Always be careful about it.

Maybe this is a bit difficult, but there's nothing wrong with trying to contact their CS. Who knows if there is a way out? And even if there isn't, then you can get certainty whether you can get it back or not, instead of continuing to wonder. Check it here to contact Huobi CS:https://www.huobi.com/learn/en-us/operation-guide-how-to-contact-customer-service/Wait, I read about this, does this has a relation?
