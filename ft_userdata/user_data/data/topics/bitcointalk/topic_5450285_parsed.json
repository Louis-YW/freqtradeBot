  "content": "Solalgo is revolutionising the De-Fi space with its ground-breaking, deflationary project that uses its proprietary A.I. algorithmic business mining tool to search and 100% acquire companies to develop and add into its conglomerate which has already attained 6 businesses. From the outset, Solalgo’s mission is to keep driving up the price of its token ($SLGO) buy using the profits & dividends from these acquisitions. Solalgo will go into the market with FIAT from profits, buy tokens at the market rate and then burn them. Over the projected 3.5 years, the maximum burn of 70% will be achieved.  At this point the conglomerate of businesses (projected to number 30+) will be listed onto a major stock exchange (London/NY) and all $SLGO token holders will be offered shares in the public listing at par, or stable coins at the market rate.
