So therefore they should be gone, maybe then the distrust is also gone, I don't know. The trust is just a part.Its not because someone is a senior member they know it all, in this case they clearly don't. So please investigate my comments and their comments and look at what proof people provided.Quote from: ScamViruS on January 25, 2023, 09:20:15 AMQuote from: _act_ on January 25, 2023, 09:07:29 AMJollyGood and ScamVirus can not be banned because they tag you, not part of the rules.I didn't tag the OP.

What I am looking right now is you digging a deeper hole instead by sending stupid retaliatory feedback. Who in their normal senses is really going to support you with such feedback?Can those people prove me that what I said ain't real? (and yes the first feedback, there is proof, this whole conversation)Regarding the second example: Please provide a 24/24 lifetime footage of you and I will remove the negative feedback?Do you guys now actually see how ridiculous this is that you ask me to proof things? I DONT need to prove anything. (for the record I actually did an hour ago in the other tthread that it is my address, but I will never use any 3rd party or other thing, I send a specific amount to a specific address before the transactionw as confirmed on the chain).So again, can you act like normal beings and discuss in a normal way.FACT: I get false accusations, they provide no proof and should be reprimanded for it.

But from my pov, if a site makes something that mentions me and then there is the negative trust, then users won't like it. So I did it for their good. Disclaimer; I have no benefits from that site, there is no affiliation of any kind, I dont even know if they care that much that I hate this platform.Nonetheless: the reason that trusted members are on vendetta's and suffering from confirmation bias, maybe means your whole trust system is garbage as is this platform if even after clear examples people don't understand the skill of arguing and providing evidence. Because acting childish? Are the people who not understand that I don't need to provide any evidence not the children? I only use it as a way to try to let you guys understand how wrong it is, but of course if the average guy here is incapable of understanding, says a lot of those guys (and the platform).So maybe it is time for those initial whiners, who make the false claims to look into their own.And I still await those users their coming to the light and I will remove my feedback, in the hope that they finally understand the point I make.",
