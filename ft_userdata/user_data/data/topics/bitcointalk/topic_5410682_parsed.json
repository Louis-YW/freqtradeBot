I haven’t seen any such issue here to be honest though I'm not active in Politics and Society where I think it's easy to have someone with different thoughts/believes.",

That is why I am a big fan of the forum discussions. They are a great way to hear from other people who have different opinions than you, but they also give you a chance to learn from them and grow your understanding of the topic. You can learn more about why people disagree, and that gives you a better sense of where your own opinions lie. I have been reading a lot lately about how different people have different opinions on various topics, and that is just fine! Think about it: if we all agreed with each other 100% of the time, there would be no point in having any kind of discussion.It is great practice in learning how to think critically, because it forces you to consider new perspectives and make sure that your own opinion is well-grounded. It also helps make sure that your arguments are well-founded as well, and in this day and age where people are quick to jump on social media to share their opinions on anything, it is important not only for yourself but for everyone else involved that your arguments are well thought out. And the best part? You get to learn from new perspectives and grow as a person in the process!",

There will always be people who agree and disagree with what has been said. This is normal and you need to take it easy. I would like 325btc to treat this with understanding and accept it as a given, and then it will be easier for him. Quote from: hosseinimr93 on August 21, 2022, 01:54:20 PMHere is a forum where people can post their ideas about different things freely and without any censorship. It's completely normal that people have different ideas about different topics. Personally, this is exactly what I like on bitcointalk, that you can find out different opinions about any event. This allows you to get additional information and expand the view, whereas, usually, we take into account only one opinion - our own. Which, in my opinion, is very limiting and more efficient to have several different points of view.",

I would set my sights lower, you should consider yourself lucky if you manage to find people that (kind of) read what's been written and (kind of) make sense. Expecting more than that from random people will routinely lead to disappointment.",
