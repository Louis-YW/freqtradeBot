Just as Binance does to their users although I don't know if is applicable to all their users but then when passing kyc to trade p2p it was said of using email that bears the same with your documents and also with same name that is on the local bank account, otherwise their identity may not be verified.Now what makes me brought this issues is about the children using their parents identity to verify them selves to have access to the gambling sites, if those gambling site are this mean to restrict under age gambler they are meant to go into detail of looking towards requirements in other to still limit under age gamblers. Then facials verification is also something very important to track down those that are secretly stealing their parents id, if this is required I don't think any under age child could have the courage to meet their parents to help them pass kyc while the parents knows the implications involved.",

It would be an awesome evolution for online gambling in my opinion  I bet it would attract new people towards that specific webpage, I think Stake could pull it off.",

They won't put gamble responsibly after their advertisements if the gambling sites themselves will be the ones controlling your playing time. It's on you. Be responsible. I'd suggest applying for the \"Responsible Gambling\" feature of one gambling site. Stake.com has that kind of option if you want to take a break. https://stake.com/settings/responsible-gambling",

While these features may be helpful, it's important to note that preventing addiction is a complex issue and may require a multi-faceted approach.Allow users to set financial limits on their gambling activities, such as deposit limits or maximum losses. These limits can help individuals stay within their budget and avoid excessive financial losses.Providing players with notifications about how long they have been playing can serve as a helpful reminder of the time spent gambling. It can promote self-awareness and encourage players to reflect on their gambling habits, potentially preventing them from losing track of time and engaging in prolonged sessions!!Develop educational materials and interactive tools that inform users about the risks associated with gambling, signs of addiction, and responsible gambling strategies. This can help increase awareness and promote informed decision-making!",

It's not even for preventing addiction or anything (nor it can really), it's just the way the laws that they follow work. And honestly speaking, probably ANY type of rule or ToS in casinos that directly involve in stopping players would inevitably cause them a loss, and at the end of the day they're a business, so I highly doubt they'd do that. That's why self-exclusion exists, it's a great way to let users know that they \"seem\" to care, but they won't really force it onto them no, cause it's a direct loss on their part.Maybe the time can be a useful one though.

That's a good thing in my opinion because time can fly fast during a gambling session and we don't want to feel bad if the whole evening is gone. Would be nice if all casinos would adopt such a statem. As for setting a fixed time limit on our ourselves on how long we want to gamble, it's a bit difficult because we would be logged out in the middle of a session if our time is up. Let's say you are running a martingale strategy and have quite a few losses in a row, you need only one win to recover everything. But if you get forced to log out by the system you would be stuck with a big loss. Having a panic button is a good compromise, with it we can log ourselves out for 24 hours up to 1 month whenever we need. Also I would prefer to not send selfies to a casino, is it really needed?",
