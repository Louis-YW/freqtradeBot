  "content": "I recently visited a land-based casino after a long time to gamble, have some drinks and enjoy live music with a couple of my good buddies. Not long after we settled in, we heard one of the casino workers yelling at one of the gamblers. He said, \"Sir please you have to leave now. You come here every day and you keep losing. Please be considerate of your wife and your newborn babies.\" The backstory is that this particular man is a very popular gambler at the casino not because of his winnings but because he keeps losing. Despite his losses, he would return to the casino the next day to gamble. From the story, his wife had just been delivered with twins. I would later find out that the casino worker is his nephew. If you were the casino manager would you fire the casino worker for interfering with your business or would you ban the gambler from visiting the casino?",

I do think that, the staff is amazing but they do need additional information regarding how to handle such situations, they can also work with the government in providing safer gambling site and tackle the addiction.",

      "body": "You may be lucky to have this experience while visiting a land-based casino instead of telling us about how your gambling experience was there. But that's not the case because actually in terms of business, the employee has violated the rules. You should never tell people to quit just because they have lost many times because you know that the more gamblers lose, the more profits the casino will make.But in the case you describe, I just think that the family relationship between uncle and nephew plays a more important role than upholding the professionalism of the employees. I don't know what to do with this case but if it wasn't a family relation then I think the casino owners would be very angry about it. It was one of the mistakes that reduced the professionalism of the employee employed by his boss.",

Imagine how difficult it is for this wife to have a husband in such conditions and imagine how difficult it's going to be for these twins to have an addicted father wasting all the family's funds wagering, what will inevitably prejudice their development as kids, unless the man takes conscience of his acts and change his lifestyle for the better. In fact, that is responsible gambling policy adopted by the casino on practice.",

If you were the casino manager would you fire the casino worker for interfering with your business or would you ban the gambler from visiting the casino?This is like a double edged sword.I would fire that employee if the client/gambler was a whale,that would be the only thing that would made me fire the worker for interfering with a big part of the business (I consider whales big part of the gambling industry which contribute to fattening of casino wallets).In every other circumstances meaning that if the gambler is a normal one which is irrelevant to my business if I were the casino owner I would not care if he yelled or not to clients/gamblers,that would be not a problem for my business as my business keeps growing from whales.If this gambler was a poor guy that kept losing his money day after day in my casino and if this client was not a big one,it was only damaging himself and not contributing to my business I would ban him from entering the casino,at least I would save a poor man.For business,we have to be 100% ready to do what it takes to see it grow,that is the mentality that is instilled in me from the place where I work from many years.",

We might not know what that customer's family is going through because of his gambling addiction. Maybe the wife and family might be suffering from lack and want because of his addiction. And the worker felt he has a responsibility of discouraging his uncle from his uncontrollable gambling habits. But the worker would have be retrained on the ethic of casino workers. He must know that privacy is paramount and every customer must be treated equally regardless of the informal closeness or family ties. Would he have done the same thing in the same circumstances to another customer that was not his relative?",

There is no need to yell in the casino and make everyone attentive.If I was a casino owner, I would have fired the casino worker for making me lose my regular client. This is a natural instinct and everyone wants to get money, no matter from where it comes. Also, that addicted gambler is playing at his own will, no one is forcing him to play when he is losing more.",

Though a dealer should not be the one to stop the gambler, i guess this is the job of the manager and yelling to gambler might not be the right way. You can talk to the gambler on a more professional way, there’s a lot of ways to prevent that guy from playing and I think that’s the best thing to do.",

Casino doesnt have the fault or wrong in here but rather on the gambler itself.You should always be having the good control of your finances and be thankfulthat there are people who are in just concern despite of the condition.",

If that yelling happened between a client and a worker, whether they are relatives or not, that's not a good impression for all people there watching the scene. The worker instead can just easily grab that client/relative silently in a different place and talk about the concern away from many people.Firing is too much but the manager can possibly consider doing it since it was unprofessional behavior and to give lessons to other employees that might do the same. In that way, the casino is showing that they are not tolerating the behavior. Much better if the sanctions are not that heavy but next time, I doubt the nephew still will be given one more chance if the same situation happened again.",
