There are probably not many, or any (not including Salvador as it's a completly economicaly torne country). So everyday usage is the most important criteria.",

The countries I have heard that taken bitcoin as their legal tender is only two. El Salvador and Central African Republic and they are tax free Countries on bitcoin. But the ones that are trying to adopt bitcoin as their alternative currency on the digital space for exchange are contemplating on the adoption of the coin. They are still thinking of a possible way to collect tax from users of bitcoin in their Countries. I do not think they can collect tax from the users of bitcoin because when goods and services are exchanged between two or more persons, they users use direct payment method which is called p2p. And with that, government tax has been bypass. Most countries hate cryptocurrencies (bitcoin) because they will not benefit to the maximum they want.",

Therefore, countries with low income and relative stability will be ideal because you do not need to spend a lot of money with zero taxes.There are also variables such as the ease of buying and selling Bitcoin, restrictions on foreign currencies and other things that need to be taken into account.In general, why did no one mention El Salvador?",

But Nigeria on the other hand is far from being call a crypto friendly Nations.El Salvador having made bitcoin it's legal tender should have fit very well on what Op wants. But I am not sure that El Salvador is tax free on cryptocurrency. Since bitcoin is a legal tender in El Salvador, it is therefore lawful to tax people on bit.I do not understand why Op doesn't want to be taxed. If you work and being paid in bitcoin and you are required to pay tax according to your income, it should not be a problem to you then. You should be able to pay your taxes, unless you are over taxed.",

Asia is where you wanna go with very affordable cost of living like Thailand, Cambodia or The Philippines. The good thing about crypto is that even if only few countries are crypto friendly these days, but you’ll know the adoption will grow eventually in the years to come. So that means, more adoption, higher price for bitcoin. And it will be more valuable too if you buy it at certainly low price and then hold, and you’ll only use them in the future for huge future profits, and of course spend them in countries where the cost of living is very affordable.",

As of now it have made several plans and the progress isn't big. However a decision to make a nation with bitcoin is a challenge and president have taken the challenge against many criticism.Another country I find it to be crypto friendly is Estonia. It is one of the early adopter of blockchain technology and the same have given it a path to be crypto friendly.",

Some examples.. “ Malta’s strategy to become a global enclave for digital assets appears to be working, though lax regulatory oversight has raised concerns over money laundering and other financial crime. Roughly $71 billion, or 60 billion euros, worth of cryptocurrencies has passed through Malta since the tiny Mediterranean state first adopted its “blockchain island” strategy in 2017, the Times of Malta reported Sunday. Although Malta has upgraded its crypto-focused regulations in recent years, financial watchdogs say the nation's anti-money laundering regime may have lacked proper protocols”. - https://cointelegraph.com/news/71b-in-crypto-has-reportedly-passed-through-blockchain-island-malta-since-2017",
