For instance, many people have complained about their life struggles here and have received advices that changed their life on this forum. So, why would you want them to bottle up all of their hardships? I can tell you this is one of the reasons people have mental problems, get frustrated, or commit suicide.",

It is not easy to be successful in whatever you journey you embark on,even at youthful age or advanced age. I have seen so many youths in their 20s that made money and are living a good life presently. To be successful one needs to stay focus and sacrifice a lot in order to be successful. You are right,down here in my country the youths at their 20s think that they have just started life and they will be busy living a flamboyant lifestyle and believes that they don't have any reason to invest or build for their future because of their shallow thinking and maybe they still believe that they have someone they can run to when they are in need.",

      "body": "I commend your efforts, You have come up with good points and advise that can be of help to some people. Generally that’s what interests men. Women and clubbing is what they do for fun. This can’t be taken away from them especially for young men that has no family of their own yet. Its good to have fun once in a while but when you make it an habit you will hardly be able to achieve anything. Though it depends on our personal differences and how we plan ourselves, some people might spend a lot on women and clubbing but still plan for other things as well. We just have to apply wisdom in all we are doing. Success will come when God wants regardless of one’s age. Quote from: Youngkhngdiddy on June 08, 2023, 06:30:04 AM2. Avoid unnecessary spending and Know when to stay quiet, it would save you a lot of trouble, money and mental problems.We earn money so that we can spend it and meet our wants, and no matter how hard you try to avoid unplanned spendings, they will always find a way to locate you. Sometimes we spend money on things we didn't intend on, only to discover that they are problems we must fix. As long as we earn money, there will always be new problems, and the more you earn, the more your wants and requirements. With a well-designed plan, you may accomplish a lot and minimize the rate of unnecessary spending. Quote from: Youngkhngdiddy on June 08, 2023, 06:30:04 AM4. Learn skills like sales, copywriting and marketing,these will take you further than most college degrees.Learning a trade and working a side hustle can be quite beneficial. Most college grads in my region have accomplished a lot with the skills they learned outside of school. Most people graduate from high school and then give up their degrees because they are no longer useful to them. Getting a job is difficult here, and without any talent it is difficult to to survive.",
