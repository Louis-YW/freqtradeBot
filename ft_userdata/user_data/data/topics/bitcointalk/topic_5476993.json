Not saying that Riot is 100% guilty of all the thing that people say they do but when there are places that why would you take that chance?-Dave",

As the saying goes where there is smoke there is fire. When you have places like bitdeer and foundry that don't have this kind of bad press we know it's not mining in general, it's just that miner.....-Dave",

      "body": "It's a legal battle that one side eventually lost, and since courts are relatively reasonable in the US, the decision was probably the right one (considering that multiple levels of courts decided that Riot was wrong). But then the side that lost (right?) involved private security to kick out employees of those who actually won, if I got it right. I think private security should not be used in cases like that, and as a civilian matter resolved in court, it doesn't need anything apart from the court's decision.But the case is confusing to me and seems more like a quarrel of specific companies than any position regarding Bitcoin mining specifically. So I don't think it'll have wider impact.",
