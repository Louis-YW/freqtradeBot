  "content": "Hi,My Antminer S19XP stopped working and was still under Bitmain's warranty. I sent it for repairs and they told me that the miner is scrapped so no warranty applies to it. They said: \"If you would like us to return all the scrapped products to you, please CONTACT US within 5 days otherwise they will be discarded. You need to pay for the additional cost incurred including the return shipping cost, local customs duties and taxes\".I am just appalled that such a big company has such a poor customer service and warranty. Just because a hashboard is not repairable they want to scrap the whole miner?! They could easily replace the faulty hashboard. Why such a frail warranty? I even offered to pay for a replacement hashboard.They did not give me any feedback on why it was scrapped. After emailing them several times, they sent me this low resolution blurry picture. And again after more emails they told me that the hashboard no 2 is scrapped. Can someone please make out what is wrong with the hashboard in the picture?",

They only care about the big fish. Of course they don't want to spend money with your single miner... That's how big companies will always work. No surprise here!This way of dealing with costumers is kind of a way for them to sell more miners and to get more money out of small costumers, in my view!Why don't they have repairing centres all over the world? Why don't they have resellers? This is just to benefit big players imo...",

Like many other manufacturers they're trying to earn and save as much as they possibly can. You could also try to find a used hashboard on our local classifieds website or on ebay.

Bitmain's warranty (a read the fine prints some time ago) works this way:You send it in and they try to repair it. BUT: if can't be repaired by their methods/policy then they WON'T replace the board or anything. They will \"scrap it\" as not repairable. Meaning no warranty for you and you are screwed (out of your money).You can get it back (for a price) and hope a 3rd party shop can fix it (which they can if they are good).",

      "body": "There is one thing many mining beginners don't understand, when it comes to warranty, you can't escaped a tampered hardware that's under warranty, if something bad happens to the hardware you are to return and believe me, they are the engineers, they coupled that thing up themselves, you use screwdriver, they will know, you do anything on the board? They will know it, so do not think you are smart, next time return it immediately. When you hear no warranty applied, it's either the warranty expired or you have become the upper smart engineer yourself. As for the picture, was this before or after you sent it back for checkup? Anyway, if you want to fix this I don't know the level of your skills with such hardware and if you don't have any please don't add more problems, send it to a qualified repairer that's not too far from your country.Â  There are valid repairers in China that I used to send dead GPUs and miners back to, I think you should just ask around, if you are qualified you will still need extra parts and that's going to cost you some money, whatever you might be looking for is available in China.
