In future time to come there may be another or not, the blockchain technology which is the sole basic network bitcoin is built upon, immutability and decentralization is what blockchain offers with bitcoin and we cannot conclude weather there's a likely possibility for another invention soon aside bitcoin.Quote from: BTCapsule on November 22, 2022, 11:44:31 AMMaybe Bitcoin is all we really need. \"Fix the money, fix the world\".There's no uncertainties here, bitcoin is just the perfect economical solution the world has always waited for and that's why it could achieve this big within it's first thirteen years.",

That's hilarious to be honest! An app can't challenge the world order which is controlled by politicians. Neither bitcoin nor any other cryptocurrency hold such enormous power to overthrow the existing system. These cryptos can act as a parallel currency system and that's it! It will reduce a bit of dependency we have with the fiat but it can't negate the need of fiat. Bitcoin is just too small to fix the monetary system that exists today and it will remain as it is unless a real nukes war starts.",

If the political system is corrupted, the corruption has to be removed even if it is too deeply rooted that the whole system has to be overthrown and replaced with a new one (aka through a revolution).If you add bitcoin on top of that corrupt system, it won't do anything and in fact it may lead to more corruption.

Because, the police will be under the people's control. Back to the internet, Bitcoin is being used for illicit activities because they're no external rules attached to it except the cryptographic rules that govern the block chain which nobody can meddle with, yet the master cards by the banks with multiple rules on it are used for illicit carding activities too.
