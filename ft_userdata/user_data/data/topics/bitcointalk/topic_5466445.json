  "content": "This looks like a Dusting Attack[1] but in a slightly different and extremely weird way!The attacker seems to be searching the chain for funded addresses like [2] then uses a \"brute force tool\" similar to vanity address generators to find an address that looks similar to your address like [3] but they try to be sneaky and search for an address with matching beginning and end. Examples:1LTaZWnFTAsTqBfkSEShSXEh5VTiWUKQh8 Someone's address holding 2.56BTC1LTKTBLDQxxf5QvgRFMzuyPMnRUULCKQh8 Attacker's address1GZ3EfTjHVxLqnKi7yhEGCoffdATJEKeR7 2.49BTC1GZKQVjY21SAas1tjnibAHHHNF9B8nKeR7 dust12XqeqZRVkBDgmPLVY4ZC6Y4ruUUEug8Fx 32,321BTC12XgkRFEdE3oSvy4tzzp8jVtsdMATwg8Fx dust1FZy7CPFA2UqqQJYUA1cG9KvdDFbSMBJYG 15,739BTC1FZBQjXH1RhbfpYtA3LoVrzJKqiAWSBJYG dustThen the attacker sends two dust amounts to these similar looking addresses in the same transaction (eg. 600 sat to you, 600 sat to their own address). Feel free to share your thoughts on why would someone do something weird like this but my guess is that they hope someone would see the incoming transaction, then try to spend that output and their own coins but copy the attacker's address that looks similar instead of their own and send all their coins there so that the attacker can steal it!But there are two weird parts involved in this \"operation\":1. Usually in this type of attack they rely on the user's greed to rush them into making the mistake and send their coins to the attacker. For example one somewhat similar attack I've seen was to use some shittokens on Omni layer in an address empty of bitcoin and send the key to the user who would then get greedy and funds the key with bitcoin so they can spend the token but before they can do anything the attacker steals their bitcoins.But there are no tokens involved here as far as I can tell (not even the scamjunk called Ordinals) and the amount they send the user is dust!2. They didn't even let the dust amount remain in user's wallet. As you can see now, the transaction is already double spent and none of the addresses I shared above (the ones with high balances like 2.56) have the dust any more while the scammer's address holds slightly higher than 2x the dust limit possibly wanting to repeat the attack once again but this time the sender address and the change address and your address all 3 would look similar.The only reason why I found this is because I received one of these transactions recently and was surprised when I saw the similar addresses in the output. The attacker seems to have given up on trying to scam the big whales though as the first couple of txs in the address are sent to those.[1] https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/81508/deanonymizing-dust-attack[2] https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1LTaZWnFTAsTqBfkSEShSXEh5VTiWUKQh8[3] https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1LTKTBLDQxxf5QvgRFMzuyPMnRUULCKQh8[4] bc1qfyftjfs2aufq566mlwldkzgl9v6rxqqg7ta75p",

Not something new. I get to know about this cam few months back and according to many studies these types of attacks has been useful for hackers/scammers because it helped them to scam hell lot of money and AFAIK, I started to see topic related to this issue back in few months but the hype of this issue started from December 2022. Scam with USDT TRC20 tokenWhat are Address Poisoning Scams?And you are 100% right about it, in such scams, victim only fall prey to these attacks once he used to copy address from the last transaction made to his/her account. The best practice is to compare the full address rather then just checking the initials and final words of your address. When I get to know about this address, I always compare the whole address even if I have to make a smaller transaction too.",

Nowadays all the modern wallets are HD. It's safer to pick a completely different address from the wallet. This way the new address will probably not be similar with the attacker address and avoiding reuse is a good practice anyway.",

For example I wouldn't have seen this transaction if I had checked my wallet a couple of hours later.By design double-spend attacks have a low success rate due to their complexity to execute. As you have mentioned you might have missed that transaction completely if you haven't checked your wallet within that specific timeframe. So the attacker needs to rely on their luck as well and a dust attack can put a red flag into the owner's mind that their wallet is targeted by a scammer. So they will be more cautious every time they do something with their wallet.",

This kind of service is even more dangerous or easy to attack than randomly copying the address. Just like the copy and paste address is prone to keyboard malware’s this also is too. It is more dangerous again because you definitely need to expose your address to the internet, an attacker can also temper with such sites and change the address without you knowing through malware.",

The attacker will succeed if the user accidentally copies the attacker's address instead of their own during a transaction.This is new information to me, and I'm thankful I came across this thread to learn about it. Now that I'm aware of this type of trick, I'll be more cautious and double-check addresses to ensure they are identical when conducting Bitcoin transactions.",

Copy your wallet address only from your wallets addresses tab, or you select or generate new addresses from your wallets receive tab so you wouldn't reuse addresses, which is both bad for privacy and vulnerable to this attack.Quote from: albert0bsd on September 11, 2023, 10:12:15 PM-Never be too quick to spend funds you've received, especially if it's a small and strange transaction.You can spend dust tx's and it is not risky to do so if you know what you are doing, sometimes dust attack is an attack on your privacy and a way an attacker can link your utxo's if you spend the dust utxo with the others in your wallet, using coin control is one way of spending dust tx's without losing your privacy.Quote from: albert0bsd on September 11, 2023, 10:12:15 PM-Using a good wallet that lets you block incoming dust transactions is a smart move.You cannot block incoming tx's into your wallet, in other words you can't stop someone from sending you BTC's.",
