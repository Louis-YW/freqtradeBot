Maybe the gambling platform can give a notification on how much they had wagered and what is their stats in terms of profit and loss. Maybe this can help them understand and limit their spending or go further.If there is some limit set and requested to stop at that point, surely some will stick to it. Same time there are chances people looking for an alternate gambling platform.",

For example, if the terms stipulate that they exclusively prohibit the usage of VPNs, then this should be constructive notice to all players in creating their accounts.With regard to the survey if they are comfortably spending more time, I do think that it may help but gambling is a discretionary act. It is very easy to circumvent this and as a player I would get annoyed if surveys would be asked in a consistent basis.QuoteThis is for the casinos to avoid issues in the future when players look for loopholes to regain their losses by charging them in court.I read this in a separate thread- did these person win the case? As far as I know, they have a lack of cause of action against these gambling establishments as their case should fail from the very start.",

But are casinos ready to do that? If you want to deposit, no KYC. But if you want to withdraw, there is KYC. That is how casinos and most gambling sites are. But on some gambling sites, there are some articles for addicts, which they can read to help them. But help starts from discipline and if not greedy. About the use of VPN, punters should ready TOS. But if there are pop-ups or something to fill sometimes for the safety of gamblers and for them not to take the wrong steps, it is a good thing.I choose 'yes' which I think it is the right one to choose.",

Nowadays there are many, but not all, casinos that provide gamblers with responsible gambling measures, but even so, there are always those who get out of control and end up losing a fortune.",

Well it is a bit hard to say. On one side there can be many advantages of survey assessments from time to time in order to protect themselves from bad actors and also protect the players from themselves. On the other hand however, such surveys could become more and more intrusive over time and at some point, before we even know what has happened, the surveys become privacy issues. Although perhaps I am being a bit paranoid about such things... But players will also find loopholes to charge casinos in court with nonsense or try to cheat them out of money in other ways. That might not be a good argument. I doubt such surveys will have much weight in court.",

Something sorta similar to drug dealers who pretty much make a living destroying other people’s lives.For this reason.. I don’t think this kind of survei is necessary. It’d show some false care for the gamblers (presuming casinos don’t care about them for real) but nothing else. If a gambler wants to spend past their previous threshold, they’ll just find a different route.",

But if the casino finds the main user who always plays with big amount and they suddenly break the rules, is the casino banned him? In this case, maybe he has forgotten to turn off the VPN to access the casino, or in any case, he play the casino on an office pc and won't people know what is he was doing. Maybe this is for attention (if the casino survey it regularly), or maybe there are exceptions for the special user if find him uses VPN.",

In the case of thresholds, instead of a survey casinos might as well implement a system where they can only spend x amount per month, and we all know that's not gonna happen. And if users were to only answer what they can spend in a survey but not follow it, might as well not do it in the first place imo.As for the VPN thing, well, a warning at the start may be better instead? And then a 3 coin (life) warning system, if it goes past that then it can be considered intentional (or if they keep vpn open for their entire session)",

A casino is not different from any other company and should try to get a feeling what most gamblers are looking for. So far I haven't come across many websites asking me to fill out a survey. There are multiple benefits from a survey, the casino can categorise it's gamblers according to their preferences and if gamblers change their behaviour completely to their initial intentions the casinos could contact them and maybe prevent gambling addictions in the future. It also helps the casino to identify what current issues the gamblers might have and if they can be resolved quickly. But maybe here on the forum it might be a better place for casinos to interact with their customers instead of a survey, because a survey is usually a one way for the customer to give information and it's not a dialog.",

This should be our responsibility and not putting a business operating for it's profits to tell you how to handle your money.It won't be a bad idea if the casino decides to implement a survey assessment but we shouldn't be depending on that. Before using any casino or gambling sites, always read their terms and conditions and you won't become a victim for defaulting.Gamblers usually don't read anything about a casino before they use it, and some only depends on online review which isn't safe since casino can pay for positives reviews and at the end of the day defraud their customers.",

These policies should cover responsible gambling practices, ensuring fair play, and specifying the consequences for any attempts to exploit the system.
