  "content": "Hi  I would like to ask some specific questions regarding a possible exit strategy from cryptocurrencies (cash out, perhaps not immediately considering the current early bull run) without having to pay the exorbitant taxes that some country asks, namely:How is it possible to sell, for example, BTC legally without having to declare and/or pay capital gains taxes?The various ideas that I have had for this problem, also considering the latest news/laws, and the various questions that arise are:IDEA #1 | Exchange BTC for DAI or PAXGIn this case there should not be any event considered taxable because DAI and PAXG (pax gold) are not strictly related to a fiat currency and therefore it would be like exchanging crypto for crypto which is not taxable (I guess in some country that is the case).DOUBTS:- Is DAI reliable as a stable coin? (being algorithmic and the bad experience of UST...)- Could PAXG be a reason for future discussion for possible taxation? (it is not linked to fiat currency but is still linked to an asset = gold)- Where to exchange BTC->DAI?- Can we trade on Binance or another CEX? (the event is not taxable but if the sum of countervalue in BTC is important, with the KYC done, it leaves a good trace...)- Any safe, reliable and cheap no-KYC exchanges? (however you can't make transfers to your personal bank account so does it make sense?)- If we do the BTC->DAI exchange in DeFi, which is the best or recommended DEX?- How to bring BTC safely to the DEX? on which chain?  (given the continuous bad news on the various bridges exploited)- Once we have the DAI, how can we, trivially, spend it? (I suppose that by spending it there is a taxable event given the intrinsic conversion into fiat, right? but in theory they should consider taxation on the last DAI/PAXG->EUR trade or not?)- Which crypto card do you recommend that can use DAI or PAXG as a payment source? with KYC or even without? (maybe I'm asking too much here but something we can use in Europe with EUR)IDEA #2 | Exchange BTC for USDT/USDC on ChainThe idea is to trade for USDT/USDC on a DEX (never on a CEX). The event would be taxable but nothing is related to us so who would ever notice?! At least in theory.DOUBTS:- Many of the doubts of idea #1  (regarding: on which dex, how to make this exchange and how to safely transfer BTC?)- How to use/spend the $ tokens once we have them on our cold wallet?- Is using USDT/USDC anonymously feasible?- As above, is there a debit card or method that allows this? (without KYC in this case because USDT or USDC would be taxable in this case)- Could we use the Nexo card by exploiting the loan mechanism with the stables as collateral? But is DAI supported?  (in this case we are practically not selling but we are only borrowing then we spend what has been lent, even if I don't understand the mechanism well but then there will also be limits and in any case we must do KYC)IDEA #3 | Change of residence to a foreign country without taxationHere we move to the desperation phase with this solution. Definitely the most decisive and perhaps safe ?? With a \"right\" residence after the right years we could also make bank transfers directly with the cash out.DOUBTS:- Drastic solution but is it feasible, in some obscure way, even while physically remaining in the actual country of residence?- Is it possible to create a foreign account with the related CC where you cash out and use it with that?- Even by staying close, can we exploit, for example, Switzerland or Germany or Portugal better law structure?- I wouldn't even know where to start. Practical advice?There are many questions and perhaps there isn't even a best or definitive solution but if someone has experience and wants to share it they could give me and everyone else who is asking the same questions a significant help.If there are other related questions and someone wants to post them, a discussion on this topic is welcome.I always thank everyone right away for their help, always much appreciated",

What I know is purchase a gift card, but it's not easy to sell it.",

I don't know if it is possible to somehow cheat the system within the EU and stay in one country, and at the same time sell crypto in another and thus avoid taxes - but I think that with all the new regulations something like that is actually not possible.In addition, there is another problem, which is that each of these countries can decide to change the law at any time - so you could find yourself in a situation where you move to a country, live there for a certain period of time, and then instead of less or none you pay even more taxes than in the country where you lived before.",

I perhaps assumed a specific country in this case where the new regulation made a distinction between stable coins anchored to fiat and stable coins with another underlying. In this case only the exchange with all those stables mentioned above or fiat generates a taxable event, which in a certain sense we can exploit to our advantage.Quote from: Helena Yu on March 15, 2024, 11:37:13 AMSpeaking about DAI, currently it might be the best stable coin, the safest chain should be the main network i.e. ETH network.

Reliable since 2014. You could use Changenow.io too for example, but it is less safe IMO as they operate AML verifications, and shared information with some gov agencies in the past IIRC.-DAI is reliable as a stable coin IMO, at least it is the best (even if unperfected) stablecoin available for now. Cannot be frozen or seized in your wallet like USDT or USDC.-For the crypto card, Wirex is cool (low fees) but KYC is mandatory. ID + POA.-Otherwise, you should know that in Europe, if you spend crypto with a crypto card, no matter if it is a stablecoin or not, you will need to pay taxes (at least in 99% of EU countries).

      "body": "Quote from: passwordnow on March 15, 2024, 11:39:34 PMGoing to a country that has zero taxation with your crypto gains is going to be costly unless you have a lot of profits that shall be taken on that country. But wouldn't you be questioned when you're about to get out from there and you'd start to bring that money with you or you'd just wire transfer that from there to your local bank account? But if it's about changing your residence, are you sure that you'd be willing to go that with extra mile and you've got a lot of requirements to fulfill with it unless you go in a country that will just want you to invest or buy some real estate that will cost you $100k-$500k and more. That means that you'd be having millions of crypto gains for that particular country so that you won't be required or else, you've got some relatives there and they shall be the one to take you up there and that will be cost effective and lesser once you migrate there and have that permanent residency. So, if you have no relatives that are willing to help you, isn't it that it's just best to pay the taxes to remove the hassle and there's no need for you to drop that amount for that country to be considered with their residency visa? But hey, it's a property to another country and that's still going to make sense as another investment, right?As I said is a desperate idea but someone is using this and I was wondering if there is any chance to be effective but I know it has downsides and maybe even quite impossibile.Quote from: Maus0728 on March 15, 2024, 11:40:59 PMIdea 2 is my to go exit strategy but then there's taxes and I think that with your options of ideas that you've presented, it's probably a good assumption that you don't want to pay your taxes or you're evading some people in your life and you don't want them to know that you're going to make money in crypto or maybe even know how you made it. Idea 3 is a little too much unless it's a necessary thing to do, unless there's a threat to your life or you're being chased or will be chased as a fugitive, that's going to be your option. I don't think there's a lot of countries that would have what you're looking for when it comes to no taxation, if you want to pursue the third idea, you're gonna need to love the sun because most of them are probably tropical countries that make money on tourism to sustain their no taxation policies in some parts of living in their country.Quote from: Poker Player on March 16, 2024, 04:43:33 AMAs noted above, ideas 1 and 2 do not exempt you from the obligation to pay, meaning that you would be committing a crime or misdemeanor, depending on the jurisdiction in which you are located and the amounts involved. Well I'm now talking about reasons here, I was just asking and presenting ideas to see if there is any feasibility and above all how to implement it.As I said previously, there are country where not all cryto related is taxable so lets assume this for now: trading BTC -> DAI is not taxable so can this be used to our advantage ??Quote from: paid2 on March 16, 2024, 01:00:03 AM- About \"any safe no KYC swap/exchange\" and your question about how BTC to DAI can be done, I would advise you to use eXch, as it's without KYC, without account to create and no logs. Reliable since 2014. You could use Changenow.io too for example, but it is less safe IMO as they operate AML verifications, and shared information with some gov agencies in the past IIRC.-DAI is reliable as a stable coin IMO, at least it is the best (even if unperfected) stablecoin available for now. Cannot be frozen or seized in your wallet like USDT or USDC.-For the crypto card, Wirex is cool (low fees) but KYC is mandatory. ID + POA.-Otherwise, you should know that in Europe, if you spend crypto with a crypto card, no matter if it is a stablecoin or not, you will need to pay taxes (at least in 99% of EU countries). As your CEX will do the exchange crypto/fiat for you when you will use your card.Thanks for all your suggestions. This is precisely what I was trying to achieve by presenting ideas and doubts  So anymore suggestions? pratical one too. For example: how that exchange works? how can I bring BTC on the exchange? or maybe doing all on a decentralized exchange? how? safest one?Quote from: Poker Player on March 16, 2024, 04:43:33 AMThe one I missed in the list is the one popularized by Saylor \"borrow against your Bitcoin\" and never sell it. If you have enough holdings, you can take a pledged loan for 1% of what you sell and if the price goes up you can keep refinancing, the loan goes down on its own. If it goes down to avoid a margin call you can put in a little more Bitcoin.That was another possibile solution I found using a cypto card that do just that but I don't know much about it. Can you explain more your concept? how can that be achieved?",

As your CEX will do the exchange crypto/fiat for you when you will use your card.This applies to physical cards that are subject to KYC, but not to virtual cards that you can make as many as you want, pay with them online or add them to Google/Apple Pay and pay contactless at any place where cards and contactless payment methods are accepted.There are also \"anonymous\" physical cards (one member has been selling them on the forum for a long time), but this service costs quite a bit and you have to be prepared to use a card issued in someone else's name in another country.I also recently saw a topic about a virtual/physical card that seems to have been issued in Hong Kong, and somehow I doubt that anyone in the EU could so easily get information about a person using such a card (although I may be wrong).Quote from: BiTCalt on March 15, 2024, 11:32:00 PM~snip~Switzerland, Portugal and Germany are all more convinient for me. Even in a country like Germany, for example, you don't have to pay anything if you cash out crypto detained for more than a year and I think this is a very democratic and fair law.You have other options if it's the EU, in Croatia you don't pay tax for 2 years after purchase, otherwise the tax is 10%, and I think Slovenia also has favorable laws when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Of course, it's a matter of which country you prefer, whether it's language, culture or maybe climate. If you ask me, Switzerland is perhaps the best choice because of its level of democracy and neutrality.",

The more you deposit, the more you can borrow against.You Keep Your CryptoEven as you make card purchases, your crypto won't be sold, thus retaining its upside potential.Get Up to 2% Cashback + InterestGet crypto cashback when you spend. You'll also be earning interest on assets not used as backup.Credit Line Starting from 0% InterestCredit Mode offers you rates starting from 0% and never exceeding 15.9% p.a. You can also repay at any time, unlike traditional credit cards that require you to deposit funds every month.Nexo’s zero-cost credit is available to eligible Nexo clients who maintain an LTV of 20% or below.Optimize Your Tax LiabilitiesCredit Mode allows you to spend without selling your crypto, which doesn't trigger a taxable event.They also said about the tax liabilities so  Can be a viable solution?But again: how can we properly use this method? When btc goes up and goes down? Can we use even DAI or USDT or USDC to use it as collateral? If anyone knows and already use this can teach us about it",

In other words, you want to outsmart the system so that you don't sell Bitcoin, but at the same time you profit from it - or you sell Bitcoin, but you don't pay tax, or you pay much less than the 20% that it amounts to in your case.Quote from: BiTCalt on March 16, 2024, 12:13:05 PMI found this nexo card that maybe do exactly that:I've heard about it, but I don't know if that model has a sustainable business strategy. However, the idea that you should give your BTC to someone in order to be able to get loans is actually very problematic at its core - because you are not the owner of the BTC, and the company you entrusted them to can disappear at any moment and you are left with nothing.
