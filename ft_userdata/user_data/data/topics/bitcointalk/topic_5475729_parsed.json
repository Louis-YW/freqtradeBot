      "body": "I saw the whole episode as the USTC was being pumped by only God know who.The crypto market is funny at times, with manipulation everywhere, do they want people to still invest in such a failed project? A supposed stablecoin that is not stable. It went from $0.013+ to $0.078+ in about 4 days and dropped to $0.043 in less than 24 hours afterwards shortly after reaching that peak. This is a pure manipulation that couldn't survive their plan.I wonder who would still foolishly invest their money in such a failed project, something that was supposed to be pegged with USD. However, LUNA and LUNC didn't move much but they also breathed new air because of this.",

Now people may think I got good profit still whinning, no I know how much stressed out and it doesn't worth t.It is very interesting to note that you made good profit by using a clever strategy, specially considering that most likely its price will decline again. i was also surprised to see it rising to the extent of 300% which was unexpected and fortunately I also booked profit on my  long standing holdings of USTC. It could be an attempt of a big market player to manipulate its price and take exit after making substantial profit. Let's watch and wait how its situation unfolds in coming days and weeks. Its the time that will reveal the truth behind its sudden surge.https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/terra-classic-ustc-rise-300/",

Yes, usually 5x is the max leverage which we can take as a professional trader even on safe coins and took a calculated risk and it paid off, repeated the same stuff today on long with 10x and the outcome was positive once again but as you said these are very risky trades and USTC and this whole LUNA coin family can just go to zero like they did in the past and I am getting out of it with one final trade which I have shorted from 0.0429 but unfortunately the market is upwards just waiting to meet break even or some small profit before getting out of this.",

Now people may think I got good profit still whinning, no I know how much stressed out and it doesn't worth t.After what happens with USTC and LUNAC i don't think it still has investors who believe in its long term growth. The Classic Luna network and its stablecoin have already been replaced by the new version of their previous one which has utilities in terra ecosystem. These Luna classic token are just like a souvenir and they don't have any value other than historical ones. They are the reminder of one of the major failure in crypto industry and they are nothing but some speculative asset. This recent pump in those token was done by the market maker.",

If you think the price will go down so they can give more pump to liquidate people after that they just give a significant dump again.I will recommend just leave that kind of coins and focus on other coins which are looking real.
