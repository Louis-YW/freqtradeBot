Each individual has their own take if that's a good starting point for an investment and reasons why. You compare the good with the bad, think about which opinions make more sense to you personally, and you make your decision. Although the first question is subjective, the second one isn't. Can someone steal my bitcoins if they know my seed (assuming there is on passphrase or multisig setup)? The answer to this one is clear to anyone who knows how Bitcoin works and there is no room for alternative interpretations.",

The ANN has a fair share of similar answers, but more of those are unreliable.So the rank (and trust!) of the answering ones may have its weight too.Then I've seen, especially on technical problems, a lot of answers that were incomplete or not suitable for the actual problem (especially when the OP is not clear enough in expressing that).The good and complete answer may need to be obtained like a puzzle, from multiple pieces scattered in the answers.Hence indeed, it's not always straightforward to find the good answer.

Are you suggesting that if someone asks a technical question about the Bitcoin algorithm for example, they need to learn all related things about it? While some users can do that, some don't. What is your suggestion for the latter? Not trying to say that your advice is bad, but giving more suggestions on how users can learn more knowledge would be more helpful IMO. I think most people know about \"do your own research\" thing here, but some of them don't know how to do it.I also think this is not exclusive to Bitcointalk. Any forum/community-related website will have varying degrees of opinions. Not to mention if you ask opinion-based questions as mentioned above. Depending on what board you are spending your time on here, or what question you ask, I believe the second type of question mentioned above (what is a wallet, can I store my seed offline, etc) has answers that are quite close to the truth. At the very least, they can give you a different perspective when some members disagree. CMIIW.",
