  "content": "Hi everyone,In this topic I would like to introduce you to the Ape Miner. Ape Miner is the first mining-based MMORPG game that incorporates AR to build parallel universes in the real world. Players complete tasks discover and mine minerals. In ApeMiner, holding NFT is mining, treasure hunting makes money, and the game changes your destiny. ApeMiner is already compatible with eth, bitcoin, polygon, bnb, and will continue to be compatible with various chain assets, we’re looking for powerful mining pools to join and help us build the project.More about us: BTCOur website: https://www.apeminer.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/ApeMinerVerseTelegram group: https://t.me/apeminerofclOur Discord: https://discord.gg/rvkd2XCSWF",

Are you buying miners with the NFT profit or you are using that money to pay a fake mining process?And why are you i don't get clear why are you looking for powerful mining pools, to be honest i don't think some one will use their mining profit to feed an NFT scheme. Isn't clear what's the deal will the miners or how can they help you to build the project.",
