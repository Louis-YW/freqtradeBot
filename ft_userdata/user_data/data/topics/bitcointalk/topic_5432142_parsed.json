Good news is that users are given sufficient time to withdraw their assets. Unless I am misreading what they say people have until the end of January to withdraw. 35 days is really not a lot of time, 60 to 90 days would be a lot more reasonable. There are people who do not spend a lot of time dealing with their crypto, despite what those of us here do.Vacations / traveling and so on, people are busy. I can see some people not paying attention and then having to go through hoops to get their money back.Yeah, not you keys not your coins, I keep saying that but still people are people and they keep funds on exchanges. -Dave",

So, they will have to contact this \"Legal Affairs Bureau\" to get back their moneyThat's what I understand from the Kraken Japaneese blog post",

Of curse, just because this might go smoothly it doesn't mean to trust Kraken with all your coins and leave them there for months!",

      "body": "It's not about Kraken being uncomfortable with Japan's stance on crypto. They were welcomed there, in the first place. It's just that business was no good. There's no reason to stay when the operation is not profitable. If the revenue remains lower than the cost of running the exchange, despite the 30% layoff implemented just a month ago, there's no point insisting to continue. I guess this is a better decision. When the market recovers in the near future, re-entry is always an open option. They're already considering this as early as now. Ironically, though, just as Kraken is about to exit due to the downturn of the market, its rival Binance is about to re-enter after 4 years. Binance has acquired \"Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC), a Japan Financial Services Agency-licensed business,\" paving its way for the re-entry.[1] The two exchanges must have different, even opposing, outlook or appreciation of the Japanese market.
