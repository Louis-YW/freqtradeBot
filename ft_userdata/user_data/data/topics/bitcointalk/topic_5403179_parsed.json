  "content": "just saw this video published today by Cyrus Janssen.  although he isn't providing link to what he is actually talking about. I did some googling which i found these:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-29/alibaba-makes-metaverse-bet-in-china-s-magic-leap-rivalhttps://www.alibabacloud.com/solutions/metaversei didn't know how AR differs to VR. Alibaba will be creating the worlds shopping center where you can use the headset and just literally going to experience this metaverse. In the future i think its not so far fetch after all to play and travel around the world while at home. the way its been described by Cyrus will actually work best for metaverse casinos than what Zuckerberg have in mind.  i think this is where we can chat on the poker table and make bluffs.",

When the metaverses and VR are of a very high quality, I am sure that these technologies will be used everywhere, not just to go to the mall or to travel.",

It's as if you're wearing a glass or head gear similar to the robot vision featured in the movie, where information is displayed on top of the object you're looking at. Perhaps AR could be really handy for counting cards?Virtual reality, on the other hand, appears to be more useful for training or as a gateway to an actual casino experience, and table game simulation is an excellent example of this to gain a better understanding of the game's concepts.If I were to choose which technologies will have more impact specifically in casino, it would be AR for sure!!!",

AR would add the experience of that 2d/3d feel to the real world which imo is a lot easier compared to adding that realistic 3d feel of the world towards 2d/3d. It's the difference between implementing a system in a developed world and developing a new world. Plus, it makes you go out. I'm honestly more interested now in AR development with what they showed.

Right not MeTa is the (or one of the) cheapest social media stock there is and it is being priced like it is going bankrupt. That should give you an idea .In the future, virtual and augmented reality technologies will become very widespread.  Modern smartphones no longer surprise with their technologies.  In their development, quantitative rather than qualitative changes occur.  The number of cameras is changing, IPS screens are being replaced by OLED screens, stereo sound is being improved, and so on.  However, modern smartphones are not much different from smartphones in 2017.  There are no fundamental differences.  The functionality of modern and old smartphones is exactly the same.  At the same time, augmented virtual reality headsets provide a completely different user experience.  They provide a complete immersion in virtual reality.  The smartphone also allows tactile, visual and auditory interaction with its owner.  However, the smartphone does not provide a complete immersion in virtual reality.  Currently, most of the major IT companies are making huge investments in virtual and augmented reality technologies.  Because it is clear to everyone that other devices should come to replace smartphones and laptops.  Many believe that the future belongs to augmented and virtual reality headsets, helmets, glasses, and so on.  Perhaps virtual augmented reality will develop only with the massive introduction of neural interfaces that will allow you to deliver information directly to the brain.  In any case, it is virtual augmented reality that will allow you to get a unique user experience in a new type of online casino.  Such online casinos are the future!",

Jack Ma for sure knows that despite bitcoin, crypto, mining, and gambling being illegal, there are still probably millions of Chinese involved in it secretly. Rich Chinese though can easily evade the law since they can just go to HK or Macau or overseas and acquire an ID or even properties in order to be exempted. This project though if realized including the casinos will be a problem for Jack Ma if the government will go against it. I am not updated if Jack Ma is still a member of the communist party after he went MIA last year.",

Hence the AR device needed to augment what you can already see.The metaverse concept everyone's bandying about is completely VR (virtual), though I suppose AR could be used to bring aspects of it out into those wanting to mix the experience.Have to say though, practical versions of metaverse casinos actually existed since the late 1990s... I should know, my very first online casinos were installed from CD software... William Hill and another one I don't recall had a huge virtual casino experience, avatars, chatrooms, suites, VIP rooms, restaurants, etc. It does seem like it's moved away from that now. Live dealers streamed in real-time, preferred to actual gamblers mingling around in lobbies and tables as chatting avatars. So I think that while the tech exists to renew the old idea and make it better, is that what gamblers really want? Is there even a market anymore for it? Social app users and gamblers, they're not necessarily the same group of people.",

Mark Zuckerberg's version seems like a capstone project of VR students that just wants to test their fundamentals on the subject. While I understand that creating VR material is extremely hard, knowing that the likes of Half-Life: Alyx exists already from a company that has a relatively smaller budget than Meta's, of course people expected more. China's visualization of how the metaverse should be is great. It can be adopted onto a bunch of things and companies can use it as a basis.

Currently, the technology is still in development and has not yet reached its maximum stage because its appearance is still not as smooth or \"live\" as we see it in the real world. So I don't think it will be implemented into gambling yet because I think the price to buy the equipment is still quite expensive for most gamblers who still prefer to use the existing technology. But that will change when the equipment price can be cheaper so they can buy it easily. It all depends on how much it costs people to buy the equipment and if it's still expensive, not everyone will try it.",
