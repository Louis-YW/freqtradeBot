Meaning we re-roll again, but giving out two prizes, rolling two blocks, instead of one.Example: 3rd prize (1st block) was already won by a participant. Now we are rolling for 2nd prize (2nd block). My entry is hit: Now we roll again, but twice, giving out two #2 prizes.Just pick any available number between 00-99! Please post in the following format: \"YOUR NUMBER/SPOT - YOUR USERNAME\"Once full, I'll pick a Bitcoin block that has not been mined yet. The last numbers of the block hash will determine the winner.
