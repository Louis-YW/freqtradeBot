We think that NFTs should be taken to the next level and that's why we created a combination using DEFI mechanisms, the use of NFTs and the utility of some tokens. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOblfRzoCjsThis is a project with long term sustainability in mind but at the same time it is very simple. Anyone who wants to manage the resources of their own city, build a community based on NFTs, hire and fire employees can do so using our city simulator. Basically it is a city builder without limits, it is scalable to infinity. https://imgur.com/gallery/2pfVgbrhttps://imgur.com/gallery/fBV11jLhttps://universe.businessbuilders.cityThere are two ways in our game. Be the empire owner or be a player. When you are the owner you build cities and factories to passively generate resources, if you choose to be a player you will have to pay attention to the constant changes in our system, generate resources using other players cities and factories and constantly increase your team of employees. To generate your NFTs you can use our applications on the Meter network https://meter.businessbuilders.city here you can manage your NFTs, generate new ones and join several to progressively increase the number of employees in your team. We want our systems to be multi-chain but we decided to start our project on a promising and stable network. We use the blockchain of https://meter.io which has provided stability and the taxes of all transactions are very cheap.Our communitiesTwitter: https://twitter.com/NFTBBuildersDiscord: https://discord.gg/dVr4cW593pInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/businessbuildersnft/Telegram Announcements: https://t.me/business_buildersTelegram chat: https://t.me/business_builders_en",

I especially have the right economic model that works really well and is fair & really sustainable but this world will likely not like without trying because it will be too fair and good for their liking",

Meter is a highly performing layer 1 (which also acts as a sidechain) with 2.5 seconds per block .. which makes the TXs really very fast and the fluidity to play is really fantastic",

      "body": "Good evening everyone.I'm happy to have entered such a promising project early. From the latest changes, whether severe or not, I appreciate the hard work of the developers and their long-term vision, very important details. I have entered into many projects and I assure you that few developers work so constantly and hard and above all that they listen to those directly involved, that is we investors and users of the platform. I say this because I have had the honor of speaking to developer many times. Today we are witnessing an all-time low for many recently born assets, including FTB. And it is precisely for this reason that I am convinced to invest a lot and constantly in the project, both in terms of time and in economic terms.I would especially like to thank the Italian BusinessBuilders ITA community for the enormous help and patience they have with all of us.I hope that you, like me, are happy with the work done so far and the hard work that will have to be done to make Business Builders a globally known play to earn game. Finally, WE are the community that will be able to take the project far!!",
