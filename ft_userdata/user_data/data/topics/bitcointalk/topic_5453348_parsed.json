Maybe designing an artificial intelligence wife sounds like morality to him, just like making electric cars. It's all about the money and the fam but we a bigger than that because what matters is the quality of things you put your time into and there are different forks for a different job.",

This is much more efficient than control via telephone or conference call. It is more profitable for an employer to save on office expenses, but this is not suitable for all employees. Recently, it has become fashionable to send IT workers to a remote location, but they still have to come to the office 2 times a week. I look at the experience of my colleagues, and their bosses require the presence in the office at least once a week.",

He's aware of the WFH setup and that has been there even before the pandemic triggered. I don't know why he has to make this such a wide discussion and have to make bold statements about vague comparisons. He may be entitled to his own opinion but he's off and entirely wrong with that comparison. If people choose the skillsets that they have which will allow them to work at home, why stop them?While those people chose the skills that will only be done inside the company's premises through working on site. There's no violation, there's no discrimination with the choice of anyone whether to work at home or to work on site.",

      "body": "Jobs that do not need to be confined in the office have produced a lot more positive results compared to when they're inside the office. Also, those who are creating vehicles need to be on site obviously, and Elon's comparison on these two things are very poor. It's never a question of morality, it's the question of efficiency and how much things can be done on which setup while also limiting the cost of operations and whatnot. This is what Elon cannot comprehend, or he does but he's pushing the narrative to go out there and use vehicles because, well, he has an interest on it as one of his companies is working on electric cars. I believe that a hybrid setup on jobs that this is applicable is way better than a permanent work-at-home or work-at-office setup because this change in environment can actually help the employee get a better feel at working because they are not seeing the same things over and over again.",

And it's just dumb (and there really is no such thing as equality tbf). I mean, let's be real, his argument of service workers coming to the office to work REQUIRES them to work there because that's there, or at least a part of their job description, simple as that. Some jobs are able to function well enough in their homes. Though it may be a matter of preference for them, it certainly doesn't necessitate the requirement for them to go to the office to perform their job. I agree that it isn't really about productivity, I mean some people are just more productive in the office with fellow workers, and some are just productive while in the comfort of their home. Morality? Now that idrk where he got that from. Plus, I say bosses, team leads, CEO's or whoever is in the lead probably just isn't used to handling people online, hence why they make them come to the office, where they actually know how to.",
