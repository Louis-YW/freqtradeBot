  "content": "Today I received a message from a user on telegram about a user in the winz.io campaign who was buying merits. I spoke with the user and told them, \"Without proof there is nothing I can do\". After speaking with this user, I also decided to message the person he was referring to as well as look into his merit history. While looking into his merit history I seen 2 suspicious profilesDEGATON44 who hadn't posted since April 2021.mafoja1 who hadn't posted since April 2022.MAMUN74 the cheater Both profiles looked fishy and made me wonder why they would give merits if they don't even use the forum? So, I told the guy being accused that I kind of believed the guy messaging me and buying merits is cheating. He actually confessed.I'll be tagging all 3 accounts as cheating and merit selling should not be tolerated. If any of you have proof of this type of activity, feel free to post here and help stop these cheaters.",

The user creates a destination Alt (beginner) account to redeem (Merit).2. Or maybe he bought (Merit) from the account you mentioned above or based on information from the user who gave it via telegram to you.It could be done, but why did he buy only one (1) Merit, how much would that 1 Merit cost if he bought it.... curious.But my guess is that the user transfers merit between Alt, considering that there is no valid evidence submitted by other users in your telegram, the reason I match these users is based on the Alt they have a lot, besides that the other two accounts were beginners, he could have made him do that.That's based on my argument, maybe if there is other evidence leads like the title of this thread, good enough and professional.",

I rarely check winz campaign spreadsheets maybe because I wasn't part of the campaign but several accounts joined, I noticed they've started upping their posts, which means your terms and goals run successfully.",

If they weren't you wouldn't see signature campaigns, bounty campaigns, or any paid promotions because there wouldn't be anyone trying to participate. Look at the number of designers offering services or the number of campaign managers. We are all here making money. Very few that aren't. Now the user in question has messaged asking for forgiveness but I have not replied because I feel he doesn't really feel sorry he cheated, but more sorry he got caught. So in his mind, his account is ruined. What does he have to lose?",

A crooked man especially can be so smart and adaptive.As a manager, you must have understood that the quality of posts have improved since you enacted the rule. But in some rare situations and with a more careful scrutiny, you will see a less quality post receiving 1 merit and a more quality post recieve none. As a manager you know the quality posters in your campaign, then your conscience wouldn't allow you to kick a quality poster because he failed to earn a merit, and retain a less quality poster who maneuvered his way.I'll suggest that to achieve your aim, pay your participants per post. If it's $1 per post and maximum of 25 posts per week. Then a poster makes 25 posts in all and out of which is 17 quality post, you pay them $17. Next week, they will pay attention to their post quality.",

username @mariawilson24 (mariawilson), (Ombakbanyu)mariawilson to MKP90** (profile), same reason (see this post)With mafoja1 and the others I found now there are even more connected accounts.  Now things get bad.  If they are using all of these accounts to farm Merit points and sell them, they may be making decent money.I want to bring something up here.rana250 tried to get Merits in the Sign a Message thread (see this link).aslam86 got 2 Merits in the Sign a Message thread (see this link).mafoja1 got 3 Merits in the Sign a Message thread (see this link).tamim60 got 2 Merits in the Sign a Message thread (see this link) and tried again two months later (see this link).There is probably more.  I will try to look it even deeper but my mind is already boggled out.  I got very tired by this.  This is so much to handle and process.-----Edit with more connectionssawrajsi to Diannetownzen** (profile) and swarajeb** (profile), they use the same Facebook profile

that I connected many accounts, it is time to finally have a list of who sends Merit points to whom.  Note almost all accounts connected by Veleor in 2018 are now inactive since 2018 - 2021 except about a dozen, mostly those at the end of their list.  Most of the accounts I found are still active in 2022.mafoja1:> November 28, 2022, 1 to Mamun74 (see post here)CPNpr:> September 29, 2022, 8 to rojan (see post here)MatthewLM:> October 28, 2022, 1 to Marvell1 (see post here)Last updated, 6th of December 2022Please note I am not implying any of the Merit recipients are purchasing Merit points from the connected members.  I only want to keep a history of Merit spendings for future reference.  Maybe it helps others investigating.-----**need to temporarily tag them in this post for personal

Can you point to those decent posts?Cause looking at his history this is all I see:QuoteBitcoin price already touched in 68k+ in 2021 but it early dropped in very next year.Bitcoin staying $40k around this year even April month bitcoin price was around $40k but this month bitcoin price dropped and hold $31k.I hope bitcoin price will be recover in november's month this year.But market condition very hard to predict bitcoin price. I hope bitcoin price will be more grow like 2021.~I think it will happen coming days.Now market condition very hard and very hard to predict bitcoin price. This month bitcoin price staying $28k-30k.For my experienced,Bitcoin price was under $25k but it already touched in $68k+ in 2021 too.But bitcoin price early dropped in 2022 and bitcoin price was around $40k previous 2-3 month.I hope bitcoin price will be more improve this year and bitcoin will be more grow in this year.~Bitcoin price early dropped in 2022 and now huge dropping day by day.Bitcoin already touched in 68$k but now it dropped and reached $19k+.Bitcoin price early dropped in this month cz previous month bitcoin was around $37k+  and it was staying around $40k+.I think bitcoin price will be recover soon and bitcoin price wil be more grow in future.~Bitcoin price already dumped and touched $17k and too early to happen. But bitcoin price early dropped in 2022 and staying 3-4month around $40k+ but last 2 month bitcoin price dropped  unrespectable. Bitcoin price touched $68k+ in 2021.we know Bitcoin has always up to a new ATH every dip so maybe we see 75k+ next pump.~I believe bitcoin price still movement correction. Bitcoin price already touched in $68k+ in 2021 but it early dropped in, 2022.Bitcoin price staying around $38-40k+ long time but it dropped and reached under $18k.I think bitcoin price will be more this year.And bitcoin price will hit $30k again in coming days.Pages over pages of what the price was a year ago and two months ago and ending with the hope of it going up in the future, hundreds of posts with the same structure, the same useless data that nobody needs, the same two or three lines of nothing but you put some numbers there, so it must be a decent post, cause using numbers shows much knowledge. Such wow posts! Much doge impressed!This is the same shit that has been happening in gambling where everyone is posting the current score and the obvious useless phrase that if team A Scores more goals than team B it will win the game and here you go, the quota for the gambling board done without even knowing how to place a real bet.",

Because merit is moving arround for some users only 10-20 per year makes it impossible to circulate and attract new users not to look to buy.So overall, blame yourselves.I think anyone Legendary rank should only get 1-2 merits from users if someone is going to merit a Legendary since the merit is not very useful except in giving Legendary ranks more merits to send out, but I strongly disagree that it's our faults that lower ranks aren't merited. People think that because they met the section requirements, stayed semi on topic, and hit character counts that their post is a good post. They're wrong!!! So many users repeat the same opinions because they're just looking to qualify to get paid in a campaign. They do the minimum as fast as allowed so they make a few bucks, that doesn't mean they posted great quality.People with good quality posts stick out compared to the majority. Yes, there is some self-scratching but that is happening on all levels, so it evens out IMO.",

One of the accounts was already tagged by me before I found this thread, I had read the previous feedback about merit selling but kept mine limited to 1xbit. I have tagged the other two accounts for merit abuse and added them to my trust exclusion too.~DEGATON44~mafoja1~MAMUN74Quote from: The Pharmacist on December 06, 2022, 09:54:08 PMThere have been so many cases of suspected merit abuse reported in various threads over the years that I'd bet it's well over 100.  I'm sure it would be more than that were it not for the fact that Theymos told the community not to make a big deal about it--but either way, if the community wants to start tagging merit abusers with enough evidence against them, I sure as hell would be fine with it and if the forum detectives start looking closely enough I've no doubt this thread would end up with 1000 pages within a year.",
