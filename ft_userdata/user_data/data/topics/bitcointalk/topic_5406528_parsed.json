  "content": "Hey.Someone recommended this coin to me. I am sceptical. It has a total supply of 10Billion. Yet only 9% of it is in circulation and its 96% down from its ATH in December 2021.I'm sceptical of any altcoin that got released at the top of the bull run. (They almost all are riding the hype and taking advantage of peoples greed to sell them shitcoins)I'm not really sure what i make of the idea behind the project either. From CoinmarketCap:\"Unbound Finance is the first-ever debt-free liquidity provision system. Unbound achieves this by building a derivative layer on top of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) such as Uniswap, Balancer, Mooniswap, Bancor, Curve.fi, etc, unlocking locked liquidity from existing AMM pools and giving loans on existing Liquidity Pool Tokens (LPTs) as collateral.The Unbound Protocol charges no interest and it's liquidation Free.\"--------It currently has a flexible APR loan rate of 25% at Kucoin. (pretty damn high for a flexible / not staking) Which makes me wonder - why do they want people to buy it? Someone told me it is 100x potential.... but... I don't trust them at all. They pretty much make exclusively bad calls...What're your thoughts on this project? Scam? or does it have potential?Thanks, TG",

Scam? or does it have potential?It might be not a scam project but look at the current distribution of the token.  If the project failed to gather investors then the only path of the token market is to go down due to the inflation of tokens and not getting more buy support from the target audience.",

As I can see, you are just depending on the suggestion of your friend, take time to analyze on your own based on your own strategy, for me Its better to invest on top coins during bear market.",

Scam? or does it have potential?The coin's description looks like it was one of those serious coins but after reading the part where it offers high return, it then gives me a doubt. You ask if why do they want people to buy it? Of course for them to profit as well. If you are skeptical then that is a good sign that you must avoid this project. Only those who are allowed to invest on such are those who are willing to take big risks and can afford to lose money.This project was released on a bull run but I think that's how they work as I rarely see a project being released on a bear run but no, not all do that only because of the hype but there are legit projects to which stays even the hype was over.",
