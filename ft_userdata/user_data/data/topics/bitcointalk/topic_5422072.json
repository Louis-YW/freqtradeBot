Winter, Christmas, and New Year, and people are starting to withdraw their finances to prepare themselves to watch the world cup added to the current issue of centralized exchanges experiencing bankruptcy has sparked concern for users, both traders, and investors, to immediately secure their assets to their personal wallets so as not to suffer the same thing that FTX users feel. Furthermore, it is driven by the estimated predictions for 2023, where the economy will face a recession, which clearly has a significant impact on the price of Bitcoin and other altcoins because people will be predominately preparing cash funds for some time to come.",

For now I don't know if that will pull price down but usually during the first and second month of the new year, it is always a slow start because of the activities of December month. For now it is still not a certain moment for investors who want to use free money for the festivities and not to buy.",

I bet that it is going to be long and we may not see a bull run next month, but I could be wrong. There are no guarantees or promises when it comes to the prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by the end of 2022 because it’s so unpredictable and we may not know if it goes up or down without warning.",

It’s just temporary fluctuations which are nothing but opportunities for new users to join into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Rather than panic selling, we should buy more Bitcoins in this bear market and hold until we get profit. Bitcoins are so valuable that, after some years it will become really rare, and for this the price will go up, and we gonna enjoy huge profits.",

The profits will increase massively if they buy at such dips and sell later.So I am in the same boat. Although I don't own much sats but I am trying to implement the same strategy and trying to accumulate as much as I can in this dump.",

So far the price of Bitcoin has not increased but rather decreased.In such a situation no investor is able to invest properly. Different analysts are not able to accurately analyze which direction the market will go.However, many analysts have analyzed and said that the year 2024 will be the next halving of Bitcoin. But we investors must wait till 2024 and till then our bitcoins and all Should be held for long term.",

Especially if the cause was rather clear in cases like this (The FTX issue), and wouldn't really affect the market in the long term that they're looking at. Some long-term hodlers probably even held way back when Bitcoin was in 3, or 4 digits, so even with the current price they'd probably still profit. As for the price by the end, I reckon we'd still be hovering below $30k. There may still be issues that crop up that could potentially push the price down temporarily like right now, positive news are also unlikely even to push it that big, so we're off to a steady movement for the rest of the year imo.",
