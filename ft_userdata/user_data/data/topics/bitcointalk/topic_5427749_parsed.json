For those who do not know Masternodes are Are proof of Work concept in which w have to stake our crypto that are also specified and than you will earn money on per block that is completed. And it could be the future in late 2030. Cause it has no any kind of Hardware's and other such setup. Here you can find more details.  https://masternodes.onlineI think that Masternodes is a best way to earn passive than solo hardware mining m I also know that big companies are good to go with Asic miners but not good for low budget people.",

I would not call master node a POW. It is more like a PoS system. You explicitly stated that you need to stake some coins so I don't understand why you assume it is a version of POW.You also need to set up your own node (it is arguably cheaper, but still needs a setup), it is not a magical system where you can slap it anywhere and it will run perfectly. Not to mention you need to own some coins first, which might be costly depending on what coin you choose. The ROI also depends on the network and the price, if you choose a coin with a theoretically high ROI but the volume on the market is low, then you might not make a profit at all.If you don't have an excellent budget to run your own mining rig, it is probably better to just buy some BTC regularly instead. Passive income sounds cool but usually requires some budget and luck. You can also look for farming on pools if you really want to get some interest, but remember that there is always a risk. Don't expect too much profit when you don't have a massive budget.",

You explicitly stated that you need to stake some coins so I don't understand why you assume it is a version of POW.I agree, masternodes aren't really POW. They're more as POS because in POW, you're required to mine it and with masternodes, you're just staking it.Also, in masternodes, the most profitable ones are expensive to have and that's why it's not going to work for me but if I ever do and I've got money to spend it. I'll choose to mine and do the hard work since I want to mine bitcoin or just buy bitcoin and hold it.ETH is no longer a POW since it's now a POS. But if you like to get into staking, just choose those altcoins that won't require you any minimum amount to stake.",
