  "content": "Google may be the biggest tech giant in the world, but when it comes to blockchain and cryptocurrency, they're not afraid to open up their wallets and show some serious love.According to a new report from Blockdata, Alphabet (Google's parent company) poured a whopping $1.5 billion into the blockchain industry between September 2021 and June 2022. That's more than any other public company during that time period.So what does Google see in blockchain that has them throwing all that money around? Maybe they're finally ready to take crypto seriously? Or maybe they're just trying to stay ahead of the curve and be on the cutting edge of this new technology? This is a serious commitment to the space, and it's good to see that Google is finally taking blockchain technology seriously. With their deep pockets and expansive reach, they could really help take the industry to the next level.The corporate world's sudden interest in blockchain technology is quite amusing. It's like they've just discovered fire. Or the internet. Among the top 40 companies, a total of $6 billion has been invested into blockchain technology in the past year. This is compared to a measly $1.9 billion between Jan 2021 and Sep 2021, and $506 million in 2020. The companies like BlackRock and Morgan Stanley are leading the charge, with investments totaling $1.17 billion and $1.11 billion respectively. Even Samsung, an electronics company, has invested $979.2 million. It's good to see that these companies are finally catching up to the times and investing in something that is clearly the future. But it does make you wonder what took them so long.Hope this was helpful to some of yall!",

Though I'm not ruling out the fact that they might be into crypto, them investing $1.5b doesn't automatically mean that Alphabet is \"ready to take crypto seriously\" or something like that.There's a good possibility that Alphabet is just playing it smart and allocating a small percentage(basically hedging) into crypto-related companies, just as a sort of insurance for if crypto actually becomes far bigger from here and not just a temporary fad.",

Maybe they're finally ready to take crypto seriously? Blockchain doesn't automatically mean crypto, it can mean tracking it can mean voting, it can be used in logistics and many other things, it's basically a database and databases have been used for decades for almost every single purpose known to man. So the pouring millions into a blockchain project might just be for an extra research for their enormous database usage and their scalability or their payment systems without giving up fiat at all.Quote from: mk4 on August 18, 2022, 02:16:26 PMThere's a good possibility that Alphabet is just playing it smart and allocating a small percentage(basically hedging) into crypto-related companies, just as a sort of insurance for if crypto actually becomes far bigger from here and not just a temporary fad.It has become nearly a standard where large multi-billion companies are throwing money at hundreds of projects that show a bit of promise, it's the only way right now to keep up with every trend in the world as your own company can't go on a developer hiring spree to cover every niche, so you just invest in each and hope you nailed it as of course, not every bet will bring a profit, and some will fail miserably.

      "body": "It seems they're investing in blockchain companies, which is a very different thing from, say, purchasing Bitcoin. And it makes the $1.5 billion an even smaller sum because it gets diversified. It might be investments into development (or operations), in which case Google might believe there's good potential there. But it can also just be buying some shares in case they go up. Also, from the article stompix referenced, the projects are clearly not all crypto-related, some are about other blockchain use cases (Dapper Labs is blockchain video games, for instance).",

In addition, they strive to be \"pioneers\" everywhere and in everything, in order to stand at the origins of technology, in order to remove \"the thickest layer of profit.\" They invest huge sums in their own, even pilot projects - they can afford it. Moreover, not all of them \"take off\", beat, have and will have failed projects, but negative experience is also experience. Well, 1.5 billion dollars is not a lot of money for them, but the experience and experience gained in this area, they will sell much more expensive",

It makes sense for them to search out other sources of revenue. Blockchain is a ripe area for growth. Of course there is always the possibility google could combine their indexing and search technology with blockchain. To create something new. There have been several proposals along these lines for many years. Ranging from blockchain based voting systems to blockchain based ledgers.",
