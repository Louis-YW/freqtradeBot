  "content": "I want to share my thoughts on making money in a bear market, now investing in some tokens is not entirely profitable and easy to hold, but if you put them in staking, you can fight off their falling price, or do like me, stake stablecoins at 3% per annum, I I use Analytex as a lending aggregator for my bets, to be honest, I have no complaints about AnalytEx, I just didn’t figure out how to make some contributions there, but in general everything is very cool, I think there are some other such projects, but I found only this one. I read an article from them that with $1000 in some of the stakes you can earn up to $1 per day, in my opinion this is a very good profit in such a market, as always DYOR.",

      "body": "As for aggregators, I don’t know, but as for me, the idea of making money on stables is not new, and there are some concerns. I think if, from the point of view of earning on staking, you can use aggregators, if they are really proven and can make a profit, no matter how strange it is, I will try, maybe it makes sense, I will write down what happened later.",

There are a few good ones that got the same APY and they're far more liquid than what you're trying to promote here. What's the edge of it compared to those staking sites that prove they're established and known? Profits are profit now matter what it takes to get it but people are weary when it comes to new platforms that offer the same yields when they can earn the same on trusted and well known staking sites.",

They take all the farms and collect them in one place on the site, and you, as a user who uses several farms, do not need to use several farm sites, you can do everything in one place in the analytics. Connected wallet and stake and brand in one place from all farms. It’s the same with lending pages, there are a lot of them, Analytex collected everything in one place into a “catalog”, which you looked at, chose the best percentages for yourself and invested where you wanted",

I have not seen this before, quite an entertaining thing, but in terms of percentage, yes, there are better options",
