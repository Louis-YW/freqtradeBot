  "content": "Hello everyone, my name is Vladislav, I live in Ukraine, I am developing gamesI've decided to try myself in the NFT space. I'm drawn to everything related to pixels and voxels, but initially, I didn't want to create a typical PFP project or sell regular 3D models as NFTs because I have experience in developing browser and non-browser games.In my case, the token should be interactive and represent a browser-based 3D game. I had to figure out something that nobody has ever done before and something that people would enjoy.After considering various ideas, I settled on creating a voxel car collection that could be used in a 3D game. The development of the project began and continued for 9 months. At this stage, I have created >200 cars, a 3D game, a multiplayer browser game, and a game level editor.Multiplayer mode:https://i.ibb.co/Xsb7nWt/Fxfi-Lw-TWYAA1-Ge-X.jpgGame level editor:https://i.ibb.co/rmc0yGq/Fxfi-OCj-Xs-AAEca6.jpgInteractive token:https://i.ibb.co/LQ9p1fJ/10.pngSome renders:https://i.ibb.co/5TRn128/renders.pngFull render:https://i.ibb.co/b7gRJYQ/30.pngSo, let's summarize what we have:✅A voxel car collection divided into 5 rarity categories.✅Weapons attached to each car's roof for use in game modes.✅A game that utilizes these cars (for interactive tokens).✅A multiplayer browser game with game modes.✅A game level editor that allows users to create their own levels by placing dynamic and static objects.For the blockchain, I chose Tezos, and for the marketplace, objkt.com. I put up for sale 31 out of the 200 completed cars for sale, dividing them into different rarity categories and editions. I created a Twitter account, verified it, and started sharing the progress with the Tezos community using hashtags. People began buying these cars, and currently, I have sold 11 out of 2000 copies (2000 copies because of different editions and rarity categories). This indicates that people find it interesting.Currently, I am looking for an investor willing to invest $11,000 in the project's advertising campaign. Naturally, I can't leave the investor empty-handed and must contribute something myself.I offer 40% of the sale of each token. If an investor is found, we will close the listing and launch the advertising campaign. Once we have a sufficiently large audience (which will take 1 to 2 months of daily work), we reopen the listing and make a large number of sales.Here's how the deal could be conducted, in my opinion:objkt.com provides functionality for revenue distribution based on the percentage of each token. I will add your wallet address to each token and indicate that you will receive 40% of the token's sale.I divided everything into 3 stages to ensure safety and provide the investor with the opportunity to earn not only in the initial stage of the project.Stage 1: Close the listing, create promotional materials, launch an advertising campaign on Google Ads and Twitter (note that direct NFT advertising is prohibited on Twitter), set a sales start date, and sell cars to the audience.Stages 2 and 3: If you are satisfied and wish to continue collaborating with me and the project, you can invest money in the advertising campaign for the second stage. This involves launching an advertising campaign for the multiplayer browser game with the game level editor and also earning from the sale of land for constructing these game levels.(To avoid confusion, stage 2 refers to the advertising campaign for the multiplayer browser game with the ability to create custom game levels, while stage 3 refers to launching the game level editor. They are interconnected.)All stages of the project development are already completed, so you won't have to wait for me to finish something.

I will not give away the secret phrase to the wallet containing the tokens.",
