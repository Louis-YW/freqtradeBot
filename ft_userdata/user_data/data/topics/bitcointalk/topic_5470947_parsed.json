In my country as an example, there are gambling ads everywhere, on YouTube and TV channels, in a way kids can easily know that they can go online to gamble.

In our society today, we see children of younger ages doing stuffs that even the adults might be scared to go about. Gambling is something that anyone can pick up from anywhere. Addiction is what we end up falling into. Disabling adverts showing gambling, won't stop a child whom his father gambles alot from gambling. The best thing is for the parents to advice their kids on the consequences of being addicted to gambling and why they shouldn't involve them selfs. Just like smoking, stealing or other negative habits can be herited, gambling also can be passed on.",

You are right OP, you should also know that some habits are easily learnt, that is why there are some things that we don't need to do in the present of our kids because children are fast in learning these days. I believe that nobody taught anyone how to gamble but the mentality to use money to show you are a pro in a game or to make prediction about the outcome of an event that is yet to happen is in human nature.

I think it has a lot to do with how and if children value money or not, in what type of environment they grew up and also whether or not they received financial education in general. Not on a high level like formulas, but basic accounting and calculation and the skill to delay rewards. I think addiction can often be found in people when they have an issue to delay rewards or not have the required mental control over themselves. Gambling, like alcohol, has moments of instant rewards and that changes the brain over time in an addicted engine that's only running on excess dopamine if issues get worse. That is when consequences decrease in perceived significance and the need for short term rewards increases in perceived significance.",

As you mentioned, during those days when having phones or the internet was not a thing, as a kid, I was already involved in gambling without even seeing ads related to it, seeing adults doing that thing, or anything.It's a common thing to encounter while we grow up that's why it's totally nonsense to me to hide gambling from kids since that will just make them curious. But look at me, even though I was involved in gambling during my youngster days I didn't end up irresponsible. It's because of our natural common sense where we know what's right or wrong. I do believe that those kids that do some kiddy gambling activity like the one you shared on your story are just for entertainment and there is no way they will treat gambling seriously at that age. The purpose of those kids in the story is to determine who's right between and not to earn money out from that betting.",

And many things are learnt in school, than at home. Parents don't spend as much time with their kids, like the kids do with peers. They spend most of it in school. Most parents have only weekends to communicate with the kids. Thereby the friendship or relationship for the child to easily unveils things like gambling to the parents, won't exist. Kid keep most of these attitudes to themselves. And doesn't say a thing about it once they see an adult approaching towards them. They could be scared or not. Most times some things in the society is beyond our understanding. Especially activities that has been in existence for centuries. It's certain to meet school children whose neighborhood exposed them to gambling. It'll be simpler for other kids to learn gambling discussions from them. And then disseminate it amongst any available child. Similarly, they'll take it home and influence kids in their street or home. You'd see that the fight of controlling it through Ads doesn't add much meaning. Because in the school, a friend will definitely influence another. So, talking about gambling education, it could be beneficial, but easily will it be abused by the kids. They are known for turning things upside down. If they begin hearing gambling often and then in classes. It could lead them to gamble, for money. They should be a means of taking gambling off their mind. But that way may not be existence in the society of today. If we don't activate the inbuilt gambling habit, others, peers, can help us with that. It's like an involuntary action; gravity. And remember all parents are not thesame. Some are busier than the other. You could be training your kids to stay clear from gambling, while the other parent is not concerned or not aware of giving his kids similar training. They'll be a change of thought whenever your kid comes to befriend the other child whose parents don't care about gambling restrictions on kid. Who will be the influencer?",

But, I think they'll be no successful way of stopping young people from gambling. As it's in them. Most articles here also say things like gambling addiction being hereditary. That means gambling can be hereditary as well. Because I just watched from a distant two kids below 10 years, staking bets, after a long argument about who the artiste of a specific song is. They later staked close to 40 cents each, for the person who gets the answer right. Then they went ahead to verify. And I lost sight of them. I thought about, how come or who thought these kids about betting money during a long argument. I was able to memorize, back when I was a kid. We easily said, how much would you bet if it turns out I'm saying the truth; during an argument. It made me understand that, despite during those days we had no phones or access to the internet, gambling is somehow embedded to the brain of humans. Then, as a child, we weren't exposed to gambling. I could only remember of lotto, as a kid. But we still said things like \"let's bet it\" Gambling addiction isnt really something which is heriditary on which anyone could really be that getting addicted on the time that you do make yourself that being careful on the actions that you are making.When it comes on being young and having no experience on what are the things that we do have around then for sure you would really be that most likely be having that chance that we would really be that curious and we would really be that tending to engage out of it on which it is really that a common approach. There are indeed things in life on which we do really naturallybe making out some bets in against with other peoples choices too on which on the time that making things that a little bit exciting then you would really be adding up some money in correlation to it.This isnt really that someone couldnt really be able to do from time to time though and its true that this isnt really be just talking about into those situations but alsothis could really be done into various things which agreements and betting whether it would happen something or not. Being on young age will really be that its true thatthere would really be scenarios just like this.",
