I remember them having a lot of players years ago and they were really blowing in the poker bitcoin scene on the forum but then, I think with transition and stuff things have changed and they decreased in popularity, unlike almost everyone who has forgotten that they're popular in bitcoin poker.

I have only withdrawn to usdc, because the min withdrawal via btc is a whopping 500$, crazy.I got the money after around 36 hours every time. Once you are fully verified there is no need to delay withdrawals, so better do all the KYC at the beginning, safes you the stress.Usdc min withdrawal by the way is 50$, and eth is the worst, 1000$, hahah.

Maybe because people who are involved in crypto are different. Also when the first crypto casino came out, we are introduced to the unique games. So, people are used to them the most. It's not a big deal since we know that Poker is still a famous gambling game outside crypto.If OP and other Poker lovers want's some hype, it would be better if they will play Poker on popular sites and they must learn to deal with fiat payment methods if they are not used to it. I don't mind using a fiat but I still find Poker boring. Same goes with Chess and other mind/skill-based games. I'm not that dumb either lol.
