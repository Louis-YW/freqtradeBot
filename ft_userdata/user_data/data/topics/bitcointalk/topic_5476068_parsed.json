You can definitely be a winner in the long run if you follow a certain strategy but the big question here, is it worth it?You need to know everything about the team (and their opponent) you are betting on and having the knowledge isn't enough. You need to know how to make use of that information. You need to spend years to come up with a successful formula but if you work that much you can be successful at any business.It is probably more rewarding to start your own business instead of focusing on gambling.",

On sports betting, You can probably win long term since the result of your bet can be improved by a good analysis compared to the regular gambling games that gives pure random result. There’s a lot of way to win on this gambling category through the use of arbitrage bet, value bet and many more strategies that can give sure +EV.The only major enemy on sports betting is patience since there’s only limited number of games per day on a certain league which people follow. Without patience on this game will result to betting blindly on different league without further analysis that always result to losses.",

Winning sports betting especially soccer is not difficult  but it depends on how much that you will win. If you take a small risk then you are likely to win but a very small amount also and increasing the risk means likely to lose. That is the challenge. I'm sure many users here win in soccer bet.So among the games used in betting, sports is the most practical. It is more friendly, you can relate with sports and understand it without a third party explanation most likely but other gambling games are rigorous to understand. It is more of practical with sports and people already take part in the games practically by playing them in the field or tracks, so it is self explanatory, explicit and not confusing.",

Here in sports betting, you can make your own strategy that would work in the long run. I think there are already lots of successful sports bettor out there and personally I also like to succeed in sports betting, but as we all know, it's not easy as what we expect since first you need to ensure you have to build a good bankroll as success here are measure on a long term journey, and no gambler would be fulfill even he is profitable but not making a significant amount of money. For me, the most important factor here is to consider starting with a serious amount of bankroll, then everything will follow as a gambler as we are, we will do everything to protect it. It's quite different when you are just playing for fun than being serious in sports betting, and one way to make yourselves serious is to start with a decent bankroll.",

This makes it easier for them to analyse the team based on their player's ability and performance in previous games.",

Why most gamblers make use of sport betting platforms is for the avoidance of complete dependant on random luck to achieve a win as it's clearly known with slot games. In sport betting with a careful analysis on the matches you are about to make your bets on based on your knowledge gathered you can have a long run wins compared to casino slot games. You can hardly feel cheated about the outcome of the matches in sport betting as they are a practical live games that you don't need to wonder about it been provably fair in the results or not as it's found among slot machine gamblers when they experience streaks of losses for a long period they start assuming maybe the system is not probably fair as they claim but this I don't think is heard of with sports betting. That's what I think.",

I'm not someone who regularly bets on sports, but I still occasionally spend money to bet on my favorite teams. Even if they lose, I still feel happy. It could also be following a trend, because I remember during the football tournament, I spent money on almost every match, but honestly, it was just playing along with my colleagues, sometimes with friends. My old friend also had bets on the score to decide who would pay for the entire party.For me, luck may appear, but it will not last, and especially if I feel any shady things, I will immediately stop. I once received a big lesson from my own relatives, which is to owe money when losing money in betting, and that is the reason why I have always been clear about playing to relax, not to make money.",

After all, there isn't a consistent improvement on the performance of sports bettors against another gamblers. That is why you should gamble on categories you really enjoy, never seeing it as your job, task or duty.If you are a sports fan, bet on sports, because it will be entertaining for you. But if you don't like it, don't gamble just because you heard the chances are better there, rather go for another category of gambling you really like. And in every cases, keep in mind it's never going to be a money making method.",

In different way possible players want to support the team they are a fan of and also get entertained people are too committed to their favorite team so they include gambling and make a bet to them, others want to play gambling because they are knowledgeable about the games, teams and other information that gives them benefit to have a highlight which team to bet. By that they can easily make a big wins with their skills and also sports betting is one of the most active and hype choices by people to have more fun. Else people want to get a huge return with the YOLO game play which is they playing with the odds, just predict the winner with higher odds of course with huge amount if you hit good profit but if not most likely just small amount because of the odd winnings makes it bigger.",

I'm sure all casino games are set up by the casino to win the dealer and only a small part to win the user, that's why I never play casino games seriously because I have my own view like that even though other people may have other views that are more reasonable. I'm sure we all think the same that it's hard to beat the dealer.In contrast to sports betting, if there is casino interference or match fixing I think it is only done for small matches where players can be paid and bribed, I'm sure some people know dirty methods like that which we might find in the media that sometimes there are fixing the score to win the club that is not really the favorite, but even so I believe more in sports betting because I can analyze it and at the same time I can watch the match live officially.",

Well, I love sports betting because I love sports, aside from what I believe it has a good chance of winning compared from other games, I know myself that I could have more fun here than choosing random games.
