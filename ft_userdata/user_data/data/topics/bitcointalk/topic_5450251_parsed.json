Because if your accusations are not clear without adding all the important information then it will be difficult for the community members to understand what actually happened to you. So please add the screenshots if you have them here along with the link to the website. Because just saying forex doesn't mean how you got scammed.",

Look like you're one of that greedy people who want to become rich quickly and scammers exploit this behavior and scam you.  Please provide more details and perhaps someone will be able to give you a piece of better advice.",

How devastating that could be. I know how you feel OP. So sorry about your experience.Kindly do well to update your thread with the website so we could know if there is any help that could be of importance here and also other details pertaining to the transaction as to keep members abreast of they should encounter such in the nearest future so they could know some one already posted it and warned about the activities of the scammers. Atleast that could save many people here so as not to fall victim of such scam sites.",

Then this scammer will import a watch-only address (with balance that keep updating/increasing every time) to the account of their victims saying that its the profit of their investments. I don't know the issue of OP but this is what i remember when i see a scammed user from watch-only address.@OP unfortunately, you cannot do anything to that watch-only address, simply just serve this as expensive lesson to you that when it comes to investments, when it comes a too good to be true offer, it is scam.",

I also remember that online wallet was very popular when it came to watch-only scams, but desktop wallets were also used, because it's important to convince someone that they have something they don't actually have.Of course, scammers first talk about investments and ask for new payments, and when the user tries to withdraw coins, they ask for some kind of withdrawal fees and in that way they take even more money. It all boils down to the fact that you need to learn first, and only then invest, otherwise you have a story like the OP.@Jman200, I will just warn you not to fall for someone who will contact you in the sense that they can help you return the money you invested, or to look for such services online. You can report everything to the police, but don't pay anyone because it's just a new level of scam.",

And when you where about to withdraw, they are going to ask your to deposit big amounts of money and that's where the trick is. You can't withdraw or even if you deposit that amount, I don't think that can you get that money easily.So in any case, I think the OP has lost his money already, but I do hope that he will learn from this experience. Specially too good to be true offers, not just here in the community.",

Like the crypto market, the forex market requires knowledge, skill, and learning because it is also fraught with risks. It is possible that you chose a scam forex platform and put your money in it, as there are many suspicious platforms; I hope that you will explain to us precisely what happened with you because forex, in general, is not a scam but rather a profitable market. I advise you in any market you enter to gain experience and not invest with your emotions and ignorance and to have the ability to deal with technical and fundamental analyses so that the end is not dire.",

They give you the wallet seed phrase and since it is setup to be a watch only wallet the imported wallet will be showing the funds on the wallet and then the scammer will instruct the victim to send in some coins mostly bnb to the wallet and that it is the only way for the send option to open up. They end up sending to the same wallet due to their naivety but they won’t still have access to the wallet. Because it was watch only and only the scammer can grant that accessThis seems like a childish scam but newbies still fall for them and I think it is the kind of scam that Jman200 had fall into.",
