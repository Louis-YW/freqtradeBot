It is similar to creating content on the Internet, and if you are not talented, you will need to watch thousands of ads in order to earn a few dollars.Faucets reduce the withdrawal limits to arouse the user's greed, as we all like to withdraw money more than having it as a balance in the faucet and the withdrawal fees for them may be low (less than normal transaction fees) because they are batching the transactions but they cannot generate a lot of money and may not be worth $10 per month.

So the small amount given by the faucet is fake bitcoin?I think I know which faucet you mean and it's the most popular of them all, I think. But regardless of whether it is or not, the thing about faucets, as in many casinos, is that the numbers you see on the screen are a bookkeeping entry. If they're doing it right, they should have separate bookkeeping for their deposits and their profits. They have real bitcoin, but unless you reach the minimum to be able to withdraw, you will not have real bitcoin, what you will see on the screen is the accounting entry. In the case of the most famous faucet, it's a bit like playing the lottery but for free. If you hit the jackpot it's $200, which you can withdraw and you'll have the equivalent in real bitcoin, but I agree with what was said before, in general it's a waste of time.",

After I didn't get anything on the faucet, I started following airdop on telegram, and again it was crap because I didn't get anything. Until finally I found out about this forum. Maybe that's my path to this forum. Btw, I found out about Bitcoin during the Covid pandemic and I was WFH so I had enough time to do it all.

Yes, I just thought that if the exchange did something like that, it would be the same as what conventional banks do. As you said, I also know a little about conventional banking which uses customer savings to lend to other customers. When there is a large withdrawal of money, the bank will definitely go bankrupt and will not be able to disburse all of the customer's money because the bank doesn't have it.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on November 01, 2023, 08:16:17 AMQuote from: PytagoraZ on November 01, 2023, 07:52:57 AMThat sounds bad, so we also don't know how much bitcoin they have? including casinos and centralized exchanges also the same? the numbers written on our account are just fake bitcoins? can they use the bitcoins we send them for their needs?

Now, is there a proper way to know whether that amount in those addresses equals exactly the amount of user's holdings? No, not for most exchanges anyway.So what happens to the FTX exchange that experiences problems like this? I heard that FTX was a big exchange that went bankrupt but I don't know the root of the problem because at the time it happened I wasn't on this forum yet. I was interested in reading the FTX case.",

No, not for most exchanges anyway.As for your second question, then the funds never really sit at the address you send funds to. If you were to try and send BTC to your Binance's address for example, and then recheck that address in a blockexplorer a few minutes or hours later, you will see that the funds were moved (maybe to the exchange's hot wallet, or to another user who requested a withdrawal) and then, if you make a withdrawal request, your funds will come from somewhere else.",

During the time you accumulate 6 satoshis per hour, the number displayed on the screen is fake because no one has enough time and transaction fees to transfer you 6 satoshis per hour. But it would be surprising if OP or someone is still using faucets to accumulate bitcoins these days, which is pointless.",

Could that be true?Exchanges are very funny people because they are always bringing figures that are not in their reach to make people feel that keeping their funds with them is safe, when you will know that it is not true is when that exchange crashes, they wouldn't be able to refund all customers their funds at once. Another way to know is when there is a massive withdrawal from the exchange, you will see that the exchange will now deprive their customers from withdrawing and also place a withdrawal limit on customers so that they wouldn't know the truth. Same with traditional banks, have you ever thought that what id all the customers withdraw all their funds at once, the bank will never accept many withdrawals and they will put a withdrawal limit. This has happened to me and I need the funds for an urgent purpose. Not your keys not your coins. The moment you deposit to an exchange, your coins becomes a business coins, and not yours anymore, it is only when you have withdrawn it that it becomes your again.",

Faucets distribute these small amounts to encourage user engagement and familiarity with cryptocurrencies. The amounts are minimal and might not cover transaction fees for sending. Yet, upon reaching the withdrawal limit, the accumulated amount of Bitcoin will probably combine with other users' amounts to cover the withdrawal transaction fee and then be sent to their respective address.",

So the small amount given by the faucet is fake bitcoin?I think you have found the right logic that the faucet is giving fake btc to your account. This is clear as there is no delay between clicking the “claim” button and the Bitcoins going straight into your account. Even though it is fake bitcoin but when you have lowest withdrawal limit then they will send real bitcoin to your bitcoin address.However, working on this faucet is really a waste of time, in the past I also often visited the frebitxxx you mentioned and played the dice games they provided, but always lost and never made a single withdrawal.",
