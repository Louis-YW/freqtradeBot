The only country that did what I said is El Salvador. Every developing country should focus on Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrencies, they should also focus on AI because these two are the future and there is nothing with as good ROI as investing in future technologies.Btw this profit isn't good enough to have a significant effect on the economy of many countries because for this, they need to invest a significant portion of their budget, which is still risky on a large scale but El Salvador is the winner in this case because they started investing in Bitcoin earlier, when the price was significantly low compared to current price. For the country with a budget of 8.5 Billion USD, 300 million net profit is a very good result.",

Yes that's correct! No one talking much about Bhutan because western media usually ignores such small nations in Asia. Bhutan is a beautiful country and I had a good fortune of visiting their during my childhood. They have availability of abundant hydro power and the government is wise enough to use their extra electricity to mine Bitcoin. This step shows how visionary their government is, similar to El-Salvador. I am sure Bitcoin is going to be a game changer for many countries in 2025. I can already see multiple countries are actively discussing to create a Bitcoin reserve. 2025 might be the year of decentralization.",

Not every third-world country can have a leader like him as most of them are corrupt if they do something like him for their country they will always think first about their benefit and not the country. Bhutan a country ruled by a monarch was reported to be mining Bitcoin using natural energy from 2019. They have never reported how much Bitcoin they have officially but an estimation is that they have BTC12.206 as per this article. I think Bhutan is more profitable if we compare them with El Salvador as they never bought those Bitcoins they mined it using natural energy, and the only investment they made was in setting up the mining rigs.",

Furthermore, around 10 percent of the population is now estimated to be living in extreme poverty compared to just over 5% in 2019....Public debt peaked at 84.9 percent of GDP and sovereign spreads remained high, with limited financing options. Since 2021 authorities have been working on successfully negotiating an IMF program to help address these fiscal challenges.",
