  "content": "Hello everyone.A quick one. There's this project that its liquidity got drained on Wednesday afternoon. The scan shows that it was the contract creator's wallet address that pulled the fund. But they have come out to deny the incident and said they've even launched complaints to Binance team and coin market cap team. But this seem rather untrue. They claimed it was a hack.Has anyone had similar instances. Or could it be a rug pullContract address: https://bscscan.com/token/0xeb9a5cee5ece46338c82bde90af677585ee6f806",

      "body": "1. There is no way \"Binance & Marketcap team\" is hacked the token.2. Could be an inside job.3. The source contract code is from \"Copy-paste\", so the security of the contract is really low and there has some chance the contract has been leaked.4. Buying contact from a third service, and suddenly the contract is getting hacked by the service.But, from all of these points. Nothing surprise is gonna to end to zero, because you are buying a \"meme-token\". Number 2 is already a valid points, they remove the liquidity and exit scam (rugg pull).",
