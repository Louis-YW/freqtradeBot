We don't even have a more or less well-done metaverse yet. I'll just shut up about the decentralized internet. Web3 is probably an interesting topic, but so far it's futuristic.",

However, the technology is here to stay and I think NFTs will find themselves lots of use cases, specifically for investments and entertainment. I have no doubt that all digital assets will be tokenized someday. I think weâ€™re still probably 10-15 years away from that becoming reality though.",

I don't know why people keep believing with BS about web3. lol. that's hilarious to see that. Metaverse is a concept that's going to be big in some form. Technology trying to ride with it however was a bubble as no one seemed to know how to build it or who to build it for. So no one wanted to adopt it. Most of the people don't even understand what the concept is. t might be easier for people who have played online games to understand web3 economy. I think that AR will make it easier to understand but AR tech isn't ready for it yet. But trying to build a some weak dull corporate platform for it and expecting people would join in is just not organic or interesting enough.",

So far, what I can say is about the Metaverse that seems to be done already while Facebook(Meta) launches their project on it but yeah, they're quite late on the party already as the bear market pulled down the trend about it.Quote from: SmokerApeth on January 24, 2023, 02:55:34 PMI think there's enough potential for improvement, what do you think?I think it's very interesting to be able to store something valuable in a digital wallet, such as a meta mask, just like keeping items in my own inventory in a game or cartoon.In every space in the crypto market, everything has the room to be improved but it just so happen that the market isn't focused with what should be improved. Like what you've mentioned, web3 and Metaverse, instead of getting focused on one of it to thrive and then when it's on the top, we can leave it and take time to choose the other one and make it at the top as well. But, it's not doing like that because of the hype that's being created, the highlight that it's getting is too short even if you can see some potential on it.",

Let's not talk about Metaverse.How about VR? the main problem of these sector is the gear to expensive for regular person. They still hard for make a progress, and comparing to Metaverse can they gain a lot user from the migration from Mobile/PC into Metaverse ?",

In 2021, many investors invested in anything that contained the word \"metaverse\" and cunning developers took advantage of it. Not all coins are like that, there are so called blue chips that are constantly developing and have a large community.

Back then projects like Bloktopia and others gave early investors huge profits of x100 or even more. Just take a look at where the price of Bloktopia is at the moment. It went down from close to 0,14$ to now 0,0026$ and that is just one example of a metaverse project, that was massively bloated back then. Metaverse is definitely not dead, but the first big bubble about it is already gone in my opinion.I think web3 is a different topic though, because i think a truly decentralized internet with blockchain functionality involved could really be a big game changer in the space, but i also have to admit that i don't really know how this will work.",

I expect in the next bull run they will get the attention that they need especially with Web3, it will be a big one for sure.",

If the metaverse is the future, then first there must be good secure wallets that cannot be hacked by phishing or virus attacks. There is a lot of speculation on this topic, but I would not buy NFT tokens.",

There are not any devices to enter metaverse anyways (vr devices exist but too simple still in my opinion). I think it will stay popular in crypto world tho.Web3 is nice thing in theory. Decentralized ownage of internet itself can be awesome for users. But when we consider altcoin projects I think its just hype now. I plan to invest in some web3 supported altcoins but I mainly see them speculative.",

This is a very good feature for the future.Also, i believe it is important to keep web3 and metaverse nfts in your metamask wallet, and also keep your seed safe.",

Meta has been developing one and spending billions already and yet there are still no progress and there are a lot of unknowns.So for now we can say that it is hype, not yet a bubble though because we as I have said, there is no model yet. Or if there is one, I don't think it is big enough to be consider a full blown and working metaverse, in my humble opinion.",
