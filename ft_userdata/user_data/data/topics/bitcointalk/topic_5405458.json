  "content": "Crypto mining firm Core Scientific sold over 7,000 Bitcoin in June via the open market to bring its holdings down to about 70% over the previous month.The US-based company said in a public statement on Tuesday that it had roughly raised around $167 million after selling 7,202 BTC at an average price of $23,000. The firm was left with 1,959 BTC and $132 million in cash as of Jun 30 – a drop from 8,058 BTC holdings compared to its 31st May filings.Core Scientific mainly used the proceeds from the sale for ASCI server maintenance, debt repayments, and investments in additional data-center capacity. The company hopes to continue selling BTC gained through mining operations to further fund operations, maintain liquidity, and reduce debts.CEO Mike Levitt said in a statement:“Our industry is enduring tremendous stress as capital markets have weakened, interest rates are rising and the economy deals with historic inflation.”He added:“We are working to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance liquidity to meet this challenging environment, and continue to believe that we will be operating in excess of 30 EH/s in our data centers by year-end 2022.”The firm was able to generate 1,106 Bitcoin in June – roughly 37 Bitcoin a day – exceeding the May outputs by a slight margin. Additional server deployments in June helped it achieve a higher daily output of approximately 14%.Self-mining and crypto mining activities account for 57% of its current data-center capacity of more than 180,000 servers – as of Jun 30. The company is expected to release its earnings for the second quarter on Aug 11.The current market crash has forced several mining firms to liquidate holdings to fund operations. Bitfarms, a Canadian crypto mining firm in June sold 3000 BTC, roughly 47% of its holdings, for $62 million to fulfill working capital requirements.source: https://coinmash.co/core-scientific-sells-over-7k-bitcoin-to-raise-167m/",

      "body": "I can't decide if this is bullish or bearish news (it feels quite neutral). A mining farm raising capital to pay for its facility makes sense and the huge amount of goat the market has been able to absorb is also quite impressive imo. It'd make sense for miners to have a figure at which they need to sell their reserves to pay for everything too.",

      "body": "one thing i am noticing latelythese mining farms usually sell 'off-market' via private deals on OTC platforms. but this last month or two there are less whales on OTC platforms buying privately, which has made some farms have to sell on the public market. asic farms have and do sell regularly but usually its not seen on the public market. apart from a couple times in the last couple months it has been more noticeable that they are now selling on the public marketas for how to interpret the wording of this topics message, my opinion..yes this topic is talking about their usual activity, selling coin to pay:electric, (biasedly worded as 'debt'.. funnily enough when we all get electric bills in the post we all owe the electric company)salaries,(biasedly worded as 'debt'.. funnily enough at the end of the month companies do owe employees a wage)paying off asics(biasedly worded as 'debt'.. funnily enough when pre-ordering asics with a deposit, near delivery time they owe the remainder)point isthey are buying more asics and more facilities so they are bullish to stay in mining, and expanding. nothing in the topic message says they are selling asics and shutting down..some math for interest.. electric is about ~20% of a 'coin' value (based on maths i done on many things in the past topics. rest of coin costs is the more physical costs of hardware and facilities spread out over time and per coin)(below is not accurate, but using the assumptions of the content of this topics post)based on the '180,000 server' statement (meaning 180k asics) if using the 2021 gen asics of 110thash would put them at 19.2exa. meaning if they are buying 2022 batch asics of say the 140thash and wanting to achieve 30exathats 10.8exa  (10.8m /140=77143)77143 asics being purchased this year. and at a price of $11.6k eachwould be nearly $900m if all paid in one lump. (~$150m per month over 6 months)so 'needing' only $167m this month is like paying off that order at a monthly amount spread over 6 monthswhere by it also shows they are paying off a few months of electric contract..so i dont see it as them owing any large multimillion 'loan' debt.. its instead just the cost of doing business amounts.. of paying their monthly bills",
