There could be some global news or event that could highly affect the price of bitcoin. I don’t think it’s accurately possible that the same rate of people buying will stay constant for a long period of time.I have no doubts however that the price will be incredibly high post-halving but I’m not very convinced that there will be no correction anymore.",

Short terms BTC buyers aren't actual HODLers and you shouldn't call them HODLers.The pace of buying can't continue \"at the same price\" because the price won't be the same. Some BTC buyers might be willing to buy at levels above sixty thousand dollars, while other buyers might be waiting for price drops, in order to buy at a lower price. If the price grows above 70K USD, some of the buyers might get discouraged by the high price. I'm sure that there will be FUD news and panic selling in the next few months, so the rapid growth shown on this chart won't be sustainable. The real bull run should start at the end of 2024.",

In the last few months the price of Bitcoin has been relatively higher in buying than selling and the price has increased due to which investors have regularly bought Bitcoin in the last few months. But if Bitcoin were to halve its value right now, there are many investors who would sell their Bitcoins instead of buying them. But whenever investors sell their bitcoins instead of buying them, the price of bitcoins will keep dumping again. But if the investors continue their buying during this season of halving then the price can recover but every investor usually refrains from investing in Bitcoin with large amount of money during this season.",

If you have been around crypto for a very long time you should not worry about someone dumping a huge bag, its been happening since the first day of Bitcoin, this won't stop a new all time high from happening, it is always a matter of time..",

This can give you a clue as when to start taking profit or not. It's not accurate though, since there's some long-term hodlers that are also buying at the same time as those short-term hodlers, in fact this demand graph isn't the best one to use if we want to measure the growth or potential of bitcoin in the near future. Regarding long-term hodlers selling during dips, wouldn't that be the wrong way around to sell their stash of bitcoins since they're going to be selling at loss if not maximized profits? Maybe during the ATH, that can be a good indicator to sell bitcoin since that's what you should do, that's why we got whale alerts right?",

But the function of retail Bitcoin holders also influences the continuity of Bitcoin, because they are the spearhead that can bring people who don't know about Bitcoin to try buying and selling Bitcoin.If everyone chooses to invest in long-term Bitcoin, of course buying and selling activities will not occur every second. Instead, they only buy Bitcoin and continue to accumulate it until the investor's target is achieved, which could be decades away or at least until the next halving period.",

Since the ETF approval on January 10 the nine institutions have been continuously stacking up bitcoin with the overall bitcoin bought within this time has been reported to be more than 900,000 bitcoin (~$60B), which shows that within this short period of time they Have definitely bought more than half of the 1.8 million reported. The only investor reported to be selling during this correction time is Gary scale. So I also think they are the investors influencing this correlation, even bitcoin hitting a new ATH right before halving which is the first time definitely makes it clear.",

I understand that inexperienced people have many uncertainty and they can feel fearful with many things. This one is one of their wrong thinking and bad fear on things which are not too much important.If they zoom out and discover that long term investors get very high ROI with investment in Bitcoin and holding it for years [1], they will no longer be fearful with short term holders.[1] https://casebitcoin.com/charts",
