Posts that were often deleted were worth it to be deleted has been what I know about this forum since I joined. I will also advice him that if posts are often deleted like that, he should have more quality ways of posting which I think would be this thread conclusion.",

If plenty people reported a post to be spam, moderators will still check it the post, that is there work. But maybe they may not check it thoroughly as usual if more of the same person posts are reported over and over again by several people. If more are deleted, that would result to temporarily ban. Moderators because of that are handling reported posts carefully.

If plenty people reported a post to be spam, moderators will still check it the post, that is there work.Of course i have been here long enough to know that moderators do check posts before deleting or not, that is the only way they'd know how to handle the case/report, my post was in response to @len01 who asked why mods wouldn't just delete all his poor quality posts at one go, thus the reply that mods wouldn't just start going through all his post history; but would most likely take a look at the very one that was reported by a certain user as spam and delete it.Quote from: Minecache on October 31, 2022, 05:36:05 PMIf so, then if I do not make a new post, why is the old post not being deleted?Prolly no user made a new report against any of your posts they thought as low quality during that period.Quote from: Minecache on October 31, 2022, 05:36:05 PMAlso, I don't make more than 4/5 posts daily, so how can it count as spam!I don't think you quite understand how things work here, you are relating signature campaign rules with the forum. Spam has nothing to do with how many posts you make in a day, spam posts are posts considered to be of low quality and worthy of deletion, you could even be inactive and haven't made any posts in months and your post can be deleted, prolly because someone spotted it as spam and reported it.Quote from: Minecache on October 31, 2022, 05:36:05 PMIt seems the posts are being deleted by an automated botMods delete posts and not bots, and the mods are normal users you get to interact with on the forum.",
