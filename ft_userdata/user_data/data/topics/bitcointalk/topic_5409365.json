  "content": "Lately, a number of topics have started to pop up,1,2 with users really questioning if Bitcoin has shifted its role (for some), and rather than a hedge against inflation it has become something completely different, and I'm thinking that there is general shift in this direction.Today was the most awaited day of the week for all traders as inflation numbers were to be published and even crypto traders and crypto blogs seemed to echo one thing, lower inflation is going to be good for bitcoin price.QuoteCovering July, the data was due at 8.30am Eastern time Aug. 10, with expectations demanding it show that U.S. inflation had already peaked.“CPI prints have been pretty pitoval for BTC price action,” Blockware lead insights analyst William Clemente wrote in part of a tweet about the event, adding that CPI would form a “big day” for crypto.QuoteShould the CPI rise above the consensus expectation for an 8.7% increase, assets on traditional and digital markets will likely fall in price on expectations of another interest rate increase after September’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.And the outcome of the announcement that rampant inflation has indeed cooled off, withQuote\"The Consumer Price Index climbed 8.5 percent in the year through July, compared with 9.1 percent the prior month, a bigger slowdown than economists had projected. \" well, bitcoin didn't disappoint:Let's not even try to think this was a coincidence, the spike was like ~3 minutes from the CPI number release, no, not even a chance of being something else, and the only news about crypto in the papers is that Coinbase has lost a billion last quarter, which I wouldn't call positive.So, at this point, can we start thinking that, looking alone at the price and not usage or adoption or anything else, a good economy with lower inflation and constant economic growth is far better than the recessions, bloodbaths, economical wars that were supposed to bring the price to 1 million a piece since every starved jobless zombie would buy coins?",

People won't buy bitcoins if they don't have money for food and rent, and the whole idea that somehow millions of users that have no power and no bank account will be able to invest enough just to balance the daily mined coins iswell too far fetched.Quote from: fzkto on August 10, 2022, 03:13:28 PMBitcoin moves with the other major indices.

Your money would have done a lot better than protect against inflation.I will never say that bitcoin is not a hedge against inflation, even if bitcoin would be dropping in price for a while it will still long-term beat any inflation unless something of catastrophic magnitudes happens. I've amended the title to high to enforce a bit what I was trying to say, if you look just at the price and not correlate that with purchasing power it's clear that it will not grow fantastically in a period of prolonged inflation, it will be able to keep on top looking at the rates but nothing spectacular.One thing, let's not say 2009!

      "body": "The first mistake people make is assuming that Bitcoin was ever a hedge against inflation, as it never has actually done this, only in a theoretical sense based on it's regulated inflation. How can an asset be proven be to a good hedge against (high) inflation in practice when there hasn't been high inflation during it's existence until now? The theory is solid, but the reality remains to be seen.Bitcoin has never existed (until now) in a period of high inflation or recession. To me the idea is that long-term Bitcoin will become a hedge against inflation, but while it's value is less than $1 trillion and therefore can't realistically be considered a reserve asset or store of value by most, that time is still far away. Bitcoin has only existed during increases in speculative markets, since the 2008 global recession.Bare in mind that when high CPI numbers were previously announced on July 13th, considered bearish, Bitcoin rallied +20% from the lows within a week. Now lower CPI numbers have been announced, and Bitcoin has rallied from support levels. What's becoming clear is that Bitcoin cares much less about CPI numbers or inflation than many would like to believe, as price has since increased regardless.I also think it's too early to tell if Bitcoin will be a good hedge against inflation in this period. For example after the dotcom bubble finally popped in March 2000, Gold didn't increase in value, but instead continued to lose value for another year. It was only until March 2021 that price bottomed out as S&P/Nasdaq continued to decline. It took until half of that bubble had popped before Gold became a hedge basically.",

Speculation. Even though I (and millions of others) experience high gains, and therefore does fit the \"inflation hedge\" category for us, it doesn't mean it does for those who bought recently. I just think of it like this:Bitcoin has better characteristics than gold, to be considered as a store of value.Bitcoin can hardly be confiscated, opposed to every other asset. This can attract institutions and individuals in a world war scenario and/or other totalitarian treatments.Cash will go extinct, sooner or later. Bitcoin can't just disappear like that. It might be the only cash available in the future.The supply is non-negotiable. It can't be altered. Inflation rate is steady. Try finding another asset with such probable supply schedule.For these reasons, I strongly believe it has a bright future, and is potentially an inflation hedge in the long-term.",

      "body": "There are many forces that drive bitcoin price. X% of investors treat it like speculative asset (first to dump during bad times, first to buy when things starts to looks good) Y% of investors treat it like safe haven/digital gold and DCA all the time or do \"buy the dip\". Z% do have different approach. XYZ varies depending on the bitcoin adoption, market cycles and many more. The fact that after inflation data announcement bitcoin pump (just like every single asset) only proves that we have X investors here that dominated this trading hour because they were motivated to buy just after first positive inflation announcement. It does not invalidate the fact that we have Y or Z investors that still do their investments based on other criteria. They were not on the market during this 1h pump because they don't do financial decisions based on short term data that might be manipulated because of upcoming election. They belive in long term bitcoin advantage over any other asset. X is responsible for short term price action, Y is responsible for long trends (years/decades) because they continue to accumulate limiting available supply.Why X investors bought bitcoin after good inflation data combined with reduced unemployment? Because they calculate in the fact that we will come back to printing (aka devaluating fiats in long term) sooner than later.Quote from: stompix on August 10, 2022, 12:59:55 PMSo, at this point, can we start thinking that, looking alone at the price and not usage or adoption or anything else, a good economy with lower inflation and constant economic growth is far better than the recessions, bloodbaths, economical wars that were supposed to bring the price to 1 million a piece since every starved jobless zombie would buy coins?Bitcoin was never a recession/depression/stagflation hedge.

Meaning, bitcoin may get hurt, but we are all equally hurt here, whereas in the banking world, banks are not hurt, but you are. Just look at 2008, there was a house and mortgage bubble, right?Well, those banks got bailed out, meaning if you didn't pay your mortgage, they were hurt, and took the home from you, and they were bailed by the government and KEPT the house, whereas you just lost.

On the other hand, Bitcoin's volatility has always been present. Whether Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation or not is not about its market cap.

But what stompix points out makes sense, as it was a common thought that scenarios like this year, and more so given all that has been printed in the last two years, were going to drive the price into the stratosphere. Recall the predictions that were being made last year, before the war broke out, about ATH for this cycle, which were much higher than what actually happened. Would Bitcoin have a higher price if there were no war and no inflation? I think so, among other things because some of the money that people spend because of higher prices due to inflation could be invested. So, one has to ask whether once the Bitcoin market has matured, and has a decent market cap, whether the returns are going to be lower going forward in percentage terms, which is quite likely, and whether there will be other assets that are better against inflation, such as real estate in good locations bought at a good price. I believe that in view of this we can only observe and draw conclusions in the light of events.",
