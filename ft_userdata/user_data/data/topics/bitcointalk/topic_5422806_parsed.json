You will have to interact with various smart contracts, as a result of a hack or mistake, you can lose all your coins. Take care of your main wallet.It is effective enough to protect the coins that you have, making the main wallet is indeed very important to maintain the security of the investment funds that we have, especially if you always follow airdrops events that are carried out by new networks, it is highly recommended to divide the main wallet and the wallet that receives rewards from events.",
