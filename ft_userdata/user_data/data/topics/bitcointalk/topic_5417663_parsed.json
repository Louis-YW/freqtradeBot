In this way, your word is against his, and even if you post credible evidence, you should know that the scam on the forum is not moderated. However, if you provide evidence, the user may receive negative feedback or a flag may be created that will serve as a warning to other forum users.Trading with accounts that have no reputation and without escrow is a big risk, remember that for the future.",

Tagging him is not going to make him lose anything. He will create another account, change skype ID and telegram name to scam another person. Besides there are no evidence has shown too. As suggested by others, if you can bring evidence to back your accusation then others can make a justification, otherwise it's not worth to pay attention.Yeah, use escrow for any sort of p2p trade unless you have prior business experience with someone.",

This kind of mindset won't hurt anyone, but maybe the OP is a little greedy because he failed to verify the seller is trustworthy or not. Really, StormeriL's trust page shows he's not a trustworthy user, and if the OP had noticed then he would probably have avoided trusting him with money.Trust Summary for StormeriLBut I hope this will be a good lesson for the OP if he wants to trade with other people in the future. Use escrow, it's always recommended if you don't trust any user.",
