  "content": "Technology: Technology is pivotal in determining a project's progress. New blockchain projects or enhancements to existing platforms like Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) attract attention. However, it's crucial to remember that technology alone doesn't guarantee success; thorough research on a project's technology is vital.Tokenomics: Tokenomics encompasses economic factors tied to a project's coin or token. Factors such as total supply, token utility, unlocking schedule, allocation, and decentralization matter. Projects with appealing tokenomics can offer stability and potential coin appreciation.Market Capitalization: Evaluating market capitalization gauges a cryptocurrency's size and value. Larger market cap coins often boast reputation and liquidity but may grow slower. Conversely, smaller market cap coins can yield higher price appreciation with added risks. Market cap aids in accurately assessing whether a coin's price is reasonable.Utility and Application: A project's real-world application is vital. This involves its focus area and target user base. Low utility can lead to loss of value due to user disinterest. Decentralized finance, NFTs, gaming, and metaverse are practical applications.Development Team: A strong development team is pivotal. Their expertise, experience, and vision matter. A reliable team committed for the long term increases chances of future success.Collaboration and Partnerships: Partnering with other entities can benefit a project. It can involve technology advancement, user network expansion, or new app creation. Positive partnerships enhance success and reach.Competition and Industry Position: Assessing industry position gauges competitiveness and growth potential. Analyzing competition, differentiation, and project advantages offer insights into market entry and user attraction.Social Engagement and Community: An active, supportive community aids a project's acceptance. Participation, social media, and events contribute. A strong community enhances coin value and development.",

      "body": "I take only the advisor behind the project. This matter a lot for the project. I don't care so much about tokenomics or something else. I fully care about who is VC that already backed the project. This will help to build the hype. Tech doesn't matter a lot these days as so many new projects were just imitating the old project with new brand. It's a common thing in the crypto. IMO, so many matrics were useless when determining the potential project. Just stick into the project that is backed by binance. Easy huge roi as long as you will able to buy at the bottom.
