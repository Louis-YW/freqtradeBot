  "content": "If you are living in Ireland you should have known that Ireland Is About to Introduce Its First-Ever Gambling Regulation Bill.  This has been drafted and created due to the alarming number of citizens getting addicted to gambling.  IN SUMMARY:New gambling legislation and a new national regulator are on their wayThe new bill seeks to regulate advertisements and sponsorships in addition to core betting activitiesThe initiative is meant to help prevent problem gamingA little background on the Gambling Regulation Bill[1]:QuoteEarlier in 2021 the Department of Justice outlined its targeted timeframe for the reform of Irish gambling law and the establishment of the Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland (the Authority) in its 'Justice Plan 2021' and its 'Statement of Strategy 2021-2023'.The Justice Plan envisaged that a fully independent Director / CEO of the new statutory gambling regulatory authority would be established by Q4 2021.  Although the timelines in the Justice Plan have not been fully adhered to, the Department of Justice is taking steps towards the Authority becoming operational and recently published an advertisement on 25 February 2022 seeking candidates for appointment to the role of CEO to establish and lead the new Authority.If anyone is interested you can find the presentation of the proposed bill here: General Scheme of Gambling Regulation Bill and the pdf copy here.Among the proposed presentation here is the summary of steps the proposed Gambling Regulation Bill is implementing regarding how to solve the increasing Gambling Problem.Part 5 - Safeguards, Advertising, Sponsorship and Social Impact Fund[2]QuoteThe Authority will have the ability to address advertisement of gambling across all forms of media, as well as addressing the issue of sponsorship by gambling companies.The approach here importantly reflects that the Authority cannot address all these issues in isolation or unilaterally, and recognises the importance of cooperation between all bodies with responsibility for advertising, as well as the importance of consultation with concerned stakeholders.The Authority will be empowered to issue codes, tied to enforceable sanctions for breach of terms and conditions of a licence, to address advertising, and to regulate promotions and sponsorship by licence holders. This approach will provide the Authority with greater flexibility in addressing current concerns and future developments. Some of these measures to be included in the codes are:the times and frequency which gambling advertising can appear on television, radio, and other media platforms each daya prohibition on the use of children or elements which may appeal to children in advertisementsEqually as important, Part 5 also includes measures and safeguards to address problem gambling, the protection of children, to ensure public safety and well-being, and consumer protection including:prohibitions on the offer of inducements such as free bets, VIP or preferential treatmentprohibitions on the offer of credit or credit facilities to playersspending limits where practicablerestricting payment methods (such as credit cards)requirements around warnings and messagingprohibiting children from gambling and employing children in connection with gambling servicesIn addition, this Part will also establish a Social Impact Fund for the purposes of financing research and information, education and awareness raising measures, and appropriately supporting problem gambling treatment activities by relevant health professionalsRead more on page 172 of the General Scheme of the Gambling Regulation Bill pdf.To Discuss:It is notable that part 5 of the said bill is all about mitigating problem gambling and protecting minors against gambling exposure.  If you are to evaluate the plans stated in Part 5 of the bill, will it be effective in the mitigation of the Gambling Problem? Will it effectively protect minors from the influence of the gambling environment?Source:[1] https://www.algoodbody.com/insights-publications/gambling-regulatory-authority-of-ireland-a-step-closer[2] https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/426dd-minister-browne-publishes-general-scheme-of-gambling-regulation-bill/#",

The campaign should include students from elementary to college.  If it is possible it is best to create a curriculum about gambling awareness and discuss the matter of gambling addiction.  Nothing beats implanting knowledge specially at a very young age.",

I think every country can do better apart from passing bills to stop or reduce youth from gambling by creating more jobs and giving the younger ones good orientation about the bad effect of gambling I believe that's when the bills will stand strong.",

The estimated population in Ireland puts them at just about five million people in the country. It will be devastating even to the country if more than half of its entire population old and young become problem gamblers. Problem gambling can prompt many criminal behaviors especially in minors. In addition to the regulation they are about putting in place, the government can also look into establishing rehabilitation centers for those who are already problem gamblers, especially the minors.Hopefully other countries should emulate this strategy as well to ensure that they tackle the issues of minors involved in gambling and to enforce responsible gambling in adults as well.",

Therefore, the law or bill will be effective in two ways. One is on the part of the gambling houses or casino to checkmate them on disallowing minors from playing. Also to the parents, to activate parental guidance for their children. Laws are sure a good step to direct citizens on their rights and limit to same right. In Nigeria for now, the government is nonchalant about the gambling industry and you see minors having freedom to do as they wish both online or real life gambling.",

I don't know if that is guaranteed but pretty sure it will help lessen or mitigate the problems of minors being involved on the said activity because the lists are quite good and I can see there that they focus mainly on reducing or totally cutting the credit/debit card as a source of payment because they are also aware that it is the root cause on why a minor can gamble because they can just steal it secretly fro their parents.Not only in gambling actually but there are reports where minors also use their parents' cards to purchase items from their video games or on those so-called loot boxes.",
