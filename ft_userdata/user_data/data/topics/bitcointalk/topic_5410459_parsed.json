Add in the deepening widespread drought, a shortage of hay and feed, skyrocketing prices, transport costs, and various other metrics, some Southwest Oklahoma beef producers suggest cheap ground beef could eventually top $50 per pound....\"https://z94.com/oklahoma-beef-prices/",

Can't control the weather, but you can control transport costs and make harvesting cheaper. This isn't an issue in the NA region -- any country with high energy costs are going to not be able to afford food soon if the trends keep up. Meat's going to be a luxury item.",

The western world is largely obese, wastes a fair portion of the food that it produces and yet tens of thousands can still die from famine every day. If the energy costs associated with distribution goes up then so do food prices. Poor countries are the first to suffer famines. Developed countries have enough funds to to cover the higher food costs so they'll be fine, hopefully.",
