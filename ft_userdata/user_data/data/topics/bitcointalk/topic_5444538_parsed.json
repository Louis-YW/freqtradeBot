First study bitcoin to know what it is and make a reasoned decision on whether to buy it.Specifically on stablecoins, I would add to what the colleague said that they are especially targeted by the authorities, as they are in direct competition with fiat and CBDCs. I believe that in the future there will be no stablecoins apart from CBDCs or they will be of residual use. Seeing what has happened to several stablecoins recently, I don't think it is worth using them to try to avoid volatility. If you buy bitcoin you already know it is volatile, and it is better not to do short term trading, as being a newbie you are likely to lose money.",

In that case, grab the trunk-looking organ under my belt and pull it a bit to get your reward you low-life governmental ass juice.

Thanks for sharing this for us. (Especially) the stable coins that were/are pegged to fiat were not really meant for holding. They were the tool for arbitraging and not much more, because they historically pretty much always had trust (and proper backing) related issues. One big point of crypto should be to trust math, not people (nor businesses); stable coins don't follow that.So it's not that much about \"careful of holding any stable coin again\", it's more about being careful about holding stable coins at all.",

Almost every altcoin has USDt trading pairs, and I see that USD, EUR, and YEN are fiat that can stay stable with full trust better than some stable coins because if there is any threat or serious issue in the market that concerns the price of fiat, there are usually news stories to warn people, but most stable coins can just get a threat and decide to block or disable the withdrawal of the intended stable coins. Instead of conversing with any random stable coin, it is better to convert to Fiats, you can convert to fait without withdrawing.QuoteA stable coin enables crypto investors to convert their coins into dollars without the bothering of withdrawing in FIAT currency form.

The word \"stable\" is perhaps one of the biggest hoaxes when it comes to cryptocurrencies, and there's no doubt that it was sold very well by people who literally made their own currencies out of nothing. If you look at the statements of powerful politicians in the US and the EU, to all of them stablecoins are a far greater threat than Bitcoin and all those tens of thousands of altcoins.After that whole circus with Terra/Luna, I really thought that people would wise up and move away from stablecoins, but it seems that the exact opposite is happening.Quote from: Pmalek on March 12, 2023, 09:55:06 AM~snip~For example, You are wearing a signature under you name.

However, if someone decided to seriously consider the guys behind USDT, we are talking about the current value of over $72 billion tokens, for which no one can say with certainty whether they are backed by anything, least of all USD.

If something hasn't changed, then it's exactly as @Pmalek confirmed. As far as I know, if you are employed, what you get from signature campaigns should be declared as other income and reported every time you receive a payment.
