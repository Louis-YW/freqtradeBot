Few days back they officially announced their airdrops claiming and after that few exchanges announces their listing on 23rd including top tier 1 exchange like Binance, Kucoin and many more. Some have been speculating its price to $5 to $10 or even more. But what Ive see on twitter that there are already some buying with $1 otc of that and seen firsthand the transactions since some of my known friends sold their drop.Any thoughts on this project? Seems 23rd of March is gonna be interesting day for airdroppers. Have some of you got the drop?",

Well, those that have got a lot from this airdrop means congratulations to them and that's one of the best things that has ever happened to them. But I want to tell them that they should learn from other airdrops because they'll never know if the hype stays longer for ARB because if not and they didn't managed to sell during its launch, they might miss all of those opportunities as drop and its value could potentially be lower because of what's being awaited coming from all of the airdrop recipients. It's typical that everyone will dump it.",

But I am planning to buy Arbitrum when it dips and then hold it for the coming big bull run next year or 2025. A few days ago I saw a post about ARB IOU which was about $10+ and then today I checked it was $11+. I expect it to go down though as pretty sure many will dump their free holdings once listed especially on Binance. My personal assessment of its price is $1 to $2 or even more when the bull run comes to play. So my target is to buy as cheaply as possible from these dumpers.",

And here I think it will go straight to the top10 cmc, and depending on the exchange or the winner of the airdrop claim and sell them high to low and at the $1 threshold there will be a lot of buyers.I think we will enjoy the comfort of this event, and I think after ARB will have L1 announce mainnet and airdrop in the near future.

Just don't use your money to buy Arbitrum and join the early hype wave as it is very risky. I believe after early pumps, selling pressure will be very high and don't put yourself as one of victims of Arbitrum dumps.Think why did they do airdrop?To make noise and to create hype.",

Seems 23rd of March is gonna be interesting day for airdroppers. Have some of you got the drop? Obviously i also noticed all the hype and news that are surrounding Arbitrum at the moment, as it is pretty hard to not notice any of it. The reason for that is quite obvious. All the people that are tweeting about Arbitrum now and how good it is and how great the token will perform once it is released are all people that are eligible for the airdrop, so obviously they are trying to support their own bags as good as possible so they can sell off their airdrop bag for a nice profit. That is just part of the game and i don't have a problem with that.What i dislike are those airdrop farmers. If you look at those OTC channels on telegram then there are people that have 50k+ Arb tokens to sell. Those people have 50x more token than the average user. They are playing the system and stuff like that should be banned.",

So I can only wait and see how the token price of this project will be in the next few months.Of course brother it is important to exercise caution when it comes to investing in any cryptocurrency project, especially one that has seen a recent surge in hype and attention. While Arbitrum does have the potential for growth in the future, there is no guarantee that it will continue to rise in value or maintain its current position in the market.As you mentioned, it's not uncommon for the price of a token to experience significant fluctuations, especially following a period of hype and speculation. It's possible that the price may drop as early investors and airdrop recipients sell off their tokens, and there may also be external factors that can affect the value of the token in the market.",

But if the project has some real developers that are ready for such scenarios, it won't really affect the progress of the project and it will proceed and surely the price will recover and even rise after the investors see that they are doing some major developments and updates to keep their platform alive in the crypto market.",
