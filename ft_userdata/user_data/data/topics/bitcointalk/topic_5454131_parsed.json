Which makes them curious already about it since saving money is already related to Bitcoin. Since in Bitcoin there's also money involved which is already a good thing, imagine they grow whenever they tried to save they would have this image of Bitcoin. It might not have a huge effect but it's better than nothing, OP's effort is already commendable as his methods of introducing BTC involves money and teach them to save money. This way also doesn't even force them to learn Bitcoin it's like it has been introduced to children so it's up to them whether those children do their own research soon which will be their advantage in the future.",

I have seen instances where people try to save money in piggy banks, so they come up with a saving plan but lack the discipline to see it happen. Few months into the savings they break open the bank, take the savings and use it for whatever purpose they want to use it for. The chances of people seeing this through to the end and finally using the saving proceeds to invest in bitcoin is very slim.",

It’d make a little more impact imo.Nice incentive but I think it doesn’t help children that much right now. Children won’t think about saving for BTC. They’ll think about candies, a new skateboard or a new phone for gaming. If you want something that attracts children more, you’d probably need some text like:“Keep the money, you get less than a gameBuy a game, you end up with a gameBuy Bitcoin, you end up with more games”Just my opinion tho!",

By incorporating the BTC print on the piggy bank, the initiative aims to encourage saving and investment specifically in BTC.
