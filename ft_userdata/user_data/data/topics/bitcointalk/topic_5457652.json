So, I think, for most traders transaction fees dont matter at all (except for those who use BTC as a currency). The other problem is adoption level. High transaction fees hamper adoption rate, so the only way to get a higher adoption level is to make fees affordable.",

As a merchant you're in business to make profit and not to 'lose', so a general answer is to do whatever works for you and will make you revenue.If there is no way you can make revenue now through accepting payments in BTC, then you should stop it temporarily. I assume most of your customers themselves wouldn't want to pay in BTC because of the high tx fee that also affects them. If there are customers still willing to pay through BTC, then they have to pay a certain percent higher because of the high fees, or you accept the payment through a payment processor.",

Only in some moments, the Bitcoin transaction fee is high when the network is congested, but when the network is normal the fee is quite cheap.For small sales payments, isn't there already a Bitcoin Lightning network and it will certainly be more efficient and faster? The Bitcoin Lightning network provides faster transaction services and is very suitable for small transactions because of the low cost. Bitcoin is indeed an optional payment in countries that have adopted Bitcoin, but countries that prohibit it will certainly not have a Bitcoin option.",

If you sell goods, it would be the buyer who would get hit by high tx fees, not necessarily you. So why would you drop selling any low value items? If customers are happy to buy them regardless of the extra costs, let them. On your end, you should make it easier for them to accept payments via lightning network.Even if you're acting as an intermediary, and have to make purchases with BTC and pay fees, you could still ask/pressure sellers to start accepting LN payments, it's in their best interest so shouldn't be that hard.",

      "body": "What's the point of thinking about how much money is to be spent if you have a chance of avoiding those fees?As a businessperson, customer satisfaction is always a top priority, but that does not mean you should be running on empty just to satisfy your customers. If the fees for payment are really huge and if you want those fees to be deducted from your side, this should be based on the amount of goods purchased by the customer. If the total purchase is calculated and profit from the cost of goods is deducted, will your profit from the goods be enough to cover up the transaction fee? If it's not enough, I will advise not to engage in such a transaction because you will be running a business with losses instead of making profit.If payment with Bitcoin is very important to you, then I will suggest some kind of centralized system, which is not that advisable, but to some point it is cheaper since you can use an in-chain transfer option, and when you have received enough payment from your customers to cover up your transaction fee, then you can withdraw back to your self-custodial wallet, where you can have total control over the coin. This could be a little way of reducing transaction fees, but it's not the safest.",

In my country, merchants can accept payments for free just by using a service called UPI. After the launch of UPI, both Visa and MasterCard are seeing a huge decline in their card services and transaction volumes. They used to take 2.1% transaction fees plus 18% tax on that fees amount. With UPI, it has become free. So when it comes to accepting payment, I am personally not ready to pay fees because of the available option. The world will slowly move to UPI infrastructure. 8 countries have already been onboarded and Japan is the latest addition. Bitcoin and cryptos can't compete.",

It's because with LN, transactions can be sent without incurring high fees, which is important considering Bitcoin's current high fees. Otherwise it might not be very profitable for businesses as far as I know.There are several alternative ways to handle this situation.

If I say 10% or 20% here, it doesn't mean anything. You need to do this calculation in order to maximize your profit by creating the income and expense balance yourself.What I don't understand is that your only loss is the fee you pay when converting crypto into your local currency. If you want to tell that you have paid this fee every time, you can start withdrawing your money on a weekly or monthly basis. You convert more volumes of money at once.",

If your business is a local business type than you should use fiat for that purpose because you won't lose anything in fees, however if you business is worldwide then you can use other crypto-currencies as payment method. In such case LTC is preferable because its fees are quite low and can be a useful option in current times. I often prefer LTC for transactions that are of low value, for example I prefer LTC over BTC for transactions below $10, and I'm quite sure that many others are also doing the same.",
