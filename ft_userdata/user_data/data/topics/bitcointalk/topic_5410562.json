  "content": "As people stay long in this forum, there is this level of anxiousness they develop. Some newbies look back, in retrospect on their time spent in this forum, and they feel like they have been wasting away their time.Could this be the reason someone asked me during my crypto lecture: \"for how long you have stayed in this forum, you have nothing to boast of, how are you feeling Like being a member of the Btt forum?\"I chuckled. The question was funny to me. The only answer I gave was:\"At least, I have acquired enough information in crypto and the forum also. At least nobody will see me as a newbie in the forum again.\" We laughed over it. But then, I knew why the such question was asked. Some might be thinking that this forum is a get-rich scheme. Others, once you understand crypto, you will be rich and have bitcoin and other altcoins in your portfolio.There is a lot of pressure some folks mount on themselves when they enter crypto. I can understand the issue, but, let's talk about reality.We all know that crypto and the Btt forum don't promise riches if you join or get ranked up easily. Crypto requires more intelligence and DYOR.By 2024, it will be a bull season, how prepared are you?Before the year 2024, I plan to re-strategize to create enough awareness for crypto in my society, create an enabling ground for lectures and solve some problems. Before then, I will keep developing myself intellectually and growing. With the efforts, I have made, if, in a working society, I know what the result could be.Investing in crypto comes with a little ease when you remember you securing your future indirectly. Just invest with the amount you can afford to lose and leave the rest as too much pressure to invest big in a coin can be bad.I am just having a retrospect as to why people pressure themselves too much to invest big in crypto.As for me, I invest when I see a potential coin, invest with my spare money though. Being over-anxious has never solved any problem rather it leads you to invest wrongly.",

The newcomers that join during bull markets might leave fairly quickly once the bear season returns.I joined mid bear market from learning about the technology which is probably a good way to get people (if they're already interested in things technology related).To do well here and then transfer it to other areas you do need a lot of information and must have acquired most of it already. Altcoins aren't the worst investments when bitcoin's down but there is a new development over the next few months to be cautious off if you hold a lot of alts (eth 2.0).",

Crypto requires more intelligence and DYOR.By 2024, it will be a bull season, how prepared are you?Best you don't promise anybody anything as the cryptocurrency market is very unpredictable. You can only speculate but can't get it accurately. The only certain thing happening in 2024 is that Bitcoin miners reward will be halved and as a result there'll be less supply of Bitcoin circulating the market and If the demand for Bitcoin stays the same or increases, it'll drive up the price of Bitcoin. As for altcoins nothing is certain, we might have a bull run for them in 2024, before then or never, nobody can assure you that, so it's best you trade with caution.  In 2021 speculators thought we'll see another bull run for Alts as we did back in 2017 but that didn't happen because altcoins already rally before their expected timeframe. Currently majority of the altcoins are down 90+ percent, them just going back to their all time high is already a miracle (rally) so don't be over expectant of more gains to come after that (which people consider the altcoin rally).",

Maybe it's comforting that someone sticks to the strategy \"I only invest as much as I'm afford to lose\", but it still doesn't make much sense to me.",
