I checked theirs website and found that they offering daily 1%, 4% and 10% with principle back guarantee. They claiming automated bot system but there is no details of their team and Whitepaper So that they can be believed. Many Users told this user that the project he promoting is ponzi but he has not deleted his post.

Do not think that everyone is naive and will believe your lies. We know very well that you are trying to hide behind the name of trading bots that claim that they will help Beginner traders. Trading bots are developed by companies that have a reputation and popularity and have legit and not anonymous teams. You should know that legit trading bots are useful tools that help users execute deals that do not have time to analyze the crypto market themselves but do not guarantee unrealistic and fixed returns. You would like people to try a dollar, okay? This is not proof of the legality of your project. People's funds will accumulate with you, and you will disappear with people's funds in a blink of an eye.",
