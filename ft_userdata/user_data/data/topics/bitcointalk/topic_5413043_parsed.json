  "content": "The trading is done in the Binance market platform, which of course, does not have markets for every altcoin pair. The workaround for this is to use a bridge currency that will complement missing pairs. The default bridge currency is Tether (USDT), which is stable by design and compatible with nearly every coin on the platform.Coin A → USDT → Coin BThe way the bot takes advantage of the observed behaviour is to always downgrade from the \"strong\" coin to the \"weak\" coin, under the assumption that at some point the tables will turn. It will then return to the original coin, ultimately holding more of it than it did originally. This is done while taking into consideration the trading fees.Coin A → USDT → Coin BCoin B → USDT → Coin C...Coin C → USDT → Coin AThe bot jumps between a configured set of coins on the condition that it does not return to a coin unless it is profitable in respect to the amount held last. This means that we will never end up having less of a certain coin. The risk is that one of the coins may freefall relative to the others all of a sudden, attracting our reverse greedy algorithm.DownloadLink: https://anonfiles.com/54C4z271ye/Binance_BOT_v3.6.36_zip",
