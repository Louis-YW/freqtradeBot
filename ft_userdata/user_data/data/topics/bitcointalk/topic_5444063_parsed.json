They drop down to 2/3 hashboards just like appears to be happening with the units mentioned above. My units are still @ Bitmains authorized repair center and have been for 2 months now...",

Make it so!\"?Sooo many things wrong with what is described and shown in the pictures...I know! They used the idjit responsible for the terrible AMT/Bitmine.ch A1 CoinCraft miner hash boards as a consultant!",

The tweet that led me to this was far more alarming than the article looks at first impression.So, they thought that it wasn't enough they've made outrageous profits selling gear at 5x the prices for a year, so it's time to milk it more, how about we cut costs with this and that and save 10$? Or something like that?I don't know the implications of that aluminum board, they say that Whatsminer is already using the same design but the PIC thing seems tricky, again seems to encourage larger farms over small miners.",

      "body": "They depend more on the PSU. If you want to recognize them, the \"old\" miners (with PIC) came from factory with PSUs: APW12, APW12A, APW121215 a,b,c. The rest are all \"new\" miners (without PIC).The old miners can use \"new\" PSUs, but new miners MUST use \"new\" PSUs, they are incompatible with the old ones. Very old firmware will not work with new miners either.As for Bitmain saving on parts, yeah its not just the PIC, there are also less temperature sensors, some hashboards have only two instead of 4 or 6.However the \"old\" miners are becoming rare, everything they sell now has switched to this.You need to be careful those ribbon cables are well connected, specially the small one that goes to the PSU.This is nothing like the S17 fiasco, it simply puts more weight to the PSU itself. I don't think they are significantly worse than the old miners. Of course the early S19 Pro 110TH uses 7nm asics while the current ones are all 5nm, confusingly even the newer S19 with low THs.",

They drop down to 2/3 hashboards just like appears to be happening with the units mentioned above. I keep hearing that the \"A\" version of the 19 pro series is terrible, I have always questioned why people sell it at cheaper prices than the other ones, pretty lame to have a gear that expensive die on you in a few months, reminds me of the 17 series.QuoteI don't know the implications of that aluminum board, they say that Whatsminer is already using the same design but the PIC thing seems trickyIt's not just the aluminum board, it's how everything works together, based on my own personal experience nothing beats Whatsminer in terms of durability, people who had enough experience with both brands will understand that it's the reason why Whatsminers sell for almost the same price as Antminer despite being slightly less efficient, it's the extra quality you pay for, of course, Whatsminer is far from perfect and there is some stupid stuff in the design which pisses people off and should have changed years ago, but just like Bitmain they don't seem to care.",
