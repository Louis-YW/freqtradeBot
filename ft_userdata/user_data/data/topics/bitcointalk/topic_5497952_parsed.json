  "content": "My cousin who in time i asked to investment on bitcoin but has always had excuses that he'll invest later, sometimes he tells me that he's afraid to invest his money on the bitcoin due to the potential losses.He had aslo told me that he's contented with his monthly salaries at then but now he has fall back to me that he's ready to invest because he has lost his job and it's becoming tough for him to meet up with his financial requirements.This has someone living a luxurious life without undermining that his job is just temporarynand economy inflations could affect his savings.Then I reminded him that the bitcoin investment isn't a get quick rich and for an individual who has bills and financial needs to respond to as responsibility, you must have an alternative source of income by which your bitcoin investment can only be fertilexbti yield profits when you invested and doesn't panic it to grow else he may end up selling his bitcoin at lost having me to be blamed.So I've told him that I'm not involved if he gets to Invest at this time because I know he'd panic over the volatiles of the bitcoin market since he doesn't have  another source by which he can rely on earning income to process his financial needs. The choice is his to decide because if he had alternated his source of earning to bitcoin since I told him, the dividends of his bitcoin assets would had be reliable to him after much he may have made some profits from it. It'd had also served as means of savings and factor to encourage him to be economical with his luxury life which he doesn't have the potential to continuesly afford them",

Your friend had the opportunity to invest when he can, and you were there to put him through but he refused. Just because he lost his job, he is back to his senses that he wants to invest. This is how some people are, they will think that they will have whatever they want everytime due to their current financial status, and they will not think of investing when they can it is when they have lost it all, they Wil want to invest.",

Why don't you ask the opposite question, why did he previously have a stable economy and avoid OP's investment advice? I don't see anything wrong and completely agree with the OP's advice to his cousin. For someone with no income and a get-rich-quick mindset, giving investment advice at this time is trying to kill them rather than help them. Even if you give them thousands of tips, thousands of warnings about the risks of investing in bitcoin, they will never know how risky it will be because they have never experienced it before. The volatility and risk of investing in bitcoin cannot be described in words, only those who have truly experienced it can know what it feels like.",

Maybe it will be based on the things he might have read about those who invest in Bitcoin and how they made it out rich from it, which is the misinformation most people live with. The best thing he needs right now is to look for another job that could give him earnings and not invest the little savings that he might have into bitcoin, whose price will be floating, thinking he can have a life-changing opportunity.",

I always tell my friends the project is good, I believe in it, I put money in it BUT it may go to zero at any moment.So in case it goes 20% down, they won't look at me with regret.The security issues when investing is a whole another problem.. I am not into dedicated solutions for crypto as I'd rather be a fish in the ocean than shark in the tank and use regular hardware for cold and hot wallet but if someone is not too savvy with computers, maybe a hardware wallet is a good idea - even better would be to learn about the dangers because even hardware wallet users are getting scammed due to social hacking / mail spam with misspelled domains etc.",

People without a security deposit or some stable income that allows them to save beyond their needs are going to have a very hard time if it stays in a slump and they need the money. For them the financial loss or much more significant to someone with a property he can earn income from or someone with a high paying job. So really, if your friends are poor, by all means, take the time and teach them. Show them a skill, that skill may very well be crypto. But don't given them predatory advice to invest anywhere especially if you know that they can't afford the risk of losing, which is a very probable scenario.

Some people are not collecting high amount of money that can satisfy them while some will be collecting an amount that can satisfy them but can not save. Some people with just one source of income can be satisfied and save enough than someone having two or more incomes. People face different things in life. There are sometimes that you may have just a source of income and having enough to save, that does not mean you should not invest in bitcoin, because you have the capability. What that matters is capability. If you have the capability to spend, save and invest, having one source of income or more is not what to be considered.",

Some people are indeed  earning enough on a daily basis from crypto investment but in most instances, people are yielding to loss due to bad decisions or mistakes.

Even \"professionals\" or experienced investors are suffering from loss so what more with beginners.Alternative source of income will save you from being at financial problematic edge. What's best is to know your \"grounds\". Know how much you can engage with investments and the amount you can afford to lose in this industry.",

If he can get a new job or a business with the money he has at hand, after having a business or another job, then it will be the best and right time for him to invest in bitcoin because investment is never too late.Otherwise, if he invests now, he will end up surviving in debt, and that will just create a bigger problem for him because how sure is he that the profit that he will get in bitcoin will be able to cover all the debt that he accumulates?

I personally, with great caution, can advise anyone to invest in Bitcoin, before that I will carefully analyze the person and see whether he is emotional and prone to rash actions, as well as whether he is greedy or not. If these conditions are met, then only in this single case can I tell him a lot about it. Of course, in our conversation, I will warn him that this can be very dangerous for his wallet, and that you can not only earn, but also lose, because when buying any asset we take on the risk. Although many say that they are not responsible for those whom they told, I cannot say that I think the same. If a person loses some money, then I will indirectly blame myself. On the other hand, it would be wrong to be completely silent and not tell other people about Bitcoin, because in itself it is one of the best assets that exist. And I am still very grateful to those friends who introduced me to Bitcoin several years ago.",

That’s why you can’t just invest and rely on it solely, that will only put your life at risk. Find a stable job at least prior to any investment so that if ever you fail on your investment, your whole life won’t breakdown as well. That way, regardless if your investment will work or not, at least your finances will still be stable and can still cater to make ends meet.",
