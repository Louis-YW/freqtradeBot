  "content": "A whale sold 18m dollars of Curve and tanked the price 20%, pretty scary. Only a small number of people need to decide to stop playing musical chairs for such large price movements.Curve is a much larger market cap than most alts and there are massive outflows from crypto right now, it's going to continue to be rough.Does anyone know of any other projects like Ondo Finance that are able to double the liquidity of alts? Projects like these are super important right now to stop most of them being wiped from existence imo.Let me know, thanks!",
