  "content": "Altcoin bounties are famous for being useless. However, there tends to be gems every once in a while, have you come across such any?For me and from my memory of 5 years of alt bounties these three take the cake, Jrt: Got 180k tokens of it with 100 eth value at one point of time, that would be ~$500k at ath, and still ~$100,000 eth. Aave: Back then 'lend'. Had just got 87 tokens, sold it on etherdelta for pennies. However it reached $660 ath, that would be 57k. Gold - stablecoin bounty, was part of it for 41 months. Highest payrate being $300/month. This might not be much, but I'd like to include it just because how consistent it turned out to be. What are yours?",

One mistake I guess. But in memory I think got some tokens from a project that Ibsold for 0.4 btc and probably biggest just forgot the name. While other tokens are also good in amount and value.If only hold at peak those precious airdrop from uniswap and others might have a good savings.",

When i first get it, it was traded $1 ATH, i could earned $17,000 but i greedy and wait, and finally ended up nothing as i didn't sell and now it hasn't any value at all.Quote from: libert19 on December 22, 2022, 06:42:38 AMAave: Back then 'lend'.

Rebranded to Aave and reduced their supply.I think OP cashed out Jrt when its total $100k, but sold Ethlend on cheap price (since he said sold it for pennies), so he didn't get those $57k",

You need to hope for that project to succeed to maximize the bounty rewards. Its still a gamble actually and that is a choice of hunters. Unlike to regular btc paid campaign which is fixed. Altcoins can sometime have overwhelming rewards, and honestly its luck if you did choose a good campaign or project.",

At the present only high rank members of this forum or community qualifies for the strict requirements of new projects.

This bounty was first announced in 2017 when ICO and bounty campaigns was really fresh and the projects were actually made it to the final products, although they didn't survive until this date. But still for bounty reward itself, it was really impressive on that date.LUNYR : The second one is LUNYR.
