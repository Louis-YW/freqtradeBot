  "content": "AnnouncementEarlier yesterday morning, being the 3rd of October 2023, a church building collapsed (Dunamis church benue branch) and according to news and the investigation going on by several officers and special intelligence, they said only one person was confirmed dead, and that person was the pastor of the church district. However, 3 people have also been confirmed injured.So now how we take am as we see this matter, why most church buildings dey fall anyhow? The pastor and some of the members of the church no dey observe some changes before the collapse dey happen? I really know say as building dey so, the person way be say nah im get am go observe some walls way done crack and some kind of things for the building before any incident dey happen.Anyway, it has already been said amongst us that, as a 9jas if e never happen we no go take am serious and this is the result, seriously seriously, life is lost and members of the church have been injured, and more victims are yet to find out, but I pray let there not be any other victims.click here to know how it happened, click here for more details.I believe that more people will be too conscious about their building this time around. Although this is not the first, I believe that there will be changes.",
