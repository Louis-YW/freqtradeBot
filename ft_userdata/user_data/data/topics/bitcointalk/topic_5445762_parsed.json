  "content": "As we all know, bitcoin has been trending for a long time now and has been recognized by nation's and individuals globally. Irrespective of the fact that bitcoin is a digital currency, it is highly volatile and risky and if you must invest in it, you must use your spare cash or funds which you can be able or afford to loose. Many people use bitcoin as store of value ie they use it to store their assets and wealth after converting from Fiat to bitcoin. It is otherwise a savings account to many as they see it so. With bitcoin your privacy is guaranteed compared to the Fiat which you must pass through processes before having access to it. Fiat is stable enough to sustain it's monetary value but can not guarantee a stable economy as it was designed for. Fiat exchange value varies between nation's as it is measurable in the economical value each nation has and is contributing to the global market GDP but as a national tender it is, it is still of value because that is the only means by which one can exchange for goods and services compared to bitcoin depending on the country in which you are if they truly recognizes bitcoin as a legal render.As bitcoin is, it has the tendencies to appreciate high in price compared to fiat which is stable, bitcoin has no third party custody unless you have it stored in exchange if not you are solely incharge of it which means you have your private keys and phrase under your custody compared to the fiat which is been held by banks and other financial institutions.As a bitcoin enthusiast having the knowledge of bitcoin and it's potentials compared to the fiat as a local currency and means of exchange or payment for services rendered what is your take and preference on it? And how long do you think it will take for bitcoin to be accepted as a digital legal tender world wide?You opinions and thoughts are welcomed, let us discuss.",

I wouldn't go that far, I prefer to have both of them. While I use fiat for spending it for our daily needs, I've got bitcoin for the sole purpose of being an asset and investment of mine that shall be held for a long time until I decide to start selling it.Quote from: CryptSafe on March 21, 2023, 09:03:38 AMAnd how long do you think it will take for bitcoin to be accepted as a digital legal tender world wide?You opinions and thoughts are welcomed, let us discuss.I'm not thinking about that anymore. What's good with the situation right now about bitcoin is that, there are more people that do like and know it unlike years ago when it's being feared upon of related to illegal activities and dark marketplaces. But today, it's all good and way different and likable by many.",

However, 2 countries have already legalized Bitcoin as a legal tender (I.e El Salvador & Centre African Republic), and Bitcoin start increasing in price, I'm sure to have more countries adopt it as legal tender any time soon",

On the other hand, fiat currency is controlled by central banks and is subject to inflation and other economic fluctuations.As for the question of how long it will take for Bitcoin to be accepted as legal tender worldwide, it is difficult to give a concrete answer as it depends on various factors such as government regulation, adoption rates and technological advances. However, it should be noted that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are gaining more general acceptance and use, with some countries even considering their own digital currencies.In terms of preference, I think it depends on individual goals and circumstances. If someone values privacy and sovereignty over their finances, then Bitcoin may be the preferred choice. However, if one values stability and predictability then fiat may be a better choice.",

Once the government starts to see bitcoin as an alternative to fiat and not a currency that is here to bundle fiat away then we could see bitcoin being legal tender fast. But as it is the government want to control everything monetary and their constant threat to once privacy will take bitcoin longer years to being legal tender globally. Personally I still both bitcoin and fiat been used together because most people in rural areas still can’t have access to bitcoin because of lack of internet and its knowledge. I should I offered to take any of the two I will just take any because no matter how I see bitcoin as a store of value I feel one needs to hold on to fiat for daily expenses rather than selling of one’s coins whenever there is emergency. Moreover one could easily convert any of the two to the preferred one, so it isn’t a big issue having to accept any of them",

Almost people are kill the Bitcoin's purpose, but if you're hoping a government to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, you're also kill the Bitcoin's purpose.",

But I didn't know where exactly to get the picture but when I scrolled down I was happy that I saw the picture already posted. The matter of Bitcoin and Fiat choice is no longer a debate but is a matter of a decision and matter of the level of information that is available to the choice maker.Someone that is not informed or acquainted with the latest happening in the society would always trust the fiat and would always trust their bank and government to keep his money till 5 to 10 years or 15 years as the case may be.But someone who is more exposed and has the idea of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency would say that the other man is just being dumb.",

Since Bitcoin is not a stable coin, there is a possibility to earn a lot of profit by holding Bitcoin but on the other hand Fiat is not a stable currency whose price will never increase.  But for some reason, the value of country-based fiat may decrease against the dollar. So many may opt for Bitcoin in hopes of profit.  But it will depend on a person's condition.  If a person has enough money for daily spending, then he will definitely be interested in accepting Bitcoin.  And his thought will be to earn more profit by holding Bitcoin.  But if a person does not have enough money to run their daily expenses.  But he will definitely choose fiat to run his daily life in the present without thinking about his future",

Go for Bitcoin to hopefully combat the ever-increasing inflation affecting many people around the globe and of course cash for daily needs. I am sure that fiat will continue to be here for as long as we have the government still around. I am not wishing for the government to go because I know that there can be chaos once there is that vacuum and who knows who or what will be filling that empty space once it is gone.

Privacy isn't guaranteed when you use BTC, it is the user that has to guarantee their privacy by using decentralized services. Centralized exchanges has the highest trading volume, most people buy and sell BTC through these exchanges, and to do so you must tell the exchange who you are and where you are from; KYC is a must, and even in some of them that don't require KYC for small amounts, you must be ready because they can ask for it anytime. So if most bitcoiners buy and sell from centralized exchanges, they have lost the privacy you are talking about.Quote from: CryptSafe on March 21, 2023, 09:03:38 AMAs a bitcoin enthusiast having the knowledge of bitcoin and it's potentials compared to the fiat as a local currency and means of exchange or payment for services rendered what is your take and preference on it?

To buy most of the things you need, you have to do so with fiat. You cannot hold all your assets in BTC even if you feel you prefer if to fiat. BTC may never be a legal tender worldwide, especially in the developed countries with currencies that are used as reserves around the world, like the USD for example, why would the USA want to make BTC a legal tender? All we need is for BTC to remain legal in most countries and then mass adoption becomes possible in the future.",
