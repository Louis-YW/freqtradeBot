  "content": "Guys, did you remember Optimism's previous round of airdrops? Those were a very huge amount of free money. They mostly consider giving those airdrops to those who usually use their main net. These are the Scenarios of Optimism's Round 1 & Round 2 both airdrops.   So according to those points, what can we expect to be eligible for OP 3rd round airdrop? I analyze a bit of these previous scenarios and these are some key points that we can expect in 3rd airdrop round. Done at least 10000$ transactions on Optimism Delegate at least 8000 OP tokensUse Optimism for more than a year with at least 100+ transactionsSpend at least 200$+ for gas feesThese are the only speculations that I have done. Since it's 3rd round I think Optimism will consider mainly for the most active ones in their network + community may be. So what are your thoughts about this? What else that I missing here? I have seen regularly a lot of posts always similar in  Altcoin Discussion that say \"Should I buy this coin/token? when a bull market appears? what are the top alts in the next bull run blah blah blah\"  Let's start a real Discussion with a token that has a great user case and good funding background? Shall we?",

But since Optimism is still early we can think of it as another chance but they will do that only if only necessary like boosting the community or for other enhance activity on their platform. But if you consider their current standing they will not drop it right away maybe few years from now again.",

DAO and voting5, Number of active weeks6. Number of active months7. Number of active days8. Time of the first transaction9. Number of dapps",

The only reason I used Optimism due to its lower fee for using dapp and lower fee withdrawing from some centralized exchange. But it was also a hassle as I thought OP were the gas for the platform but it was actually wrapped ether which was even hard to get hands on. This made me use the platform less as matic became my cheap goto alternative for Ethereum platform. The airdrop would be a good reward for the loyal users of OP as most of us occasional users would have no chance.",

Nfts or otherwise, doing quests usually turns out futile.
