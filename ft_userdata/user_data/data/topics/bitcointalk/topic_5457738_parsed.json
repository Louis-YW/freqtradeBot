According to what people are posting on this forum, truly Ubuntu will be the better one to go for.You can even use Livepatch (for free) to automatically patch the Linux kernel while its running, without reboots: https://ubuntu.com/security/livepatchBut I think that there needs to be some kind of service for automatically downloading and updating your node. It can be a 3rd-party program or something, but I think one hurdle to that would be if Bitcoin core has any callback \"configurable shell command\" that it can run when Core is about to shut down, similar to the blocknotify event.",

I don't mind liveOS (not persistent) as databases could be stored persistently on an attached SDD independently.That's not the only problem though, for example,1. Tails is meant for device which have monitor and GPU. I don't know whether Tails have CLI only mode.2. Whenever you need to reboot, you'll need to re-configure Tails manually (e.g. connect to Tor network, opening bitcoind).",

That's the purpose of Tails to leave no traces.I think it's better for you if you play with Linux distros. You can try CentOS 7, Ubuntu, Elementary OS and then pick the one you prefer the most.",

      "body": "My nodes mostly run headless on Raspi 4B hardware. I have RaspiBlitz running on one device, this is based on RaspiOS which is based on Debian. As a technological study object I also run Umbrel on another Raspi 4B, no productive or locked real coins involved there, because I don't see Umbrel as well designed in terms of security.My daily driver is Ubuntu 22.04.x on a laptop that's basically on all the time (consumes ~10W while mostly idle). I leave it on and running because on that Ubuntu another Bitcoin Core is up and running all the time GUI-less (it doesn't need to, though) and I use that Core to perform some command-line requests with which I don't want to bother my RaspiBlitz or where Umbrel is a bit too cumbersome to use the cli.And then there's another Raspi 4B running Raspibolt on RaspiOS light (no GUI) with which I can even more play with if I'm in the mood to do so.I guess, I have a bit too many nodes running, but... well, who cares? They have some sort of purpose for me and that's it.The OP should ask himself, what's the purpose of my node and decide on the appropriate platform based on his needs. When it needs to run 24/7 then choose a platform with low power usage if that doesn't hinder your other needs of the node. Can you maintain a headless solution.What are your needs? There's usually no all-fit answer.",
