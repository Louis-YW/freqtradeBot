I think Messi needs just one goal to pass the legend Batistuta who is the top goal scorer for Argentina and I think Messi will score against the Netherlands as they are not well known for having a solid defense,that was always their Achilles's heel where they suffered a lot from the not so good defending.Argentina is well known for scoring goals and most probably will score against Netherlands with Messi having a really high chance of becoming the best goal scorer as I think Mbappe will have difficulties to score that easily against England but we will see.",

Cody Gakpo has all the advantage for the Golden Boot. I see the Dutch team going as far as the semi-finals or finals. I would pick Ronaldo, Rashford and Richardson of Brazil to compete for the golden boot. I do not see Messi in the race for the golden boot but I see him winning the most valuable player in the competition due to his leadership qualities and skills he has portrayed in the tournament so far.",

He is only 23 years old. If there are no major setbacks, he will play in 3 more world cups. I think he will score more goals in the history of the world cup than Miroslav Klose, who scored 16 goals. He's such a goal machine!",

Messi could have been the top scorer, if every opportunity he had could be converted properly. even so, I can understand that at the age of 35 years, the sharpness and accuracy are decreasing.by the way, don't underestimate the Netherlands. because after all, so far the Netherlands has appeared very nicely. they have quite solid teamwork, a front line whose sharpness should not be underestimated.Too bad the Netherlands had to meet Argentina. both teams, this is my farovit. Messi still has the opportunity to add to his coffers on condition that he must score against the Netherlands. unfortunately, Argentina will meet Brazil if these two teams both qualify for the quarter-finals.For Mbappe, I agree with you.",
