There are probably honest games and casinos that let you use the blockchain to confirm the validity of outcomes, but even then it is up to the casino if they want to rip you off or not, even if it’s provable they’ve done so.",

Someone who really has a decentralized casino offers you to check it for yourself, because decentralization works without any trust and can be checked at any time. We are all used to playing in casinos, where all relationships are based only on trust, which means that it is too early to talk about decentralization.",

This time you can't just believe a casino is decentralised. They claimed to be but users need to register using email which definitely doesn't fit the narrative. But when users need to connect their wallets such as metamask, users are also very cautious about such casino for possible exploits.",

It is a relative question which means that I mostly trust only slot providers (taking into account slot games for the answer only) who use only one RTP level and Pragmatic Play is the best at this,they give you just one RTP and the casinos can't change it unless some dark underground accord is going on between the casinos and Pragmatic Play while there are other providers like Play n Go and No Limit City which offer different levels of RTP which leaves a lot of space to the casino to change the RTP to be the lowest while claiming to be using the highest,so I have lately refrained from playing such providers,I know it is only luck based in Pragmatic Play while I am not sure in other providers I mentioned here.",

What is the most convenient games you play on gambling platforms? Is using leverage about luck or skills? Or even a rigged game? Looking at the 2nd and 3rd questions related to slot machines, the answers seem a bit obvious really. Outside of some online casinos which might have engineered a verifiable and trusted way to show that they are fair, every online and physical casino owns the facilities so have ample opportunity to bend the slots to do exactly what they want. However there is the underlying idea that they are simply geared to generate money from players over the long term, so they have no real need to abuse them too much. Also, anyone who says they are \"good at\" slots simply doesn't know what they are talking about and might have not yet learned that they have zero control over the outcomes.",

I don't know whether we will enter into an era where we may see decentralized casino because decentralized means under control of no one so its kind of non profit and the same time has to satisfy users so its kind of hard to reach that.Games are games so the decentralisation doesn't play any role in the games, even in the centralized casinos the results are random and you can validate it by yourself.",

I suppose so, otherwise where is the decentralized coming from if the games aren't autonomous with the casino? That just doesn't make sense doesn't it? Quote from: Outhue on May 02, 2023, 04:49:41 PMDo you guys know that some casinos regulates their own slots machines themselves, can you gamble with ease of mind on such casinos?  Yes, I've been made aware since the first time I touched the crank of a slot machine, and yes. I don't think a physical casino would go so far as to screw with their customers, on a game that is already designed to favor the casino itself. Quote from: Outhue on May 02, 2023, 04:49:41 PMIf slots games is all you are good at, are you really good at it or you are just lucky? Can you use the word 'good at it' with slots game?  Nope. game revolves around chance. Chance and Luck isn't a skill per se, but a stat in videogame lingo. You can't actively improve upon it in real life even if you try. Quote from: Outhue on May 02, 2023, 04:49:41 PMWhat is the most convenient games you play on gambling platforms?  Slots, Dice, and Hi-Lo are some of the most common games I play whenever I'm in a casino. I dabble in some sportsbetting too, so there's that.Quote from: Outhue on May 02, 2023, 04:49:41 PMIs using leverage about luck or skills? Or even a rigged game?  Leverage amps your chances of winning, does it guarantee your win? No, then it's not rigging the game in your favor. Is it actively improving your ability to win the game, not the chance thereof? No, cause how? So it's luck-based",

The game is just your thing, because it works smoothly for you maybe not all the time, but most of the time more often than you have lost, and can perhaps be the game that you have experienced the biggest win you have recorded in gambling. Slot games are not skill based, so there is no need saying that you are good at it. You can rather say that the game is good with you.",

If we do make up some comparison in speaking about decentralized games  into those which are typical or having that central control then we could really say that there's really a significant difference in between.Take for example about those hash  games or blockchain type of games which really that indeed decentralized or no central authority or something which games is really that fair and truly having no possibilityof being rigged or what but the thing on here is that these type of games arent really that getting that much attention or recognition and this is why we arent seeing good numbers on this one.Speaking about gambling then it do always matter with luck but there are games which we know that knowledge and skills could really give out that advantage.Choices would vary because each person does have its own preference when it comes to this.",

Yes, they are supposed to be decentralized and that also means the the slots are supposed to be provably fair and the code of the casino and its games are supposed to be open and available for anyone to see, study and audit, that is the whole point of the casinos which want to be the next big thing in the world of decentralized entertainment and there is where the ease of mind comes from.It is similar when you download an open source wallet and you deposit your satoshis on it, there is not backdoor or cheating because the code is for anyone to see and verify. If some so-called decentralized casino does not reveal the code using some excuse like not wanting competitors to copy them, then I would say that casino is to be avoided until they change their mind.",

In my opinion, live dealer games are definitely gaining popularity and are becoming more and more mainstream in the online gambling industry. Although they do provide an immersive gaming experience, I personally prefer the older, tried-and-true casino games such as dice, slots, and roulette. There's something about the simplicity and classic nature of these games that keeps me coming back for more. I find them to be more relaxing and enjoyable compared to other games.Quote from: Outhue on May 02, 2023, 04:49:41 PMIs using leverage about luck or skills? Or even a rigged game?
