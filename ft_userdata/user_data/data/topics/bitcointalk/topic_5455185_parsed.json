There’s other transaction included on your transaction batch. You can check the output details and find the address that you use to send your Bitcoin. Probably that’s a change address or if you are using exchange then it’s other transaction included on the batch sent. You can share the Txid here so that we can point it out to you clearly how to check the transaction output details.",

Maybe you missed calculating the volume you sent out to the person. If what you sent out was Bitcoin, based on your calculation, the volume you sent out was equivalent to $130, which is a value decided based on the wallet you are using, but when the transaction was executed, the price that is shown there is the current exact value, which is based on theprice of the Bitcoin sent and the current exchange rate. There might be a little price difference from when you sent it.",

I think when you send a transaction on the blockchain, the \"Amount\" field represents the specific amount you sent. The \"Output Value\" field includes not just the amount you sent but also any change generated during the transaction. The \"To\" field displays the recipient's address. If you see an output value higher than the amount you sent, it's likely due to change being returned to your own address. This is normal, as change is often involved in transactions, but still i am not sure.",

      "body": "As already mentioned, there was probably a change included in the transaction. Let me explain it in more detail.  Whenever you receive a bitcoin transaction, you actually receive a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) and when you want to send bitcoin to someone, you have to spend the UTXO in full. Let's say you have received 0.1 BTC in a bitcoin transaction and now you want to send 0.05 BTC to someone. Your transaction will include 1 input and 2  outputs. The input will be the 0.1 BTC you have received before. One of the outputs will belong to the recipient and the other one will belong to yourself which is the change. The change will be 0.05 BTC minus transaction fee.",

In Bitcoin, there are input addresses and output addresses, and their sum is equal. When you click on the send button, the wallet searches for the highest balance in your income addresses. If the highest balance is equal to or higher than the amount required to be withdrawn, then the income will appear to you as one address, but if it is less, it will appear in several input transactions.In the output, if there is one output and equal to the input balance, then you will see one output, otherwise the output number will be added to an address from your wallet called the change address.Watch this YouTube channel ----> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPQMCVVhExY",

At the time that you sent it, a business or other service might have estimated the value of that quantity of Bitcoin at approximately $130. That estimate may or may not have been accurate depending on how reliable that business or service is at determining Bitcoin value.Quote from: Anonymusx on June 05, 2023, 04:05:17 PMI check blockchain the transaction.What exactly did you check? Because \"The Blockchain\" only has the quantity of Bitcoins. It does not convert that value to dollars or any other currency. So, you almost certainly used some website or service to interpret the blockchain for you. That website or service will have done its own estimate of the value of the bitcoins that you sent. That value might have changed after you sent the transaction (since the market value of Bitcoin is constantly changing), or they may simply have used a different method of estimating value.Quote from: Anonymusx on June 05, 2023, 04:05:17 PM And i see \"Amount\"  and \"Output Value\"  and \"To\"   arround 170 dollars. Depending on what service or wallet you used to send the transaction, and what service you used to find the transaction in the blockchain, this could be as simple as differing opinions on the value of Bitcoin, or it's possible that the blockchain interpretation was showing you the value of ALL outputs (including any change from the transaction).",

I suppose that's due to some problems with blockchain congestion. At the time of heavy traffic loads its possible for fees to be that high. I think transactions will become cheaper as soon as traffic returns to normal.",

Simple as that OP, this is the right answer. When you make a transaction, the input goes to a new change address. It's a part of Bitcoin's functionality that improves privacy. You should still see the other $40 in your wallet and you should be able to validate this answer by using a block explorer to see how it works. If you have $170 in an address within your wallet and send $130 to another address, $130 will go to the recipient and $40 will go to another address in your wallet which you can spend later. Similarly, if you had $500 and sent $200 to someone and $100 to someone else (in the same transaction), the other $200 would go to another address in your wallet.",
