  "content": "When I was a beginner when I didn't have merit I asked about the reason why you all give merit to someone? (Please State What Criteria or Reasons Willing to Give Your MERITS to Someone?) . At that time I didn't even know what it was like to give merit and I even tried to send merit to someone when I didn't have any merit at all. and of course it can't be done. and I also post a question about the criteria and reasons why someone sends merit to someone.And I feel happy because so many people respond to my questions. and I also collect all the data from the responses or answers of everyone who has participated in the topic. and use it as my reference to improve my writing and quality. and it worked. I thank everyone who participated at that time.but now when i have merit and i often give merit to someone i have a new question in my head. that is :How do the people I have given merit feel? Do they have the same feelings as me like being happy and feeling valued. or each level has a different feeling.I started to think of a possibility that I think maybe everyone's responses and feelings are different. and one indication is that every level from beginner to Legendary has different thoughts and feelings. So I decided to make the topic of this question back. and I hope that someone will respond and give an honest response starting from the feelings of the Newbie level, Jr Member, Member, Full Member, Sr Member, Hero Member, Legendary and even staff and moderators and merit sources who have merit advantages.The question is How do you feel when someone gives you MERIT?And I'm sorry that when I created this topic, I didn't have the smerit that I could give to appreciate those who participated in responding to my topic. so I can only say THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PARTICIPATING AND RESPONDING TO MY INTEREST.",

Seriously it's always a great feelingÂ  Your experience about merit is almost similar to mine. which I also misunderstood at first. thought it could be given to anyone without limits and by anyone. like the like button on facebook. but it turns out I was wrong when I don't have Smerit and will send it to someone, it turns out that we are required to have at least 2 merits, which means we have 1 Smerit that can be sent. and it's true I also feel what you feel. the feeling of being happy and feeling appreciated. truly extraordinary. so I decided to be diligent in giving my smerit to share this happiness in useful and worthy posts and to those in need. and it doesn't feel like my Smerit is now up. and it's nice to appreciate someone's writing by giving a smerit. and because I feel happy too when I receive it.",

Though I still feel that I'm somewhat contributing better if my posts get merits so I kinda use that as a gauge.oh so it turns out. there was a slight change in mood when receiving merits at different ranks. when it is legendary then it is not a big thing anymore. It's different when you're still a member like me, then receiving a merit is still a tremendously big impact because members have other goals and encouragement other than feeling appreciated for posting but also being given the feasibility to develop and being given the opportunity to move up to the next level, namely like me from a member I want to go up to full member. so when someone gives me then I feel like I've been given the opportunity to get closer to ranking up. and of course feel appreciated also for my writing. I feel like a child who studies hard and is given a gift by his father.and that makes the child even more active in learning",

Questions about merit are of interest to those who are only growing in rank. But what you write, what people answer on your topics, is not only answers to your supposedly interesting questions, but also the most common fulfillment of the quota for subscription companies.Just watch that when you ask a very simple question, you get a lot of relatively similar answers. Do you seriously think that this all comes from the sincerity of people?While you are growing in rank, you are full of enthusiasm, but after that, many no longer appreciate it so much.

      "body": "Some users would say it depends somewhat on the rank of the user, for example a newbie would prolly be overly excited to get a couple of merits here and there cause it helps them rank up (and tbh, every user wants to rank up, even if they claim otherwise), and a Legendary user would be happy to receive merits cause it shows someone likes/appreciates/think what they wrote is good/recognizes their efforts, etc, even if it does nothing for them in the grand scheme of things (as they have no other ranking up to do), except that it allows them apply for good campaigns that have a merit criteria (like x amount of merits in the last 120 days).Overall the merit system is great for the forum, it combats spam and reduces it to a large extent, though it doesn't eradicate it which is not possible, but it has a really positive impact, and any user should feel great when they get some, except those who totally do not care about the merit system (whether sending or receiving).",

You can get merit for a simple joke while causing bewilderment among newcomers.maybe you are right.I did expect a sincere answer from feelings. and I would really appreciate it.but even if someone answers insincerely then I will still appreciate it. because I can't measure someone's sincerity. then don't be afraid to write even though the answer will be the same. because I would still love to read it. because when you take the time to reply to this topic and answer my questions that already makes me very happy.people are free to choose to be honest or to lie. because behind a choice taken then there must be a reason behind it. and I value every one's personal reasons. and I want to keep positive thinking about each respondent.

There was a period of time where everything was getting a little bit out of hand. Now spam has reduced, we're actually starting to get reports from way back when, and ultimately cleaning up some of the mess left behind before merit. Obviously, there's still a lot of spam coming through on a daily basis, but nothing out of the ordinary for a forum this size.
