No lock detected and hashrate keeps falling down. All 3 cards are the same model from Zotac and have the same BIOS. Have to stick to 2.74, and also really unpleased about devfee increase....",

I'm assuming because it has 24 threads and not 12 like the AMD 3600 its taking 4x longer?or am I missing something that's not quite right?Thanks!",

(Windows 10).Difficulty by the Vega is 27 and the RX480 23 (auto setting).All works fine with 0.30.6.I hope it no big problem for the next versions.Thanks.",
