The frustration is even more evident in the way various unfortunate events are happening around the world. The war in Ukraine, for example, has led to inflation in many countries. It is difficult to say when the market will see the light of day after overcoming these problems. For those who want to invest in cryptocurrency, or have already invested and want to avoid losses, there are several things to keep in mind, as different people have different opinions about where the crypto market may turn in the future. Many are hopeful that the market will turn around by the end of this year. If you have to invest, you have to wait a few more days. Because if you invest in a downward market, you will get a lot more profit.",

Covid came and bitcoin did numbers after a year. The war just began and soon it'll settle down, many people or victims that got saved through bitcoin donations will acknowledge the coin in the future. Say next year and things will work out fine for cryptocurrency. The world can't be in total peace we are too many to expect such a peaceful world without frustration and war. Though as humans, we don't see things as regard previous actions. As they say leave the past, it belongs there. But, with the look of earlier trends on bitcoin in the year 2021, this is the best moment to invest. Waiting for the price to hit 10k or less may be risky. We saw bitcoin hit 60k during or after a pandemic (according to different countries) so investing on bitcion now is okay. Though waiting for bitcoin to fall again in price like Luna before investing is not advisable bitcoin price has been on that price rate for a while now.",

Maybe your words are more suitable for long-term investment/trading. I think there must have been a good, good time that was when we could get the bottom price. Although it is rarely we can do it. Because our combination of technical and asset management is not 100% correct. We only use technical to maximize profits and minimize losses.",

Having your portfolio fall below your break even point does not mean one has incurred a loss. The market is volatile, but one constant is Bitcoin has been appreciating in value over the years, you just have to o hodl long enough.Quote from: sensimilia on July 05, 2022, 01:48:00 PMIf you have to invest, you have to wait a few more days.

You never know when the price will starts increasing.The truth is that over the long term there is not going to make too much of a difference between buying right now or at slightly cheaper prices, the price of bitcoin is already cheap enough so we can justify buying it.We know the fundamentals of bitcoin are solid and we can buy it for a huge discount, this by itself should be more than enough of a justification to buy bitcoin now, especially since it is below the 20k level, those waiting for the price to go even lower are taking a risky bet, maybe they will win it and they will get bitcoin cheaper, but if the price goes up what are they going to do? Because in those instances people regret their decision and decide to wait once more so the price goes back to its previous levels, and sometimes that never happens which causes them to completely miss the window of opportunity they got and not get any bitcoin in the process.",

It does not a big intention when you apply DCA.DCA regularly has another advantage: you won't go empty with capital to do it. Exception is when you lose your jobs and no longer have enough regular income that should be used for DCA. With DCA, you can buy at many entry prices, from high to low.",

There are also a lot of people telling that when Bitcoin started to dump below $20,000, it will again visit the $13,000 level or worst the $10,000 level.Another thing to consider about these dumps is the COVID 19, I remember last March 2020 the effect of it when it started to spread, we saw a huge dump on all markets.But now we are recovering from that virus but why the market is still dumping?",
