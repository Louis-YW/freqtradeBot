If anyone knows about it please let me know the process about it.This is not exact number since there are many inactive and banned members, and new accounts are registered every day, but maybe you can ask TryNinja to add this option in his Ninjastic.space website.I don't think this is important information to know unless someone is working on creating some statistical report that needs this data.Newbies and brand new accounts should probably be excluded from report to get more precise data.",

DdmrDdmr's Merit Dashboard has it in a table for Forum ranks.https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ddmrddmr/viz/BitcointalkMeritDashboard/PersonalSummaryWhat the op asked for is not here.  It is only a chart of merit transactions. op wants to know how many members of which rank are there out of more then 3.5 Million  members in this forum so far. Which is hard to predict.  And no tools finds it tooQuote from: LoyceV on April 02, 2023, 11:20:01 AMIt's hard to get accurate Rank data on all users. The Rank can change at any moment (when posts are made or deleted), and you'll have to check each profile to be sure. At 3.5 million profiles and 1 check per second, that takes 6 weeks. And by the time you're done, many user ranks have changed already.Yes, someone's rank on the forum is constantly being up regularly. So it is now almost impossible to find out how many members there are of any rank among the 3.5M members. But AI bots can be the solution to this problem.  But who will develop this AI bot",

That should eliminate the users who never posted, or didn't post enough to reach Jr. Member. For the remaining users you can download the profile to get the Rank, and you can keep an eye on who makes new posts to see who upgrades to the next Rank. It's not flawless, but it's close.",
