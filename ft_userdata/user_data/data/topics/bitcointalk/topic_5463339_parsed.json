I am referring to browsers like Duckduckgo which is my favorite. Another privacy browse is Mozilla Firefox.It is good to mention Tor which is a privacy browser but not need the help of anything because it is Tor itself.",

Or are you referring to browsers to be centralized?In the post, I emphasized about problems with browsers for your privacy. Orbot is good for your device and privacy but if you use it in combination with other softwares that are centralized like those browser, it is a bad practice and weaken your privacy.If you use Orbot, why do you need to find alternatives for Tor browser?",

This is also not recommended by Tor project[1].[1] https://support.torproject.org/tbb/#tbb_tbb-9Actually, Tor Browser recommends Orbot for using Tor on Android.Tor Project also has an Android version of Tor Browser, but it is just a slightly modified version of Orbot.",

Is this idea good as an alternative to Tor browser?There seems to be some kind of confusion between the use case for Orbot and Tor browser _act_. They are both designed to give access to the Tor network with a small difference : Tor browser is a fork of Firefox that allows you to browse the internet behind the Tor network (and bridges) while Orbot ends up being a VPN for smartphones whose aim is to route traffic from any installed app that you have on your device through the Tor network. What are you trying to achieve in looking for an alternative for the Tor browser (that, as you could see, ends up using the same network)?As an additional note, I don't know where you installed Orbot from, but usually the newest updated version can be found on their GitHub[1] page. Even if you don't usually install the Beta versions, the latest stable release that can be found on GitHub is v17 RC 1 (tor 0.4.7.11) while the Google Play store version[2] still sits on the v16.6.3-RC-1-tor.0.4.7.10.[1]https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot/releases[2]https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android",

If that's the case, as what OP is doing here, then you should use the Tor browser.https://support.torproject.org/tormobile/tormobile-6/Quote from: _act_ on August 15, 2023, 08:20:15 AMIs this idea good as an alternative to Tor browser?No, it isn't. You'll get better security with Tor due to things like NoScript and limited permissions for websites you visit, and you'll get better privacy since by using DDG via Orbot you are providing a fairly unique fingerprint which could be used to deanonymize you.Why not just use Tor browser?",

I've never used Orbot, so the only thing that comes to mind is that the surfing speed on the same one is perhaps a bit higher than on Tor, which can be really slow - I think that on the Android version of Tor there is no option for the new Tor circuit.",

I tried Orbot and it worked and I thought I should ask the question on this forum to know if it is a safe to use Orbot to on privacy browsers, not that I am intending to do that. I use Tor and Tor is very fast than before. I have read all what that you have posted and this lead to a conclusion that Orbot should not be used with browsers. Although there are still apps that you can use it with, example are noncustodial wallets that you can connect it with directly. There are wallets that uses that on mobile devices like Electrum and Unstoppable wallet.",
