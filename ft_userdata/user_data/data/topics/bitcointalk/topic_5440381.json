For instance, I have this card but I see a wide range of prices:The one I have:I don't see any difference between them. I would appreciate any help.Your best bet is to check Ebay sold comps & also tcgplayer.com for the pricing on slabs as well. Mavin.io is also good. Also, the stark increase is due to the difference in price from a PSA 9 to a PSA 10. Which the 10s tend to fetch a high premium.",
