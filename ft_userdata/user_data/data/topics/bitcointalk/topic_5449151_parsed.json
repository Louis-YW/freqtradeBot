Google and fast search skills required/ Or Chatgpt skills. for more about work and payment contact the Telegram: Â Bibixblad3If you need a designer, you need to make everything open here on the forum and not refer the person to your Telegram profile. You are still a newbie here, and before anyone can agree to do work with you, we need some solid proof that you will actually pay for the job as agreed. Maybe an escrow will be helpful.And in what area of work do you need the design, at least some site links, images, and descriptions so that one will know what he or she wants to partake in?",
