How do I report them if the project and the token are total scams that will steal customers' money and flee while looking legitimate and promising?Huh ! It was as if they were selling preasles on cryptoralia.com (which allows them to find new victims imo) and getting ready for rugpull. How can I block these actions ??url of the website: quontral.comPreasale (rugpull) for the token $QUON is available at https://www.pinksale.finance/launchpad/0xBD6D2DCE3FAc72BE84E5f45DB0a08E0850cc6d52?chain=BSC.The address is 0xBD6D2DCE3FAc72BE84E5f45DB0a08E0850cc6d52.Could you examine it? How do you feel? I dont know that is it right place but if it's not feel free to move it to suitable place (sorry about that)",

Just use \"move topic\" command located below this current thread on the left and move it under: Economy > Trading Discussion > Scam AccusationsBut it would probably be a good idea to present more evidence why you believe the $QUON token is a scam/rugpull. I have never heard of that project before and so any information you could provide would help my understanding.",

What you can do to make awareness if this token was a scam. it's more than enough. Just told them to DYOR before invested in everything.Quote from: biyob92 on January 10, 2023, 09:18:07 PMHuh !

You must be careful when playing with pinksale. This launcher mostly used by scammers. Quote from: biyob92 on January 10, 2023, 09:18:07 PMCould you examine it? How do you feel? I dont know that is it right place but if it's not feel free to move it to suitable place (sorry about that) I didn't even need to examine it to make sure whether it was a scam or not. Its 100% scam. I fell nothing. The smart people will always try to did their own research while dumb people lose their money by invested on that shitty scam token",

Nothing strange until we see their presale on Pinksale, we can see that their softcap for the project they are developing is only 1 $BNB, for real? whether such small funds can really develop a project? LOL. This evidence is indeed not strong evidence, but it can be an indicator that they are going to scam.",

This evidence is indeed not strong evidence, but it can be an indicator that they are going to scam.Pretty obvious I guess. 1 bnb as softcap is like not enough for such fundamentals of the project. I really think that this project is joking around. I guess the evidence werent not sufficient but the act of deed might get some hint of possible scam. Pink sale presales are legit but afterwards projects did some rug pull. So better to be cautious when dealing with this kind of projects.",

Main one being the fact the team doesn't seem to be doxxed. That is enough red flag for me for not to invest, but if that changes i would definitely take another look at what they are building. There are only few projects that make sense not to reveal dev identities and even with those it's risky and questionable not to. But this is definitely not one of them. Just a generic project using stock footage on their ad video.",

That's just the first time ever heard that token though and most of these are rampant on the Binance exchange but my question is why they have to keep receiving/accepting these tokens that wouldn't last for a long time after getting listed.What the above said was to make an awareness so maybe make a thread about it if it's legit scamming people.",
