  "content": "If you're starting your journey on gambling do you think reading about people's bad experiences like losing their savings and getting depressed which leads to loss of jobs and livelihood will help new gamblers to become responsible gamblers for fear that what they read will happen to them?I ask this because, in our country, our government has mandated cigarette manufacturers to post graphic images of those who suffer from the bad effects of cigarettes on every pack of cigarettes like lung cancer pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitisSo do you think it will be the same with gambling?",

I have noticed one thing in life, that people learn from what happen to other people. But despite that, some people will be falling and still not learn from someone that have fallen before. But it will help some people.I agree with your opinion one of the factors that helped me to become a better and more responsible gambler is reading other experiences although I also experienced slippage, I always go back to remember what I read but sometimes you tend to forget this through excitement, and the effects of dopamine in your body you know that it's risky but you are too excited to be a risk taker, but once you remember and realized the bad stories of people who lose control you will come to your senses that you have to be in control.What you've seen in other people will have an impact on your mindset, when it comes to gambling you don't have to experience the bad things you just have to remember all the lessons coming from other people so you will become a better and more responsible gambler.",

Kinda like you have been made aware of what might happen but those will not restrict you from doing what you wanted to do. Just like the smokers who still keep puffing the smoke despite the warnings from the advertisements themselves. It didn't stop me from smoking when a pack of cigarettes itself had a label from the government warning saying: Smoking kills. Freedom is freedom.",

A bad incident that happened to another person caused by an irresponsible and uncontrolled gambling activity, of course, this is a form of appeal and reminder for us to be more careful in playing gambling. And do we have to fall first in order to know how painful it is. I don't think so, we don't have to experience bad events in gambling to know the negative effects of gambling, as you mentioned \"losing savings and experiencing depression that causes the loss of jobs and livelihoods\".and what others have experienced is enough to make us realize that we must be more careful in playing gambling, so that we can avoid the negative effects of reckless gambling. we must be able to do all forms of anticipation so that we do not experience the same thing as others feel.",

I never read people bad experience online when Iâm new, I just discover it myself when Iâm actually gambling and losing.

Stubborn people will tend to ignore others' experiences and will still try on their own, while more logical and reasonable people will tend to learn from others' mistakes, avoiding to repeat them on their own lives. Therefore, I think it's completely valid for governments to launch such propagandas to spread awareness to the population. Even though not everyone is reached, there will be always some people who will. And if the worst for the lives of those people can be avoided, it's already a valid measure.",

One of the advantage about asking and learning from people is that, it will make you to be aware of the possible challenges that could likely be caused by gambling, so however you will be guided when gambling so that the possibility ofÂ  falling into the same victim with not be possible. But although it all depends on individual because there are people who knows what others pass through in gambling and they still went the same way instead of learning from it.",

We think it cannot happen to us or before it happens to us we would have prevented it.However what we do not know is that when the emotional component of gambling comes into play logic AND rational thinking is thrown away for emotions and irrational thinking. Then we start chasing losses, we gamble more than we can afford to lose and before you know it, it is us telling our own sad stories about how gambling has destroyed our lives.",

While the cigarette packet itself shows how harmful smoking is to health, then people do not stop smoking cigarettes. Even if the price of cigarettes increases or there are major diseases caused by cigarettes, people will still smoke cigarettes. Just as people cannot quit smoking even after seeing the real form of cigarettes, similarly those who become addicted to gambling cannot bring themselves out of gambling even after realizing the negative aspects of gambling. If a person takes gambling for fun then gambling is fine for him but when he becomes addicted to gambling for fun then gambling becomes very bad for him. If we can control our gambling, gambling cannot harm us.",
