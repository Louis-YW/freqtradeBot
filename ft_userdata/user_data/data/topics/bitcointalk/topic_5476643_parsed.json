Also the wallet you’re sending from doesn’t support any means of bumping transaction and it seems they are rebroadcasting the transaction again. If you have private keys to the receiving address I will advice you import it to maybe you electrum wallet if there is funds there you do CPFP. The transaction doesn’t looks like something that will drop now. Also i just check the mempool.space accelerator too it is expensive too around $21, if it’s ok by you try it. But do not use any accelerator apart from this and viabtc i think they just take your money and rebroadcast transaction only Also the total receiving amount is still 0.08478975 and not 0.07628310 has you have said",

Of course, as I said in my previous post, there are many nodes that have dropped OP's transaction from their mempool and should accept a new transaction with the same inputs.",

Good luck mate!  Unfortunately, the TX isn't RBF and still, not a lot of wallets implemented the RBF feature so it's not a big surprise also the fee estimators on the wallet app suck so OP unknowingly send the funds without realizing the mempool status, and trusted the wallet suggested fee.But the good thing is Viawallet provides private keys that can be used to import in electrum like wallet and make new transactions with the fee required at that time once nodes drop this transaction from mempool.",
