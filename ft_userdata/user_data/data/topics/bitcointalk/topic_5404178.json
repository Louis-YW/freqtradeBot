Thus, those who once looked down on this coin may regret it for the rest of their lives. Will the humiliated be exalted?Tell us.It depends on a lot of factors.Personally I still mine Ethereum as the most profitable coin for GPU mining so far but as a side experiment I mine CPU coin Raptoreum which has a really low value in dollars but its developers have said it clear,we don't care how much time it takes,we know we will make it a great coin and I believe them so far that is why I mine this coin as a side experiment.To mine other GPU coins except Ethereum and Ethereum Classic it doesn't make a whole lot of sense so that is why almost everyone mines them.",

Most are POS and they are tokens of ETH which you can’t mine. You buy those on exchanges directly.You can mine other coins which use similar Algos like ETH however the profitability will be very similar. Because most farms have bots which are finding the most profitable coins and they switch their mining around. So there is no secret coin out there.",
