Not to mention that there might not even be a PayPal account...And yeah, if you don't like negative comments don't leave offers on the forum.",

      "body": "Hey, no need to panic. I have been through the same ordeal before. Here's a simple solution. You just need to wait for 160 days and then you can make an account on Payoneer or Wise and withdraw your funds easily to it. Also, anyone buying it will have a hard time before they can't withdraw the fund to an account that doesn't have your PayPal name on it after 160 days.I hope this helps you.",
