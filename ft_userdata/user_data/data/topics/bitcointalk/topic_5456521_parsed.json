Women who like to gamble or men who like to gamble are both related to the courage to take risks'. It is obvious that men are courageous than women. Men like to explore than women. It indirectly means that men are more into gambling. Even in my country that gambling is allowed, out of 10 men, hardly will you see 1 women that is gambling.I do not think gambling sites are looking for gender traffic on their website, what they are after are total traffic irrespective of the gamblers to be men or women. But generally men gamble than women. But I do not know if the research is totally accurate or not though",

We may see women being ethical while gambling and men are not but that doesn't really mean they always win.",

Women who like to gamble are usually women who don't want to work and always think fast to get money from machines. slots, as far as I have seen in my country there are almost a few women who really like slot games even in the office where I work.But it's also true that a woman who likes gambling isn't fit to be a wife because of course even though I'm a gambler I don't want to have a wife who has the same hobbies as me, at least someone can control one of them, for example my wife often reminds me to stop gambling when it's time, so talking about gender issues, almost the average man prefers to gamble than women.",

Women hate being embarrassed in public and they would view losing in public as humiliation. Men are less calculating than women and just jump into any risk, headfirst without a plan or care in the world.  Women are more careful, that's for sure.I have never heard of women being called dirty or unfit for gambling though. That might pertain to gambling addicts regardless of gender",

For example,.When I used to visit my motherly half of my family the whole neighborhood would usually gather together to play cards and lottery at night. Many women participated and even their spouses and children were usually around playing football with other children. And nobody cares because it was viewed as a tradition and as something which brought the community together. On the other hand, I think my family would have frown upon on someone getting used to play on a slot machine too often.",

Maybe why many think that men will be more involved in gambling than women because women are not open when asked and are also used to doing it in secret because of society's judgment that gambling is bad, especially women who do it, but if this is true, the reason could be because women are more afraid losing money where gambling is very possible, and prefer to use their money for certain things or pleasures that can be felt immediately, such as buying items that can be used, such as clothes or bags.",

All these distracts them away from gambling.Apart from thinking how to look good, the ethics of the society somehow categorised some activities for men and some for women. Even if it is not publicly pronounced, it is in everyone's subconscious mind. A guy will be free and even proud to say that he is a gambler. But any woman who goes publicly to declare that he is a gambler will be seen as irresponsible. Another thing we will consider is that women don't know how to handle losses, so when they lose once or twice, there is a very high tendency that they will quit playing",

I could remembered that when it comes to gambling and you gamble lost $500 the reaction you would get from it may not be that effective compared to when a lady of our country (9ja) lost such amount of money. Female are often too attached with emotions when it comes of gambling because they feels very disappointing if what they planned and played didn't go according to their predictions, but naturally gambling activity are often being carried out by men just few ladies gambles.",

So the results of this study may not be accurate because we don't know how many women like to gamble.And casino owners may not think about gender issues because most importantly, casino owners only think about promotion issues.
