  "content": "Had electrum LTC installed years ago but then stopped using it.  Had reinstalled electrum ltc on my windows pc and did the verification of it.  Don't have any coins on electrum but wanted it on my laptop again.Now with electrum LTC, is verification still the same?  Want to use it as a small spending wallet for storing tiny bit of LTC... like probably 20 to 50 dollars worth only.Anyone here done the verification?",
