And how many people do you think hold a lot of wealth, who did buy with KYC, but anonymized them for privacy. Not for committing crime, but just mixed or XMR converted their btc and back to get anonymous bitcoin and are whales. Moving markets but no one, not even the US government, knows who they are?",

      "body": "Well, the whole point of privacy is that such data is hard or impossible to obtain. Adresses that hold a lot of coins could belong to organizations and not a single owner. Individual whales could have dozens of addresses with moderate amounts of coins, instead of putting all eggs in one basket. There are attempts to count the Bitcoin whales, but I seriously question their accuracy.So, this is a question that no one can give a good answer.",

It's really difficult, there are some whales who are using multiple wallets without trace or connection to different wallets but only 1 owner. This is power of decentralization, it's just amazing because you can do it without someone knowing or someone can control your funds.",

If the whale formula is based on the volume of holding, we can count the number of wallets holding the specific volume of bitcoin. With that calculation it is possible to have the number of Whale wallets and that doesn't indicate the number of Whale holders, because a single Whale holder can have multiple wallets.",

After all, we cannot equate addresses with individual owners. It is very possible that addresses that have so much Bitcoin belong to crypto companies and not to individual whales. We also can't accurately tell whether certain whales bought their Bitcoin with or without KYC. It is very possible that whales who have so much Bitcoin made the purchase through OTC or through brokers.",
