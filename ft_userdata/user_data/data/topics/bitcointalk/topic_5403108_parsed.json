In fact, even though for example a tournament will be held in the near future and if I refer to the picture, it looks like the teams in the top three rows are the candidate teams for the title. Maybe over time the changes will be in the squads of each team, but I also think the changes will not be too significant either, because the squads of each team are currently still in their prime.",

But to have a discussion on the sidelines of a big league break, I don't think it's wrong, my friend, as proof that we like football.Quote from: hahay on June 21, 2022, 03:55:52 PMYes, the tournament will be held at least a year from now, discussing who will win the title is still too early for now.

Can they not be counted as champion candidates?",

There is one year until the tournament and it is not certain whether the important players of the teams with strong squads will be injured. Or whether lower tier teams will have surprise performing players. So it is a little difficult to predict. But in general, I see Japan as one of the favorites of the tournament. But there will always be surprises.",

In my opinion, the main problem is that the hottest topic that will be ahead is the World Cup, and against the background of this, the prospects for teams in the Asian Cup (taking into account the fact that some of them will play in the World Cup) are of no interest to anyone until the end of this most important tournament.",

There are 4 pots each pot has 5 countries. But I don't know when the group phase determination draw will take place yet. It is not a problem to discuss from the present, of course it is interesting to discuss the preparations of each country. I saw Pot 4 filled with the country with the five lowest rankings in Asia. If the draw is adjusted then later POT 4 should be prepared to meet the favorite country in Pot 1,2,3. Of course I see maybe the Asian country that is in Pot 1 will be the favorite to win because their Asian Ranking is also at the top. But maybe rankings don't have much of an influence, sometimes when players' mental matches are an important palin factor. Maybe Japan, Iran, Korea and Australia will be the Favorite countries of the champion. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_AFC_Asian_Cup",

Japan is also considering the possibility of participating in the bid to host the 2023 Asian Cup.In my opinion, it is still far from predicting who will be the champion, and all countries still have a chance because there are many good changes from each country.",

From this tournament will be born players with extraordinary talents who will make the name of each country smell good.Out of 24 countries, who will come out as champion?After China withdrew from hosting the Asian Cup, it looks like Australia is a strong candidate to carry out the 2023 later, I think that if Australia will host it, of course it will be advantageous for the Southeast Asian teams because are geographically Â almost the same and close to australia, for champion candidates later in addition to Japan, I personally prefer South Korea to win the 2023 Asian Cup, I think these the two countries currently have a better squad depth than other Asian countries and the factor of the large number of Japanese and Korean players playing in European competitions is certainly a strong reason to favor them to be champions.",

But the Hong Kong team is good enough. I think the Hong Kong team is stronger than Malaysia. And their gameplay is tidier than Malaysia. But we think Saudi Arabia will win the title. Among the Asian countries, Saudi Arabia, Japan and Korea are the strongest teams. And I think Saudi Arabia will win the next Asian Cup.",
