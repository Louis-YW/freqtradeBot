I find that somewhat hard to believe. And then once it reaches 51% it would then use that power to DoS other stakers or would it even double spend? I don't think that would be very wise because it would instatnly destroy the value of the coins, right?2) To stake coins, you need to keep your private keys around, you cannot stake without them. In Proof of Work, you can mine on someone else's behalf, and you can also just mine on your address, without keeping your private key on your mining machine.Yeah this one I see. It makes your privKey more vulnerable, for sophisticated people maybe not a big deal though. That shouldn't be a show stopper either I guess. 3) Proof of Work clearly separate miners (those who own equipment) from whales (those who have coins). In Proof of Stake, whales control the network. That means, in Proof of Stake, the whole network can be ruled by some exchange, just because it is popular, and users deposited a lot of coins there.That actually is the same as in 1). Is it really realistic that an exchange would control like 51% of tokens? I am assuming a fully mature system here. So how do you reply to my challanges?

I don't quite see that. I actually dont think it is realistic for a single entity to control more than 50% of the currency supply in a large network. We even don't have that in the Fiat world. Look, it depends on how you implement PoS.If you are staking with coins, then whoever owns 51% of the STAKED coins controls the majority and can disrupt the chain.ETH counters this with casper ffg and other consensus protocols. In short, all the bad actors will get their ETH slashes(or deleted) until they no longer have the majority  ETH PoS still has some downsides to it, interested to know? (Hint: read the previous line again. That could happen to someone who wasn't a bad actor but was staking on a faulty client which got exploited :p yea, you will lose your ETH if you are staking on a buggy client if it's used by most people)",

If we would have Proof of Stake, then our coin would be already gone.QuoteI mean in Bitcoin it is also the rich people who control more hashing power.In Bitcoin, you have whales, and you have large miners. It is possible to have a large miner with a lot of coins, but because those two functions are clearly separated, getting more coins won't give you more power, unless you consider speculation. Another thing is that some people have 50 BTC coins from the early blocks, but they mined it long time ago on their CPUs. If today they don't own a lot of mining equipment, they cannot just use their past coins to rule Bitcoin, because it is based on Proof of Work, not Proof of Stake, so signing huge amounts is not affecting the chain rules directly.",

I don't quite see that.I would argue, that it’s not just easy, but the natural state most PoS chains will develop into, if no further measures are taken. Let’s take ethereum for example:In a PoS network only the validators can create new blocks, and thus rake in transaction fees and newly created coins. The more coins you stake, the more rewards you will collect.There’s a gate on becoming a validator, you will need 32 eth for this, something most people can’t ever reach. To get around this, you will need to get inside staking pools, but they will take parts of the profit and you have to give up self custody and centralized pools will control a huge amount of coins, while getting paid for it. People with 32 eth don’t have this disadvantage, they earn more with less risk.Then there’s mechanisms like EIP-1559 which burns coins in circulation, that disproportionately favor older holders who don’t move their coins, making their relative stake bigger automatically over time.Now imagine a combination of burning an amount of coins from people who do transactions, and giving out new coins to a small amount of people that have enough capital to stake and just let their coins sit there. This is the worst combination of deflation + inflation, if you wanna keep the distribution fair and healthy.Which creates one result: more and more concentration of wealth at the top, hardcoded inside, large holders are disproportionately favored to get more coins automatically over time, while newbies get punished to even use the chain and loose more and more relative stake over time. It’s not really a question if a small group gets 51%, but when.——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————And note this is just one example, check out the other thread for a deeper analysis on everything.Quote from: BusinessChain on June 25, 2022, 10:12:10 PMWe even don't have that in the Fiat world.

It is not likely that one entity would control half of that, right?Well, first of all the largest PoS market cap is in the dozens of billions; not in the trillions.Even the potentially soon (don't believe so myself) largest market cap coin, Ethereum, is at right around $150 billion. Still a good way off a trillion dollars. On the other hand, that's also a lot of money and still the founders hold more than half of it. So especially in any coin where the initial supply was not mined, but just allocated by the developers and then sold on the market, there is a high probability that half of it sits in the founders' hands, no matter how valuable it becomes, because that lets them keep all of the decision power.Even if it seems practically infeasible, there's no denying that it's always going to be simpler quickly buying and selling some digital tokens (that's what all this is about, right) than buying, setting up, powering, disassembling and selling a ton of hardware that doesn't even exist. So sure; with huge market caps, it becomes expensive to buy 51% of tokens. But the very fact that it's going to be much harder to buy half of the world's SHA256 ASICs automatically makes PoW the logical choice for me.I also believe this is part of what is right now being discussed in [Megathread] The long-known PoW vs. PoS debate, so opening another thread about the same question was kind of stupid to begin with.",

Many PoS coins have more security coded into their allowance of pools than anything btc has, and they are more decentralized and more secure because of it.I suggest looking at the reality of the top 12 crypto coins, and notice that BTC is the only PoW coin.PoW tech is dead on arrival , as due to energy shortages it is becoming more unsustainable by the day.Instead of falling into the nonsense of thinking something is flawed in PoS.Try and decide how will the flaws in PoW be prevented.1. How will BTC , PoW function, when the rolling blackouts are daily, and the politicians ban PoW because they need the energy so people can heat / cool their homes, or hospitals have enough power for surgeries.* China already started a PoW mining ban, Iran just imposed a mining ban even on their licensed BTC miners, * Most of Europe will be having rolling blackouts in less than 3 months, * The US is on the verge of the entire southwest & Midwest having rolling backouts.https://e360.yale.edu/features/bitcoins-intensive-energy-demands-spark-a-crypto-backlashQuoteThe enormous energy demands of Bitcoin mining are prompting some U.S. municipalities to impose moratoriums or outright bans on cryptocurrency facilities. Bitcoin mining activity, critics warn, is leading to electricity price hikes and a revival of dirtier sources of power. Miners seek cheap energy to maximize their profits, but their energy-intensive activities typically drive electricity costs up for everyone.The United States is now home to 40 percent of the world’s crypto-mining business, with one-quarter of that in Texas.Almost all cryptocurrency currencies are mined with proof-of-stake right now.“Bitcoin,” Read says, “is cryptocurrency’s Model T.”The time of plenty is ending, and the wastefulness of PoW can not be allowed for much longer.Now a BTC religious fanatic will just cry fud and ignore the reality that is unfolding, a thinking man will start to wonder how can PoW survive if the utilities can barely keep the power on.A thinking man will also realize, that PoS networks can survive with so little energy, that they could function as secure as before and run off laptops with nothing more than solar powered backups.And if the thinking man thought the above, he realize that is the reason that every smart developer is moving to PoS to avoid the flaws in PoW that can not be fixed.

And that the network still subsidizes miners with 6,25 Bitcoin(125.000€, can be more if we reach higher levels again) every Block(around 10 minutes) to keep their operations running. A harder thinking man knows that a flawed consensus mechanism, can’t provide security or consensus, as well as PoW. And that all of these arguments already got debunked objectively, and got silenced in the other thread.A harder thinking man knows that it’s never smart to base decisions around, how many people are doing something, especially if this decision gives them more power and profits, and is also done to virtue signal to some corrupt politicians.If your decision is based on doomsday fears, following the herd and debunked assumptions, doesn’t this sound a little more cultist?// Edit: Another short question, if PoS is so unstoppable, so where is luna now?

Companies like amazon cloud have backup power systems to keep their stuff running in case of utility power failure.Your ASICS warehouses draw such an insane amount of power , that trying to have a backup power system for anything over 15 minutes utterly destroys any profit margin. Which is why you don't see any BTC miners running off nothing but solar in the desert and using batteries to run the other 19 hours of the day when solar is below peak efficiency. They literally can't afford it. Even being on utility power PoW Miners are in the hole below $28K, so without constant free Venture Capital (which is drying up) to keep them afloat, look for more miners to sell all of their btc before their bankruptcies this fall.  The only real question is will the BTC PoW miners go broke and death spiral the btc network before the Governments can permaban PoW mining and death spiral the BTC network.  Either way you are going to see BTC in a death spiral , if BTC maintains PoW as it's choice for consensus.While PoW is awaiting a deathspiral, from bankruptcy or Government Bans, PoS continues to evolve , not really caring what happens with PoW death.https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/proof-of-stake-delegated-proof-of-stake-consensus-mechanismQuoteVarieties of Proof of Stake: LPoS, PPoS, HPoS, PoVThere are several variations of Proof-of-Stake, each with its own solution to achieve effective, resource-efficient network governance.QuoteProof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms were designed to address inefficiencies inherent in conventional Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols. Instead of relying on crypto mining, PoS blockchains use nodes selected based on their stake of platform tokens to verify and record transactions. The majority of new blockchain projects use some form of PoS consensus mechanism, as it is significantly more scalable, flexible, and environmentally friendly than PoW iterations.Funny how every sane person can realize the superiority of Proof of Stake, but all a btc cultist can see is fud.  https://fortune.com/2021/05/27/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-proof-of-stake-environment-carbon/QuoteEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin says long-awaited shift to ‘proof-of-stake’ could solve environmental woeshttps://www.stilt.com/blog/2021/10/what-is-cardano/QuoteAnother popular and unique feature is Cardano’s proof-of-stake consensus protocol which is designed to reduce energy expenditure during the block production process. This protocol includes an infinitely scalable consensus mechanism. Cardano’s energy efficiency and ability to scale makes mining easy and ensures quick transaction times on the platform.With Cardano, you can send and receive funds instantly with minimal transaction fees applying. Want to compare PoW verses PoS transaction fees.Bitcoin PoW peak transaction fee $54 , while Cardano PoS peak transaction fee of $2.85 .https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-average-transaction-fees-lowest-in-two-years-at-1-04QuoteBitcoin’s average transaction fees peaked in December 2017, standing at $54.638. The sudden spike in the transaction fees at the time mirrored the significant decline in the Bitcoin network hash rate. https://messari.io/asset/cardano/chart/txn-fee-avgQuoteAverage Transaction Fees on 06/19/2022$0.17Want to compare transaction performance of PoW BTC against PoS Cardano.Bitcoin processes 4.6 transactions per second.Cardano currently processes approximately 250 transactions per second , and is going to increase in the future. Cardano is over 54 times the transaction capacity of btc.If after reading the above, you can't understand why PoS is superior to PoW, well my friend you make an excellent btc cultist, and why should we let reality interfere with your fantasy Delusions.",

Cardano is over 54 times the transaction capacity of btc.I do, Bitcoin decided to scale in layers to stay decentralized. There it outscales cardano by a lot. Lightning has more than 80.000 channels at the moment, each channel can do 500 transactions per second. Which gives it a theoretical troughput of 40.000.000 transactions per second.

Hash power is limited worldwide, it’s always a competition with Bitcoin indirectly for it, which makes it almost impossible. (But sorry ik you won’t accept actual reasons)This is the most important point he doesn't seem to understand.Being hard to create a new PoW coin from scratch and getting people to point hashpower at it, is obviously a strength for Bitcoin. Not a downside.How can it be good if you have a consensus mechanism that allows to freely pump out shitcoin after shitcoin, with no effort or costs? How does that make them valuable? It doesn't. In fact, it makes them less valuable. If there were 10 PoW coins, each with decent hashpower going into them, it could be argued that Bitcoin would have more competition and thus lower value.Another point that he doesn't seem to understand about his sacred CoinMarketCap top 10 list, is that while only 2 or 3 coins are PoW, it doesn't mean that there are 7 or 8 PoS coins in there.Last time I counted, less than half were PoS actually, since there was a token and Tether which has neither consensus mechanism and is centrally issued and controlled.Quote from: tadamichi on June 26, 2022, 09:04:29 PMNow what we’re seeing in reality is that many founders don’t go trough the hassle of choosing PoW, they just pick PoS instead(not the only reason).Exactly; it's easy and cheap to pump out PoS coins. There literally is no cost. Maybe get a developer to download another coin's codebase off GitHub and change the project name and there you have a new PoS coin. Just like that, it will pump out a block every X minutes, without anyone doing anything. This is the definition of basically Monopoly money. Even if nobody would stake, with no risks and no chances of slashing or anything like that, blocks would be produced and coins would be issued. How can that be a good thing?",
