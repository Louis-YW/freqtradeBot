The optimism on winning huge multiplier is they selling point of this game that's why many players keep playing this despite a terrible result in general.I can count using my finger my huge win on this game while I lose a lot on this game so in general this game is disaster for me just like you. I still preferred blackjack and sports bet compared to slot games if we are talking about the main game to play. I remember spending 4hrs of auto spin on slot game and end up in more than 50% loss to my bankroll plus migraine due to the animation.",

Of course, it‚Äôs not that I didn‚Äôt win anything, but there weren‚Äôt even any coincidences. I tried it purely out of curiosity without any hope of winning and it was initially clear that this was a marketing trick to attract new gamblers. Unfortunately, this trick didn't work for me. In general, my experience of playing slots was also unsuccessful. I gradually squandered the entire modest deposit that I had, step by step, and lost. Therefore, I consider this a waste of time and money. And if I hit the jackpot (which is almost impossible), would I have the opposite opinion?",

      "body": "When there is a wager requirement or any other type of withdrawal condition, be aware that things typically don't work out properly. These casinos are very aware of what they are doing, so they won't just hand out 77 free spins to any new player that signs up, because there's a good chance that many of them will come out on top and take home a few bucks from the bonus spins. The free spin is more of a marketing ploy to advertise their services and entice people to join and register with the casino and use the services of the casino. I always prefer to bet on sports games that I know a little bit about rather than playing slot games since I have lost money on them a few times and I just don't feel like it's my kind of game.",

      "body": "Free spins or bonuses should be the waste of time, not slot. As slot games still provide huge profits. But, you may not have won because the free spins are given to players to help market the casino. They expect you to wager on your deposit after losing the $55, as the house also want profits. They need your funds to maintain their website and settle marketing bill and other bills. You'd see that while they care to provide relaxation for players, the casino indirectly take money from players. To run the business, that's where the losses go. Hence, if the house edge isn't well calculated the casino will run out of business. I've read different threads about the irrelevance of bonuses and free spins. It's never worth the time spent, most people lose out with no profit. The initial limit before withdrawal, illustrates the aim of the free spin. To attract players, then encourage them to wager money. Logically, it's impossible to win up to the amount required to withdraw, using 77 free spins. It's just a marketing strategy and many players will fall for it.",

Actually it isnt really about having wasting money since its not your money at all since it was given as a bonus. The thing you do only spend is only is time. So that you do expect is that they do really only asking out some easy way on cashing out? Of course they would be setting wagering condition on which you could really be able to needed up to be reached out before you could cash out. They cant really just put up it up so easy because thats a huge expense for them for players or to those testers would really be able to cash out.Dont get frustrated because you have did your best on trying to cash out. There's no way that we could easily hit up those thresholdnot unless we are really that very lucky. So its better not to expect or anticipate much.",

I myself experienced it, I played gambling in the middle of the night with the aim of getting rid of boredom but because the spin was good, it made me even more interested in continuing to play it, unconsciously I had spent a lot of time gambling until the morning, and it was very beyond reason, I did not think that slot gambling would take a long time.Maybe other people also feel the same way, with hours of time when playing slots, because maybe every good spin makes the money available not decrease but instead increase and the pull and encouragement that is felt to continue gambling without thinking about time.",

I have once in my life actually managed to withdraw something like 70 bucks i won just by getting free spins by joining. Requirements to gamble weren't too bad, but i can't even remember what casino it was. Later after that i took some free bonus offers and realized how rare those opportunities are. Either requirements are beyond ridiculous or i am just not winning anything.But in slots overall i have been dangerously lucky. I recently stopped winning and decided i needed to take a break. And what i mean by dangerously lucky is that when you are winning a lot, you get hooked. And start to believe it's more common or easy to win. This make you put more and more money in until reality hits, and it often hits when it's too late and i wanted to gamble more to get ath again. Or even back to the starting point. I have learned the hard way that gambling more to win back your money isn't a good attitude, so i am just taking a break from slots. I will eventually play them again, but now i've changed to sports betting.",

Being patient or betting persistently is only going to make you lose slower and with a more steady pace actually. Often times the aim of playing slots is to get a high multiplier, but the chances to get such multiplier are so slim that it doesn't matter what the statistics say about RTP or volatility. As with any game, you should just play slots with amounts you can afford to lose and for the thrill of it, nothing more. Also, a big mistake people make with slots is to actually go after big wins others make. We have to keep in mind that these wins are often made with money given from the casino's marketing team and it's not unlikely that the seed given to these public players like streamers isn't entirely random too. So all in all, slots might seem appealing, but those actually after good chances to win would be better off with games like crash, dice or even robot blackjack. When looking to win, actually go after the lower house edge other than a game's looks.",
