      "body": "NotATether nails it right on the head. Bitcoin doesn't have to keep up with other currencies. However, it's almost guaranteed that fiat will continue to be subject to inflation, while Bitcoin will eventually become either deflationary or very marginally inflation resistant. That's the way it's designed. Now, we currently see quite a lot of volatility, but when block rewards are either very very low or completely gone, that should also bring the volatility down. At the moment, we do see a little bit of inflation since we're introducing new Bitcoin into circulation, although note that isn't being printed off like traditional fiat currencies, instead it has already been pre allocated. So, we theoretically know how much Bitcoin that'll exist, and we know that beyond a certain point inflation should be a thing of the past, if you're using Bitcoin. However, that's not to say that'll it'll \"keep up\" with inflation hikes in other currencies, and nor is it expected too.",

The market is created by people and most of them act emotionally. The Bitcoin market isn't different. When there are pessimistic news and FUD, the BTC market reacts. When the stock markets goes down, the crypto market goes downs as well.I wouldn't call the most volatile financial asset \"resistant\". Volatility and resistance are two completely different things.Interest rate hikes will definitely cause the crypto winter to take longer. We need fresh newly printed money, in order to pump the Bitcoin/crypto prices. I'm sure that Bitcoin will survive the Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, and I'm sure that the Federal Reserve doesn't want a long term recession. That's why the interest rates might be lowered after a year or two.",

      "body": "From an economic standpoint, Bitcoin was created to minimize the inflation with a fixed supply and thereby increase the purchasing power over the period of time. With FED funds rates getting higher, there might be a huge decrease in the rate at which money flows in the economy and as a result it will obviously prevent individuals or businesses to spend the money on assets such as stock markets. But OTOH, Bitcoin or crypto market in general is depended directly on the amount of technological innovations happening behind the scenes and is not related to the stock market. The recent rise in the prices of Bitcoin or crypto market in general can be tied to the reduction in block rewards or an increase of traders interest towards Defi markets and doesn't relate to stock prices.Moreover, it is generally advisable to keep converting fiat into bitcoin and spend them for cheaper goods whenever necessary. As the supply is limited and the number of coins in circulation reducing on a rapid rate, Bitcoin will rise higher regardless of interest rates until volatility reduces.",

Stocks had ATH 2 months before first interest rate increase. Market always estimates next 2-6 months. not presence. Presence was calculated in few months ago. So if we are about to see inflation ATH (and the end of interest rates raising) in about 4 months ... its possible that bitcoin already bottomed in. People will continue to distrust pump because of FED raising rates until BTC pump to 50k and FED start to print back again because of short term inflation drop. They will jump in right before market starting to evaluate next 6 months in which inflation will come back and crash markets once again because high inflation will be with us for next decade but not like people think. It will not be a straight line. We will see couple waves of inflation, disinflation, maybe even short periods of deflation. Just like in 1980. Assets will go crazy. The chart shows the SP500 and US inflation. Sorry for the % scale, but this was the only way I could show both charts on one picture. Tiker for US inflation on tradingview is USIRYY, if someone can show it better.3 inflation waves, the first to 6%, the second to 12%, the third to 15%. The low of the 1974 stock market matched the peak in inflation, the same in 1970. If bitcoin is 2 months before stocks ...Nowadays, many economists also argue that the peak of the current phase is near and warn against bullwhip effect, which may even lead to temporary deflation. Than printing will start, the stocks/crypto will return close to ath, than inflation will return, panic in the markets will return, and so on.The bullwhip effect theory, which will force fed to print again, already has its confirmation in this chart (stocks vs sales):And FED is printing for last 100 years. Speed up in 1971, go crazy after 2008, go insane after 2019. Its not like they are going to stop. They need it to survive. They will go back printing and destroying fiats as soon as economy will allow that.And present 1.75% interest rate or even 2.75% after a while is still far below 9.1% inflation. Its still not the place where you want to have your money in. So its not sucking liquidity from markets as harsh as many may think.",

In my opinion, the number of people waiting to buy Bitcoin after the chaos that will occur in the market with the FED's interest rate hike may be too high.Regardless, I think we are experiencing a temporary depression for Bitcoin. A store of value that has limited supply, that offers the possibility of money transfer without the need for third parties, and that has been operating successfully for 13 years, should have been in a better position in the current global crisis. I realize that I am disappointed when I evaluate our experiences regardless of technical and fundamental parameters, but I continue to trust Bitcoin and its promises to humanity.",

However, if you do have that lump sum, you have a choice. If you believe in Bitcoin because of its characteristics, and you believe it will continue to appreciate in value over the long term, it's better to put it all in.

The US's economy hasn't reached recession yet. They could be in a recession now, we just don't know until the next GDP numbers get released. Negative GDP growth will shock the market, Bitcoin goes tumbling. And I think that the price bottom for bitcoin has already been passed, and here's why. The driver for inflation is the rise in energy prices, including the rise in the price of electricity - and this directly affects the cost of mining. Now the average price of mining one bitcoin in the US is about 21 thousand dollars, that is, miners in the US work at the socket level. Bitcoin mining in Europe has long been uneconomical. If you look around the world as a whole (and this is logical because bitcoin is a global network), it turns out that there are very few places where bitcoin mining still brings super profits due to very cheap electricity against the backdrop of a government that is relatively loyal to cryptocurrencies. On average, the situation is about the same as in the US, maybe a little better. With a global recession approaching, it is difficult to assume that miners will be able to sustain losses for long enough, they need at least a minimal operating profit to cover current expenses.As for raising the Fed's discount rate, in order to cope with inflation, it is necessary to raise the rate not by 0.75%, but by at least 7.5%, which of course the Fed will not do, because it will cause an immediate collapse of the economy. Therefore, now the Fed is more likely not fighting inflation, but simply trying to be a little ahead of the ECB (hoping that this will be enough if the EU gets even worse and then the US dollar looks good against the background of the euro).",

You have a very short event horizon, the near-zero discount rate is a phenomenon of recent history and has only been observed since 2008.
