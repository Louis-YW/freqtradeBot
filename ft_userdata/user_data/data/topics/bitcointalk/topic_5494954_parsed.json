  "content": "I overheard a discussion between two friends and one was telling the other that Bitcoin is a scam and that a lot of people preached about the halving and how people could cashout from it. The other friend was trying to convince him to continue holding his asset but he refused and replied that nothing would stop him from selling the coins he's holding. When I heard that man mentioned cashing out from the halving, I understood that he might know about Bitcoin but he's not properly enlightened concerning it. A lot of expectations were cut short after the halving event cause most people expected Bitcoin to set a new height of $80k but then it didn't even get close to the previous all time high and have reduced below $60k currently. I think people shouldn't get discourage by that, though I didn't experience other halvings cause I had zero knowledge about Bitcoin then but i think something similar have occurred before in one of the previous halving where Bitcoin price didn't go up as expected but later traced back and went up after some period, a lot of people might begin to panic and sell their coins but I still see this an opportunity to buy more Bitcoin and for those who are not opportuned to do so, holding is the best option, please correct me if you think am wrong",

Worst case scenario, they will go to court with you for wrong financial advice etc.Best case scenario, the investment goes well - they will praise themself for investing and maybe you'll get a \"thank you\".Even if you put \"disclaimers\" that they can lose everything, the anger will be as high as the hype they had when investing.As for buying/selling opportunities, each trader has his own \"strategy\", less advanced ones follow others but in the end it's as good as \"systems\" for winning a lottery / slot machine \"jackpot\".What you need to have is rules, iron rules that can't be bend like selling when certain asset goes down more than x percentage, otherwise you're just holding for your dear life on a stormy weather.",

This is nothing new and it will happen in every bear run.You cant stop people from saying bad and from dumping their coins at a loss during such periods. Our target is to increase our stash of coins and hence we have to buy at the low when the dropping rate aka deceleration reduces, so you will be buying at a discount from the weak hands.Let the prices fall, make money from prediction games predicting these losses and dont fret, because cycles are the normal thing in crypto.",

The other friend was trying to convince him to continue holding his asset but he refused and replied that nothing would stop him from selling the coins he's holding.Your friends represent 2 types of BTC-investors:1 - Absolutely not understanding and not trying to understand the fundamental principles of bitcoin pricing, not to mention the technical aspects and capabilities of this financial asset. This category is only interested in quick and instant profits.2 - Reverse opposite. This category may show genuine interest in technology (at least superficially).Quote from: Princess Leah on May 01, 2024, 03:59:05 PM When I heard that man mentioned cashing out from the halving, I understood that he might know about Bitcoin but he's not properly enlightened concerning it. A lot of expectations were cut short after the halving event cause most people expected Bitcoin to set a new height of $80k but then it didn't even get close to the previous all time high and have reduced below $60k currently.Bitcoin is very unpredictable and, as if on purpose, doesn't live up to expectations, changing the “trajectory of his flight” in a completely opposite direction from expectations. Everything would be too simple if it was enough to “buy before halving -> sell after -> take profit”. The cryptomarket knows how to arrange surprises.

I have a unanimous opinion about it, like you, that profit is always in front of patience. I mean, if someone doesn't have the ability patience, obviously he can get the chance to get back with a high profit.  To b honest To the extent that I have knowledge about the market, I think that this time there is a much better scenario than the previous experience. Those who have seen the previous halving know that after the implementation of halving, this price dynamic decline is a grab opportunity, There should not be panic, it is best to hodl and to buy more is a wise stance in current sentiment.  Experienced traders are looking for the opportunity to get a slightly discounted price of Bitcoin in the bull market. The accumulation of bitcoin is yet to be found. So don't be scared, it's nothing more than normal, they say \"healthy correction is necessary for the next jump\".",
