  "content": "Onchain gambling is gone, it was one of the first ways to gamble our bitcoins... The casinos used to be totally anonymous, to the point where you don't have to create an account on the casino to place a bet. And that was what I call freedom. When I join to this crypto world in 2014, there use to be 2 casinos with this feature, their name was Lucky bit and Satoshi Bones. And their games have a unique address where you can send your coins and get back to the bet result to the address where the bet comes from. That was how they didn't ask for an account to place a bet.Those engines were provably fair, and the max wins were up to 100BTC in lucky bit (in that time BTC was at $500 approx) but still huge. The new casinos are crazy with their KYC rules and customer support. They hold users' money as if they were the owners of the money, and you can find all the same slots games bringing a lack of original and probably fair games.Maybe regulation brings us to the current situation, but in the past was funnier, fair, and legit. And that's why I miss the old onchain gambling.Do you remember those old casinos, and what are your thoughts about the current gaming sites compared with the old ones?",

It was a shame that it was taken down due to attacks against that style of taking bets as a result of high transaction fees allowing users to place bets that would never confirm both ways, and then double spending the losing bet while confirming the winning bet with higher fee transactions. It’s a shame that this method of gambling was attacked and abandoned before it could be developed further. This is exactly the sort of thing that I point to as an example of why Bitcoin has actually lost use cases over the years instead of gaining them. We’re ironically centralizing ourselves as a community as frequently as we can. I don’t blame casinos though, nobody wants to risk having you business bankrupted by the downfalls of the Bitcoin network.",

Majority of gambling platforms in this recent time do ask for simple KYC where other tend not to consider that as a requirement but the gambler will be limited to a certain on of fund that can be deposited or withdraw. This reason alone makes people to go in search of gambling platforms that are legit and has no KYC",

By the way directbet is the best in my opinion personally.Haven't experienced this type of gambling but I believe the reason why it was popular in the old days was because the restriction was not yet there as crypto gambling was still in the early days of the market. But as crypto gambling is getting interest from the community, the restrictions that come with it also changes. And for these casinos to comply with the license they are applying for, to make their business legit, they need to ask some information from their clients owed to this AML laws. Also, with fees getting expensive, I don't think the gambler will want to pay the fee every time he will bet. Because in the current situation, the gambler will only pay the fee upon withdrawal from the site. But during his games or bets, there's no corresponding fee to pay.",

Yes, it's at the cost of KYC rules BUT you can't deny that with the order that those casinos give out, most of the experience users felt has been a lot more comfortable/better for the most part (emphasis on most). I reckon it wouldn't be that bad for a group/company to develop those types of casinos again, but I don't think it can be kept afloat since I don't think a lot of users would actually use it since the majority of the people would rather enjoy a comfortable (and a bit more secure than others) type of experience.",

There are still casinos without KYC but it seems to me that we are on an unstoppable trend to fully regulated crypto gambling with KYC. This also means more taxes to be paid by the houses and a lower return to the player or a higher HE, however you want to look at it.It is not all bad, because it is assumed that with greater regulation there is greater security against scams and greater player protection, with mandatory gambling resposible features, for example, but the past that you long for is not coming back.",

Online gambling casinos were not really that much of an issue back then, when crypto was still fresh and new. You could easily use Bitcoin without having to worry about this regulation or that regulation.Nowadays without decentralization of gambling via smart contracts I do not see much of a future for online crypto gambling, as regulations just keep getting tighter and tighter...The best option is just to keep upgrading until we reach the point of balance again. I still believe in Bitcoin and I am sure it will overcome this annoying government-placed obstruction of freedom.",

As a gambler, I would prefer off chain games/casinos. Simply because it is easier to access and play, I do not need to make transaction for every bet. Off chain gambling gives me more different games to play at single time and single place. Onchain gambling was great but it was very limited, mostly people can play 1 single game only in a gambling site. When it comes to regulation or something related to KYC, yes OnChain based gambling is better than Offchain.",

The past week a see how a user get his account locked for abusing the promotion in one casino. So if you take all the promos now you are an abuser, and that's nonsense for me. If the casino feels the users are abusing the promos, then they should take out the promos.",
