Trading requires a lot of patience and perseverance, otherwise those traders will end up losing in the market because they consistently trade even if the market is against on their trades.However, there are also responsible traders who really know the value of trading, and that trading will only be successful and profitable if they are aware how to deal with the market's volatility, and that they remain patient and calm when the market is not good to trade.",

For those who already understand the basics of trading, there may be no difficulties in trading, it's just that many of them have the wrong mindset from the start because they consider trading as a way to get rich quickly. If they have a mindset like this I am sure 90% of traders will fail. And things like this every year there are always many people who enter the world of trading with the same mindset. Before trading, your mindset about trading should be changed first.Apart from that, they must also be able to understand trading psychology or trading psychology. Because these two things are a way for traders to get consistent profits but also a way to recover when they fail in trading. Because with psychological trading we can overcome trauma, overcome fear, overcome FOMO, control money management, and control risk and reward so that traders become successful and successful but also calm traders.",

That's why I'm getting annoyed by the people on the internet who are flexing their luxury and achievements from trading, which is their strategy to attract potential investors. It would look like trading is easy, but it never is. They show the good things about trading but never the bad side of it. You see, they have also lost trades, which is very common, but they are showing that they are not to attract investors to avail themselves of their services, such as signals, or that they are the ones that will handle other traders trading accounts. Trading will never be easy, so if someone here is new to trading, then better think again. If you can handle the risk and the hardship of trading, then you will survive, but if you do not have a weak heart for trading, then better build yourself first.",
