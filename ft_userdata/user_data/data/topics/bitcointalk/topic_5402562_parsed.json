  "content": "People have been confused and some people did a very bad research about Avalanche because some people claimed Avalanche is not a capped asset. But it is not true, because Avalanche is a capped asset. It can be seen in Avalanche’s whitepaper. Avalanche is capped at 720M Coins. https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalancheAvalanche is a really scarce coin and it is also a deflationary Coin because transaction fees are burned. Yes, transaction fees are really burned: Burned transactions fees are available on Avalanche but not on Bitcoin, so Avalanche is even more scarce. People always need to do some basic research and here’s a great example of good research because researching if a project is capped and if yes, at how much coins a project is capped and if transaction fees are burned, is very important to research. A very detailed guide how scare Avalanche is can be researched here: Why Avalanche (AVAX) has the potential to be an incredible store of value: https://medium.com/avalanche-hub/why-avalanche-avax-has-the-potential-to-be-an-incredible-store-of-value-8ef6e68cbb60Doing our research here is a big step to finding out important information about Altcoins.",

      "body": "Research about a cap of a coin must be our most important education. If a coins is not capped, it will lose value pretty fast over time. A good example of a capped coin is Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is capped at 21,000,000 coins. A bad example of a uncapped coin is Polakdot, because Polkadot is not capped at all. Avalanche is also a good coin.",

Cause from the beginning avax already set a capped token supply of 720m which will never change forever. This was clarify by professor Emin by those who misguided about the tokenomics of it. Ive been an early investors of avax, and knowing this details should been pass to a lot of new investors.",

But it is not true, because Avalanche is a capped asset. It can be seen in Avalanche’s whitepaper: Avalanche is capped at 720M Coins. Avalanche is definitely an interesting project and i am thinking about investing a small amount into that project now that all coins have lost so much value in the last few weeks. I had a relatively small amount of Waves that i sold a few weeks ago when they were at around 50 USD so i now have a bunch of USDN lying around in my WavesDex that are waiting to be reinvested. The big problem is that USDN is also not really a stable coin it seems, because at the moment it's value is at around 0,94 USD and i just don't wanna lose 6% by just converting USDN to USDT or USDC. Once i can swap my USDN to a reasonable price then i will buy some Avalanche i think.",

It's crazy but some people have said it. Doing research seems to be very diffucult for some people because I agree to you, it's very easy to know and to search.But some people said, Avalanche is not capped.So I wrote my text and when someone uses Google Search, he will find my article and see it: Avalanche is a capped coin!It's always about education, bro!Quote from: Jackl87 on June 15, 2022, 12:26:52 PMQuote from: Master of Shitcoins on June 14, 2022, 11:18:40 AMPeople have been confused and some people did a very bad research about Avalanche because some people claimed Avalanche is not a capped asset.

Once i can swap my USDN to a reasonable price then i will buy some Avalanche i think.Yes, prices haven been lowering massively in recent times and it's a good opportunity for buy right now. Maybe prices can even go down lower, we don't know. I also hope, your stablecoin will be stable again, to avoid some loss of your funds, bro. It was from some days ago, maybe it has stabilized again right now? It's very hard times for DeFi, we all know and it will be a test for all crypto currencies.

When times goes by, a very scarce coin will grow in value, while an inflational coin will lose in value constantly. And people will abandon inflational coins step by step and only select capped coins. It will be huge difference.",

Bitcoin is only so extremely succesfull because people like to keep Bitcoin. It's called HODL. And why people like to keep BTC? Because BTC is a very good store of value. And why BTC is a good store of value? Because it's a scarce and capped asset, it's limited to 21 000 000 Bitcoins.  Bitcoin can't be inflated. 1 BTC = 1 BTC.",
