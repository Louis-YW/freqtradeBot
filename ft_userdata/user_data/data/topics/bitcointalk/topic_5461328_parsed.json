It's not clear if this is intentional or an artifact of the bustabit v1 code that was copied to generate the game outcomes. Incidentally bustabit currently offers a flat 1% house edge, making it a strictly more economically better place to gamble. And the new moneypot.com offers crash in a very bustabit v1 style odds, with a house edge starting at only 0.1% (but based on a much more complex formula involving the casinos bankroll).",

I think it was mentioned in the video at the beginning that according to the formula it is about 3%, that is, in about 3% of cases there will be an instant crash.",

I just hope that allmost 9 minute video isn't too much. Best way to explain what you want to say is to actually learn it while saying it. This video is so packed with information about crash and the probabilistic background that powers it that I feel like if I nerd out on my gambling circle and tell them that crash is a game where you can't high roll cause you'll be stacking the odds up against you if you go frugal, explaining it on the fly will be better and I would be able to persuade some of my friends too, maybe even try the thing mid-conversation to prove my point lol. We used to do this with the monty hall problem, as well as with minesweeper, now with crash which we don't really play that much but is interesting nonetheless we might have a very fruitful discussion.",

If they start with a bad approach, want to gamble to get rich and especially to beat casinos, they will pay very high cost.The point with crash games is gamblers will be more greed when their adrenaline increases more and they will not stop before their spaceships, cars, whatever in the crash game actually crashes and explodes. With crash games, I only play with minimal amount allowed by the casino as I only try my luckiness with small amount and high multiplier.

Crash has a house edge because it has an instantant crash which gives an auto lose on all bets no matter how early your cashout setup. This is same with dice losing at 99.99% winning chance rate. Having this kind of loses while betting small amount will put you already on great disadvantage.Also casino will not make the game open source code if they are not confident that the game is unbeatable. There’s no way someone can compute the crash algorithm and predict the next multiplier because it’s pure random. I assume the video is just a computation on how crash game determines based on the previous games and not using the future games.",

The game can be very useful for the ones who are lucky because they can really beat out the mathematics of the game with their luck.I have seen players who have made more than $10k per bet, and I was also betting during those sessions when I saw those players. I have even saw some players having multiplier of at least 1000x, and yes the player that got the huge multiplier placed many bets before getting a 1000x win. I remember the bet was $2 dollars and the guy earned more than $2k with that bet.I have personally been unlucky with that game because most of the times I have lost money instead of gaining anything, but I must say that the game is quite addicting, and the ones with low hands will often tend up losing everything instead of getting anything. The luck factor is part of that game as well, but still the mathematics also makes some sense.",
