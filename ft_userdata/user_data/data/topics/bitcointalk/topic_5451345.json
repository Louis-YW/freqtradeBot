  "content": "So while browsing on TikTok, I've seen a video explaining about Bitcoin and how it works with a cartoon-style animation. It's pretty basic information and it was explained in a simple way, making it easy to understand for beginners who want to know or explore Bitcoin. Actually, I find an animation style of explaining what Bitcoin is and how it works easily. It also catches the attention of other people who aren't into it. Also, with this style, it won't be too boring to understand Bitcoin. It might just be a brief explanation but compared to when you're just reading some explanation online, this is more interesting.

I'm just not sure if it's for kids since I don't know if it would make sense to teach Bitcoin to children, might be a good idea but it could be a good foundation since saving money was a good start.",

What do you think?That must be a great way to teach bitcoin, but I still believe it cannot cover all of the information needed to understand about bitcoin. Learning about bitcoin is not a child’s play and requires complete focus in order to grasp the concept completely. Illustrating in a cartoon is not a bad idea, but it has a lot of constraints that are unnecessary when learning about it. However, word-for-word or step-by-step factual information regarding bitcoin is more vital and beneficial to use than an animated film.",

      "body": "I'm actually not sure if Satoshi Nakamoto really created Bitcoin because he/she/they were \"fed up with government money\" and \"the corruption, the manipulation.\" Although Satoshi made some unfavorable remarks as to fiat's design and flaws, nowhere in the whitepaper did Satoshi mention that Bitcoin is a solution to government's failures. As a matter of fact, I particularly like how the whitepaper appears pretty much neutral. If one is to read the whitepaper and appreciate it vis-à-vis the strong statements made by enthusiastic Bitcoin supporters against governments, one might begin to wonder whether they're on the same page. Bitcoin was created to solve a real-world problem; it was designed in such a way as to \"allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\"[1][1] https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf",

Because not all people like to watch the animation and agree with what the animation said. For me, which like a simple way, watching animation videos is enough to bore me especially when created by unprofessional person, so the result is not perfect to delivering important points. But the video you have shared is enough good for me, I got the point and understand what the content he said. Maybe I will continue to watch video like this, and maybe try to learn and begin to create the same themes.",

I am unsure that those cartooned videos have correct information and so doubtful about their technical accuracy.We shouldn't assume that animated programs or materials are strictly for children. After all, adults also watch animated films and they are very interesting. Even in colleges and universities some academic materials or information are animated to simplify the content for easy understanding. One of the reasons behind the animation is to convey vital information simply and entertainingly making the learners assimilate the information in a relaxed manner. Instead of spending hours watching movies, looking at this animated material about Bitcoin in one's spare time is not a bad idea. I bet you will learn something new. This doesn't dispute the fact that we shouldn't stop reading as adults.",

Notably, I'm glad things are beginning to take a better turn and it's good to have more of these educative contents out there for kids (many of them want to learn \"this Bitcoin\").Going forward, I think it's also good to have such contents on YouTube and Twitter to further spread them out.",

Of course, when you're already familiar with it, that's where you can go dive deeper into Bitcoin.

For other beginners searching for some basic information on Bitcoin, it will indeed be boring to read a bunch of texts with unfamiliar terms. Although we can't fully rely on animations to learn about Bitcoin, I think this is a good starting point. Also, the amount of people using social media, it's a great way to boost Bitcoin awareness and adoption.

The point I'm trying to make is that the video should not just explain how to learn about or explore bitcoin, but it should also explain the risks involved, so that those who are free to do so can join and those who are unwilling to take the risk can leave. This is due to the fact that there is a very high risk involved in investing or putting money into something these days that you don't fully comprehend, like those who didn't know anything it. I'm not saying the video is a bad idea; it's a smart approach to help people grasp bitcoin simply, and I'm sure people will like the tiktok video information more than anything else.",
