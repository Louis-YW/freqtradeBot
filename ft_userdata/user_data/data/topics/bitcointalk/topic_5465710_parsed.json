  "content": "OK Folks just to be clear I'm not pointing to any specific service or entity. Actually I am askingI don’t know if they are miners, mixers, exchanges or just spammers bumping overall other users fees?In the past week, fees have been bouncing around 10 to 20 sat/vB (I know this is less than previous congestion caused by the ordinals BRC-20 ). And It is pretty normal for it to fluctuate during the course of the day,  I'm cool with it.Graph:But here's the thing, there's a bunch of these dust transactions that are paying more in fees than they're worth. And I'm not talking about a few, I've seen loads of them.Also i’ve seen those dust TX with status of “Added”, This comes from the audit function on mempool.space.According to the mempool.space documentation that only means that those were mined directly by that miner and the TX were broadcasting privatelyQuoteADDEDA transaction is highlighted blue if it is not present in the expected block, present in the actual block, and also either:far out of the expected feerate range, meaning the miner may have intentionally prioritized the transactionnot in the mempool at all, meaning the miner may have accepted the transaction out-of-bandI know that miners need to maximize their profit, but common this is affecting regular users.Recently some block with more than 7500 TX was minnedhttps://mempool.space/block/000000000000000000028ee2f1668e346cdf974cf94e302dd02998439d4ec30dFrom those more of 7500  TX around 97% are dust amounts.Code:QTY TX : Output amount1632  : 5464185  : 2941470  : 295To be exact, 7287 Dust TX in a single blockMy theory is that some miners are spamming the blockchain on purpose incrementing the average fee to profit (At the end if they are going to keep the fees for themselves, then doesn’t matter if they pay more fee than the output amount)All this is just my speculation and I can be wrong, just my two satoshis.What do you all think about this?",

If you filter the said block on the \"OrdinalsOrdinalTx List\", you’ll see that they are all similar to this (*):https://ordinals.com/inscription/d9d0920f37c1ba8688a43a4d01943132fe98319bb271e72c4011b7798caf3354i0Ordinals are averaging between 9 and 12 sat/vB per day over the past week which have risen a fair share from the 6 to 7 sat/vB during august, and since they’ve been occupying and average of 40+% of the blocksize over the past few days (it had been in the 20%-30% range for some days previously), I figure this all sums up the current fees, still distant to those that were around some months ago, but still.(*) BRC-20 json files.

In the side-market where they trade the garbage with each other, they don't care about paying high fees as long as they either scam the money from someone in their trade or hope to make profit despite losing money.",

They all are related to ordinal scams. In ordinal transactions, the scammer generates outputs and assign identifiers to them with some extra data attached to the transaction. To make the attack as cheap as possible, the attackers generate the outputs with the lowest possible value (called dust limit).",

It is because miners are paid for every transaction they include in the block and as simple as the higher the fee major will be the profits they earn. If we want to keep the miners from this then I think there are two paths through which they may be discouraged of not doing this, One is to increase the minimum transaction fee which would difficult for the miners to spam the blockchain and they may be less likely to do it, And the second one is to set up fee market in which every users fix their own fee and the miners would choose which transaction to be included or excluded on basis of fee they want to pay.",

There’s still a possible that a miner is behind this attack since they are the only one who can benefit on it since paying insane fee for a dust transaction doesn’t make sense for someone that is into BRC20 collection.This network congestion is really annoying since my transaction keeps being pending even if I bump the fee to the latest high priority because it keeps increasing in a short period of time before my transaction receive 1 confirmation.",

Just an idea.absolutely right, When Ethereum and other networks already available for this work then why need ordinal burden on the Btc network which has no positive results and normal users will be frustrated. many transaction is pending and will take lot of time to be successful. In the previous congestion my transaction took 48 hours on setting 30 Sats/s. I am not seeing any best way to overcome this issue.",

Otherwise they would lose some money by not mining the real transactions and hoping that it would drive the fees up and make up for the not mined transactions. If there's 7000 transactions in a block, and the miner chooses to not mine 6,000 low fee transactions, let's say at 2sat/byte, then the remaining 1000 transactions must increase by 6 times the value of not mined transactions to break even - so every transaction should add 12 sat/byte to their fee. And this will probably not be the case, because rational users will increase their fee only by a few sat/byte above the minimum. Also there's always users who for some reasons overpay on transactions, and they would probably not react to manipulation anyway.I think miners could try to manioulate the fees by finding weaknesses in fee estimation algorithms in popular wallets and then mining just a few \"fake\" transactions with very high fee to make the algorithm recommend higher fee to all users.",
