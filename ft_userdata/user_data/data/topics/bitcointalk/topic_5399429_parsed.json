You got a point actually. There are polite ways to respond but some cant help themselves trolling the trolls as well. Maybe because those guys knew that the account isnt serious enough. But if those newbie history post proves that they are really trying to learn and being corrected harshly then maybe he dont understand what being a newbie feels like.Some also experience criticism but remember not to become so emotional to take it so deep. Everyone got criticise too. I advise take it as a positive feedback instead and prove them wrong.",

That obviously does not rule out getting a slap on the wrists here and there, but overall, it seems easier to be a thin-skinned type of person these days on the forum. On the other hand, some posting behaviours kind of call for it, although I’ve got the feeling that the OP is derived from a personal angle, more than a general observation on the forum. I’ve gone over the posts where you are quoted in an answer, and there isn't seemingly any real case that is using harsh words; at least not beyond a regular threshold. Yes, some people did not understand what you said (me included in one of the posts), and others blatantly disagreed with you on a rather tolerable rebutting scale. Over time, on tends to change his perception of things on the forum, essentially through reading and obtaining a broader view. One may not stand by his claims as time goes by, and become more lenient to considering alternative viewpoints.",

Having created a tip thread and getting merit as an advance, I now see several similar open threads created by the OP. What can be said about this, except as the most common merit hunt?OP, this is a forum about bitcoin, not about the aesthetics of behavior in society. But your posts only talk about it. It is not necessary to create a bunch of identical topics and say banal things. Many have passed the age of kindergarten, and education here is completely inappropriate.But seeing a newcomer who teaches in each topic how to behave and how not to behave, one involuntarily wants to be rude.Just draw your own conclusions.",

      "body": "It's a bit of both really. I find sometimes veteran's can be a little overzealous. For example, I know that the recommended approach is you search up your issue before posting, but we're a global forum used by users of varying different levels in terms of language. Therefore, I know how it's sometimes when you can't quite find your answer, and you kind of need to word it your way, to make sure that it is actually being read, and answered correctly. This is especially true when there's jargon involved. Also, it's a great learning tool. Being able to ask a question differently to how someone has explained it, I find has improved comprehension of certain topics. Now, I'm not giving anyone the green light to do this for the sake of doing it, but I understand somewhat with particular questions. I do think sometimes we can all be a little guilty of judging certain users on past experiences, a bit like stereotyping. Although, I don't think politeness is necessarily needed. It's probably desired to prevent discussions from being misled on personal tangents. Although, that usually only happens when someone is being outright rude for the purpose of being rude. I tend to correct myself at times, using language that a newbie wouldn't understand, and that's why I think when you're writing a guide, you need to consider the type of users that will be using it. It isn't likely going to be the technical folk, that would use advanced language. Plus, expect basic questions. This is what the beginners & Help section is exactly for. It's for questions that don't really fit anywhere else, and are probably of basic nature, and most discussion is intended with newbies in mind. So, theymos at some point recognised the importance of that. Also, I guess it depends on how you've been brought up, and in what environment. While, I wouldn't use it with strangers or those that I think would take offence. If one of the respected users here called me an idiot for a mistake I made which was a valid take, I'd probably agree . For example, a while back I accidentally ignored all my reports in the report queue, so I had to contact theymos. He didn't call me an idiot just to be clear, but I bet he was thinking it . We all make mistakes. Newbies are definitely expected to make mistakes, and I feel like sometimes users come here trying to walk on egg shells a bit, which is not what we want. Quote from: Israelgogo on May 20, 2022, 12:23:07 AMIt does not make sense when an experienced member criticize or condemn a newbie's write up ,a word of encourage can help put the newbie's on check. Even some so called old experienced members still makes mistakes ,will they be happy if a newbie's criticize them .I do somewhat agree. However, I do think intentions matter, and sometimes that can cloud the judgement of the seasoned veterans here. Most of them have seen every trick in the book, and if an innocent newbie posts something similar to one of these tricks as an example, I kind of get why they would have alarm bells ringing, and be a little more hostile. Is it a good thing they do that? Probably not, can I understand it? Yeah. I'm specifically thinking about instances where someone has made a post, which kind of looks like they were searching for merit, but basically repeating the same ol' content that has been posted a million times, you know the inspirational post attempts. Quote from: Beparanf on May 20, 2022, 05:22:52 AMAttitude is not moderated or even harsh words that forum user using here. You should accept all criticism if you are receiving one True, it isn't moderated, and definitely isn't something that ever will be. However, I don't completely agree with you should accept criticism. I mean, that criticism could be wrong, even if you're getting it from someone who has been here for years, and you've been here for a week. Not all criticism is valid, and warranted.",

      "body": "I had similar issues which resulted to second guessing my ass( self) I used too be way scared of bashing and someone criticizing me, I should say I do get scared of @lovesmayfamilis and @The Pharmacist they are very straightforward people who don't take bizarre and confused writes up easily ( Don't get me wrong) , I'd complain at time to a close friend   ,but I gradually adapted to the forum, I said too my self I want too grow, how do I do this ? But gradually I got used too the forum, still a fvckn juvenile learning and reading also not perfect.So In conclusion what I'm saying is that, newbies can also have experience of the cryptocurrency industry or are probably an old member directing the newbie to write that way (Merit fishing - which is not a good start although). So I know it's kinda hard, people with different personalities and how they react to thing's, most at times could be from you current mood.Newbie's In my own opinion should be guided, ( if you want a yam to grow in a particular direction then you have too caryy out stalking)Correct them and not blast them, this is my own addition to this. @DdmrDdmr is very good at this!Advice: Op develop a thick skin! Be observant. Everyone makes mistakes, as there is no question always right/wrong and response always correct. Do not take positive criticisms too personal, that'll eventually cling you from growing. Good luck Ahead! Peace out!",
