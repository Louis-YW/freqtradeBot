Not your key not your coin is what that is good to know.",

(IN FULL FORM)The Secp256k1 curve used with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)This is the curve with:a = 0b = 7(resulting in a curve equation of y2=x3+7p = 2256 - 232 - 29 - 28 - 27 - 26 - 24 - 1Base point G = 04 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798 483ADA77 26A3C465 5DA4FBFC 0E1108A8 FD17B448 A6855419 9C47D08F FB10D4B8n = FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE BAAEDCE6 AF48A03B BFD25E8C D0364141h = 01Quote from: Biat on December 27, 2024, 11:29:53 AMQ4)What is the maximum supply of BTC that will ever exist?Less than 20,999,999.9769While the limit appeared to be 20,999,999.9769 at the time that the software was first released, an unnoticed bug in the code allowed miners to accidentally erase some bitcoins from existence by creating a duplicate coinbase transaction.  This happened a couple of times before the bug was noticed and fixed which reduced the total supply below this initial value.  Additionally, there are many bitcoins that are provably unspendable, so while they do still exist, they can't really be considered part of the \"supply\" any longer.Quote from: Biat on December 27, 2024, 11:29:53 AMQ5)How long does it typically take to mine a new BTC block?The protocol attempts to keep the AVERAGE time between blocks close to 10 minutes.  However, due to the increasing global hash rate over the past 16 years, as well as the effects of random distribution, more than half of all blocks have been faster than that meaning that the TYPICAL time is actually a bit less than 10 minutes.  Quote from: Biat on December 27, 2024, 11:29:53 AMQ6)What hash function does BTC use to secure transactions and create block hashes?Not sure what you mean by \"secure transactions\", but SHA256 is used for block hashing as well as for the Merkle Tree.Quote from: Biat on December 27, 2024, 11:29:53 AMQ7)Which type of BTC address to you use.All types.Some of the more popular ones are:P2PKP2PKHP2SHP2WPKHP2WSHP2SH-P2WPKHP2MSP2TRQuote from: Biat on December 27, 2024, 11:29:53 AMQ8)Purpose of \"OP_RETURN\" opcode.Creates an unspendable output which can then be removed from mempool reducing the total number of unspent transaction outputs that need to be tracked.  It is often used by those that want to store data in the blockchain instead of using the blockchain for exchange of value.Quote from: Biat on December 27, 2024, 11:29:53 AMQ9)What is the best exchange in your opinion.None.  The best way to interact with Bitcoin is to receive it as payment for a product or service, and to use it to pay for products and services. In this way, it serves it's intended function as described in the White Paper:\"an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trustedthird party\"Quote from: Biat on December 27, 2024, 11:29:53 AMQ10)Are you a dev?A dev?  Do you mean, have I ever written any software code for any purpose ever in my life?  Sure.",
