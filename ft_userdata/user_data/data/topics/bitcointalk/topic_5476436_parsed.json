Sample N=3 (number of repetitions of the pattern that occurred in 2017 - rebound from 0.618 FIB) is definitely too little to draw conclusions about how accurate this indicator is. But like any good technical analysis indicator, Fibbonaci retracements have accurate data available online about the indicator's performance: \"How Accurate Are Fibonacci Retracements? Some experts believe that Fibonacci retracements can forecast about 70% of market movements, especially when a specific price point is predicted.\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/fibonacci-rules.asp\"Overall, Fibonacci retracement was accurate only 37% of the time. If you exclusively used this indicator for trading, you would have more losing trades than winners. Additionally, the golden rule of 61.8% was no more likely to be reliable than any other Fibonacci level.\"https://www.liberatedstocktrader.com/how-to-use-fibonacci-retracement/In my opinion, in the case of crypto, this indicator is better than in the broader market, because price here is not influenced by non-technical factors (such as the company's financial results), so it is probably closer to 70% than 37%, but it is definitely not 100%.Also 48k is a good target to take profit.",

I understand it may help with trading, but it is not the greatest way to invest long term, only for short term trading. I have a \"friend\" (someone I know on telegram) that turned 300k into 800k by just trading short term futures during the last 2 months, it's bull period so he just got 5x long futures and kept holding and sold the day it goes up and then bought again and kept repeating and because the price kept going higher and higher in the last 2 months he made a lot of money.For those type of people this might be true and working, but for people like me who rather hold it for 20 years, the idea to sell at 48k doesn't make sense to me, I know for sure that in the next 1 year the price will go significantly higher than 48k, it will probably be over ATH as well, so why would I end up selling during this period?",

What is clear is that I think there are more survivors than sellers.About the approval of the ETF, people's views are a new breakthrough to go bullish and there are still many who are waiting for this news at the beginning of this year, as for those who say it will be corrected it is still very possible because the price of bitcoin can still go up and down.I myself will not sell until the halving and may look at the end of 2024.",

Research suggests that about 70 to 90% of traders lose money. So it can't be that most people look at some pictures with charts and start to believe in them and that's how it will be... usually it's the other way around. when bitcoin was going to $60k, everyone was drawing charts that it would reach $100k, when it dump to $30k, no one expected that we would revise the levels of $60k, when everyone was calling $100k again and yet we fell to 15k, where most people were screaming for $10k and we are now here at $40k. horde is mostly wrong.",

Because I was traumatized several times by buying BTC and when the price rose a few% I sold it because I had made a small profit and in the hope of wanting to buy again when the price fell but the price of BTC continued to increase so I was left behind. This started when the price of BTC was still $30k, after that incident I was determined not to sell BTC again before my desired target was reached.",

I certainly agree that if the price of bitcoin manages to break through $48k, then there will certainly be a bigger push to break through resistance at $50k and above. It all still depends on the SEC and ETF situation, but if the ETF is approved then I and most other users can expect $70k achieved easily.Personally I wouldn't sell my bitcoin at $48k if it hits this December, but I'm likely to hang on whatever the price volatility is. The long-term plan is a priority that must be maintained even though I can accumulate by selling high and buying low. But this is an individual's choice and strategy, and I don't plan on selling it anytime soon even if it could reach $50k this December.",

This isn't new to us, after a recent pump there must be a correction as we expected but it could be also fueling again to jump into a higher remarkable price.  Remember also that in most cases, the last quarter of the year is most likely a green month of the chart.",
