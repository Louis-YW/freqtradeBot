Can anyone recommend where I should start or things I should read or watch etc.Hello KHarty! Welcome to the forum!There are many free online courses that covers all the fundamentals of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but I have read that the best way to learn is by actually using these currencies and understanding how they work.Crypto is a very broad topic, from the most basic of Bitcoin skills, through to more advanced uses such as decentralized applications and sidechains. Even if you're a total beginner, it would be a good idea to spend a few minutes going through everything you need to know to better understand this new and exciting technology. Depending on what exactly you want to learn, I can point you to some resources. Youtube has a ton of video tutorials, but be warned that they are a lot of amateur made (and poorly made). I would also recommend reading any of the free information and guides that can be found online such as howto guides, blogs, books and whatnot. You can spend a few minutes reading about the concept of Bitcoin, about the underlying cryptographic protocol that will underpin all of your future interactions with Bitcoin. The more knowledge you have about how Bitcoin actually works, the more depth you'll be able to delve into with other topics like blockchains and the best case scenarios of this technology.",

There’s a lot of misinformation on here and when you’re just getting started it’s hard to know who actually knows what they are talking about. Reading books and watching videos by well known proven experts is not something to avoid just because of this website. Be very careful with where you get your information from when trying to educate yourself on bitcoin. Even on this website WELL over half the people here don’t have a clue what they are talking about, so always take everything with a grain of salt and research research research.  The person I would argue is the very best to learn from, who absolutely knows what he’s talking about and is easily one of the most knowledgeable bitcoin experts on the planet is Andreas Antonopoulos. He wrote “mastering bitcoin” as well as several other books. He’s got countless educational videos on YouTube. Start from his earlier ones. He really does a great job of explaining it on a level anyone can understand. His page - https://youtube.com/c/aantonop",

Many free course videos are available online which can teach you from the start to the expert level.

What is even better on the link you shared is that it's a video based explanation so which means it's more easier to understand than those traditional books or online articles where the only way to learn is by reading them manually.OP is a good example and all the newbies that are planning to enter cryptos must follow him.
