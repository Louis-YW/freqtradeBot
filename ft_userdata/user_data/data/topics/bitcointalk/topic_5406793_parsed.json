Is it just the price or the number of projects built on each blockchain? Both are currently moving upwards.Anyway, when talking about long-term, answers to both questions are still related to each other. Last time I checked, Cardano is not short of teams wanting to launch their own platforms there. Cardano developers are also not slacking of with the recent successful launch of Vasil upgrade on testnet. The upgrade is supposed to improve the network's scalaility.Having said that, I think it's only a matter of time before ADA explodes like Matic or Sol. If you decide, you just have to be more patient with this coin. While waiting for the next major pump, you can also try to stake it in your cold wallet or in platforms like mycointainer.com",

But that doesn't mean there is no opportunity for ADA, because ADA is one of the potential chains in the crypto market and it might beat MATIC's popularity, nothing is impossible.",

Do you guys think ADA can also do that in the coming days?I don't really understand. I mean MATIC is \"just\" a layer for Ethereum, which is great no doubt because using polygon you can save a lot of money on transaction costs. Maybe that is not as important at the moment as the gas price of Ethereum is also relatively low right now with only 15 Gwei but once we are seeing big market movements again i am sure this number will very fast go up to 100 Gwei and even way more.Cardano (ADA) on the other side is it's own chain and it already is a bigger project than Polygon in terms of the market cap, so i don't really know what ADA should do in the coming days that Polygon already did? ADA had it's price peak when the news about the smart contracts came. We are still ways off that price range.",

The update that has come to ada is very impressive and the ecosystem is growing so fast just like what solana did in the past. So, thinking about ada will not have the same patter like what matic done is pessimistic. The major coin like ada has so many whales and supporters. It can go back again to go up once the bullish market will be coming soon. The fact that if crypto looks liks going back to the bullish pattern again.",

I mean sure there could be a potential that Matic could one day reach to third place if it does too well, or gets hyped during a bull market, but having a consistent increase is better than having one big hype and then going down.Look at ADA, it became third biggest coin in ranking for a while, then it dropped so much. I rather have coins keep their place and go up decently instead of all of this. In the end, we are not going to see anything marginal here, it's going to be two of these going hand to hand close ot each other and not one bigger than the other too much.",

But unsure if it's going to happen as what you're asking in the next few days. I hold a little amount of ADA and it's like an experiment and I would not benefit a lot if I profit. There has to be a big reason for it to pump just like Matic the last few days but don't overjoy when you see that because you know what's next every pump that happens.",

But what happened later happened and ADA could not recover itself. Even in this past bull period, it could not give the expected reaction. Matic, on the other hand, has made himself accepted in the crypto money industry in a very short time and has been able to do very successful work. This is why you might have said that Matic would be the next ADA. But if you say that a previously released project will be matic, it would be nonsense in my opinion.",

We couldn't compare a project to one another especially if they are coming from a different platform as no matter what we do, it can never happen that they will work together and grow the same. Prices aren't the basis of it and it eventually changes from time to time depending on the market situation. I have some ADA before but I was hopeless then after having huge losses, a reason why I don't trust this project especially this time.",
