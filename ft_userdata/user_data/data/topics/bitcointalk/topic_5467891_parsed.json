  "content": "I was trying to setup a hardware bitcoin-only wallet. I had, for the generation of the seed, 2 options: single and Shamir seed backup.I noticed that the single seed had 24 words and the Shamir 20. This made me wonder which of them is hardest to guess/hack. In case of a single, 24 words seed, one has to guess 24 words. But how does this work with Shamir? Suppose you have setup a Shamir with 3 shares and a threshold of 2. Do you have to guess 20, 40 or also 24 words (or something else) to hack it?This also brings me to Multisig. If you require two seed to sign a transaction, does this mean that an attacker needs to guess 48 words in total, or can this whole multisig process be reduced to an other set 24 words?",

      "body": "A 24 word seed phrase provides 256 bits of entropy and it's secure enough. Note that even a 12 word seed phrase can give you enough secuirty.If your shamir shares have 20 words each, your master secret should give you 128 bits of entropy and that's again enough. Take note that whether you have a wallet with a single seed phrase or a wallet with Shamir backup, it's secure enough (assuming it's generated and used in the correct way) and you should choose which one to use depending on your needs.I personally don't like Shamir, because all shares must be generated in a single device and you need to enter all the required shares in a single device whenever you want to make a transaction and if that device is compromised, you would lose all your fund.Shamir may be a good option if you worry about your psychical backup being stolen but can't give you extra security against hackers. I prefer a multi-signature wallet to a wallet with shamir backup. In a multi-signature wallet, the seed phrases can be generated in separate devices and you don't have to import all of them in a single device when you want to make a transaction.",

      "body": "Shamir secret sharing is secure than just 24 word seed phrase backups. If you have 3 shares but 2 threshold to be recover your seed phrases, that means an attacker will need 2 out of the 3 shares to recover the seed phrase. That makes it secure than having only 24 word seed phrase backup. But on this forum, established members do not recommend shamir secret sharing.Multisig VS Shamir Secret SharingThe better option to go for is a multisig wallet which you also mentioned. Assuming you have 2-of-3 multisig wallet, an attacker need the 1 public key and 2 private keys that can generate other public keys and signed  a transaction on the wallet inorder to compromised the wallet. Multisig is part of bitcoin improvement protocol and more secure than single signature wallet. I am referring to offline backup, not about the wallet itself online. If you use a hardware wallet which has its private key offline and you are able to to secure your backup your seed phrase securely in two or three different locations, that is not bad at all. If you want to go for the option, we can guide you if you ask a question on this forum about the best way to create a multisig wallet like 2-of-3 multisig wallet.AdviceFor a single sig wallet, I will not advice you to use shamir secret sharing. You can use passphrase instead which is better. Also with passphrase on hardware wallet like Trezor, your wallet can not be physically attacked to reveal your seed phrase because physical attack on your Trezor can reveal your seed phrase to an attacker even if you use shamir secret sharing. But with the passphrase, different keys and addresses are generated which will not let the attacker to know your keys and addresses and not able to spend your coins. It is good to use a strong (longer passphrase) in a way it can not be brute forced. If you lose your passphrase, just like your seed phrase, you will lose your coins. Backup the seed phrase and passphrase differently in different locations.",

The answer is that it doesn't matter because we can't perform either one of these. In case of Bitcoin, you can not \"hack\" a single key just like you can't \"hack\" a multisig but of course technically harder since it normally requires more than one key. However, the security you would have depends on how you use them. For example a single key generated on an airgap system and kept offline and safe will provide a far higher level of security compared to a multi-sig generated on a single online PC running Windows OS!As for Shamir algorithm, I'd worry more about its implementation rather than whether you should use it or not. Since it is not very popular and it technically is for \"secrete sharing\" not secret storing, a broken implementation could lead to losses.",

I hope that my Keystone pro supports this!Thanks a lot for all the replies, it was really helpful!!Just a few comments for your multisig setup.All cosigners must be created and backed-up offline, otherwise there is no huge benefit with multisig.Let's say you have a classic 2-of-3 system where 2 of the 3 cosigners are needed to sign a transaction.In order for you to be able to send funds you need to have at minimum 2 of the 3 seed phrases and the 3rd XPUB.Let's say that the cosigners are called A, B, C. Then I would create 3 backups (offline on paper) as follows:Packet 1: Seed A + XPUB BPacket 2: Seed B + XPUB CPacket 3: Seed C + XPUB AIf you lose one of the packets then you can still recover your wallet because you will have the 2 seeds and the 3rd xpub. If a thief steals one of the backups, they can't do anything. They won't even be able to monitor your transactions, since they will not have all the necessary XPUBs.Keep in mind that the XPUBs are super important. If you only have 2 seeds and not the third XPUB, your wallet is lost forever.All the packets need to be stored in separate places of course. Otherwise, there is no benefit at all.Finally, avoid silly mistakes, like putting the seed on a device that is connected to the internet, or maintaining backups at the same place.Multisig is in general the safest option, but if you make mistakes, then it won't help you more than a singlesig wallet. In general, human error is the only enemy here. If you have any question or hesitation ask here in this forum and make sure to \"learn\" before you \"act\". No rush!",
