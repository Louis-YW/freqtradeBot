  "content": "Hello HousePlease I have been battling with trying to help a neighbor who i introduced into cryptocurrency and the forum and after registration, be was asked to pay for proxy ban which I also tried explaining to him but die to the very high charges involved in sending that very little proxy ban fee and I also don't want it to seem as if I have any connections with that account for trying to help pay proxy ban and I also want to use this opportunity to make a disclaimer that I have no relationship with that account and that I intend helping the neighbor pay for proxy ban and what ever actions he should be held responsible for it.So I wanted to ask if it's ok for me to pay for the proxy ban or not please Â N/B: please pardon me if this is not tye right board for me to post this as I will be appreciate of my attention is drawn to the right place to post this.THANKS",
