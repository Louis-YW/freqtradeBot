  "content": "DOBLEBITA great project that we have been working on for months, where we will be creating fantastic physical bitcoin collectibles for our community that we appreciate so much.When we met our passion for collecting physical bitcoins made us take a big step and venture into the creation of fantastic collectibles, an exciting hobby where every day crazy ideas come to mind.Our first project as DOBLEBIT  is called \"FREEDOM\" ¬†a fusion of crazy and brilliant ideas, where our mind led us to a mind-blowing design with details that every bitcoin lover will understand and get to the heart.We will explain in detail all our ideas embodied in our creation:A coin with the face of Satoshi Nakamoto, anonymity, freedom, Bitcoin, called \"Freedom\" likely has a symbolic meaning. It could be interpreted as a representation of the original values and principles of the Bitcoin network, as Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym used by the anonymous creator(s) of Bitcoin. The anonymity aspect of the coin may also be a nod to the decentralized and private nature of Bitcoin transactions. The word \"Freedom\" could refer to the decentralized and permissionless nature of Bitcoin, which allows for financial transactions without the need for intermediaries such as banks or governments. Overall, this coin likely represents a belief in the power of decentralized and anonymous digital currencies to promote financial freedom and autonomy.We welcome suggestions",
