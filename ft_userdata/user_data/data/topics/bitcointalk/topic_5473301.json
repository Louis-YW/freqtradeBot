  "content": "the following idea came into my head in the last few days, which i would now like to share with you all and also read your opinion on itwhat do you think about displaying the exact BTC block time in addition to the date and time (when a thread was started or when a post was written)?even if the opening post or the respective post is edited, the block time would remain unchangeable. the block time would then be displayed right next to the other information (date and time - marked red in the example below) or you could display it in the middle (orange marking) on the same linesince this is a Bitcoin forum, i would very much welcome this additional display of blocktime and in my opinion would also have a further reference to the entire blockchain",

However, this involves adding more information to the BD, which makes this idea more difficult to happen.Quote from: _act_ on November 08, 2023, 07:43:15 AMI have noticed many times before how some people requested for bitcoin price to be displayed on the home page of this forum, saying this is bitcoin forum, but nothing like that was done. I will not expect anything like block time to be displayed right next to  other information or any other way that you suggested it to be done.This idea would be easier to implement. But, then different opinions may arise about which fiat to use for exchange or something like that. Of course, in general it would be the dollar.On the other hand, 1 BTC is worth 1 BTC. This is the idea of many regarding the value of bitcoin. Having a quote from the forum would hardly be consensual.",

The block time is approximately 10 minutes (usually a tad less, because of the ever increasing hash rate). It varies per block, but also per day as you can see in the linked graph.Or do you mean the latest block number? That would make more sense, although I don't see how it's relevant to anything posted on the forum.",

That would make more sense, although I don't see how it's relevant to anything posted on the forum.i am aware of all this LoyceVi just wanted to suggest that the block time (or in other words, as you have already written, the block number) be displayed accordingly. if several posts were created in the same block time, then the same block time would also be displayed in the post in questionfor example, when creating this post, the block time/number would be 815832",

The block number is sequential and is not easy for humans to remember, so it will require the service of a third party to interpret the meaning. However, if you mean it as a way to archive topics, then showing topics based on the block number will make tracking discussions more difficult. It will also require more work on the database, as some topics will remain without a number. Until the block is mined.Often it takes more than 20 minutes to mine a block. Will everyone wait until a block is mined to post a comment?",

I just feel like it wouldn't add anything useful.  But hey maybe I'm missing something.",

As he said somewhere, he is the only programmer maintaining the forum, and he does not have much free time to build new features. I have seen an old thread where theymos were looking for devs to build a new forum software. The thread is from long ago, and the budget was over 5000 BTC. Does anybody know what happened then?",

It's probably possible to create a user script for this, but even then: block propagation isn't instantaneous, so in edge cases theymos' node might see it before your own node sees it.There will probably a lot of posts near milestone blocks.

It's better for him to fix the forums error.",
