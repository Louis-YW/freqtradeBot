  "content": "Hey Fam. Wanted to know what are you going to do with your rigs and overall mining equipment now that Merge is incoming. It must be hard for some people that made the sacrifices needed to have the mining equipment on point for the ETH mining and now it's time to do the switching, wanted to know how did you guys prepare for this, even tho there seem to be some transitional solutions, in the end, PoS is here to stay.Some proposals from the community and more info could be found in this article:https://twitter.com/thetokenist/status/1565627368156418048?s=20&t=ms4fh3NrS6Ur5WiAgE3vUw",

Its also the day that the inflation numbers are released and this will play a great deal on the stock markets which the crypto markets are correlated too.I am guessing its going to be a sell the news event. Most likely many are buying ETH to get the free ETHPOW token and many will dump right after the merge. As for GPU prices? No idea. Depends how many ASICs were actually on the network.",

My only guess is that its mineable currently and maybe because if ETH was sued by SEC then most likely all of crypto will crash and alot of capital is invested in ETH and BTC. They are mostly doing it to protect the investors.Why they sued Ripple I still don't understand because there are many currencies such as Ripple.
