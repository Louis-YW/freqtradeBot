It’s been a long time since I last used the forum search feature I normally use Ninjastic.space to search for things I’m interested in. And for this thread sake, I just did a search for three different random words using the forum search engine and I didn’t experience any time delay  Edit: I finally replicated the issue, it seems like it only happens when you press the “search button” more than once. I was asked to wait for 4 minutes 4 seconds but when I typed in my word and clicked “search” everything worked.",

I make one search and the whole system is down for 10 minutes lolThe search bar is pretty fast for me but the problem with the native search engine of Bitcointalk is that it won't work the way we want it to work. But, I have been using the search bar myself for a long time do search for things that I know the search function of the forum will find without any doubt. I recommend you to use Google search engine to search for threads in the website because it'll be a pain in head to do that with the internal search engine of the forum.",

You will have to wait for a few minutes.Although, now, anytime I try to use the search icon, it still delays, and what I have noticed is that when you don't correctly put in the keyword or topic you want to search for, then you are going to experience such delays, but if you accurately put in the right search word, then you wouldn't have to wait for so long before you get your search result.For example, if you search for \"Bitcoin wallet,\" You might get a quick result, but if you search for something like, \"I sold my land and some jewelry to buy Bitcoin,\" then you might not get your search result coming up soon. Yeah, it delays, but not up to 10 minutes like you said. It would rather tell you, \"No result found.\"For me, ninjastic.space is more preferable, or you can also make use of the second search option, which is the one linked to Google.",

There are two possibilities for your experience. It might be the fault of your internet/browsers or you unfortunately made the search when the site is having its downtime moments.This is absolutely true when it comes to searching some information. I do experienced same problem when searching but I use to assume that perhaps it's due to too much similarity of words used in the forum. Try searching for a user Forum name and you'll see numerous of suggestions including the non relevant ones. Annoying enough, sometimes you still won't find the information you are looking for. Other aspects are actively working fast as long as the internet connection is not interrupted but the searching function needs some little improvement in order to be providing relevant information.Quote from: Doan9269 on October 18, 2023, 11:23:54 AMMaybe something is definitely wrong with your internet connectivity or the device you're using, have you also considered the availability of space on your device memory, search engine is not what should last than seconds to have your results with you, or maybe you probably make it more difficult to search through by what you typed in to be searched for, there's nothing wrong with the forum search here than from your end. Does this has anything to do with one's phone storage available space? I doubt that. The search is not downloading any file but just to provide us with readable informations. So I think it has less to do with storage so far your internet connection is strong. The searching function is actually working fine but my own concern is the information it use to bring out.",
