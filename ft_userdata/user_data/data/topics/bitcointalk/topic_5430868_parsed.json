Source[2].Quote from: Boxing: Akaho comes clean, admits he lost by KO to Casimero\"Mr. Akaho said that the damage he received was not due to the impact of the punch hit the back of his head,\" said John Hwang, KBM chairman, in a letter to the Games and Amusement Board (GAB). \"He took a break to fight again, but he gave up because he couldn't, and he admitted that it was KO defeat.\"[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5417421.0[2] https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/12/21/22/boxing-akaho-admits-he-lost-by-ko-to-casimeroI'll lock this thread later on...",

It's a no-brainer to think that he stopped because of that unintentional hit at the back of his head where in fact, he is shown really struggling prior to that. It's good that Akaho admitted that if the fight continues, it will result in a KO loss on him as that was where the fight will really go through.Since the result was now elevated from No Contest to Knock Out win from Casimero, I'm expecting him to climb his rank and face a much tougher opponent next that will lead him close to competing for a championship title again.",

Social media pressure from disappointed fans surely pressure Korean boxer organizer to clean there mess or else they will lose credibility to handle an official fight in them. There’s a lot of same case before that judges make a mistake even the result is very obvious. The only difference now was it all being solved properly due to the power of social unlike before that people can’t express there disappointments.I wonder what happened on bets place on this match. Will this result a win or still a draw for people who bet with casimero?",

Will this result a win or still a draw for people who bet with casimero?The initial official what matters most when it comes on bet like this. The decision when the bets is settled can’t be changed even the result is now K.O from no contest or draw on your bet. This same when you bet on fighter that win that later on loss, Your winnings will not gonna be refunded even the result was changed later on as long as the official result is already released.I’m sure many bettors rage on this fight because this a one sided match that turns into no contest for a shitty excuses.",

Problem is, they probably did this just to save face and not because they really wanted to be fair and give Casimero the rightful outcome of that bout. They surely wouldn't do shit about that fight had it not been for the netizens calling them out.",
