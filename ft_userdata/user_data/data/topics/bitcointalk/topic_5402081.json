Offchain transactions.Changes in the Bitcoin Protocol in order to fix either of these issues has been tried but each attempt to do so either results in a forgotten source code fork or alt-coins (Monero, Bitcoin Dark, Dash, Bitcoin Cash).  These alt-coins must compete with name recognition and network effects of the currency when the distinct product is their improved payment system.Far from sending standard amounts in multiple transactions to obscure the amounts, bitcoin transactions are easily identified by the amount sent.  In addition, bitcoin can be traced as it moves from address to address.  Most people having to trade from one crypto to another will have their address linked to their identity.  So much for anonymity and so much for darkness.Because the bitcoin protocol requires the transaction specify where the currency output comes from, so even when sent to the same address it is more expensive to send when they had come in smaller increments rather than a single lump sum.  At the most extreme end of the scale it typically costs 85,120 satoshis (851 µBTC) to send transaction on the next block and only 224 satoshis if you are willing to wait days and be okay if it eventually fails.When sending large amounts the transaction fees make up a smaller percentage.  It turns out that if paying the minimal fee on a transaction 50µBTC, the fee would only be 0.5% of the value of the funds sent.Enter Bitcoin Note. Bitcoins are sent to a script which is a combination of time-locked, multi-signature and single signature. The user gets to use the coins as a physical bill and is unable to transfer funds from it.  It can only be transferred with the help of the issuer and the private key on the bill.  The private key is unique to each bill.  In order to protect the issuer from extortion, he must destroy the copy of the private key on the bills before they leave the shop.The issuer also has another private key.  In combination with the private key of the issuer and the private key on the bill they can redeem the money after the redemption date with this combination.  There is an expiry date, after which the holder, of the private key on the bill can unilaterally move the underlying coins on the block-chain.  It is important to take your bills to the issuer prior to that date so anyone who ever had the bill doesn’t move the backing block-chain BTC. Measures against counterfeitingThese Bitcoin notes should be used between people who know each other.  Down the road the issuer after spending his bitcoin notes at a shop, may take them back as change for some later purchase or there maybe more cyclical economies where money moves around in a circle without ever needing to be changed into fiat.The issuer can create bills that have a torn side.  A serial number match with the torn bill can be used to validate the bill is the original and not a photocopy.  Other more involved forms of measures against counterfeit can include things found in regular fiat bills and they raise the bar in terms of what a counterfeiter has to do, what equipment one must buy, etcetera.Suggested Bill Values usedPaper currency in bitcoin based on purchasing what you typically need at a clothing shop or electronics store, it seems that 1 mBTC is a good upper size.  Larger than that, you might as well just keep things on chain.  These days, 100 µBTC is an amount that would cost about 2.5% of its value for an online transaction.  Creating a special transaction for this amount once and putting it on a Bitcoin note, could allow zero fee transaction to happen with this note limited only by the ability to pass it between one user and another.ScriptingThe script for a single issuer and a private key for each note:ki ->  issuer's public key (private key not on the paper)kp -> paper public key whose private key is on the paper <sig1> := (signature of the issuer)     <pubkey> := k1<sig2> := <sig>  (signature for the key that's on the paper) In square brackets the stack of the Bitcoin Virtual Machine is placed next to the op codes to aid better understanding.

      "body": "Wouldn’t trusting the issuer bring in the same danger, Fiat brought us into? E.g. inflating the money supply. How can the user verify the same bill wasnt printed twice, without waiting for years? Also how do we make sure there isnt another copy of the private key with the issuer? One bad merchant could open the door to mass fraud. I think its crucial for a Bitcoin bill to be trust minimized, otherwise we can run into Fiat 2.0. There needs to be some element of verification by the user. Also: how will the issuer make money? He has to pay transaction fees, has to pre-fund the bill and has to make a high quality bill. These factors all cost money and could be way higher than the fees that are actually saved with this approach. Its important to calculate the cost of low quantity bills to see if this approach even brings in savings.Isnt it just cheaper in the end to just open a lightning channel(and more secure and efficient)?",

      "body": "All valid points.  Just like when you buy Bitcoin on some centralized exchange, you trust there is actually that much Bitcoin in the exchange's underlying wallet.  If you can pay 224 satoshis for say a 50 µBTC bill (5,000 sats) then you need to charge more than the tx fee, perhaps 300 sats to the buyer.  There would have to be a cost to create the bill.  The transaction fee happens once and then you can have five years of transactions.  You can verify the issuer has not spent the coins.  A little bit like banks would issue dollars before the Federal Reserve act came to be.The lightning requires internet for transactions.  With these bills, transactions can be anonymous and offline and free apart from the one-time cost. The issuer needs to be trusted for these to work as money..  The money could be for small communities that don't want to use a LETS system or fiat but don't want the expense of smart phones or PCs. The use of these should be for ready spending rather than saving but will stay fixed with respect to the Bitcoin price.  We already pay per transaction for Bitcoin everytime it changes hands when using it online so paying up front one transaction to give a community zero fees seems like a group of people could agree to contribute to get these things.",

Also they’re in competition with each other, while it will be harder here to just switch to a competitor for a different bill. Also we’re already trying to get people of centralized exchanges, because of the damage that can be done.QuoteThe lightning requires internet for transactions.  With these bills, transactions can be anonymous and offline and free apart from the one-time cost.

They will need a computer or smartphone to redeem it anyways.2. I think if we’re trying to bring people into Bitcoin, it’s crucial they have access to all tools, to really use it. Just relying on a centralized authority can bring them into a vulnerable position.I like your idea tho and you seem like a smart and well intentioned guy. So my advice is to change the trust model and make it a top priority to not require trust, and this will succeed. See even if you as the owner have well intentions, as the business grows it will be harder and harder to control the whole supply chain, and many things won’t be in the owners control anymore, one bad apple can rot the whole tree here.",
