      "body": "For now it seems like we are going to continue seeing slow and small rises that are consistent too. Which is a good thing but I don't see any big jumps in the near future. Because the bulls you are talking about haven't gone anywhere, they have been around if you zoom out and see how price has been on the rise consistently for the past ~3 months now. Even the bigger picture since January shows an overall rise with only corrections and market manipulation dumps.What we need for that \"sharp climb\" is two things: the uncertain investors who are still too afraid to buy back in but have a lot of money to invest. And also the money that went somewhere else like the shitty but high paying bonds (due to high interest rates) to come back to bitcoin market which requires interest rates to come down.The second one requires interest rates to come down which is not gonna happen since inflation would shoot up thanks to high and increasing energy prices.The first one would happen if a strong resistance is broken. It may be $40k but I'm more sure about $50k being able to do that.",

But will there be a miracle in the next few hours?, sometimes the market is very difficult to predict, even though we know that trading volume is the most powerful indicator in predicting a potential market development.",

As we can see in the weekly chart, the bias is clearly an uptrend, possibly it would hit the supply above which was around $45k, and it happened. In trading, using pattern solely at the chart especially at lower time frame would only make you lose, because there is high chance that you are trading against the trend. Checking the macro time frame is a must to know the bias and always find a pattern that is harmonize with it.",

We've seen some corrections along the way after that big push to $45,000.I'm not sure about the Tether printing though, this has been wildly speculated for years and maybe it will put a dent on the price in a negative way but I don't think that it's the main reason why we see that minor dip that I'm talking.Maybe investors just sold to make profits at around $45,000 and then rebuying when the price hits $40,000. So it's going to be a cycle, but long term basis like in the next 6 months will be a good gauge as how far we are, if we ever hit new all time high or close to it.",

Too many speculation and I insist about the fact of holding our saving until we get a good price to spend. People are talking even about 6 figures for bitcoin, I hope so! It's sideways, but as per the TA of the OP that time, definitely there is a bullish pennant. As for breaking the previous all time high, yes, this is more likely, it could be in the next 7-10 months give and take. But definitely it will be inside 2025, as this could be the year that the price is going to be push to it's highest, specially good news will be around that time frame.There are members that could be affected by too much speculation, but for the majority, doesn't matter, you just have to learn to read between the lines and you will be good. Or even learn from those who are posting their TA here. So for now short term, we do hope that $45k at least at the end of the year will be a good indication that the incoming year will be very bullish as halving is approaching.",

I believe that Bitcoin has the potential to reach $50k value in this month and if that happens then during the halving event we may see Bitcoin at $60k value or above. Who knows that with approval of Bitcoin ETFs we may see huge pumps in the value of Bitcoin which may take it to over $55k or possibly at $60k value.I'm sure that the next two years will be very bullish for Bitcoin investors and we may see many altcoins following the bullish pattern of Bitcoin. I hope that Bitcoin may reach $80k value at the end of 2024 and may reach or cross $120k value in 2025 and if that happens then most of us will be happy because we all want Bitcoin to trade at higher price values.",

It doesn't show where the rally will end because it could be 45k or 48k, but it showed sub 50k bitcoin for sure. Anyway, the author suggested that the indicator he relies upon (Puell Multiple) is peaking and each time it happened before the halving bitcoin corrected, like that time when it went toÂ  14k in 2019 and back down to 4k. I don't agree with him because this indicator relies on miners dumping when prices are high and this time I believe the coming ETF decision will influence the market so much that it will not correct a lot, but we shall see. Maybe we go to 50k and then correct to 44k?",

And with that, it's really hard to see where the market is going at least short term. Basing on history, we've the price movement as, it should go down first before we can reach X price in the future. But it seems that this thoughts are not going to be applicable as we have like the bullish news about Bitcoin ETF. So very hard to see where we are going this end of the year. So far the price is moving to $44k-xx,xxx. So maybe $50k, the highest speculation this 2023.",
