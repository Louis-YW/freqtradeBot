Did that platform you bought from give a transaction ID about your coins?It should be a long string that looks like this one: f7360e4fa149adb8354ffdc52e4ae511c37afdef8859d21a497118f0760201d2(I've just taken the transaction ID of a random transaction)If they did and you don't have a problem showing it, you can post that here (but please make sure you don't post private key).Or (if you have no problem showing) you can post the address you're expecting the coins arrive to (and again, please make sure you don't post private key).Or you can post the address or transaction Id to website like https://mempool.space/ and see for yourself if* the new transaction you expect did come* the new transaction is confirmed or not",

So that you can explain well about your issue.If your Electrum shows a red circle your wallet has a connection problem. Changing DNS usually fix this problem.",

Then we can check their site policies to see if there is some requirement you must fulfill e.g. KYC, before it converts your money to Bitcoins.Note: If the website tells you to send more money to \"unlock\" or \"process\" the transaction, then it is a scam.",

It seems that you speak Swedish (from the word köpa), so if you know someone who speaks English or any language in the local boards[1] it will help a lot.If you have completed withdrawing your coins from the platform, you will get TXID, ask them and make sure that the data contained in it is correct.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=11.0",

OP obviously doesn't speak English, and the post is also not translated with google translate or a similar automated translation tool because it contains spelling mistakes. I would suggest you use Google translate and just post in your native Swedish language and paste the results here. It should provide more clarity.There is no Swedish local thread in the Other languages/locations sub that I am aware of.OP should use the Skandinavisk local if he wants to write in his mother tongue. The activity there is quite poor though.",

I have seen people who don't speak English do it several times, so that really shouldn't be a problem why people could get in trouble with the Bitcointalk staff. Not everyone speaks English, but they still might require some help. I see it only becoming a problem if you start building your account by posting a lot of Google translated content. But in rare occasions where the person is probably only her to get help with Bitcoin, it's not a big deal. One call always mention that the post is Google translated and the reason why if that is a requirement.",
