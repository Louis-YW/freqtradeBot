      "body": "Well, it really boils down to where you're at in Europe.  Using a local crypto exchange could save you some money versus something international that piles on the fees and  these local spots usually let you directly transfer from your bank account, sidestepping those credit card charges.  Now I ain't gonna suggest any particular exchange to use internationally but I'd say poke around for some big name exchanges that take credit cards globally.  Just be sure to read the fine print on those fees and terms and conditions real careful before you decide.  If you have a question about the reputation of a specific exchange before you decide to send your money, feel free to ask.",

What happened is for you to locates your locality and trade with someone who is from there were he can send you bitcoin and then you may transfer him fiat from your local bank account. This is the easiest way most times I does that with known p2p provider from my local board and is easier for me without having to pass much process with bank.",

Lastly my advice is, you should just use p2p to buy the bitcoin instead of going through the hustle of using a credit card which will subject you to going thru with some regulation troubles and control.",

As long as there is a place that provides why not. Well, continuing what I have read above I think the 12% premium you mentioned is an important consideration because it will be much different from the actual price and if we convert the final result affects your investment emotions.If I'm not mistaken, if looking for a service that offers Bitcoin purchases with credit cards, there are also available on several platforms such as Bitstamp or For other better places, I think it's easy to just search the internet and will display the information you need.",

If you're willing to verify your identity as it looks like, it's probably better to use your bank account directly, or deal with other individuals P2P to eliminate those high fees.Many exchanges do infact accept both debit and credit cards for purchasing Bitcoin these days, am sure cex.io, kraken(if not for certain cases against it ),  moonpay, even Trust wallet, all have  credit card options where if anyone can input their credit card number, card verification value, and expiry date, before they can get to buy the Bitcoin they want with the credit card.If I'm in a county where BTC is regulated and accepted, of course going to the bank or purchasing BTC through the banks would be a very viable option seeing one has little experience using any cryptocurrency exchanges. It is just like that in Brazil and Lugano among other countries currently, who are setting up their society and block centers to accept currency exchange from and to BTC  and thus allow trading to be facilitated .",
