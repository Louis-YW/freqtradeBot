There still no way to conveniently use bitcoin in a easiet way to convert of it into pure money or fiat without giving up a little of our identity. Yes we can hide our tracks but those bitcoin if you want for fiat you need a trusted companion or peer which tells us that guy \"knows you at least by nickname or personally( seen your face)\" so its totally impossible.",

If you're just an everyday user who simply wants to be private, you can make use of these available tools and they're effective enough. But if you are involved in something illicit and global for example that the three-lettered agencies of the US government will have to use their resources to identify you, I bet you'd still be known. But Bitcoin wasn't created to keep all of its users private such that everybody is confident enough to get into all kinds of transactions because they can't be known. Privacy coins probably have that goal.",

If you think that by using Monero you will be completely hidden, then you are wrong, let alone solutions that try to enhance the privacy of Bitcoin, which is not the goal of Bitcoin. basic privacy is supposed to break the link between his inputs and outputs, that is what mixing services do, which provide you with a simple and easy interface to manage CoinJoin transactions or any other mixing method, to enhance privacy such as time delays, dividing Bitcoin into several addresses, and setting a restriction that you do not receive anything from your previous transactions.",

I'm pretty sure some are already doing that, so you don't have to worry about the lack of innovation related to privacy tools. At the same time, there's no way to force all communities to focus on this topic since not everyone feels the urgency to improve the layer of privacy. I'd argue the average joe probably doesn't care about it, and some developers probably think other issues are more important (scalability issues etc).",

In that sense Bitcoin is anonymous, since by looking at a transaction on chain nobody can find your identity. The only way you'd lose that is if you join in a centralized service like CEX and willingly give them your identity through something like KYC which will associate your \"actions\" with your identity. Using a mixing technique improves that.Privacy is when your actions remain hidden which is not possible in a transparent blockchain where every \"action\" is recorded publicly.",

Or should we be focusing on developing new solutions and improvements to further safeguard our privacy in the Bitcoin ecosystem?You can achieve a high level of privacy if you use privacy tools, but that alone isn't enough, because it is easy to de-anonymize yourself when you make a mistake. For example, using privacy tools and sending your coins straight into a centralized exchange does not make sense, because centralized exchanges are data farms, so you can't achieve privacy when you use their service.For a better privacy, you have to use CoinJoin implementations, as well as decentralized exchanges, but if you do these without running your own node but connecting to third party servers, your ip addresses and BTC addresses would be exposed to whichever server you are connected to, so running your own node is also very important if you want to protect your privacy.",
