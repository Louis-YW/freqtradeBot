I'm not afraid of risks but I'm afraid of failure but also, it's making me realize that I can just restart if the business I started has failed and just go back to employment.",

There's a lot of ways in the tech market that means well paid consultancy roles are generally available if you search well for them and have a decent amount of employment/technology experience in that sector taking little or no financial risk to get there.Traditional companies are expensive to start but also oversaturated and with too much competition. Most software development firms also have low overheads and high margins too which seems to make them look like less of a risk (the main cost would be finding an audience).",

This is why financial literacy is needed if you wanted to reach your goals. Your goal is to have more income than expenses. Before you jump into business, it’s important that you know how to handle your money well and not spending it on useless stuff as you are still living within your means. I am currently self-employed and am enjoying it actually, in which I can grow my income by performing more gigs. But of course, it consumes me time and I wanted to have passive income one day with just spending lesser time. Having a traditional business isn’t what I am looking forward to, but it could give us some continuous residual income if we continue to have more customers who are happy with our products and services and kept coming back and order.",

Working under people makes you don't have pretty cool time with your family and based on my concerned family is everything to me. You know, what you just did now is like saying; As a student would you like to become a lecturer, Yes there are those who have skills and passion for teaching because it's not meant for everyone out there. An impatient person can't be a teacher why because he don't want what could delay his time and career. So it is to those who don't have time to start building their businesses because they always wants what could give them instant money to take sort out their needs and take good care of their family's likewise to some people, they don't always have the time to consumed by another's person works/business rather they prefer wanting to invest time in their personal business and grow it up and then employ people to work for them while they take good care of their families.",

If all people wanted to be business owners, then no business would be successful because there would be no employees operating the business; that's how the world works. Unless you asked someone who has no work and is desperate for money, anyone of us would honestly answer \"business owner.\" People want to be the bosses of their own companies, and I do as well, but the problem is that I can't start a business because I lack the necessary knowledge and capital. Business owner is really my answer, but if I look at my situation now, I will just end up as an employee, but if ever I have a chance to grab the opportunity to start a business, why not?",

Two things can be involved with this kind of people who did not go for business and worked for people as employees and make enviable climax like you said. It can be that they have a business by the side managed by someone else far from their work that you know about. They can be in online business and doing paid job of leaving the house in the morning and returning back at night. The second opinion is they working with government and stealing public money to reach that climax.",

Doing business is indeed something that is quite good but not everyone can do business properly and sometimes this is what gets them down when we fail. indeed in this case trying is better than never trying at all but on the other hand we also know that sometimes there are times when we have to know the potential that exists within ourselves so that in that way we are also aware of the abilities we have.",

So many people will choose to be employees before becoming their own owners. But there are also some people who will accept being an employee because they can't stand the pressure of being a boss.",
