No need for this North, East, West, South and Central.  Abeg, make una dey calm down!",

This isn’t right and it’s very unnecessary.",

Back to Naija,I see say u don won carry tribalism come here,this leg go spoil our board because we don learn how to live our lives as one to help one another.Tribalism na e keep Naija the way e be today because everybody think say tribalism na e be ideology. We see everybody as one here and we dey do things as one. So make the love continue like that after all we come from the same Ancestors. The earlier Nigerians see tribalism as a big problem the faster Nigeria will get out of this mess.",
