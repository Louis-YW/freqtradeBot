It is better going through stages in trading. However, if you have opened threads like this, you could close them or this one.",

For me, that’s always the basic rules in trading aside from learning trading consistently. You don’t need to jump into trading just because it promises high returns. But make sure once you start trading, your finances are stable and trade only on what you can afford to lose from your hard-earned money. And always trade with less involvement of your emotions. Otherwise, if you only trade following what your emotions tell you, you will lost your focus and determination to reach your target goals in trading.",

After diving in the market and learning your lessons with trading cost, you wrote this One of the Best Weapons in Trading which is very helpful for traders who don't know about that or never use the Stop-loss order.In addition, a Stop-limit order is helpful too.Stop-Limit Order: What It Is and Why Investors Use ItWhat is a Stop-limit order?QuoteHaving good risk management will help you to become successful trader because it will help you to protect your capital and the more capital you have the longer you will stay in market, you will have a lot of chance to enter in a good trade.Chasing profit, ignoring risk when combining with each other, will bring nightmare for traders. At the end, if nightmare comes, that trader will pay very expensive cost. If it is spot trading, temporary loss can be recovered in future if that project won't die. However if it is Leverage trading or Futures trading, the cost will be very high and if the forced liquidation kills that trader, nearly impossible to come back if capital drops to very low.",

As long as it’s real money there will be some emotions at least.It is true that an actual trading with real money is different, very different than trading with credited number in a demo account. Emotion with real trading and demo trading would be different like you mentioned.Demo trading must be used with clear mind from newbies that they use demo trading because they are newbies, don't understand like how to make buy, sell orders and some more advanced orders like Stop limit, Stop loss, OCO orders. So they can create a demo account to practice with basics and understand basics in trading.However they must aware that a biggest difference between actual and demo trading is emotion and psychology. They have nothing to lose with demo trading and no emotion, no psychological effects on their decisions. With actual trading, with real money, they will be affected more by market news, fuds and their previous trades.[LIST] Demo Trading Platforms",

It was there I realised that very thing isn't real and I was not being careful with the money since it it not real. Besides, if I  blow the accont, another 5k dollars would be assigned to me.As you said above, it is better to start small with any amount so that as you are learning to trade you are also training your emotion and patience.",

I guess that tip will always be essential no matter what since everything comes down with the basic rule as you won’t be in failure in the end if you only stick to what is right in the first place. Investing and trading are both risky, so by investing with a huge amount that you can’t manage to lose, then you are increasing the risk of losing your funds instead of trying to reduced or minimized it because that’s the right thing to do.",
