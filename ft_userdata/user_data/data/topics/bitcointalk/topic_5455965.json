I'm also on an iPhone, and I've been waiting for the iOS version for a long time, but I'm still disappointed about it. If you want to use Electrum, you should use it on a computer or phone with an Android operating system.",

So there's no need to make the OP so panicky and confused. But unfortunately for the OP, Electrum doesn't have an iOS version, so you need to find an alternative.",

BlueWallet is a recommended BTC wallet to use on IOS, it is an open source wallet and a non custodial wallet, just like Electrum. Follow to download BlueWallet: https://bluewallet.io/.If your PC later becomes available and you feel you want to switch to Electrum, you can import your BlueWallet seed phrase into Electrum software wallet. Do your own research about BlueWallet, and to do that you can get features of the wallet here: https://bluewallet.io/features/",

The simple way I do it is usually to manually write it on paper or a special note and save it. Or bookmark the original Electrum website. and pay attention to every letter in the domain really must be the same and nothing is different. After that look at the file you want to download. The original file will not be detected by the virus. So in addition to being aware of the domain, you should also provide extra security on the device using Antivirus,",

A mobile phone is easy to loose or get stolen. And even worse, most people do a ton of shit on their mobile phones which are not recommended on a device managing a crypto wallet.Yes, your keys, your coins. But also your responsibility to keep it safe!With all the app shit that some (most?) users install and use and many apps want and probably need the permission to use the clipboard, not sure how iOS handles that, but on Android likely any app subscribes to changes of the clipboard (though I'm no Android dev & expert).Anyway, depending on how much coins are at stake, one should think early enough to use a hardware wallet (no, don't even think about the Ledger crap, but that's another story and none here to tell). Though I don't know how well the wallet suggestions stated here work with decent hardware wallets, especially on a mobile device.On a PC I use Electrum and Sparrow wallet with a hardware wallet. I run my own Electrum server to maintain privacy for my SPV wallets. That is not a must for a newbie or less computer tech savvy person. But it's not rocket science, either.",
