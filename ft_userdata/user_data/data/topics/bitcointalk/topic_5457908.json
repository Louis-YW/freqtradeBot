What do you think is strange about OP's post?Everything. Just look through his post history. He started off by saying he had 500 BTC to trade off for cash but must meet the other trader face to face. Doesn't that look shady to you?After being questioned by members, he reduced the amount to 3 BTC, but still that's a lot of money to move around with just to meet a stranger for trade.QuoteTo me trading 3BTC with no escrow is a bit much to trade for a first time with no trust.Correct.QuoteAlso why not meeting in a public location for neutral ground? Going to someones private space does feel dodgy.Even if you meet someone in a public location or neutral ground. You will successfully carry out the trade, but a soon as they identify your face. You have put a bullseye on your back. They can later trail you, very well knowing that you are carrying an address containing 3 BTC, and rob you under gun point in a secluded place. I have seen such a thing happen before.Quote from: Wild-West.Trade on June 30, 2023, 02:19:22 AMAlso is Amsterdam that dangerous? I have never been there. It could be New York, London, or Kabul… You can still be robbed anywhere.",

Who knows when a wealthy person with 3 BTC goes to the OP, he is there to hack him on gun point  with his gang  The face-to-face exchange, as it used to be, when bitcoin was worth little, is already a thing of the past. The times when the exchange took place in cafes are far behind. Now it is very risky to make any transactions with cryptocurrencies for cash. Undoubtedly, this is the best way to exchange btc and leave no trace, but I repeat, this is very risky. P2P exchange is now possible only online, on platforms such as binance (centralized) or bisq (decentralized), when the platform acts as an intermediary and guarantor of the integrity of the transaction.I also don’t understand who in their right mind would agree to OP’s conditions with a minimum exchange of 3 BTC with a complete stranger with a completely unknown reputation. It has to be completely desperate.This topic looks like bait for simpletons.",

Will you ask the person for any personal data, or is the whole process done in secret? If you are going to ask for data, why not go to the OTC market, where he can buy legally, sometimes at a price lower than the market price by 1% or more, according to the quantity required.Move this topic to the local board they will have a better knowledge of financial laws in Amsterdam or the Netherlands",
