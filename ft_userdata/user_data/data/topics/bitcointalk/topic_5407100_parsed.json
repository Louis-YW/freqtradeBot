Companies holding a speculative asset in their balance sheet will be forced to sell if the asset is not bringing profit for their monthly income statement. I reckon if bitcoin continues to dump, I speculate that Michael Saylor will be forced to deleverage. Let us wish this will not become true.Tesla (TSLA) reported its Q2 earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday, meeting analystsâ€™ estimates, following a prolonged COVID-induced shutdown at its Shanghai production facility.The company also says it sold 75% of its Bitcoin, turning it into fiat currency, adding $936 million in cash to its balance sheet. The quarter, however, ended Tesla's streak of reporting record revenue.Source https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-q2-earnings-2022-201008978.html",

We all remember how market reacted several years ago when crypto community saw words Elon Mask, Bitcoin and Tesla been together in one sentence. We see same words today, but with a negative context, but leading currencies have lost only 3-6% of their yesterdays value. Either there will be more consequences, or few people care about Tesla and Bitcoin nowadays.",

With most of the voting power in MSTR, the price would have to drop a lot before it would be forced to liquidate anything. I don't know if perhaps an attack of short positions could force him. Saylor liquidating part of his BTC holdings would make him look like a big mouth much more than he is looking lately.",

Probably yes and no.It could be, but bitcoin price has been rising since last weekend, that has been 5 days ago. The bear market is not yet over. The decline has also not been significant.",

There's nothing wrong with viewing a financial asset as \"speculative\".Speculation is having a high risk/reward attitude in trading. It's simply buying low and selling high for profit.I don't know why the term \"speculation\" still has negative connotation attached to it.Elon Musk never expressed any positive opinions about Bitcoin, he mostly neutral about BTC, so we shouldn't think that he was a hardcore Bitcoin believer.",

Even this forum could not get around this news, because more than one topic has already been created with a discussion of this topic.

Can they sell in the Q2 at a loss, for some tax break or something like that?Unlikely it was for a tax break, as someone else pointed out (in one of the many other threads regarding this topic) they bought in Q4 2020, not in Q1 2021 as many assumed (included myself):Quote from: dragonvslinux on July 21, 2022, 02:25:24 PMQuote from: franky1 on July 20, 2022, 11:25:39 PMelon bought his stash in-before december 2020. he reported it on the december 2020 tax filings.... those tax filings entered the media circus of speculation viral commenting about it in feb-march 2021So they bought around $20K or less, and sold somewhere between $17.5K and $47K, based on Q2 price range.So really, Tesla bought at the beginning of the bull market and sold at some point when price turned bearish - no doubt for a profit if they had any sense (or risk management) - it's unlikely they would of sold for a loss. It seems like they saw the opportunity for quick profit, and despite liking the idea of having a % in a reverse asset like Bitcoin, prefer to do so when the market is trending upwards as opposed to downwards.I otherwise think its unlikely that they were buying this month, even if totally possible. More likely they would wait for a trend reversal or some form of stability rather than risking buying an asset which is (by many metrics) in a downtrend. More likely they buy next year around $30K to $40K imo, even if it'd be higher than current prices, probably still less than where they sold at.Ultimately if they sold for profit / to reduce risk, it's unlikely they'd be exposing themselves to Bitcoin right now given the current risk of further downside. It wouldn't be very logical if your strategy is low risk.",

I believe he was in Argentina when a bank didn't allow him to move millions of his own money out of the country.Plus once many more people truly understands that one of Bitcoin's underlying nature also political that weakens strongholds and bounderies, I believe developing/emerging nation-states will also start, or should start, HODLing Bitcoin in their treasuries.",
