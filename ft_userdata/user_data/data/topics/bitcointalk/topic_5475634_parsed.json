If they'd stop, and people would make less than 1 Mb of transactions per 10 minutes (excluding the witness data), you'd be able to send 1 sat/vbyte transactions once again and get them confirmed after an average time of ~5 minutes (after the backlog has cleared offcourse).By the way, transactions are broadcasted allmost instantly... They remain in the mempool of the nodes untill they end up in a block, it's this process that takes very long ATM.If you want cheaper fees, or faster confirmations, you should either look at altcoins, sidechains and/or offchain sollutions.",

Like when all Bitcoins are  mined and there are mainly holders instead of traders and volume of transactions decline. The time to mine a block which is set at a default of 10 minutes but still varies, although your claim of it been confirmed in 1-3 hours is not valid because even the current blocks mined in the space of that 1-3 hours is upto 12 blocks. In the future no one is issue if the block time will reduce except if we got a fork on the increase of block size or people do not make too much transactions then (which I don’t think will happen since we all are expecting a higher number of users). Also even if all bitcoin are mined I don’t think they will be no traders or the volume of transactions will reduce, it would be same like we have now or even higher. Mining ending doesn’t mean that bitcoin protocol will change, the only thing that will change is the stopping of mining and everything will practically still be the same",

Currently there are several solutions such as Lightning network or taprot. But there are indeed some other weaknesses and problems posed in those 2 ways.  I am also increasingly worried about this situation, because the fee will be bigger and it makes me a little insincere if I have to use a large fee.   Because sometimes it's not worth the amount we send. Bitcoin as the first crypto does have scalability problems. Moreover, several other coins that use the bitcoin network are increasingly adding to the dense network. It looks like there should be further consensus development on the basis of Bitcoin remaining secure.  CMIIW",

Do you mean getting confirmed? Or do you mean getting enough confirmations, so that your transaction is credited on an custodial services like exchanges? The confirmation time depends on the fee rate (in sat/vbyte) of your transaction and how congested the network is. It's possible that a transaction stays unconfirmed for months.And take note that even if the fee rate you use for your transaction is high enough, you have to wait until the next block is mined.",

I believe if their are more miners, the confirmation speed or time would be lesser than it used to be and possibly, the price would reduce irrespective of the increase in daily transactions if I am not mistaken.I'm sorry to say, but you are mistaken...If there would be more miners, the time between 2 blocks would slightly decrease for a maximum  of ~2 weeks. Every 2016 blocks (= ~2weeks), the difficulty gets adjusted, so if new miners would flood in and the average time between 2 blocks would decrease very slightly, the next diff adjustment would just increase the difficulty so the average time between 2 blocks would once again be 10 minutes. Same logic goes when a lot of miners would leave our ecosystem: the average time between 2 blocks would increase untill the next diff adjustment, the difficulty would decrease at the next diff adjustment, and the average time would be ~10 minutes again.I'm also having trouble following the first part of your post... which app, which garbage,... ?",

Is it possible in future that this transaction time will reduce or may be even become instant? Like when all Bitcoins are  mined and there are mainly holders instead of traders and volume of transactions decline. If the time between blocks is reduced, then you will need more than one block, and you may find that some services consider the transaction complete after 10 blocks or even more blocks, as in BSV, where the matter reached 1k of confirmations[1].Therefore, an average of 10 minutes is useful, and the higher fees you pay, the higher the probability that your transaction will be confirmed within less than 10 minutes. If you want instant transactions, use the Lightning Network or side networks.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/lpp0kb/bsv_transaction_taken_4_days_and_still_less_than/",

Like when all Bitcoins are  mined and there are mainly holders instead of traders and volume of transactions decline. Fees rely on network congestion. If it's congested, you need to pay higher fees so your transaction will be prioritized. I think that has been the norm, and that's the reason why altcoins are created.

Sometimes, they release withdrawals with low fees, and their user cannot bump the fees. They have no way other than waiting hours to confirm their transaction. Most centralized exchanges charge a fixed fee from users, but they release many transactions in a single transfer and that's where they try to save money. Sometimes they spend good enough as well. But the problem is, their user has no control. That is one of the reasons we suggest not to use centralized services.",

I believe the average confirmation time of 10 minutes was chosen to avoid waste of computational power. BTC nodes validate blocks and propagate them to other nodes, so the network needs time for this propagation and to ensure that miners do not waste power looking for blocks that have already been mined.Quote from: stadus on November 27, 2023, 10:59:53 AMI think that has been the norm, and that's the reason why altcoins are created.

Like when all Bitcoins are  mined and there are mainly holders instead of traders and volume of transactions decline. Yeah, it is possible because the congestion on the network is due to the Ordinals and dust transactions, and these problems are due to the scalability issues of the BTC blockchain. If you have used lightning network then you would have known that the lowest transaction fee is on LN. Like it is in 0.001 to 0.003 dollars. They are really good because they are making transactions off-chain. Besides this solution, there would be other solutions might be brought but till now they are not like I mentioned in my previous replies about side and drive chains, they are like child chains of the main blockchain but I don't know that if its is possible or not",
