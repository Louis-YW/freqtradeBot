  "content": "As title says I want to know if there is special thing about bull reason became I have seen lots of people always asking about when is bull and whenever is bull they will ask when is bear, does this has any changes or affects people who don't have any investment?I can clearly see lots of thread asking of bull and I strongly believe is same people who still asked about bear. To me it should be someone who really have an investment could talks about this.- Now why must they talks about Bull?One could talks about bull because he needs some funds to either settles their physical challenges which includes; Rentage, School fees, health issues, car maintenance and many more because they needs the price to appreciate so they could make enough gain with their little investment.- Why people talks about Bear?Talking about bear market should connotes that you are really ready to invest, to buy at dip which you are to get ready for the next bull run and it should aligned with your investment strategies of either short terms or long terms. This also simply shows that you have a free money to spare meaning you are not haste of any money to be used to settle any physical challenge or needs which may arose within a limited time.- Which areas of investment do I focused?Yes, as an investor you should know what you want or the forms of token and coin (currencies) you want to invest otherwise your investment might not yield for you without proper coin being selected to invest.Do I have any coin in mind to recommend you to invest?Yes I do, I as a strong believer of cryptocurrency there are only few coin which I do love to tell anyone to invest these includes;- Bitcoin- Ethereum- BNB- MATIC- LINk- TRX- XRP- XLM- CAKEAnd then lastly yours,Â  if any you could list yours on the comments section to have good atcoin to hold for the next bull runNote that these above listed coin are ones I love to buy and hold and have been holding some for long now, and is not financially advise, you are liable for your investment and for all always invest what you can afford to loose.",
