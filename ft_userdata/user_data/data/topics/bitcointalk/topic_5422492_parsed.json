I am also open to take payment in bitcoin, just dm me here  If you want to place an order go to https://www.fiverr.com/share/0NxelLI can do everything that e.g. adobe acrobat pro offers, but without you needing to get an expensive subscription  license 25 $ a month or 250$ per year. Most of the time you only need this type of gig one or two times per month, lets say you need two books converted to editable text 1000 pages, that is only 10 dollar for my service. I also deliver much quicker specially when doing lots of documents 1000 images at a time and so on. Best RegardsSweden_Pro",

That can be a good deal especially when you don't regularly need to convert the documents. Also, the OP is a level one seller at a fiverr and got some good reviews, 4.8 to be exact out of six reviews. I haven't tried his service but just check his profile at fiverr.",

I haven't tried his service but just check his profile at fiverr.Well, I'm not going to do it because I have an Acrobat Pro license, but besides, you don't even need it nowadays. Google lens for example does the same for you, and I'm sure that if I start searching I'll find a few more apps that do the same for me.I suppose someone might find it useful, but it's not for me. Good luck.",

They may better buy the Adobe version of the software, Acrobat Pro, and that will be a better option for those who need this conversation often.",
