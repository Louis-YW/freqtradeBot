Satoshi made the first transaction to Hal Finney. So from the Coinbase transaction 50 BTC Satoshi gave 10 Bitcoins and left 40 and later it went to other address. It was the test transaction. Now what about block #11 and # 12 and all other Block Satoshi Mined from his one single computer ?  Every think no body knows who is Satoshi ?  No one know what he is doing now ?  No one knows what has happened to his Bitcoin Stash ?  This are quite interesting story. I am fascinated about those things same like every body who has interest to know the true story of Bitcoin invention. How many Bitcoin does Satoshi really mined ? Did he mined more than 1.1 million ? If Satoshi is a Japanese Samurai it's mean he must be speaking Japanese ?  There are two language in Japan. Main is Nippon and the other one is Ainu. Satoshi must be from Kyoto and speak Nippon or from Hokaido and speak Ainu. But he published his white paper in English mean he lives some where in a English speaking country. There is huge out cry in the news media and Internet, will the real Satoshi please stand up? When he read this kinds of news, I think Satoshi does stand up from his sofa where he sits and relax but when he stand up , no body see him. The news media should publish a Article saying, Will the real Satoshi please Stand-up and come forward and reveal your Identity. Then Satoshi might definitely stand up from his Sofa and come out of his Room and say to the media, \"here I Am Satoshi Nakamoto\" , why are you interested in me ? What do you want ? Stop searching for me. I am not hiding. I am here and there, every where, you blind folks , you cannot see me. Now open your eyes and search for me in the Google or in the YouTube and yee shall find me. He who find me, I will invite him and give him some Bitcoins, may be 2 or 10.",

He can't risk he can maintain his anonymity after several technological advances today like the chainalysis and some groups.Old dormant wallets are somehow being monitored. When an old wallet suddenly sends out its BTC to exchange, there will be tweets letting everybody know about it. Exchanges today can't be trusted, you know they can prevent them from withdrawing or asking for KYC. Old wallets in the time when Satoshi was still active may just be as suspicious to those tracking him.",

He can't cash his coins anonymously because the blockchain is public information and people will realize if satoshi move his coins. By the way, satoshi doesn't have opponents. This is not a competence.Quote from: DigitalMonk on August 22, 2022, 01:51:17 PMAnd he still can maintain his anonymity, can't he ? The only way to do this is if he swap his bitcoins to Monero. That's the right way to be anonymous in the crypto world. But in the moment he send the moneros to an exchange, than he can be tracked.",

Lol! You are trying to get an answer to a mystery which the entire bitcoin community don't know. There is an address which we believe belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto. Read the below article,https://bitcoinplanet.net/info/what-is-the-wallet-address-of-satoshi-nakamoto/Also the rebranding to QT to core doesn't affect the functionality of Satoshi's wallets till the time he holds the private key. That shows the true beauty of decentralization. It's not a bank where a group of people can ban you from accessing your own money!",

I am not an ordinary Hashish s.oking Monk but I am a SHA-256 hash calculating Monk. As you know it by my Forum ID. I am very new to this Bitcoin Forum. Please do not insult me. I am praying for all Forum members that one they will be more richer by  trading Bitcoin instead of keeping their money in the bank account for 1.4% interest. Bitcoin is making people richer every day. I don't understand why Warren Buffet is missing the point. Elon Musk has made 17 Billons out of Bitcoin trading. JP Morgan is also has invested a large amount. I will buy soon more and more for my charity support. Any profits I will make will be spent for charity.",
