Therefore make we just they trade for there and send our money back to the wallets we have our private keys with us.",

Nigerians, on the other hand, are stupid because I don't see why anyone would leave their valuables on such low-budget sites. I feel bad for the victims but Patricia needed to be stopped",

I often see their founder living the dream on social media, it gave me the impression that they believe they have nothing to worry about. This is only the first hack, I hope they can fix the situation and refund their clients, it will be such a shame to see such a thriving company go down like that. This should be a warning to their competitors Roqqu to take precautions and also to crypto investors never to hodl their coins in an exchange.",

Dis na big shame to the company if dey don come dis far and dem still dey face security breach challenges. I’m not trying to encourage dem to do better so dat customers will have confident of their money saved with them but to keep their reputation at least of not losing all customers to their contemporaries. No matter how good an exchange is, it can never be completely relied on and this is just an example of what the forum always frown about not keeping most of your savings with exchanges. I hope the customers are compensated for their money soon.",

Scams na very big problem for inside online businesses, and problem be say you no know whether the scam na internal or external, because some fraudsters go open business with the aim of defrauding unsuspecting customers. Anyway the biggest lesson wey I don learn for here as a beginner be say e de safe and better to keep our assets for inside a noncustodial wallet, to avoid story for our hard earned money. If this Patricia, dey legit, I hope say make them come back stronger, so people no go loose trust for online businesses in Nigeria.",

But then again what do you expect from a company that didn't put so much into their security structure. Now they have given more credence to the \"Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins\" maxim. And again and again why self custody is the path to go. I do not think they have found any culprit as they have claimed. It is all PR to prevent their customers and the public from FUD. On the other hand, this is a huge wake up call to them. Hacks are not anything new to exchanges. Binance has been hacked. It is what they do after that matters. First thing first is to work on their security infrastructure and second thing which is the hardest is to win by the public trust and confidence because a lot of persons are going to close down their account. They need a great PR team here and their CEO Hanu Fejiro Agbodje has to be at the forefront of it just like CZ did and is doing.",

Well with all the teaching and knowledge I have gather from my short stay here, I have learnt one vital note which is the phrase of not your keys not your coins and its very simple though you just actually have to save your money in place where you are the one with full control and send them to the exchange whenever you actually feel like selling your coins. That way your coins will be safe from any scandals or shenanigan that will ever happen to these centralized exchanges.",

For a platform with such a record, although they are not publicly proven to be scumbags, this kind of news is likely to happen anyway. In cases like this, the victims have a very small percentage of getting their refunds, and anyone who is not yet affected should just hope they release their restricted withdrawal very soon, because right now they will not want to allow people to withdraw all their funds at once, for it will completely shut them down. That's if they even have enough funds to cover their depositors withdrawals, because all this centralized system can be so tricky sometimes and joke with people's money in their possession.",

At least when Paxful was about to short down, they made an announcement that if anyone has coins there should move it out within a specific period of time they gave and why Patricia exchange could not do that to save lives. And one thing why people are keeping their coins in the exchange platforms is because of the recent development of high cost of transaction fees. Because if you keep not exchange and you want to sell, it will make the process very easy. And not the exchange you see in the net should be used. Most of them are there siphoned coins to their personal wallets so be careful with your dealings with these exchange platforms. Just like as the OP said, \"Not your key and not your coins\"",
