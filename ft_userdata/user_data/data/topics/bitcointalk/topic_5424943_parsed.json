Also can you also elaborate, how did you know that no one was winning there? And how exactly they are scamming? Arenâ€™t their games provably fair? Some evidence or proofs might really help us to understand the matter in more depth. Nevertheless I would suggest you to play on trusted casinos and gambling sites. You can check stake.com . They are very reputable and operating since many years. Tell us your experience OP after visiting this site.",

Probably you are only doing a random bet on a random games that has a low winning percentage. Online casino nowadays has a license to operate that assure all players for a probably fair gaming. So the chance for them to scam you is very low because they are having a good profit with a fair game due to house edge that makes house always win on all players bet in the long run.Itâ€™s not about the casino is the problem but your way on playing gambling. You should stay away on spending on gambling if you donâ€™t fully understand the risk. This topic is more appropriate on gambling discussion board because thatâ€™s the place where pro usually post.",
