Based in Russia, Hydra not only facilitated drug sales, but also offered money laundering services to cybercriminals, including ransomware attackers. Garantex is a high-risk crypto exchange based in Russia and was sanctioned at the same time as Hydra for similar money laundering activity. Unlike Hydra, Garantex continues to operate following its designation.Tornado Cash is a decentralized mixing service on the Ethereum blockchain that was sanctioned in August 2022 (and again in November) for facilitating money laundering, primarily in relation to funds stolen in cryptocurrency hacks by cybercriminals associated with North Korea. Tornado Cash is currently the only DeFi protocol to have been sanctioned by OFAC — all other designations have been centralized services or personal wallets. As a DeFi protocol, no person or organization can “pull the plug” as easily on Tornado Cash as they could with a centralized service, which has led to questions around the feasibility of sanctioning the service and who, if anyone, can be held responsible for criminal activity it facilitates. \"__I was surprised to find out that there was a crypto exchange in Russia.",
