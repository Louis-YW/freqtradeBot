      "body": "What are you trying to do before you shown that error? Does it show when opening up the extension? I tried to search around, especially on Metamask's GitHub and its community support site, but there is no such kind of error that others had, maybe you should also ask it there.One thing to consider is to make sure you install it from legitimate sources, and if it still got an error, try to reset the extension, and reimport back your wallet seed phrase. If that is no luck, I think completely resetting the browser might be the option. I tried Metamask on Chrome, but couldn't reproduce the error on the latest version.",

Thank you.haven't experience such this error before, pls try reinstall the wallet from original source and import your seeds, if same after that best option is using another browser, recently chrome indicate some errors that should be reported to devps, However contact MM support if you have continuously rising same issue bro.",

Thank you.Are you sure you are downloading a legit metamask extension? This is quite surprising cause ita rarely to see such error and I dont understand the Statement regarding variable $1 but not defined. Is it some sort of payment? Cause its a free download. Which one you used pc or mobile device? Can you share us some images to check it properly. Oh edited.Your rank still newbie. But can you explain much in details.",

It's great that it has been fixed by the publisher just as that guy have answered on that thread. Well, it seems that this thread has already served the purpose and you're able to download what you're trying to download. Maybe for future reference, someone might find this thread and will refer if ever the same error exists as they download some extension. You can go ahead and lock the topic as it's solved your concern.",

It's easier and more compatible with using the browser extension to Google Chome.Although it eats a lot of ram and space in your PC. If you can use any other browser like Brave or Firefox or even Edge, well that's on you for what's more convenient to you in using.",
