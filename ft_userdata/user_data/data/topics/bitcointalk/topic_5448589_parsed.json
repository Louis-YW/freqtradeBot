Bitcoin should not be seen as a means to launder money or cut taxes, as a good citizen you should be able to explain your source of income to the government. Maybe I’m missing your point.",

If you're asked to explain your type of employment or investments, you can disguise yourself and use something unrelated to bitcoin if you're in a location where knowing about your investment could put you in danger. We all know who we trust and the types of people we are surrounded by in our surroundings; once we've adapted, we can discern who to be open to and who not to relate to concerning the type of work we're doing. There’s no special way to know a suitable environment for bitcoin discussion, maybe your instincts could tell. Also, no any network provider will listen to your conversation if you’re not a suspect to be tracked for a susceptible crime offense.",

Private data shouldn't be discussed or shared with others, we must keep the information about private keys and the like. Only talk about them with close people only or our family members only. And it is better to avoid discussing/talking via smartphone. Why don't we discuss/talk directly to them? I think it should be safer. We also need to choose the right time and place to talk about private information. Never talk about them in public places/areas, better to talk at home.",
