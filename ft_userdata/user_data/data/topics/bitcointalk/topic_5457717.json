  "content": "Over the past few years, I have noticed a downward trend in Bitcointalk in the leading position of the platform where new ideas, projects, blockchains, tokens, Bounty and other usual forum activities are published and discussed. Instead, from time to time, messages from the old users pop up, which in most cases imitate activity, due to the lease of the signature to gambling platform.The usual activity of the forum has long been scattered between Twitter, Telegram and Discord where it is not possible to get acquainted with the activity and merit of the user in order to distinguish the account from the bot farm or make sure that the transaction and other interactions are fair.On Twitter witnessed the impossibility of finding information about a project/token of interest without tripping over a lot of tweets of fraudulent token giveaways created by armies of bots and scammers, or by following only the accounts you are interested in on Twitter - find in feed tweets about politics and recent events instead of tweets from the subscription.In ancient times, looking information about a crypto project, it was enough to read the project topic and, based on the feedback, analyze what is now a great luxury, since new projects do not even create a topic or do not even know about the existence of Bitcointalk.Against the background of these observations, the question has matured: does the crypto community now need a new platform like Bitcointalk, only with more relevant and modern tools?There was an idea to make a fully or partially decentralized social network with profiles and a rating system, convenient web3 authorization, a private messenger, where you can also comment or suggest ideas, projects, look for like-minded people and contribute to the crypto community together, conduct Bounty and Airdrop and other activities from the current platform. The last point can be given special attention, making them functionally like Zealy and its analogues.So that the news feed platform is not empty at first, we can parse popular tweets from crypto Twitter accounts and sort them into categories: Bitcoin, Altcoins, NFT, web3 and others using artificial intelligence tools.Interested in your opinion, what you are interested in and you can add more.If activity gathers in this thread, we can think about competition with a cash prize for the best idea to attract an audience to the platform.",

      "body": "Trust me, many crypto forums have been created, but no is close to how active or clean Bitcointalk is. Maybe Reddit can try. You won't find a cesspool of scam in this forum like you would find in forums like beermoneyforumsObviously, numbers have dwindled because the spammers and account farmers have been fought against so hard, but if you want quality over quantity. The Bitcointalk is worth looking into. You have to understand the main reason bitcointalk was created. To discuss Bitcoin. The other forums came in later when altcoins were created. Ethereum, the biggest altcoin created their own forum and moved away from Bitcointalk and created their own forum... Guess where it is today - https://wayback.archive-it.org/16516/20210618210825/https://forum.ethereum.org/",

In my opinion, token should solve the user's problems and be used correctly, and not only for speculative purposes, as in most projects.Do not post your topic in the board that is the most active, but rather in the one that is relevant to your topic. For instance, if you wanna talk about a new social platform idea, the Project Development board would be the perfect spot for it. As for your question, I love online forum discussions. Sure, there are things that could use some improvement here, because this software is kinda outdated. But if we were to dive into creating a new platform, the major challenge would be getting users on board.",

There is also hive.blog, I personally find this project heavily underrated. It does many things already that web3 communities are trying to achieve.",
