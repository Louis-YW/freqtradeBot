Tell us what you think the future of this is, and what projects inspire you?For me its axie infinity. I guess majority got influenced how they roll the dice last 2021. It seems a lot of users or developers got inspired and thats how metaverse born. But before axie, there are older projects for that use case its just that they are the one become popular due to their game axie infinity.",

It will always be like that there's something new that will come and a trend of it will be built and during the bull run, everyone will think that it's the best of it and looks like it will never end. But when the bear market comes, everyone will stumble and going to see how hard it is for these projects to recover because it's always like this cycle hitting hard on these projects. It's totally a cycle from the beginning coming from, ico and last trend was NFTs, we'll see the web 3 and layer 1-2 projects and so on.",

Meta is a tech and sooner or later someone will tapped or expand the meta on different sector. Its just like facebook before, that really become a huge adoption once the people get to know it.
