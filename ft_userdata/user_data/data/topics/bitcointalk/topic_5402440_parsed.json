Indicators can not save your capital if you apply it incorrectly.Let's look at history of news stories on Bitcoin is dead: https://www.bitcoinisdead.org/More than 450 times it was called as dead but it is fine and it will still be fine in future.However, now the market is in chaos and lot of fud, risk of liquidation on institutional, project accounts to personal, retail accounts. So my advice is just it is time to protect your capital, with spot position only. Let's say no with leverage in this period. Then months later you will be fine.",

When we look for news, we are looking for its psychological impact on new investors (weak hands), which is a completely different concept from technical analysis, which is intended to follow patterns to determine entry and exit points using several indicators such as support and resistance levels, Fibonacci analysis, and others.FUD: Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (often shortened to FUD) is a propaganda tactic used in sales, marketing, public relations, politics, polling and cults.Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubtTechnical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities in price trends and patterns seen on charts.Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.aspQuote from: okorieemmanuel on June 14, 2022, 08:47:15 AMThis williams indicator looks too good.

      "body": "Good thread. Williams %R is one of the handy tools in TA. However, it is not an absolute measure. We always take Williams %R as relative measure in cumulation with the price movements. So, the following observation from you may not be entirely correct:Quote from: Husires on June 13, 2022, 03:18:56 PM..A reading above -20 is considered the peak area, which means that a correction may be close, and therefore it is an exit or selling point for the assets.The exact opposite happens to the reading below -80, the oversold area, and therefore it is an entry or buying point for assets...Reading above -20 as an absolute measure shows an overbought position but such overbought position isn't a signal of upcoming correction/fall unless we see sharp downtrend in the prices along with the simultaneous decline in William %R below -20.",
