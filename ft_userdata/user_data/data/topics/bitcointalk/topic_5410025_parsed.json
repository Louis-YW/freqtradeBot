  "content": "Sorry if i write this in wrong section, admin/mod can replace the topic in that chase.I wanted to exchange some of my Monero to bitcoins ,at the exchange site i sent the Monero how ever it did not arrive in time so the time frame ran out, at start i could not spend anything from monero wallet duo to doubble spent error message, but the wallet still displays my coins. How ever today it says i have send the XMR and my wallet is now empty with the status of pending on the amount i tried to send to the exchange siteWhere is the problem, the exchange site never got the monero it seems? But why is my wallet pending the amount and why wont it bounce back?I use monero online wallets. Any help would be very helpful.Im willing to pay a fee to anyone who can sort this issue and a few other crypto issues like this asap.",

CEX doesn't have a time frame to run out, they should credit your account any time the payment is received. The coin swaps have a time frame but you have to contact them with the transaction information and see what they can do for you.",

But being the most known (imho) online service for Monero wallet, I'd expect they did and the exchange didn't. However, as I said, ask the support. Ask the support of MyMonero; ask the support of the exchange.",

CakeWallet would be the best wallet for Monero because it has an exchange feature itself that supports Bitcoin and Litecoin and as I've heard it's open-source also.  Or else, the best of all is a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S wallet with full node support.I've suspected also that this isn't a problem with the wallet that OP used, it's on the exchange, just contact the support of that exchange as stated above.I hope OP will come back and give an update here.",

They are too anonymous to the point that if you want to look at the transaction in a block explorer, it will show different addresses and empty amounts. So, it's complex to prove to the exchange the transaction. Maybe the amount and the time stamp is the real info that you can provide to their support. Things would be easier if you were dealing with bitcoin where blockchain shows real information.",

If this is something a non-custodial one or totally decentralized then the receiving point (exchange) does have that problem.If the transaction shown that it had been transferred on the correct address on where that exchange gives then it should really be there as long it is confirmed and since you could track and see it fully then there's no doubt that exchange you are dealing with is something shady.You should at least do make out some mention on what wallet you've been using and what exchange you are talking into.",

This because the CEO and the team has a control the whole of his coin, not like a coin that really decentralized and the CEO or team don't have any way to freeze the coin.The signature you wear is one example of centralized coin, so be worried if you plan to hold it for long term",

Because centralized exchanges partially require manual confirmation. Maybe you can see the coins in your wallet, but they haven't sent the coins to the exchange wallet so you can't make the next transaction. You need to be patient until the exchange team confirms it, or you can send a ticket to the team.Do not send information in the telegram group, because that information will be used by scammers, and they will contact you asking for a fee, while they cannot solve the case. Send a PM to the exchange admin or group admin!",
