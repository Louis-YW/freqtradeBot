I repeat DeSantis has no chance at beating Trump.The latest Rasmussen Poll has Trump winning by double digits and I think he'll win by more.Trump only needs around 30% of the vote to win given the amount of potential candidates in the field and I truly believe he'll get that just from the MAGA voters turning out. DeSantis doesn't even have a base outside of Florida.I really believe DeSantis re-election victory has given him a false sense of hope.If you guys want to win some easy money I suggest placing a bet on Trump.",

      "body": "If you look closely at DeSantis, you will find two things:1. He is reasonably good at working for the people;2. He does it in ways that he isn't really authorized to do as governor, and he hurts some of the people in doing it this way.Trump does similar, but he is way smarter than DeSantis at doing good for all the people.",

      "body": "You're probably correct because the GOP base has become accustom to losing. They would prefer to have Trump run again after losing once before to the same person, who I may remind you is in some vegetative state.Trump only needs a plurality in the Republican primary. He can get away with a win even if a majority of primary voters vote against him. It's how he was able to win the primaries in 2016. DeSantis would need the support of everyone else except for Trump voters, which is difficult in a crowded primary field where the vote is going to be split a dozen different ways.So if Trump wins the primary, he will lose again to Joe Biden as nearly every head-to-head poll shows Trump losing to Joe Biden. If DeSantis miraculously wins the primary, he would lose to Biden only because ~5% of GOP voters would rather stay home and let Biden win instead of voting for the man that beat out their guy in the primaries.Don't see any foreseeable way Joe Biden leaves office in 2024 meaning a dementia patient will continue to oversee global order.",

Actually, I was waiting to see who the governor would react to the accusations from the former president on grooming high-school girls... DeSantis did not even fight back. At this point, I believe DeSantis is just hoping for Trump to get indicted and prosecuted, so he won't have to deal with him.",

DeSantis is avoiding media appearances and has now pulled out of CPAC because he is afraid of Trump. He thinks running from Trump is going to help him and polls show that is not the case.I think it will be a Trump vs Biden/Newsome presidential race.",

After all Hillary Clinton was projected to win the elections by almost all the polls but she ended up losing. International polls predicted that the Labour Party will win the just concluded Nigerian elections but it turned out negative. Elections are prone to manipulation and situations can immediately change the choice of electorate. Let Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump go to the election and compete for the Republican party ticket and let the winner emerge. I have so much respect for Ron DeSantis because of his courage to contest against the Emperor Emeritus even in the face of political bullying and intimidation.",

It doesn't have much to do with how many people love him, or CPAC polls.Trump lost in 2020 not because he didn't have the people. Rather, he lost because of election fraud, just like Kari Lake lost in Arizona. If Trump can't control the fraud, both electronically, and mail-ins, and cheating right in the election centers of the various States, he will lose again.The point isn't Trump vs. DeSantis. DeSantis isn't well enough known to be competition for Trump. The point is Trump vs. whoever the Dems are going to run against him.Watch the video at the below site ( https://rumble.com/embed/v28zcgw/?pub=4 ).Trump Promises \"Quantum Leap\" For A New Americahttps://www.zerohedge.com/political/trump-promises-quantum-leap-new-america\"Past generations of Americans pursued big dreams and daring projects that once seemed absolutely impossible. They pushed across an unsettled continent and built new cities in the wild frontier. They transformed American life with the interstate highway system, magnificent it was, and they launched a vast network of satellites into orbit all around the earth. But today, our country has lost its boldness. Under my leadership, we will get it back in a very big way,\" Trump said in a video address released Friday....",
