  "content": "The cryptospace appears to be having a domino effect in insolvency after the collapse of Terra Luna. The rumors are presently saying that much of the liquidity in Defi comes from Celsius and also a big part of it is Justin Sun. I am scratching my head in laughter if this is reality or fud hehehe. In any case, yes Celsius appears to have held UST and deposited them in Anchor to get 20% yields. They might have taken a large loss in that. 3 Arrows Capital and other billion dollar cryptofunds might also have money frozen in Celsius.However, this is not the big news. There are some who speculate that the Ethereum Foundation has deposited funds in Celsius. There is a transaction hash some have said but I have not seen it. It might only be fud. Crypto lender Celsius has hired lawyers from Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP as it mulls its financial options after halting withdrawals this past weekend, according to the Wall Street Journal.Restructuring lawyers have been tapped from the law firm as it mulls what to do after freezing withdrawals, account transfers and swaps. Celsius cited \"extreme market conditions\" in its announcement at the time.The Wall Street Journal report said that Celsius \"is first looking for possible financing options from investors but is also exploring other strategic alternatives, including a financial restructuring,\" according to a source with knowledge of the process.Read in full https://www.theblock.co/linked/152084/crypto-lender-celsius-mulls-possible-restructuring-amid-financial-woes-wsj",

The company isn't just mulling possible restructuring; it is definitely compelled to do some restructuring because it doesn't have a choice. It is falling. It is dying. It is fast losing liquidity. Celsius can't absorb all these big and panic withdrawals. And these revelations--including the withdrawal freeze--although right and good, are not helping. They only make many of their clients more fearful and therefore withdraw, thereby causing more drains from the company.",

Reuters first reported that the regulator has begun investigating Celsius' move to freeze withdrawals and transfers on Monday. Reuters' report states that Texas has labelled its investigation a \"priority,\" and that the regulator is \"very concerned\" that the freeze may result in \"significant financial consequences\" for customers.",

Celsius model business was solid.You lend people money in crypto, you make them have 120% collateral, and you charge the ones you lend money to more than you charge people depositing.Unlike banks you have no fear of people getting unemployed and not being able to pay, but you have no problems with the value of the collateral as you don't issue mortgages that might turn 1/4 of the value, and more important you have a lot of clients with bad credit interested in short loans, clients who would pay 10% of in a month to get the funds needed fast.In many aspects, the business was solid, more solid than being a loan shark or a bank or a pawn shop, but their problem was they tried to get more and they started using the money that was supposed to cover swings in collateral (as rumors say) to farm yields in different schemes, basically, greed kicked in, and the results, well, suck. I don't have a penny in Celsius but I know guys who had, and I can't blame them, normally you shouldn't have had a problem with it, of course besides the usually hacks and \"hacks\".",

Now that it has gone wrong, there is essentially nothing users can do but to sit and cross their fingers that they might get some portion of their coins back again, but it seems unlikely.This should be a very stark wake up call for anyone who is holding coins on any centralized exchange or platform, or locked in any ridiculous yield generators or other such nonsense.

While Luna has ~20% APY, Celsius was more moderate in that regard (I think BTC had 8-9%) so people automatically assumed that its legit. Over bitcoin, Celsius was paying up to 8,53% annually (if receiving rewards in CEL token) or up to 6,50% (if receiving \"in-kind\" rewards). Moreover, rates could change from week to week, depending the market conditions and demands. The more borrowing demand there was for a currency, more interest they would pay to investors on that week. So the system was dynamic and constantly changing, what I consider really good for the sustainability of the platform. And yes, theoretically it could be legit, because the lending business is a profitable one.The problem is what they have been doing on the backgrounds and don't share with the community they are constantly saying to be acting in the interest of as their main priority...I'm one of the 1,7 million investors of the platform who injected over 5 billion dollars on their hands. Things aren't looking good, because there isn't transparency, the CEO has disappeared from social medias, all messages coming from them are evasive and say nothing enlightening, sock puppets accounts on twitter and reddit keep pushing an \"us against them\" narrative to protect Celsius, just like Mashinsky has always done and inexplicably CEL's price is doing well right now, pumping decently, what indicates the platform is burning investors' funds to boost their native token.Anyway, they can't pull the rug without consequences.
