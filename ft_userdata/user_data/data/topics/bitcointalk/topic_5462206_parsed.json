Already Nwada001 and others shared some basic rules which you must know. And they should be maintained by every users in this forum. Breaking any rules of them will cause you ban or being negative trusted. And I don't think they are hard to obey so you just read them before starting forum journey.Another advice is for that you should find out or mark your interests or what you want actually from this forum.

Just enjoy your stay here while you are also exploring the forum and at the same time, gaining knowledge and experiences from other members because that will serve as a mirror so you won’t be creating the same mistakes done by them. And as piece of advice, never take this forum too serious because that will be unhealthy for you in the long run. Just be yourself, listen to others ideas and perspectives, because one day you’ll also share your significant learnings in the forum. Just trust the process, and most especially, never rush to make profits, that can wait when you have gained sufficient knowledge and skills so you’ll be capable whatever crypto endeavor you plan to enter.",

There are basic information that we can get on those pinned threads. Anyway, where do you come from, dude? Have you taken a look at your local board? I suggest you to go there first because the information on your local board should be easier to understand.My other suggestions:- Be more active to involve in any discussion, especially in your local board- Be serious to learn, specifically basic things- Don't feel afraid to ask if you don't understand- Avoid plagiarism if you want to survive a long time",

It takes nothing to read and get the information required. Usually it's very hard for newbies to devote time to read and understand how things functions except they are being told or directly shares link with them before they could understand few things and even as that they always want everything to be possible and cheaper as they want without knowing it all takes time to get whatever they want over here. There is no need of sharing link as I believe few poster already shared link with you.",
