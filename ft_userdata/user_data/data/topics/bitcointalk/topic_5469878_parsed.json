      "body": "Quotee:\\users\\goat\\code\\armory3\\cppforswig\\That's an artifact of Windows compilation. What you are seeing is the path where the source resided on my computer at the time of building the Windows binary. This is the underlying code here:https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/blob/master/cppForSwig/log.h#L70For some reason on Windows it resolves __FILE__ to the full path instead of relative path. Go figure. I haven't gotten around to that, and I will probably replace the current log code with spdlog anyways.There is compounding confusion in this log system, because the first half of the log is generated by the Python code and the dynamically loaded C++ code from SWIG library. That stuff runs on relative paths, for whatever reason. The second half is the concatenation of ArmoryDB's log, which has the full path resolution. Chaos ensues. You'll also notice the logs summoned from the Python side renders time as timestamps, where as the C++ logs renders them as datetime. Gotta clean up that mess at some point.",
