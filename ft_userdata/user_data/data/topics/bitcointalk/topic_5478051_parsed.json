What happens if you think that slot has bugs and that's why you lose? If we follow logic, since casino can deny your winning because they think that game has bugs, you should have right to ask for slots inspect if you lose a lot. Doesn't this make sense? I think it makes but I want to know if you had similar experience or if something similar has happened in history ever.",

You can even file for a bug bounty program if the casino has to gain more reward aside from the refund.But there’s a catch, casino typically don’t acknowledge bug on their games because it’s very easy to fend off users by claiming there’s no bug on their system because no one will believe this single user complaining if the rest of the players doesn’t encounter the same bug.",

If there is a bug in their system you will never find out. You don't have access to their system's backend. Even if something abnormal happened, and you recorded the screen for example, most probably you won't get a refund.",

Because they can reason out that it's a lose already.Maybe out of good will for finding that bug, there's a chance that there will be a reward. Depending on how critical the bug is, as I've said unlikely but there's a chance so it really depends on the casino.Let us wait if someone who have found a bug and lost his bet and then because of the report, got a reward/refund.",

Although we have some few casinos that accepts responsibility and go ahead to pay the gambler a refund on the bet and that must be in his staked amount and not based on the potential winning or any profits from the bets at all,  many of them also may compensate the gambler but most cases there won't. In a situation where the gambler feels he have a case against the casino who blames it on Bug for their own negligence and wants to cheat the gambler it the means the gambler has the right to approach the consumer's court if it is a licensed casino to seek legal redress.",

Not saying it because I'm a gambler but casinos should be almost perfect and such mistakes and bugs should be refunded to players no matter what, when we deposit the casino has total control over the money so why denying winnings when something wrong happens.Unfortunately, in many cases the casino denies paying the fund won or lost by gamblers, and there's nothing much to do about it. Unless the amount of money is small and the casinl don't want to lose their reputation otherwise these last ones have more control and power to decide.",

Well, you don’t ask for a refund you should seek for your total reward because whatever their reasons are, the machine says you’re a winner and you should be able to get it without any hassle.

The gambler should receive the reward, and if the casinos still refusing better to for a legal and ask for assistance of the regulations, for sure they have the policy for this one that protects the gamblers.",

When we want to make money by all means from gambling we always lose so much instead. So we have to know that gambling is not a source of income but a way to just make money if we're lucky.",

I have never seen such case in online casino but if my memory serves me right, there's a thread here before where a physical casino denied the big win and just compensate the said winner. As far as I remember on that shared story about that here, the case were even brought to the court and the case were win by the casino as they were able to shows proofs of the said slot machine being faulty although the information given was lacking so we don't know the criteria did. But for online casino, I think slot bugs won't happened frequently and if the user got the win, they will be granted that win. However, embrace for the toughest requirement they will ask, the KYC verification, where even users already complied and submitted everything, lots of questions will still be asked.",

There have been cases like this where the party suing might have won a good settlement but with out of court settlements it's hard to predict how much they might have earned. In cases where there might be a bug usually it becomes more noticable when large winnings are denied. But also in cases where overt losses are caused it could become the subject of a dispute. Good luck with that on non jurisdictional casinos though. 🙄 Overall it's a matter of trust, casinos working with crypto exclusively work a lot on their customer's satisfaction and reputation but if s large dispute arises it who knows what's gonna happen.",

My conclusion, your report depends on the response of many gamblers and if they doubt the betting system in the casino because they lost due to bugs, then the casino will consider a refund due to reputation factors.",

In the event of lost funds, you'll need to provide evidence to back up your statement and possibly a way to reproduce the bug. The casino itself plays a vital role in how cooperative they are; I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't bother with a so-called bug that runs in their favor.It has never happened to me, or I haven't realized anything suspicious yet, but I've seen quite a few incidents on the forum of users claiming that a casino is refusing their withdrawal because of a loophole that enabled them to take advantage of a bonus or simply a bug in their system.
