  "content": "QuoteThe Bank of England has warned the UK is facing its longest recession since records began, as it raised interest rates by the most in 33 years.It warned the UK would face a \"very challenging\" two-year slump with unemployment nearly doubling by 2025.Bank boss Andrew Bailey warned of a \"tough road ahead\" for UK households, but said it had to act forcefully now or things \"will be worse later on\".It lifted interest rates to 3% from 2.25%, the biggest jump since 1989.By raising rates, the Bank is trying to bring down soaring prices as the cost of living rises at the fastest rate in 40 years.Food and energy prices have jumped, in part because of the Ukraine war, which has left many households facing hardship and started to drag on the economy.A recession is defined as when a country's economy shrinks for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row.Typically, companies make less money, pay falls and unemployment rises. This means the government receives less money in tax to use on public services such as health and education.The Bank had previously expected the UK to fall into recession at the end of this year and said it would last for all next year.But it now believes the economy already entered a \"challenging\" downturn this summer, which will continue next year and into the first half of 2024 - a possible general election year.While it will not be the UK's deepest downturn, it will be the longest since records began in the 1920s, the Bank said.The unemployment rate is currently at its lowest for 50 years, but it is expected to rise to nearly 6.5%.The interest rate announcement is the first since former Prime Minister Liz Truss and former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled their controversial mini-Budget in September.Their plans for £45bn worth of unfunded tax cuts - much of which have been reversed - sent the value of the pound tumbling and sparked market turmoil, forcing the Bank of England to step in to restore calm.Mr Bailey told the BBC he believed that the mini-budget had \"damaged\" the UK's standing internationally.He said that at a recent International Monetary Fund gathering in Washington \"it was very apparent to me that the UK's position and the UK's standing had been damaged\".That same week, Mr Kwarteng was sacked as Chancellor.Image link:  https://i.ibb.co/BZZCdR6/img1.jpgChancellor Jeremy Hunt said: \"The most important thing the British government can do right now is to restore stability, sort out our public finances, and get debt falling so that interest rate rises are kept as low as possible.\"But shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said families could not withstand such high rate rises \"when we've got rising food prices, rising energy bills and now higher mortgage rates as well\".The latest rate hike - the Bank's eighth since December - takes borrowing costs to their highest since 2008, when the UK banking system faced collapse.The Bank believes by raising interest rates it will make it more expensive to borrow and encourage people not to spend money, easing the pressure on prices in the process.But while its latest rate rise will be welcomed by savers, it will have a knock-on effect on those with mortgages, credit card debt and bank loans.'I'm nervous about the loan on my van'Michelle, 58, from East Riding in Yorkshire has a loan on a van and is nervous about rising interest rates.\"My disposable income has gone down dramatically recently and I earn more than the amount to get benefits,\" she told the BBC. \"They need to help the middle earners.\"Michelle needs the van to get to work as there's no public transport near her. But if her loan repayment costs rise she fears she'll have to give up the vehicle.\"I can work from home, but like most places my place of work wants us back in the office at least three days a week and I've had to have talks with them about how I can afford that.\"It's a 60-mile round trip, it's expensive.\"Those with mortgages are also feeling nervous. The Bank forecasts that if interest rates continue to rise, those whose fixed rate deals are coming to an end could see their annual payments soar by up to £3,000.It said that it would increase interest rates if inflation remained high. Financial markets had been expecting rates to peak at 5.25% but the Bank does not expect them to rise this high.The Bank's rate decision comes before the government unveils its tax and spending plans under new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the Autumn Statement on 17 November.On Thursday, the pound slumped 2% against the dollar and the cost of government borrowing rose in response to the Bank's warnings.The Bank has done something it doesn't normally do in the published minutes of its decisions - it has given guidance that seems to suggest a peak in interest rates of about 4.5% next autumn.For those with a glass half-full - this is lower than the 6% assumed just a month ago in the post mini-budget market turmoil.While government borrowing costs and the level of the pound has somewhat recovered after a series of U-turns since, mortgage markets and business loans are still showing some stress, adding to the prolonged hit to the economy.The forecast predicts that the unemployment rate will rise, while household incomes will come down too.It is a picture of a painful economic period, with the UK performing worse than the US and the Eurozone.Indeed, what was forecast as a sharp energy recession just three months ago, is now a shallower, but more prolonged energy and mortgage shock.https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63471725....I follow UK residents on social media. If they're concerned about facing the longest recession ever, I haven't seen much evidence of it. It appears to be the same for much of the world. People have noticed prices are higher but indications of a recession or something that should concern them don't yet appear to be felt. UK interest rates were raised from 2.25% to 3%. Forecasts project UK unemployment will near double by 2025. New Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will unveil tax and spending plans at the Autumn Statement on 17th of November 2022.Usually the american media reports on all the bad things happening in the UK and around the world. To take american minds off how things are screwed up in our own country. I have to wonder if the media is claiming an over optimistic forecast in some of their recent UK statistics. Aren't forecasts typically more doom and gloomish?",

      "body": "A lot of the UK's forecasts have been very pessimistic anyway and the bank of England just seems pessimistic on the UK's economy as a whole anyway.Different regions have different strengths and yet forecasts seem to be given overall, why? A drop in London's economy likely means less than places like the North of England or Scotland (more focussed on manufacturing and generally average lower wages).A lot of our forecasts don't take into account that companies are generally more mobile than their workers (and now there's many jobs in the UK hiring remote that have a requirement of being.\"up to a 3 hour commute of London for twice MONTHLY meetings\" - to put that into perspective, half the UK is within a 3 hour commute of London (and that's just by land).I think these forecasts are also released with catchy headlines. There's lots of simulations done where you get a better example of what's likely to happen but \"hey look at my cool new matrix my analysts have just made\" is never a headline I've seen.The BoE said brexit was going to cause the biggest recession since the 20s, then it was covid, now it's probably going to be itself if anything.",

If they're concerned about facing the longest recession ever, I haven't seen much evidence of it.People are always worried about things that are happening not things that are about to happen. For example before 2008 recession whenever there were anybody warning about the system that was about to implode, nobody listened. The media went all crazy after the \"implosion\" though!Besides you may need to expand your circle on social media considering there has been numerous protest across UK already. Which means there are many people who are concerned about their economy.P.S. Don't forget that there is the biggest brainwashing organizations in the West that prevent people from thinking that anything is wrong with what the government is doing. For example the organization unofficially referred to as the Ministry of Truth that is controlling what exists in social and mainstream media and heavily censors anything that they don't like.",

      "body": "I understand why 3% interest rates would raise concerns for a recession but a 6.4% unemployment rate seems a bit lower than I would have anticipated. I'm sure their models are accounting for the inflation induced by the interest rates and energy price increases but I believe the energy price increases will leave the UK worse off long term because operating costs of businesses will eventually become unsustainable. Energy costs introduce a domino effect if the cost rise disproportionately relative to other sectors. Anecdotally, I'm seeing plenty of stories of small businesses that've been operating for years in Europe that only recently had to shut down because they couldn't afford the monthly energy/rent bills. Where will those employees go?Quote from: Hydrogen on November 08, 2022, 11:55:01 PMUsually the american media reports on all the bad things happening in the UK and around the world.

Aren't forecasts typically more doom and gloomish? These economic forecasts and models are only as good as the data you feed into it. I would have expected more doom and gloom than a 6.4% unemployment rate for the UK. That seems optimistic.",
