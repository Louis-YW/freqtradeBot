A lot of people are worried that they would miss bitcoin at $200k but what they do not know is that from all indications it doesn't seem that bitcoin will go to six-figures. The value of Bitcoin at the next halving could be around $40,000 to $50,000.",

I am \"guessing\" that its going to be 40k+ by the time we get there, I do not know what the exact price would be but what would make me happy would be 40k or more. Not that it has to, if its still lower than that then I would be still happy to keep holding my coins and there is nothing wrong with that, it could be even lower than right now and I would still be happy about it. But if we could somehow reach 40k, which could be 41k or 50k doesn't matter, then I will be quite happy about it. We haven't been there for a long time and I am really hoping for it to be a lot better on the long run if possible.",

Historically, the real bull runs usually occurs in the year following the halving. That is when things get crazy! If history repeats itself, we could indeed see a substantial price increase, potentially reaching $100k or even more in the subsequent bull run.",

Rather, there are many variables, and halving is one of them, but its effect is in the long term, not the short one. Therefore, after halving in several months, until we see the effect, this effect will not appear. Within a day, two days, not even a month, two months.Therefore, the price is normal or 5% higher than the price during the past month, and I expect it to be in a range between $35,000 and $42,000.You can see that after every halving bitcoin is taking longer to rise.",

      "body": "Quote from: Minosse on July 02, 2023, 09:32:54 AMHow much do you think BTC will be on the Halving day?I would take my predictions based on what happen last halving (year 2020), bitcoin was at a lower price two months before the the 11th May halving and then prior to the day of halving it surge up to close to 3x the price it was two months before then. This could be as a result of investor’s accumulating more which caused a price increase. Then five days to the halving it came down a little bit probably because some investors took profit out of the market. The real bull run started around January 2021. So base on this, I think with bitcoin around $30k we could see it dump to like close to $20k ending of this year and the start of next year, then a surge to like 40k month to the halving and then it will fluctuate up and down till say January 2025 where a big bull might happen which could take the price well beyond the $70k. All these predictions or speculations are subjected to change because the economic activity or government policies affects bitcoin trend. So should we be faced with any strict regulations or probably countries relaxing there restrictions towards bitcoin it could see the price deviate from the usual past trends",

The price increase will take place gradually and of course it will take quite a long time for that. Currently we are still in the pre halving, many people are accumulating bitcoin and making entries to get bitcoin at low prices. Of course because they expect a big return after the halving in 2024.Even so, in my opinion, a price correction is still very likely to occur because we are still quite far from the halving. So instead of worrying too much about price at halving, I still tend to think about preparing my investment portfolio better.",

      "body": "$40,000-$50,000In the first halving that I experienced (during the pandemic), the price of Bitcoin doesn't have an immediate impact after the halving happened. Though some investors are very excited that it happened, miners on the other hand felt the opposite because their rewards will decrease by half. The price of Bitcoin increased gradually months after the halving, and we saw it happen during the final months of 2020, and the start of 2021. Well, just basing on history, price of Bitcoin goes up months after the halving happens. Though there is still a chance that it might not happen in the next halving, we have a clear picture of what might happen months after the halving happens.",

Or it rises in a certain pattern after the halving. The predictions are very different from each other, but everyone's common opinion is that there will be an ascension. It shows us that if we look at the word meaning of Halving, it will logically rise. The important thing here is to live this moment with bitcoin in your hand while this rise takes place.I can't predict the Bitcoin price but I think it will go above 100k as everyone has said.",

We will see the block reward halving of the largest cryptocurrency for the fourth time. If we consider that the BTC price has increased tenfold in just one year in the halving in 2020, we can speak positively for the halving in 2024. Actually it should be ready in the macroeconomic conditions that will support the Bitcoin price during halving periods. I think that the halving will not have the expected effect unless the world economy is freed from inflation and the danger of recession.I think economic conditions around the world need to improve for us to see the days when money somehow flows into the crypto market. I'm not desperate for the 2024 halving but i'm not in extreme bullish. The price will settle in a certain place within the framework of economic conditions. My purely personal prediction (this is an estimate and not investment advice) is that BTC will be over $60k  for 2024. I don't think we can see very high levels for now.",
