While this seems to be a good tactic in case you do not have any portfolio but remember this open ended offer can be miss used by the employees. Some scammer may offer you to write and do not pay you even if he likes your article.Why not until you get any offers try writing your own articles and use them as your portfolio, this way not only people will know how you can write but at the same time you do not have to come across an awkward situation where you write and not get paid.",

      "body": "I'm not sure that how you came up with the idea of charging $0.02 per word but that's not the way to get clients if you don't have any previous writing experience. I recommend you to write some good articles and then use those articles as samples so anyone who reads those articles can decide whether they want your services or not. I also recommend you to offer your services for free to a few clients but no more than 500 words for free and once you get some written content then you can share those as your samples without any question. That way you'll get clients who might pay you for your work.",

He needs to build his portfolio in order to stand out among the competition for content writing.",
