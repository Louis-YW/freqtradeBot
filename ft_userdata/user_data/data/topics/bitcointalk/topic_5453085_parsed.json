Once you are very good at two of those listed, you are good to go.",

Some of those tokens you are talking about will be listed, and within just one minute, the price will have dropped from $1 to $0.5 or even less. Some times, after two days, the token may try to pump again to $1 or $2, and before you know it, it falls again and gets stocked at the bottom.I don't know if you have read the example of the token which I was talking below my first comment. Referring to that token, how about if you buy one of the token for $15 during an ICO and when it gets listed, you discover that it was not even listed at 90% of the price you paid? I have seen several cases similar to the example I gave.When I first started in this forum, I asked a question: why token swap? And the reason I asked that question was also because of the experience I have had with altcoins in the past. Sometimes, most projects will just do a token swap for a limited time, and if you are not fast enough to be aware of it and swap, your capital is gone. And my question still remains: why will a project just decide to do a token swap at its early stage or even after the ICO? (It's a rhetorical question, just keep the answer to your self if you got it.).One just needs to be very wise and trade cautiously when dealing with altcoins.",
