  "content": "Keeping up with tradition I have to make an announcement post here even though im sure most of you have already heard the news!www.futurebit.ioProduct #5 and the one I have been trying to build since the start. This one probably took a few years off my life, and is about 6 months late due to needing to redesign it not once but 3 times. 5nm ASICs are no joke. As with everything we do we dont announce or ship until we know we can make them and they are ready. This is a first of many for Futurebit, first time we have nearly caught up to the latest node, first time we have integrated a PSU directly in the box for a completely plug and play and seamless experience, first time we have created a completely in house thermal system capable of cooling 400 watts in nearly the same volume as Gen 1, and a first for creating a modern mass producible aluminum case and injection molded parts. One of the biggest bottlenecks with the Apollo BTC design was the sheet metal case that took forever to make, and with these have already produced thousands of cases and are just waiting on our thermal system and PCBs. Should have everything in by end of December and start shipping the Founders Edition in January. One of the biggest announcements is our revamped OS thats finally releasing the Solo mining feature everyone has been waiting for, and the OS will be released on the original Apollo BTC first in hopefully about a month. We hope the Apollo II launch finally gives us an opportunity to really focus on software this time around, which we never really had the resources for after the Apollo BTC launch. The hardware has finally caught up to where it needs to be, but software needs a lot of work to make it a seamless experience for people outside of this forum. We will also be partnering with Lukes pool and offering a one click BTC address setup, and working with them to finally enable lightning payouts for small miners like the Apollo and others, that will finally end the nearly year long payouts on some other pools (FYI we also got braiins pool to reduce their minimum no fee payout to .005 BTC which is half of what it was). Im sure many of you have noticed but our efforts and others in the small miner space are finally paying off and people are taking notice. People are starting to understand the importance of self-mining no matter how small, and as censorship attacks mount on the Bitcoin network this will be more important than ever. Can't wait for the first solo block to be mined directly on an Apollo device after we launch the new OS, it will truly be a dawn of a new era for Bitcoin.",

We have relationships with the major pools and will bootstrap all solo nodes directly to them. Any block found by a futurebit solo miner will propagate to the major pools first before the rest of the network.

Backend is a propriety network that bypasses the p2p bitcoin network similar to what all major pools use among themselves.Regardless you are still exaggerating the chances of an orphaned block even on the normal p2p network. There are 600 seconds within a block, lets say you are on a slow network and broadcast hits the major pools 6 seconds late, thats just a 1% chance someone will find another block before you (ie if EVERYONE solo mining has a slow connection, for ever 100 solo blocks found one will be extremely unlucky and get their block orphaned). If you really want to get into the meat of the matter and the type of research I do to come up with the systems we do you can read these research publications for a deep dive on the topic:https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~rich/class/cs293b-cloud/papers/bitcoin-delay#:~:text=The%20median%20time%20until%20a,not%20yet%20received%20the%20block.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363879722_Analysis_of_segregated_witness_implementation_for_increasing_efficiency_and_security_of_the_Bitcoin_cryptocurrencyMean block propagation times were on the order of 6 seconds in the early days (2013 when the first article was published), due to more efficient core upgrades/computational increase/network bandwidth increases the mean has come down to around 2 seconds. For everyday users trying to secure the network a .333% chance of orphaning a block compared to lets say major pools of .1% wont matter at the end of the day (and im not discounting the fact that it will matter HORRIBLY for that one person that will find a solo block after mining solo for years and it ends up orphaning but that is the nature of the bitcoin network and the risk solo miners take).",
