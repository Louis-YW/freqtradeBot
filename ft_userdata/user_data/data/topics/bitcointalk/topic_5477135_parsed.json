I'll say it as I always do in threads about meme coins. Stop supporting scammers and start supporting innovative technologies. \"But this meme coin is different because it is on solana\". who cares, it's a \"funny name\" evaluated by manipulated \"investors\" for $800 million.I would not expect 10x from todays price because it would push it to top10 CMC but, if you didn't sell yet than 50% now and 50% after binance listing would be a good exit strategy. If there are no obvious scams in the smart contract, I think that Binance will benefit from the volumes generated by Bonk. If there are no obvious scams in the smart contract, I think that Binance will not be able to resist the fee from the volumes that bonk generates. Especially since they have $4 billion to make up before they get another fine.",

Will check it out.Have a nice Saturday mate.In the casino you are also \"making money\"?. Dozens, if not hundreds, of meme coins are created every day. Most of them collapse on the same day. The chance of making x7 is probably 1:50. Why? Because meme coins have no value. It's just a name and a marketing machine. A marketing machine, commissions for listings on exchanges when there are no volumes yet, initial capital for pumping the price, commissions for pumping fake volume. These are all costs that developers must cover. They also make meme coins for money and not for charitable purposes. And since the project does not produce anything, the costs are covered 100% with money from the token dump on \"investors\". investors who play hot potato game or a zero-sum game. One earns while the other loses. A zero-sum game if the above-mentioned costs are ignored. If you add them up, it's a super negative sum game. This is a casino with a huge house edge. In good casinos, house edge (casino profits) are 1-5%. good casinos have a \"provably fair\" mechanism where you can verify this. Meme coins house edge it's probably 50-90%, it can't be determined or verified. In my opinion, this falls under the definition of a scam. Pump and dump itself is a scam. Go to casino and play crash game. you can also do x7, you also look at the growing chart and it may break at any time juse like meme coin, and at least you have a known and honest house edge.Don't say you make money from meme coins. It's like saying you're making money at the casino. This time you got it, next time you lose it, thats it.",

This time you got it, next time you lose it, thats it.Ironic that a person that promotes mixer calling a coin a scam  , but it's only your opinion and it has no value for us that made profit from this coin, we have not scammed anyone & I have never scammed anyone and never would. I trading with coins that are completely legal. You know? I respect your point of view my friend and you can sit and hate meme coins and hold your bitcoins that's totally okay and I agree with the casino comparing. But just because you aren't smart enough to know how to make money from trading & meme coins doesn't mean it something bad. Try to learn it instead, your reply says more about your knowledge then meme coins, I am not good either but I try to learn and I improve everyday.   But of course, you will lose some and win some but if you smart and lucky enough to win more then you lose you are safe.But you are on point on many things meme coin's sky rocket for just falling very fast yes almost everyone of them does, but that's the whole point with trading meme coins, buy and sell fast. This is Trading Discussion and not hold long term discussion. So thank god meme coins are in this way, it's exactly that's why I love to trade with them. If you looking for long term holding you in the wrong place bud.And you know what? I been making money from meme coins and still will. & I also make money from casino's using sports betting.  Good luck with life my friend & have a great weekend.",

Only time will tell.I feel you, it been going so good so it should turn around soon, but I don't think yet. I was only lucky for finding Bonk.  I was exploring Solana coins and since I found Bonk I have try to find more coins in Solana network and improve my knowledge, I read for hours everyday but I am aware that nothing comes without a risk but I also know that if you never risk you will never get a reward.  And I grateful welcome advice's and tips every time. I am still  a super rookie, but now when I was lucky with Bonk I got some $ to trade with other coins for \"free\", but the most profit i just swap to Bitcoin and hold, that's free bitcoin. Feel we reach the end of this discussion. Thank you to al that used their time to reply. - Regards BabyB. 👼",
