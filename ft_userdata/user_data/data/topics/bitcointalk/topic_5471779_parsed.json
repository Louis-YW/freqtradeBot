It's best to avoid such a thread if you feel that our comment won't be appreciated and will get deleted at the end of the day.Â I believe the forum always creates room to question anyone's judgement, and if you happen to get to a thread on the reputation board that is self-moderated and someone is being investigated, saying something that is not in any way contributing to the topic will get the comment nullified out. You can always object to a deleted comment by asking why it was deleted if you are convinced that your comment is not against the thread and is not in any way a direct insult to anyone.Â If the reputation board is considered to be a place that promotes signature spam posts, what will be talked about?  1, I always admire and respect those who spend time on the repetition board, as most of them are good at what they do. I don't go there because I don't even have anything to add to an investigation.",

Knowing that, your deleted post isnâ€™t completely off the forum, you could quote it either from the pm you would receive on post deletion and even from the ninjanistic space as well.Itâ€™s not a first time Iâ€™m seeing a thread trying to arise self moderation on some threads but Iâ€™ll say, certain system has its flaws and the forum remains one that isnâ€™t very susceptible to changes and we might continue to manage what we can still.

Here the Self-moderated feature is beneficial instead.Also as per my observation, if we usually see less spam and off-topic posts in threads that are self moderated ones and this applies to all boards and not just reputation.",

The OP who creates the thread often dislike the replies that aren't related to thread and somehow could create more clashes and the better solution is to not reply in such threads where OP has made it self-moderated. I know sometimes the OP who created the thread will remove our posts without any question and he/she has the right to do that because he/she is the moderator of that thread and no-one can do anything against him/her. I'm not sure that why it would affect anyone if someone creates a self-moderated thread in Reputation board and in such threads they can obviously delete the unlikely posts without someone's permission.I think it's far better to create your own thread and present the same issue that the OP of that thread has raised and no-one would be able to delete your posts from that thread. But, it's not worth it to take something into such extremes and I would instead forget about the deleted rather than worrying about it.",

If you come across a thread that you feel the OP is filtering out the just comments of non-gange members, drop your own opinion there and watch if it gets deleted. If it does, you can start your own topic (perhaps self-moderated too) with regards to what happened, and you will definitely see people who have the same opinion as yours. If you create a self-moderated topic and you discover that the same gange has come to the thread for defense, you can as well filter out their comment. The essence of a self-moderated topic is to delete off-topic comments and shitcomments; it's not for deleting an accurate comment, just because you don't agree with the person when the person is actually on point.
