It's one of the best functions the forum has. I can say that 90% of my browsing is done based on my watch list.Basically, when I enter the forum, I click on my watch list, choose a topic that has received responses since the last time, read the topic (I will respond if necessary) and return to the watch list.I find it difficult to find a simpler and more efficient method than this.

When you enter the topic, at the top of the first post on the page you will find the following:When you click on \"watch\", the topic enters your watch list, and whenever a new post appears since the last time you saw it, the topic appears in your list.To access the watch list, simply follow the following link in the forum header:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=watchlistEDIT:Of course, if you want to save a specific topic, so you never lose it regardless of how much time passes, saving that topic in your browser's favorites is the solution.",

Much better than having an endless list of topics in my browser favorites.That's exactly how the Watch feature works, it's like bookmark. For me too Watchlist and 'Show new replies to your posts' is entry point for me to bitcointalk.But in addition to watchlist another great feature is notify, although name suggest you will receive an email notification every time when someone post in this topic but you can use this to bookmark your favorite topics and these topic will appear as a list in your profile  in Profile -> Notifications and Email -> Current Topic Notifications https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;sa=notificationand your topics will appear like a subscription list For me that's exactly like a bookmark and you can get back to it anytime, irrespective of new or unread-replies. In Watchlist topic will not appear if there's no new reply.",

You can configure the watchlist to be exactly the same as \"show new replies to your posts\" by configuring your posts to be auto-watched and adding your posted-in topics to your watchlist. After this is done, you can unwatch topics that you don't want to see.Start with forum watch list to personalize your experience. If you are not satisfied with forum watch list, you can use third party tools like Telegram bot or Loyce.club notifications.Code:Edit watchlist | Watch board | Add posted-to topics to watchlist | Add notify-enabled topics to watchlistIf you customize your settings to ignore a board or delete in the watch board, topics in that board will be disabled in your Watch list too.",

It's not just adding and seeing. Furthermore, it only appears in the list if the post was made after you last viewed the topic. Additionally, this is the list of topics that have been answered since the last time you visited them. If you want to see the list of all the topics you are watching, you have to click on the Edit watchlist option.From this list you can select topics for observation. Every time you respond to a topic, it automatically enters this list. Then it's a question of organization, of \"visiting\" all these topics, so as not to have a huge list of topics to read.",

If that waiting list gets too long, it's a sign that you're not reading everything or that a lot of what's on there isn't interesting. In this case, you must remove those topics that are no longer of interest.Sometimes we need to take time to organize things, and thus save time in the future. If we don't want to spend that time organizing, it's also difficult to find solutions that help organize. All the tools to help us organize require time on our part to keep them organized.",
