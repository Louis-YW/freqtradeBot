  "content": "HelloI have a HUGE PROBLEM with Rollbit and I hope someone can help me here.I made 11 pre-game bets for a total of $10,200 risk at 2.0 and 2.1 odds. This was on the team ThunderTalk Gaming +1.5 vs Team WE in League of Legends LPL. These were all taken before the match started. (images of plays below)After the bets won, they were all cancelled by Rollbit and I did not receive my winnings. They did not pay me my $10k+ winnings. I am sure if this match lost, they would not void the bet.The support said the odds were wrong and odds provider voided the bets.This is a lie because I also took the same team match on Pinnacle for 2.03 and 2.12 and one other site for 2.05. So it is clear the odds were correct. I forwarded them screen shots and it is easy to see other books have similar lines.  I have asked many times what the \"correct line\" was and have not gotten any response. This is the most important part of this whole incident is not being able to tell me the correct line.I am already down over $20k on Rollbit so I have given them good action including casino.This actions by Rollbit trying to scam me out of $10k+ is unprofessional and should be illegal.I hope someone in forums can help me solve this issue because support has not helped me.Betshttps://ibb.co/61Pj82Hhttps://ibb.co/4T88jRNhttps://ibb.co/7rMZWC9Pinnacle betshttps://ibb.co/0nggGsW",

      "body": "I am not really sure if it is possible but can't you directly contact the sportsbook's odds provider and confirm to them whether they really did void the bets for that specific match because of the incorrect pricing?also, just curious, is Pinnacle, Rollbit and the other sportsbook you mentioned share the same odds provider?anyway, at first I was gonna tell you to contact Rollbit's representative but it seems that he already responded to your post on their ANN thread.",

Can you perhaps provide us the screenshot for those bet on pinnacle now?

I am not sure if I've asked this on the ANN thread before, I understand that the one voided OP's bets is the sportsbook provider --and not you-- and thus your hand are kinda tied on this matter. If you could help OP and the community understand better, though, can you please tell us to the best of your knowledge --or perhaps even better, an explanation from your provider themselves-- why the bets are marked as incorrect while the odds are not varied too differently --thus, incorrect-- with the one on Pinnacle as on OP's screenshot, or with the ones listed by Poika5 above?",
