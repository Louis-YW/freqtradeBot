It is plagiarism though, which isn't allowed. Any chance you're using Jambler and copied this from them?Quote from: mixymoney on September 30, 2022, 01:02:11 PMWe replace your crypto coins with verified coins from European, Asian and North American Bitcoin stock exchanges. ~We do not store logsExchanges log everything, so there's no privacy whatsoever.",

Hence the text (provided by them) that several others use as well.Especially the FAQ, since it has to be the same as others (more or less), since [banned mixer] \"decides\"You would probably find others references on bitcointalk.",

I visit the website through the signature campaign that launched today and from the website I was directed to this thread through one of the three contact links. The website looks like a Russian site because there are only two languages there and which are Russian Language and English Language. And what I discovered from the site is that the 0.0007 BTC commission is too big for mixing or I am the one that didn't understand the clause there.",

As they have created new ANN thread, they would have updated the ANN thread in all their websites and platforms including the signature Campaign thread because users would will make comments on it. examplens thank you very much for the update, and they did not even lock the old thread. They have to lock the old thread and open the new one.",
