Where did you read? Is it from a trusted site and people?Even if there is one buyer who bought miner from them it doesn't mean you need to buy look at the whois it shows you it's new and never mention it here before so no one knows here that website exists unless you are trying to promote it? Look at your account it's newbie you just created this account to promote them.",

      "body": "Hi all!I'm Jay and I created https://asic.guide/ and this scenario is the perfect reason why I created the site.As a reseller and hosting operator myself (I'm based in Thailand and Laos), I have to deal with Chinese suppliers all the time and trust is a big issue.  So my friends and I feel that there is a need and we created ASIC.guide to try to solve the issue.We want the site to be the place where buyers can do research and make a better informed decisions on manufacturers, distributors and resellers.  Verification is one of the highest priority for us, but we are still trying to figure out how to best do it.We are thinking about adding a verified warehouse so that we can help confirm that they really do operate (or else they won't be renting out warehouses) vs they just do drop ship (and you could have buy directly from someone else).I'd like to know that in this situation for niceasicminer, what kind of info/intel do you think would be best in order to make an informed decision? Obviously asking the seller themselves won't solve it.  But what if we have their 'verified warehouse'? Or 'pictures of proven shipments'? Any kind of feedback would be welcomed as we add more features to the site.In this situation, I think our resellers list is the most relevant: https://asic.guide/resellers.  We are continually adding resellers to try to cover all geographies.You can also try our distributors list: https://asic.guide/distributors.  But most likely they will have MOQs or doesn't have a specialized logistics route.Thanks guys!",

The first thing you would probably need to do is not accept new websites and new resellers that have been around for just a month unless it's a spin-off from some big company that already has some kind of large-scale business. The second and easiest way is a live video stream with the owner, if he wants that to be listed, he can spare 5 minutes with a call from their warehouse, and you can't really fake that.Also, something like a third thing, do check the ones you have listed and add a few remarks for things that have changed between the time you added them and now, cause companies like ComputeNorth for example have filed for chapter 11 and already sold 2 datacenters as they owe half a billion, a tiny details some might be more interested in that anything else.The same for Minerva, it missed completely all deliveries to Stronghold and they are part in the lawsuit investors have filed against the company.",

We will definitely take these and discuss it with our team.  Thanks!",
