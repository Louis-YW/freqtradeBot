Something like that:\"will you believe? Someone made up their money, called it bitcoin. The funniest thing is that their price has exceeded that of the dollar. What an absurdity.\"Yep. That day bitcoin broke 1$. I did nothing ... I was too focused on parties and girls.I accepted the narrative of the presenter that it is actually absurd that someone even wants to have money invented by someone, most likely centralized. Next time I heard about bitcoin was in 2017 after it broke 10 000$ and thats when I bought it for the first time.",

Before 2016, I also heard about btc, but didn't attach any importance to this, not knowing anything about the technology and not understanding the possibilities that btc gives.",

I think you don't need to regret selling bitcoin at that time because we are looking for profit here and you got pretty good return that bitcoin gives. Past mistakes will be lessons for us in the future, so there's no need to regret the past. If you don't want to regret again then now is your chance and all of us, buy bitcoin now and plan for the future to sell only when the set goal is reached. I got into the market very early myself but I also sold out of my bitcoins during bear season 2018 it was a really unfortunate time but it was a lesson for me when I got back into the market in 2020.",
