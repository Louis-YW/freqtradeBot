  "content": "Hello,I'm domain seller but this time I couldn't make a single sale and I'm broke.I've $90 balance in NameCheap.com which are good to purchase domains and hosting.But I need a fast cash, So I will purchase a domain from you for $60 on NameCheap if you can send $23 to me in Bitcoins.After $6 commission, You will have $54 on NameCheap. But since the $24 ($23 bitcoin + $1 domain) is your investment, Your profit is $30.You can use Paxful if you only have PayPal to send botcoins to me. Let's do it. Only for trusted members. We will do the transaction in two steps either.I'm grateful.[ FYI: There's an internet shutdown in my state, That's why I couldn't make a sale and wasted my money in the process to move to another state. https://www.zawya.com/en/economy/africa/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-in-amhara-region-as-clashes-surge-kbpyllre ] [ I'm not begging anyhow, I'm just telling my story so you guys could be able to do the deal with full information. Thank you very much. ]",

Maybe op want to outsmart himself and not people here because the whole story isn't clear to me at all, how did he want to sell something and the balance can not be withdrawn by him yet asking for someone to pay him through other payment method and again, he said of being broke how on earth can someone have 90$ in his namescheap account and complaining of being broke and want to sell it off. Or are mine getting the whole thing twisted here?",
