  "content": "I think this topic is worth to remind again for many newbies who panic about the current situation where Bitcoin price $30K strong resistance now drop to $24K currently traded. There are many so called expert who always predict Bitcoin price will go to x, the bottom is x etc, also one of them were offer to give his money to everyone if his prediction gone wrong, this strategy is to convince newbies to believe his words.Take look on these so called expert who predict Bitcoin price:1. The ‘Ultimate’ Bottom?—Major Fund Manager Reveals Shock Bitcoin Price Prediction And Stark Crypto Warning As Ethereum, BNB, XRP, Solana, Cardano And Avalanche Plummet2. Renowned analyst who predicted Bitcoin price top at $69,000, now claims the bottom is at $24,0003. Bitcoin price may bottom at $15.5K if it retests this lifetime historical support level 4. Crypto is dead. Long live crypto5. Long-Time Bitcoin Bear Offers $1,000 To Every Retweeter If His Prediction Of BTC Hitting $10K In 2022 Goes WrongDon't believe of those so called expert predictions since there's no guarantee their words will come true, there's no crystal ball in this world. If they're a time travel who know the correct Bitcoin price in the future, they would shut up and just bought the bottom price, so they can sell at the peak since they're already know it. But, why does they need to told everyone the Bitcoin price will crash to x etc? Because they want to gain popularity if their words are come true. They just randomly guessing the price in hoping they're correct.Did I scared after looking this chart? No, because if you look at the history, you will see Bitcoin have been survive 3 times about the dump/crash. The first is on 2017 and 2018, where the peak is $19K and the bottom is $3K (84% change)The second is on 2019 and 2020, where the peak is $11K and the bottom is $5K (54% change)The third is on 2021, where the peak is $60K and the bottom is $30K (50% change)Now we're previously at the peak $69K and currently the bottom is $24K (65% change) is still not beat the 2017 and 2018 history where the change is 84%, why would we panic and not trust Bitcoin anymore? Think about it. If you still keep thinking Bitcoin will dead, do you forget all the adoption from any institutional, government, and foremost the countries who accept it as a legal tender. Not to mention Bitcoin already improve a lot of the development e.g. Lightning network to solve the scalability issues, using for friendly energy for mining, hash rate & difficulty increase to prevent from 51% attack etc. Bitcoin right now is more scarcer since it's already mined 19Million Bitcoin, only 2Million left. We're already close Bitcoin will be accepted in entire countries due to it's value and become a currency since the price will be more steady. This is the reason why I AM HODLING.Don't predict the bottom, just do Dollar Cost Averaging or Averaging down to accumulate more Bitcoin. We're as a Bitcoin enthusiast are looking for long term, not short term or instant profit by pump & dump of shitcoins. Also there's nothing wrong to diversify your investment, but make sure you're diversify to other assets/commodities e.g. gold, silver, bonds, real estate etc, never diversify to shitcoins since it's worst than Bitcoin.",

You basically sell when you want.Those who fomo in at the top and end up selling off 4 months later already made mistakes from the beginning and no doubt would still have to sell as they need the money.",

That is trading and anyone that is gambling with altcoins, or if someone is ignorant of investment strategy before investing in bitcoin.

I am pretty sure users who believe in Bitcoin are not worried by the dump at all. Just invest what you can afford to lose and remember Bitcoin is a long term investment as you hodl.",

Some of my friends too are instead of staying strong are cutting losses. This is a heavy heart to hear at selling at a loss. But we cant blame them. We can only encourage them to hold for their money that they dont need. People tend to sell cause of fear that they will lose it all, yeah its possible unless you sold it right?",

Even I didn't directly face the 2017 and 2018 Bitcoin history, I can know how it feel when the price drop drastically.

Only Gamblers hold until they lose it all.That is the one screaming hodl, no matter if the price is at an ATH or ATL.While they cry 1 btc=1btc, well 1 turd=1 turd , and no one give a shit.",

It makes no sense to hold until price hits the bottom.Every Bitcoin holder has a selling target like me.I'm holding Bitcoin and some stocks for a long term but I also have plans into when I will sell all of them. There are some factors that affects my selling strategy like the time frame and the target price. I hope that holders also have a strategy where they will sell it when it happens and don't just hold on for dear life.Right now TBH, you say that there is no sense to hold until it hits the bottom but there are some who are doing it probably because they don't want to sell at a loss so they will just prefer to hold it. We don't know where the bottom is so better to just hold and wait for the bull market to come which will come maybe in 1-2 years. 4-year cycle .Quote from: ObscurePen on June 14, 2022, 06:40:01 AMSo the real question we should be asking is at what point do I want to save the investment that I made which is now gone bad?That's where the decision making of one's investor comes.What will happen if my investment goes bad? Will I still hold it? Will I accumulate more? Will I make a cut loss and invest when it goes down even lower? US Stock market are in a bear market territory already. S&P500, Nasdaq and DJI are in a bear market zone already and these have correlation with Bitcoin so the bear market has started. I just hope that investors decided already into what they are doing during this bear market.",

So the real question we should be asking is at what point do I want to save the investment that I made which is now gone bad?How many times has the price of Bitcoin reached the perceived bottom and how many more times has it rebounded and made new ATHs? If you've done your due diligence and understand how a certain asset works in different markets, you would understand how it acts after price dumps and pumps. With this, your liquidation point would not be an effect of dips in value, where you will be forced to cut your losses.I've gone through different Bitcoin cycles and I can predict that Bitcoin would reach another ATH within the next couple of years (3-4 if I'm forced to give a number), especially when you consider that we are more than half way to the next Bitcoin halving.With this knowledge, I can safely hodl Bitcoin beven though the market tanks and even buy more.Buyer's remorse can definitely force investors to panic sell, particularly if they bought at the top and would need lots of price increase for them to break even. Rhat is why how you buy is very important in determining if you can hodl.",

I've remembered how the crude oil price crash, the price went negative, that's mean if you want to buy an oil, you're not paying anything but you get both of oil and cash lol.
