But not SQLite or some other db-as-file.At least you will be able to make comprehensive SQL queries, make graphs (using something like PowerBI) and scale to many computers if you run out of disk space.",

It lacks address index, so you'll need to use scantxoutset or import the address on wallet then rescan whole blockchain which take some time. Many block explorer offer API, but i doubt the free option is generous enough to let you get details of thousand address within short time.Quote from: Sarah Azhari on October 13, 2022, 02:33:09 AMQuote from: BitMaxz on October 12, 2022, 11:20:53 PMThere are some sites where you can check the balance of multiple addresses how about this one below - https://awebanalysis.com/en/bitcoin-multiple-address-check-balance/That site uses a captcha, look hard when opening using TOR.

If your text file has Microsoft formatting, you may need to use this instead:Code:comm -12 Bitcoin_addresses_LATEST.txt <(cat mylist.txt | fromdos | sort | uniq)But, that only gets you a list of funded addresses, not their balances. I'll cook something up:Code:grep -f mylist.txt blockchair_bitcoin_addresses_and_balance_LATEST.tsvThis is a bit slower and eats RAM: 500,000 input addresses uses 1.5 GB and took 50 seconds. You could mix it with the earlier command to only search the balance for addresses that aren't empty.Quote from: Sarah Azhari on October 14, 2022, 03:15:58 AMI don't know exactly what you want, you ask question: how to check the balance for thousands of public addresses. the loyce link only has data address which you can't check the address that you want.See the explanations on List of all Bitcoin addresses with a balance.",
