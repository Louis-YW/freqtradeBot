I've sold 50% of all my graphic cards and I've never sell one of my vega 56, the moment I made mention of having Vega they will say no.Is there any issue affecting Vega gpu when gaming on a PC? Why do gamers hate this graphic cards so much? If this go on I will have to keep mining with the cards until no coin supports the gpu anymore. Or you have another better idea?",

If mining starts to be profitable, then these video cards will pay off a few more times or they can be sold for more. But I don't want to sell for 60 euros.",
