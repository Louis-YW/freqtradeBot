And do you really care so long as there are non KYC options.I agree with you, email + phone numbers are not a big deal and I would not consider them as KYC verification, more like security. Having a spare phone number or registering a new email address is very easy, and such data does not mean much. For a one-time pass of such \"KYC\", you can always use temp mail or temp sms service.Personally, for regular KYC where identity confirmation is required, mostly if I have a choice I use a driver's license. I am of the opinion that in some bad course of the situation, less damage can be sampled by a driver's license data than by a personal ID or passport.",

To ensure the customers are humans and not random bots To ensure that they can produced full identity details when government asks for it and to ensure that the system is not cheated with multiple accounts and other scam activities For the first reason, level 1 KYC can solve the problem. The customer just need to provide any phone number and email to be allowed.For the second, this is where the company invests time and efforts to get and verify the full information of the customer. I would have no problems completing the 1st level KYC, but will be skeptical about the other higher levels.",

I wouldn't be surprised if my name is listed somewhere even though I never register or use their service. This is why I've stopped registering for new services that require personal information such as name, phone number, ID, and so on. Some of them can be faked or intentionally mistyped of course, but there is also a risk of banning/locking accounts if the platform decides to do so. Fortunately, a throwaway e-mail address is still an option. I don't think it is a KYC either, as long as I never use it somewhere else that allows somebody else to link it to my personal info.
