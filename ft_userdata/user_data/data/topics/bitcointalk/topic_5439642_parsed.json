How many of you also stack gold and silver in addition to BTC as a hedge for inflation?Inflation or not, it's not good to \"put one's egg in a basket,\" which helped me as I was particular about 5 classes of investment in 2022. They are the equity market, Bitcoin, Gold, Crude oil and USDX. I was able to liquidate some of my purchases on Bitcoin later after seeing the way it was performing and added it to my portfolios on Gold and USDX.These (Gold and USDX) were good choices and a very good way to diversify my portfolio which worked so much for me. Gold and Bitcoin eventually earned well for me in the last 2 months, yet I will only increase my investment in Bitcoin towards the time of halving or if it would reach around $15k-16k again.I will then hold it for the tradition right from such a low level.",

In our country gold is given much priority, it can be jewellery as well as form of investment. Majority of the people have good volume of jewellery, because this is the one used as collateral when there is need of money. Bitcoin seems to be my choice, but it is quite hard to make people believe it. If it is gold, everyone simply accepts.",

      "body": "If  I was buying silver I'd buy the most unpopular kind, collecting coins is nice but Im not sure of the price relative to market pricing in the pure asset.  Im aware of the silver price and also the mining companies prospects in their endeavours to mine more.    Physically I'd collect the old silver sterling cutlery but mostly I have the mining shares or a fund which holds and manages positions for them, it gives a yield and its hands off simple to deal with but any of the options are valid if you are bullish on either silver or gold.   Physical is not leveraged, thats the appeal I think because most of us expect volatility and I dont disagree with that.  Upset is quite certain to occur, I tried to hold physical gold and other metals in a brinks mat vault arrangement at one point but its lots of paperwork required and they raised the fees massively I guess after being hassled and buried under red tape hence managed (pension etc.) funds are kept at arms length and they deal with all that trouble.QuoteI don't think Gold has much of a hedge against inflation but I might be on too small a time frame (the last 5-10 years).Its the other way round that makes it confusing, Dollars are measured in gold not vice versa.   The time scale for gold is minimum a decade, the justification for that might be the parallel of thats how long a gold mine from scratch can take to establish profitable mining.    Look up the details of any large gold mine, all the twists and turns but at present its worth it as they should get there in the end and imo price will be higher at end then they began with.  There are alluvial deposits of gold but still there is no simple story especially with modern environmental considerations for mining to include in costs.",

With bitcoin, however, it doesn't matter how much you have, you can make partial sales. I especially like the colour of gold, it's mesmerising.But above all, I don't want anyone to think that they are 'stacking' gold or silver by buying jewellery, which is the worst way. If you buy jewellery for you or your wife because you like it, fine, but to give an example, a necklace with 50 silver dollars, if you are going to sell it the next day you will be paid for its weight in melted silver and it will be 7 or 8 dollars, no more. If you want to do stacking, do it with coins or bars.",

Currently, bitcoin is considered a highly profitable investment but not considered a safe place to store assets, the future of bitcoin is still in question, so putting all your assets in that's not a good idea. I like gold because it's safe, and investing in some tech stocks is what I'm doing. In the future real estate is what I look forward to, I will continue to diversify my portfolio as investments in bitcoin and stocks pay off.",

But the fact is that i don't own (after last bear market) anything so valuable that it would make sense to keep it tied to gold.We often talk about the traditional forms of investment like precious metals or maybe even software companies by now, but hasn't the pandemic been proof that there are a couple of risk vectors one could smartly look into? Now that we know what impact pandemic events can have on the world economy, and given that our population is growing and spreading of such events becomes more likely and more dynamic, dedicating a small portion of one's portfolio to pharmaceutical companies can be as much of a hedge as owning gold. Actually, when the pandemic kicked it we have first seen a sell-off of assets that people don't necessarily need for a living. Almost everything has been performing badly at first. With the infusion of unbelievable quantities of fiat money we saw a wild bounce-back of the markets all over the place, but among the safest bets back then had been the pharmaceutical companies. Even if the stock price doesn't perform that well, they turned out to be very reliable dividend payers. Now chemistry is not a subject I am all too familiar with and I ask myself whether there will ever be a way to create some form of alternative gold or synthetic gold. There are various reports, but they also seem to be changing over time. I also don't know how trustworthy reports are about how many % of all existing gold has been discovered or is yet to be discovered. How can anyone possibly know for certain? The 100% transparency of Bitcoin's defining parameters can never be attained by anything that is yet to be fully discovered all around the globe.",

I do own stocks and precious metals apart from crypto. These don't always work as hedge to inflation, it more like diversification of assets in order to include different asset classes in my portfolio. Sadly this term has been likened to the accumulation of altcoins in this forum which I abhor.Silver though I don't buy much, it's mostly gold. Having these assets on your side means having a relief when bitcoin is going down, in case you are the panicking person.",
