First version of Smart Contract published on Polygon Network with 0.1Matic entranceSecond stageGrowing. If interest to this topic will be enough, we will create other Smart Contracts with higher amounts and on other networks (BSC, Fantom, Optimistic, Linea, Ethereum)Third stageStress test. On this stage contract source code will be published on all Networks and on GitHub. Other Devs can check code, propose modifications and audit.Fourth stageNext, updated version of contract developed, created UI (User Interface for web and possible to mobile devices)Bounty with signature campaign here - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5463217---Will be appreciated for collaboration, advice's, help in promotion, etc.",
