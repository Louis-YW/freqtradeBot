So I come dey ask ona to shear ona expirence and possible solution to this kind thing?So far as bitcointalk is concerned, noise is highly prohibited because this forum requires so much focus and concentration to be able to give quality ideas that will help one another in this community.Even if you stay in a noisy environment, there are ways to handle cases in a noisy environment like when ever you want to concentrate on the forum you move out from your area of residence and go to places where there is no noise maybe a friends place or rather you will mainly operate during the evening hours or midnight when every where is calm and quiet.This forum is very sensitive as any mistake one makes might jeopardize their level of trust so it is important that one disengage from whatever that will distract one's attention whenever on the bitcointalk",

So I come dey ask ona to shear ona expirence and possible solution to this kind thing?Bro, first of all Bitcointalk no be anybody business although I no go deny the fact say e get some privileges wey we be Bitcointalk users dey enjoy and that's the earnings we get from all these signature campaign participation but that's doesn't mean some of us actually makes it our primary job. Well about noisy neighborhood, it's not a new thing although my remedy to this is simply just posting when am actually back from work during late hours, that's late in the night but sometimes I actually post during the day when am comfortable enough and also during morning hours before my actual working hours. Also this complaint is not actually for everyone because not all neighborhood are actually noisy, because their are some place and neighborhood where is their absolutely serenity to noise pollution, you can take for example living in an estate or building complex where the regulation to noise pollution is strictly prohibited.Â  You can relate better if actually you live or stay in a neighborhood just like BONNY ISLAND in rivers state .",

You are right dear. There are people living in noisy areas and there those living in a noiseless areas. The majoy source of noise should be business activities like those living close to market, main road and industrial area. Anoher source of noise is generators for those living where light is not steady. Noise is a problem in Nigeria but I wouldn't call it emergency because there are less industries here... the sources of noise in have in Naija are manageable.",
