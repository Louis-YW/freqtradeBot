  "content": "Hi,I bought this for work originally with the plan to claim it on expenses but was made redundant before I got the chance.The order date was October 12th, and JoomGeek only has a 14-day return policy. The order has my personal details on so I am happy to share them with escrow, but not publicly.I would love to keep it, but as above, I have been made redundant and need all the funds possible. None of my friends seem to know what it is, and I hate eBay with a passion (edit: seems like I can't sell it on eBay anyway). So happy to sell for crypto provided we have a trusted escrow be the middleman.I have opened it and turned it on and had a look at it for about 5 minutes to see the menu but never used it before I put it back in the box. Will sell to the EU, not sure if it would be stopped at customs?, would prefer UK via courier.Looking for the equivalent of £140 GBP ono, I paid £200 GBP with delivery 3 weeks ago. Buyer pays delivery fee.https://flipperzero.one/Happy with Bitcoin, Eth, Monero or other popular altshttps://i.ibb.co/cwPW6J5/flipper.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/3hXrrxF/purchased.png",

      "body": "being that it is not \"brand new\" might be a hard sell when you are selling it for more than a new one costs.can order direct from the flipper site for 169 USD (137 GBP)though they can pay with crypto where cannot on the flipper site. I have a flipper and love using it. They are great devices GLWS",
