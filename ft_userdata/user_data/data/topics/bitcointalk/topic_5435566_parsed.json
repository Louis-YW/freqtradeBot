And from yesterday to today 3 posts were deleted too.I don't know what post get's deleted, I only know it wasn't posts made in the past week. So, I would like to know what I'm doing wrong and if there is a chance to avoid this happening.Can a mod verify all my posts and delete all the ones that should be deleted?",

Newbie or Legendary members, we can not self delete our topics but if we are seriously want to delete topics, we can report it to moderators and wait for their decisions.Without moderator engagement, normal users can only move their topics to Archival or edit opening post content to delete or ... and leave it like that.",

Of course, this does not have to be directly related to your posts, but to the fact that, regardless of the quality of your posts, some threads turn into a shitposting show over time.In addition, most of us old members were not even close to what we are today when we registered on this forum, so everyone's post history certainly contains posts that could be considered low quality, spam or repetitive posts - but there is no point in going that way far back and report such a post.",

Yeah have seen lot of such threads lately by the newbies trying to spam posting on the forum with such links and also thought about such newbie bots indulging in creating such threads to get some victims on the forum.So it's clear now if someone has made post in those topics it was also deleted to keep forum spam free from such threads.",

But this means it will keep happening and there is nothing I can do about it. I have some questions now about the activity, Is that number affected by the deleted posts too? or in some scenarios a user can have 900 posts and 1000 activity?",
