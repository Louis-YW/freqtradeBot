Majority of us could have sold early as well, but what can we do? We just have to be positive and move on and then accumulate even at today's price, who knows, majority is expecting at least 6 digit in the future. And if that happens then we still have chance to make profit. So just forget about it, time to make a new plan and strategy to be able to salvage profits in this bull run.",

And you have seen over 4k dollars turning into 12k? There is no excuse for you to not get a hardware wallet, because you are already risking lots of money on Bitcoin, you need to get one straight away. You don't have to wait till you have a lot of money before buying a hardware wallet, believe me I was like you, and losing my Bitcoin was when I lost my cool and took out some funds in my crypto wallet to order for a hardware wallet instantly, between a week it was shipped to me. You want to wait till you lose some assets first? Just like I did? Learn from my mistakes mate, the best route is a hardware wallet, a hardware wallet like Airgapped that's always offline keeps your crypto safer than others.",

If another exchange goes bankrupt soon, there will still be a lot of people who will fall victim to such a scenario because people can listen to you but will not play safe and heed your advice when gambling and moving with their coins across exchanges which is susceptible to loss at anytime.",

You win money sometimes, you lose money sometimes, and yes losing sucks, but the best thing you can do is to just move on, move forward, and learn from it. I guess I'm just lucky that I didn't invest a single penny on FTX because, at that time, I didn't want to hold not only FTX but exchange coins in general. Scam Bankman-Fraud is now in jail, and your money will be lost forever. As for mental health, I don't know if some of these are true, and this isn't only about FTX, but in general, some investors even committed suicide because of them getting scammed big time. I mean 5-digit and sometimes 6-digit losses.
