  "content": "Major cryptocurrencies have been on a downfall this past week, as investors lost confidence on Terra (LUNA). Bitcoin, as well as, Ethereum, Cardano, and several other \"blue chip\" coins are being traded at a discount these days. This could be a huge buying opportunity before prices bounce back to their original levels. If Bitcoin is predicted to reach $100k, then imagine how altcoins will rise in price. Buying the dip might be the best thing you could do right now. If you're into crypto for the long haul, you'll know what I'm talking about.That said, I'm curious to know if you're buying the dip? If so, I'd like to know which cryptocurrencies do you think are worth the investment for the long term and why? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

Although I know bear season has come and will surely pass, these past few days I have also been a bit worried. Although I dared not look at my portfolio and when bitcoin dropped to 30k I bought myself some more bitcoin and bnb. Luna shocked the whole market and I dared not buy any altcoin, other than my choice of ETH and BNB, I ended up choosing BNB.",

I recommend Monero, it's the only privacy that matters, rest of the privacy coins are vaporware or have serious flaws that can compromise your anonymity and privacy. i keep filling up my bags with xmr with every dip. Pulled the trigger last week when it went down to 0.004btc, and i'm already in profit since it'll probably touch 0.006 this very same week, i'll probably sell some if it touches .007 and add the rest to the long-term bag.",

Thanks.  yes buying at the dip is a good idea, but for me jumping immediately is not a good decision because obviously there's still no a clear sign to enter and the trend of the market as of the moment still the same. So i believe patience is required on these situation IMO, i mean much better to wait for more results to assure everything will gonna be alright.",

I predict the market will continue to fall, now is still a good time to buy but we should not buy once but use DCA. Now all coins have dropped a lot so we can buy any coin we are interested in. But IMO bitcoin is still the top choice, maybe bitcoin will fall to 20k-25k zone as you said but bitcoin will bounce back strong when the bull market comes.",

Always buying the dips just not Alys right now.  There is a ton of downside risk for alts I think this just started.  Stacking sats right now but beyond that I think you are just throwing away money.",

      "body": "I am pretty sure quite a lot of people are buying in this dip, many people have identified severe bear periods as a time to accumulate more of their favorite coins as prices are lower, but people still have to be careful with the coins they would be accumulating this bear period, many of the coins that crashed are also pump and dump coins, many of which would not appreciate in price again, even after prices become much better. Thus any investor who buys into such projects would be at the receiving end of it all.Having said that, i believe so much in the Bitcoin system, so it is the coin i think is great to accumulate more in this dip, it is a long term project, so you do not have to worry much about short term correction periods as it will always appreciate back up. As for altcoin believers, Eth or Dogecoin is actually not a bad idea to throw some more money on.",

You just need to buy carefully, in case the market falls further, you should have reserves for additional purchases. This weekend, many altcoins well grown after falling, by 20-30 percent, who took the risk could get a good profit. But the market is too unstable, you need to be very careful and attentive in every transaction.",

Bitcoin is predicted, it was even predicted when the price was around 40,000 and people also thought it was the bottom and there was a chance to buy cheap coins, but a couple of months passed and those bottom buyers got a new bottom. I'm not sure that right now we've peaked, the market could spin around in the 30-40,000 zone for a bit and then go down to, say, 20,000. I don't need to say that altcoins would lose even more in value from such a scenario. But still I find some prices attractive to buy, but I am afraid to buy a lot, so I would say that this situation is good for partial buying of some altcoins that you are going to buy more if the price falls even lower.",
