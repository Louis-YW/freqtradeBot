There are better possibilities thatmany people step up and take the lead.Take example with Bitcoin, some guys create the code in 2009, then when missing in action.What happen next? The community took over the project, now 5000+ Devs have contributedto the project, 1000s and 1000s of websites are related and/or have the name bitcoin in it.Countries have now Bitcoin as legal tender. And more and more...Do you think that those involve where waiting for Satoshi to give permission to do stuff,or waiting to see what is going to happen? No, they just did it. Welcome to the decentralizedworld where you don't need permission to do something, you just do it.So as a community member (owning tokens) when you have an idea, instead of waiting forsomeone to do it for you, you simply step up and do it yourself. (Want to have an EtherLite BAfrican website, don't wait for permission, just do it.) (Wish to have an EtherLite B SpanishTelegram Group, don't wait for permission, just do it.)There will always be some people waiting to see what is going to happen with this project,we just ignore them, and let the proactive people take this project to another level.I (Antares), personally, did the fork, started this project on solid ground, already did morein the first week of launching this project, than the main project crew did last year, with analready working staking environment and ETLB already listed in one trusted exchange.I (Antares) did my part and I will do more from time to time, like announcing a Contest for the bestwebsite design for EtherLite B in the coming weeks.But first we need to find a ways to contact those 15,520 community members and make themaware that they own tokens of this project.My (Antares) promise to you - 1 year from now, if we achieve and maintain a 100,000 USD daily trading ofEtherLite B (Token on the Bitgert Blockchain) on Trade51 Exchange. I will let the community voteon a new direction for EtherLite B project (e.g. like having EtherLite B run on its own blockchain)HOW TO CHECK IF YOU HAVE AN ETHERLITE B TOKEN BALANCE━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━QuoteFor example if you think you had a balance of 100,000 ETL on Block 2880000 August-14-2021 03:55:33 AMwith this address 0x01f31e140d9379Db36Afe720287cBd5C8EB1099fYou need to perform a search withhttps://brisescan.com/address/0x01f31e140d9379Db36Afe720287cBd5C8EB1099f/transactions to checkthe address balance on the Bitgert blockchain explorer.Then you will get back your current EtherLite B balance of 10,000 ETLB according to the chart below 10% ofETL BALANCES (Distribution of 21,072,288 ETLB to 15,500+ addresses)smaller than < 10 ETL = you get 0 ETLBgreater than > 10 ETL and smaller than <= 500,000 ETL = you get 10% value in ETLB (e.g. 1,000 ETL = 100 ETLB or 500,000 ETL = 50,000 ETLB)greater than > 500,000 ETL smaller than < 5,000,000 ETL = you get a flat 50,000 ETLB> 5,000,000 ETL = you get 0 ETLB (not looking to have the foundation billions supply joining this side project)You can now follow this link to add the Bitgert Blockchain to your Metamask wallet as well as adding theEtherLite B token contract to it: https://trade51.co/page-details/add-bitgert-network-to-metamaskTo start moving your ETLB tokens (since your BRISE balance is 0) you can get a one-time 1 BRISE airdropon https://antares.codes, this will get you started on sending ETLB Tokens. With only 1 BRISE, you canexecute 100s of ETLB transactions.Optional: Reply to this treat with any address you think you had an EtherLite (ETL) balanceon Block 2880000 August-14-2021 03:55:33 AM, and we will personally find if you own acurrent EtherLite B (ETLB) tokens balance.",
