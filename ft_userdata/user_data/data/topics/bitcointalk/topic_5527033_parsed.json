  "content": "Actually, this is the moment of Bitcoin's current movement which is the best opportunity for all methods, because Bitcoin has provided several opportunities for those who want the price of Bitcoin to fall to make purchases, and this moment is also the best moment for those who do short-term trading. And this moment is also the best opportunity for those who do the DCA method to increase purchases because these moments are opportunities for those who should be utilized properly and THIS IS THE BEAUTY OF BITCOIN because it can benefit any method to generate short-term, medium-term, or long-term profits. And they should know that there is a lot of positive news that has occurred which is an opportunity for them that should not be missed because I am sure that even though the decline continues, Bitcoin will tend to increase and continue to increase until it passes its previous high. And the price of Bitcoin has just reached $ 108,700 which previously the price of Bitcoin had dropped to $ 90,000 in a short time.",

However, I am more showing that Bitcoin will benefit those who do the methods they do especially for the long term because I am also one of those who hold Bitcoin in the long term by doing the DCA method which always takes advantage of the declines that occur to increase my purchases that I do periodically because this is a momentum that I always take advantage of well. So I focus more on the current moment and what you mentioned, the majority of all holders will do and act like that and the beauty of Bitcoin is more than that and what I mentioned I think is one of them and also an opportunity.",

Sooner or later the bull season will end and the bear season will come and many people will lose money because of it. Indeed, the real beauty of bitcoin lies in its utility and use cases, not in its volatility. There is nothing wrong with taking advantage of bitcoin's volatility to make a profit but don't consider it a purely speculative tool, bitcoin has many other beauties that we should not ignore.",

Those who are buying through the DCA method, they always invest with a sense of fun. Also, this moment is really suitable for them, because they can benefit from the market fluctuations.In particular, the price of Bitcoin once dropped to $ 90,000, but now it has reached $ 1,08,700, which is a good signal that there may be a positive trend in the market. Although there is still some volatility, positive market news and trends in the future can take Bitcoin higher. So, for those who are willing to buy now, this could be an important opportunity.",

      "body": "You can only appreciate the beauty of bitcoin in terms of prices if you know how to take advantage of it. Obviously, as what we say, buy low, sell high. But there are moments that you will have to question that philosophy when the price continue to go down and you are losing money and thinking of selling it already because you don't want to lose all your money. So it's not that easy to see it in the beginning, as there are a lot of ups and downs in the market and you can only acknowledge it once you go to the bull and bear market, you know how to hold, accumulate and sell at the right time. But it's good to see another all time high at $109k in the last couple of hours. And if you bought when the price is around $90k'ish, then congrats, you have made a lot of (unrealized/realized) profits already.",

The freedom its decentralized nature gives is priceless. The government of my country enacted a policy that mandated banks to restrict bank transactions to a certain amount. Businesses began to feel the adverse impact because some of them imported goods and couldn't pay due to the restrictions. Some businesses had agreements with their international trading partners and they switched to Bitcoin as the medium of payment. The only issue I knew some of them had was prove fluctuations but they still found ways to balance their accounts. The ability bypass financial restrictions placed by Central Banks using Bitcoin is second to none.",

They think that the price will go down deeper so that will be their time to buy but that will not always happen as the price is difficult to predicts accurately. Maybe they can buy for a small fraction and see the market happens and if the market still goes down for more, they can prepare some money to buy back and wait. The price will not go down without any increases so they will see when the price will reverse. The important is they can use the moment to buy Bitcoin at a low price and hold it.",
