As we know, many people are still sceptical about Bitcoin and don't think its presence can help them have a better future.It's not too late to invest in Bitcoin, especially now that the price is still at $ 26k and will increase again. So if those people are willing to start investing in Bitcoin, they won't regret it, especially when they see the price of Bitcoin going up this month and beyond.But if they still don't want to invest in Bitcoin, we don't need to force them to do what we do because it is a choice. We have a choice that we want to make, including investing in Bitcoin or something else. So it's better for us to invite people willing to accept Bitcoin, focus on collecting it only, and let people who don't want to follow us.",

I said rare asset because Bitcoin truly is rare and once the supply gets reduced and demand gets higher than those people will understand the rarity of the digital asset . Most of them will regret that why they didn't purchase Bitcoin when its price was still below $27k. However, that regretting won't be helpful either because they won't be able to do anything then.That's why it's still the best time to buy Bitcoin because I'll surely say that with next halving the $27k range will be a dream for accumulators as it will never go that down in price ever after the next halving. Instead of listening to those people who discourage people from purchasing this asset we should follow those people who encourage us to accumulate as many bitcoins as we possibly can.",

In all of the cases, I don't think it's a valid argument against investing in Bitcoin, but still. As for #2, it can be an argument against starting mining now without having major resources, but not against just buying some BTC. And #3 is worth keeping in mind, of course, but not entirely accurate. It's unlikely that Bitcoin will go 20x very fast, as it did in 2017. But it can go 3x-5x, I think, and these are also pretty good gains. Maybe it can even go 20x from the current price, but it'll just take more time, several bull runs and several-year bear breaks in between.Bitcoin is still a good investment, it still has a lot of potential to spread much further. So I do agree with the op that we're still in the early days.",

Once we invest in crypto, it means we intend to get rich quickly, including in bitcoin, because if you really want to be safe and not in a hurry to get rich quickly, then you have chosen gold or other safe havens. As cryptoaddictchie said, he is not a shark, he does not have too much money, so he invests in altcoins, but the end goal is to earn more money to accumulate bitcoins for the long term. I see this strategy used by many people and it is also their way to increase their bitcoins, what did they do wrong?",

Bitcoin value is too high, I won't make enough gains investing in Bitcoin. The supply is 21 Million, but we have already mined 19.37 Million Bitcoin in the last 13 years. You don't have to worry about the supply. The rest 1.67 Million Bitcoin will take around 140 Years to be mined. The scarcity will increase even further after the next halving. It's been only 13 years, and still, a long way to go. Compared to the days we have passed and the days remaining to the end of the mining phase. We are still in the beginning. About Miners, They are making the same or more money, I guess. The only thing I can say is if they hold what they have mined, then yeah, Compared to that time, Current miners are getting less block reward. But, At that time, Bitcoin doesn't worth what it's worth today. The current block reward is 6.25 Bitcoin, worth over $168K today. After the next halving, the miners will make 3.125 Bitcoins which may be worth more than $168K in 2024 or, let's say, 2025. So, It's absurd to talk about the block rewards. Bitcoin Mining is still profitable, and it will remain profitable for the next hundred years. Bitcoin's value is indeed too high. But, This is not the end of Bitcoin. As I already said before, We have only passed 13 years. We have a long way to go. The scarcity will increase over time, and the Value of Bitcoin will increase.",

Because most of them still can't see the potential of bitcoin in the long term and as a whole. So for beginners who are really just getting to know bitcoin investing, it is still considered normal to have thoughts like that about bitcoin. But it is true, such thinking must be changed and corrected as soon as possible. Because if you constantly have thoughts like that, it will most likely hinder someone from making progress, especially in the field of bitcoin investment. Because thinking like that has entered into pessimistic thinking. Meanwhile, in investing, especially in bitcoin, you must always have positive thoughts and should not be pessimistic. And in essence, it's never too late to invest in bitcoin.",
