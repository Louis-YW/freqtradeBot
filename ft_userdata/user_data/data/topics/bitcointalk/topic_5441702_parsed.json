      "body": "It likely depends on how the bitcoin was stored for tax purposes and when it was bought. You likely don't have to use the exact exchange rate you bought it for if you don't have it (you might be in a country that lets you use the monthly average for example). You can then just log a capital gain (or equivelant) of amount sold * (recent sale price - purchase price). The issue with this example occurs when multiple purchases are made, but then you just need to do more calculations.",

You can connect with any local trading group that can exchange bitcoin for you. If I speak from the perspective of my country, then the options are - Paxful (P2P)Binance (P2P)Bitbns (centralized exchange)Wazirx (centralized exchange)Coinswitch ((centralized exchange)However, I am not endorsing any of these companies. Please do your own research before using any of them. Now once you have exchanged the bitcoin to fiat, keep aside 30% of the transaction value for tax purpose.",

So to make the exchange of BTC to fiat currency faster you have to use p2p. I can recommend Binance exchange which is well known by most people across the nation.",

      "body": "In Ukraine (my country), cryptos are endorsed and popular, and exchanges can openly advertise their services, but the taxation is a bit of a grey area: it wasn't fully figured out yet, even though cryptos per se are legal. It's all a bit new, with people arguing for various interpretations. The loophole is, of course, used by various people not to pay taxes, but it's also risky because some may argue that it should be taxed under more general laws either as property or as income. We have many online exchanges where you transfer money onto a Bitcoin address and get local fiat to your bank account. If a sum is big, though, I think it's better to use a more-or-less official service or split it into smaller pieces for bank accounts of different banks.",

And besides as the basic rule of investment implies  Always invest what you can afford to lose so you investing all your savings doesn't sound smart.While as for the proof of buying I'm not sure why anyone would be needing that or perhaps because I haven't used or presented it in any if my transactions maybe that's why I have no clue about it.",

Best it should be in your local / national fiat currency, not in altcoins (terrible choice).This is certainly the advice I give investors looking towards bitcoin, once you set out a certain amount for investment 20 to 30% of it should only be in bitcoin and the rest could be store on other not too volatile currencies. This gives you ability to hodl for long. But constantly going to sell off when every emergency arrives only results into losses. In my country Nigeria we are yet to have taxes compounded on crypto transactions since it is yet to be adopted by the government or regulated. So any exchange P2P can be used",

Yes!Â  Bitcoin is a financial architecture totally different in custody and in the transaction process, but common sense, and above all the basic financial rules are useful to start training with bitcoin.",

It makes no sense explaining how it works in country A if you live all the way over in Country Q. But the laws in some countries also state that if you invested in bitcoin and held the currency for a specific amount of time (e.g., 1 or 2 years), you don't need to pay any capital gains taxes. That's only if you invested and bought the asset, not if you worked or provided services and gained it as a payment.",
