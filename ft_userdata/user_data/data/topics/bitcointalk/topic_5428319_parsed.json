  "content": "On different occasions I have come across statements by some newbies expressing how it has been difficult for them to grow or ranking up while on the contrary there are their other counterparts that are doing well and ranking up still in the forum. Although there have been some thread base on this Â but yet In my discretion I still thought it wise to drop this few key notes as recipe to every serious newbie out there. For they are in no particular order:*Make the forum your friend:  a friend is that person whom you are always fond of, cause their presence spring up some bliss within you as you both spend time together. In same vein as a newbie you should take the forum as a close friend, redirect the much time you spend on social media ( Facebook, tiktok, Instagram, etc) and exert it into the forum and you will be amazed at the height of quality ideas and growth you will amass within a short period.*Apply some breaks in your urge to always make a comment:  Â create a paradigm shift mentality in your urge to always want to make comments to threads. At times apply some breaks by making it a culture whereby you set aside some moment whereby you go through other forum users threads and comments with the mindset to learn from other ideas through their comments and thread.*Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Â  almost every experienced forum users can attest to the power of doing your own research. Unfortunately it is a factor many Â newbies neglect but it's actually a tool to the making of Â quality threads and contributions from you into the forum.In conclusion, we should all bear in mind that nothing good comes easy. The floor is open for other experienced forum users to contribute in their ideas and thoughts.",

It doesn't work that way.I'd advise 'em rookies to buckle up and make endeavours NOW -- now is the time cus believe me; a time will come when alot of knowledgeable gurus would get to discover the forum and \"mediocrity won't have a stand\"Sandra ðŸ§‘",

And it's true. I read it twice to understand the meaning of a sentence that could have been said in a much simpler way.O.P., do you also talk in real life? But seriously, you are right: Many people start and end their day on social media. But for me, the forum has become such a friend. A cup of coffee in the morning and kefir in the evening are always accompanied by reading the forum.You are right, OP, in that you motivate newbies, but they have a lot of new vocabulary to learn, so our role should be very simple. Communication should be in a language understandable to beginners, so simple that it seems as if the interlocutor is sitting next to you at the same table.",

I noticed after a while of becoming active on this forum that those social media sites are designed to take more from you and are mostly for relaxation and entertainment, the forum on the other hand provides access to knowledge and information. I weighed my options and decided that the forum is a better place to be active. I don't regret it, and I do not think I will regret it.",

The main focus is don't spam, have strong opinion, knowledge so you can have a good argument when using the forum. Still it's a decent community driven forum to discuss anything on a suitable board but if you want to make the forum more than just bitcoin library or something then this has to be the place to work.It doesn't matter user's intention to develop especially because he wants to gain knowledge. Success in this forum is not just success in getting high rank, making money, or anything else.

Instead of being a place where you can discuss about something you're invested in, a lot of users are now here because they want to make money, and might actually not have much of an interest in Bitcoin itself. As a trade off of this; a lot of users now think that your posts always have to be of the upmost importance, and of top quality. Which, is somewhat nice. However, it's unrealistic to expect every post you churn out to be gold. Instead, users should be posting because they have something to add, whether that's right or wrong.
