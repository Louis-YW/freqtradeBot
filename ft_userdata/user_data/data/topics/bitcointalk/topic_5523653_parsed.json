Here is the 15% correction used by CZ, from $100k to $85k.You can use Bitcoin: Bull Market Correction Drawdowns for your predictions.QuoteLet's see what's CZ tweet will be when we reaches $1 million.  He won't tweet it, because he can not time the market and when a price will be reached.",

Didn't Bitcoin fall below 70K after creating an ATH of 74K? But if you want exact same situation and the same price, probably you will have to wait a little more until the bull run ends and Bitcoin starts to fall again. For now, a lot of people posting on social media that people should be ready for a big blow because the bull run is going to end. While I believe the full bull run is yet to start. I mean, the alt season did not even start. Alts were accumulating for a while and it all dumped in a single week.",

I don't know if what we had is the actually correction because the rate at which the market recovered was like that of big hands dumping to buy which is same as market manipulation. But the difference is that he made this prediction in 2020 and the price of bitcoin had not even crossed $100k at that time. Meanwhile, most people's predictions were made just last month. Not to mention, when Bitcoin crossed the $100k and continued to rise to $107k, hardly anyone thought Bitcoin would correct anymore. If you look at the predictions on the speculation board, everyone is confident that bitcoin will break $110k or $120k, no one believes that the correction of the last 2 days will happen. It is safe to say that these predictions may or may not come true, and I would not rely on this to praise CZ's predictive ability. What I wonder is who found and shared this tweet first, was it by chance or was it pre-planned?",

Bitcoin dropped down from the $108k+, which was its all-time high, down to $92k+, which is almost 15% off from its all-time high. The market is already showing some recovery signal, but that does not mean that there is no possibility of the price dropping down again. The prediction was close, which is against what many expected.  Some have even predicted that price will drop below $80k if we reach the $100k level before it will start to bounce back again. Let's just see what will become of price before the last day of the year 2024.",

He’s the founder of Binance, so whatever he says will influence the market, whether positively or negatively. As long as the market is bullish or it’s altcoin season, his words will carry weight and people will listen.Even though he’s no longer with Binance due to legal issues, people still trust Binance, and by extension, they trust him as well.
