When I try to open the site it loads quickly The UI looks attractive moreover it also works great on mobile browsers.I just registered with the site wanting to see some interesting things in it, it's also fun when there are some games that I often play like Limbo and Plinko, that's good because I don't like slot games at least there are alternative casino games that I will play here besides sports betting , in the deposit section as usual KYC verification level 1 and maybe some will not like this, Btw welcome to the forum maybe I will try the game here later if this site has a good response from the community always make sure you are active in this forum and just another suggestion run a signature campaign to get traffic on this forum",

Just registered an account and I got a welcome message from the live chat, surprised to know that you have over 10,000 registered players already. After checking the deposit, it seems that I have to pass KYC verification level 1 first in order to get the deposit address. To be frank, I dont like this but I have to say it is better than allowing people to deposit without KYC but asking people to do KYC on withdrawal. Welcome to the forum and wish the best luck for your casino, maybe I can try your casino with your free offer only since I think I wont be filling the KYC verification to make deposit.",

As you know, feedback is very important to a starter because that is where you get the best suggestions and areas where you fall short can also be identified.",

However, I will still join in welcoming you to this great platform as your presence is highly welcomed. Merely looking at your announcement thread here I noticed your profile is already upgraded to a copper member which would enable you upload   your graphics which you already did and it looks unique and with a touch of excellence. This attribute shows how good a manager or representative you are because you followed the rules of the platform in registering for a copper member as a casino.I had to check your website and my first observation was the cookies which i am  really not comfortable with. From the looks, one must accept it before it goes of from home screen  page which is not quite alright. It would be nice the cookies is made an option to reject or accept so as to enable a full home page accessibility. I barely see your minimum withdrawal and deposit. I will suggest it is made accessible for prospective members to see and know what is obtainable when registering. However you have a good casino with lots of features but you would have other big names to contend with here. I would advise you make provision for your publicity campaign to create much awareness of your casino here as it is known that campaign managed by well known reputable managers have the tendencies to last long here. Nevertheless, you can seek the expertise of a good, reliable and trustworthy campaign manager to help you manage your campaign. Royse777 can help deliver your campaign  as he has a vast knowledge and experience here with numerous recorded successful projects under his management.",

However i am doubtful as most of the tokens out there don't have reason to exist.And i don't have yet enough information that would justify a kyc and grinding slot machines for something that might have value, but years in this scene have made me cynical and odds are it's just another pointless token.
