What are reasons for this discussion, many persons who are new to Cryptocurrency have the habit of constantly checking their phone or laptop from seconds to seconds to see their money jump high to profit. With that kind of mindset, they hardly have time for other things as their mind is just fixed on that money. And in most cases, it leads to breakdown in health as first time or new investors centres their mind on profit especially in our country where things are hard, many young person think, crypto is the saver . As you engage in cryptocurrency, manage everyother part of your life, take care of your family, spend time with them, relate with others, have fun, do other business and have impact on other people's life in a positive way. Staying indoor half of the day or throughout the day is not too helpful, checking your phone on the High way is dangerous. Wisdom demands that every area of your life is balanced as you pursue your investment goal in cryptocurrency.It is also wise to have time allocation for crypto so that it won't consume most of your time, understand the basic and know when to expect profit instead of perpetual checking of your wallet.Cheers",

It doesn't work that way; in fact, Bitcoin investment and altcoin investment (for those that still invest in them) are the kind of investment that gives one the privilege to do other things while their investment is right there in their wallet. Perhaps, as you have said, it doesn't take more than 5 minutes to look through your wallet if you really want to do so. Bitcoin Investment doesn't stop you from balancing your life style; it doesn't stop you from doing other things. In fact, Bitcoin is freedom, and anyone who uses it as an excuse to escape other important things in life is only making mistakes and investing wrongly. Perhaps it has been said time and time again without numbers that investors should only invest what they can afford to lose. When carrying out crypto investments, the investor is not supposed to invest an amount that they know will have some psychological effect on them.",

Â Everything is wrong. You cannot just invest in bitcoin and be checking the price everyone second even everyday is bad and tokless of every second for weti na? If anyone is doing that he or she should refrain from that habit. It is a very bad one be that. This kind of issue has been discussed in the general English boards and the advised given to those who doing that is to steer clear from the investment. Bitcoin is not something you invest today and you have profit within one day or week but years. So if anyone invest in bitcoin should know that they should wait for like 2 to 3 years and then they will benefit from the investment. When the person invest in bitcoin he should remove his mind from it and don't invest in bitcoin with the money that you want to use within the week. Invest in it with the money that is not par of your family plan. You have to make sacrifices in the investment to have profit and if you are not ready for the sacrifices (patient enough) then leave bitcoin investment and do physical business.",

Because me I be one of those wey been dey check phone during my early days & I see nothing wrong with that when a newbie does that within his/her first period investing in Bitcoin. But if an old member does that then something is wrong somewhere, as such individual is meant to have understand how it works, set eitherÂ  take-profit or stop-loss order and a notification to be notified when the price of BTC reaches a certain amount so as to sell or buy to make profit, while he/her go on with his daily activity. Because the fact that you invested in Bitcoin does not mean you have to cut yourself from relating with family and friends.",

Anybody wey dey take investing as full time job no get handwork to do because wetin dey there to just buy your coin from exchange or any where we sure for you then you move am to ur wallet wey you get full control come hodl an and u no need do anything until your investment mature you come move am to exchange to.

Na the koko be dat, get ur coins for wallets and dey follow up for market and their social platforms wey be say you need dey up to date because if na altcoins you dey hold, things dey happen wey dey rekt man without knowing like if exchange dey delist the coins because of one one or two wahala or just low trading volume. You need know so you know how you go take, take cover or just lock up and continue holdings. Check up for crypto dey necessary but anything wey you dey do make you no make am addiction like some people wey go wake up and before dem do anything dem go check market and all through the day na so so visit dem go dey go for market apps, dat one no make sense.",

Especially if you are a scalper or a day trader, you may have the habit of looking at the screen and checking the chart and the price of the coins that you are using to trade. I will advice against such habit as well because it can even affect the trader's health and good lifestyle.As for investment, that is the easiest thing to do. You even leave your coins on a noncustodial wallet. Checking wallet from time to time will be in an healthy way and most likely there will be a time you will leave the wallet and not check it often again, unlike trading, thinking of your trading funds not to get liquidated and watching the chart often. Investment is not what you are panicked about like trading and it will not affect you like trading. You will have time for yourself, family and friends with investment.But invest on right right coins, not shit or dead ones.",
