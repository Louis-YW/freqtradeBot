  "content": "Strong debates are going on as crypto freaks are going deeper and deeper into Dex for growth and profitablity. Over the years Dex was lagging in some things like security and fee issues as compare to osacar swap. I personally used to think that Dex is not a good option because how can I protect my investment without third party involvement but after getting a good lesson from FTX and cex I am now completely convinced that Dex has the great potential in it if a good project polishs it's properties in a perfect wayI know you guys are wondering about Oscar swap ,like how oscar has created value into Dex? How can a project can have a unique idea like this in the darkest time of crypto? So I have one word answer for you \" yes\". By refining Dex osacar swap can now combat with new challenges in the market. it has made the unique and more developed version of dex. Have you heard the good news that oscar is giving 100 percent of generated revenue just by staking oscar token in the auto compounded staking pools. Another opportunity for user who love to juggle with several task simultaneously. as a oscar user you can be both trader and Dex at the same time. Opportunities are more than ever by taking advantage of different things at the same time. By eliminating arbitrage osacar swap is maintaining equality not only that it has reduced swap and gas fee to the lowest, I can bet no ther project is offering this fee. But stop here my folks how can we invest in a project without getting satisfied about the security and privacy. As far my opinion is concerned I always gauge a project on this base. I spend 4 days to inspect   the security and privacy measure s of osacar swap and this time again osacar never failed to impress me . They have been Audied by solidproof and done kyc. But still I was afraid and had thousand questions in my mind about the security issues because many projects have done all of this but still failed . I kept thinking about this until I came accross time lock feature of osacarswap . This feature is tremendous,it ensurees that every activity will be stopped until suggestions and issues of users are responded.",

Go back to your old account that has already made the old thread above. You just ruined the reputation from your project. Lol, totally deviate from the main point. OP wants to chill oscar swap but he is doing a terrible job. @OP incase you don't know, there are several more advanced multichain dex in the space thanks to web3. Oscar swap is not the only dex with great features, so there is no need for continue chilling it. And yes, you should maintain the first thread with your other account and stop spamming with different account, it won't help the rep of your project.",

      "body": "Thank you for the detailed description of the osacar swap project and its capabilities. Obviously, security and privacy are very important factors when it comes to investing and using decentralized exchanges. It is also interesting that the project offers low swap and gas fees, which can attract a large number of users.However, as with any project, there are risks and potential problems that may arise during use. Therefore, it is important to be careful and carry out sufficient due diligence before investing your funds. In any case, I hope that the osacar swap project will continue to develop and provide convenience and safety for its users.",

For crypto to reach full adaption there must a hand shake btw it and the regulations.",

      "body": "Have you heard about hybrid exchanges? where the advantages of CEX and DEX are combined? Generally, they took the security aspect from DEX, like if you use your own private key to access, you keep it because if you don't hold the private key, it's not yours. Then, they took the service aspect of CEX and said they would solve your problem 24 hours a day through their customer service. You need to do KYC to prevent money laundering and to obey the government's rules. Both CEX and DEX have their own disadvantages, and with hybrid exchanges, I think the trading experience will be better. Recently, I met this one project that claims itself to be the first hybrid exchange that is compliant with Islam's shariah. No stake, no future trading, 50/50 profit sharing Will hybrid exchanges beat DEX in the future? let's see.",
