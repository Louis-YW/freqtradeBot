  "content": "Hi guys! Long time lurker, first time poster. I've been researching a lot into the marketing of running crypto casinos but have always been curious about where these casinos source their greatest affiliates. In the fiat and global in-person casinos - the biggest high-rollers are generally sourced by junkets & big agents who accommodate these players with complimentary benefits. I presume that there are many of these types of agents that bring in a hefty percentage of a crypto casino's gross volume. Where would we be able to find these types of agents & affiliates in the online gambling realm? Many thanks!",

      "body": "I can certainly make a mistake, but it seems to me that all this is done individually for each online casino, but in any case, you need to start with obtaining a license. And since the legal environment for gambling is very different in different countries, then advertising gambling on the Internet is a rather laborious process. In many countries, online casinos are regulated or even prohibited, and before undertaking any advertising campaigns, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction. But many new online casinos start by creating a community on Twitter and telegram.",

      "body": "As said above it seems to be done individually and is normally just a thing that changes who you get through to when talking to support (from what I've seen)Because of the nature of cryptocurrency, there are a lot of people who make large deposits that seem to want to contact the support first to see if they're comfortable taking such deposits and if there's anything extra that needs to be done (for example extra security features). This is likely the time where casinos look to attract wealthier people and hope they'll bring other contacts that have funds too to play there (there's also a chance things like comps are determined because people stand out with their accounts on casinos and get noticed by people or algorithms that analyse user data).Advertising is likely a great source of communicating with everyone though too and high rollers are going to be more interested in your casino if you're old, trusted and well used.",

In fact, it is more effective as what you have said, namely with references and stories from the experiences of everyone who has used a particular gambling platform.Maybe this is happening because now there are many gamblers who believe more in the experiences of other gamblers because it is more real and they really have experience playing on a gambling platform.The gambling platform must consider properly if you want to use the services of an affiliate to carry out promotions.",

It's great to see someone taking an interest in the marketing aspect of the crypto casino industry.As for your question about finding affiliates for online crypto casinos, there are a few different avenues you can explore. Some casinos have their own affiliate programs that you can join directly. You can also find affiliate networks that specialize in connecting affiliates with online gambling sites. Additionally, many crypto casinos also partner with affiliates and agents through private deals and negotiations.If you're looking for a casino with a strong affiliate program, you can check out sites like FortuneJack, DuelBits, and the best of the best: Stake.com.

Try group chats like Telegram or Discord but I don't have the resources.You may need to create an account on Stake.com first then do the marketing outside thru social media or forums. Here is the good part about the commissions though.QuoteBeing a Stake.com affiliate means you will earn a commission for all bets placed on both our Casino and Sportsbook - which unlike traditional affiliate programs, means that despite if they win or lose, you still make the same commission!Good luck with your quest.

And I agree that what @OP needs to do is build a community network first so he can get followers who will spread the link. And if he already has a lot of followers, he can share his affiliate link with them while seeing how it develops.And to choose a casino, @OP needs to research one by one the casino sites in this forum to see which casino sites have the highest and best payout for him and he also has to pay attention that the casino site must have a good reputation. This is to guard against problems that could arise later.",
