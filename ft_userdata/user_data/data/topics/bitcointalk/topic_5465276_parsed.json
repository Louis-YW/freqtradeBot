For many countries with a weak national currency that loses its value due to inflation, the dollar remains a way for the local population to maintain their wealth. But money is a very poor tool for this.Actually, I'm not very good at sorts of shit, so choosing between \"Stable coin or having USD in bank\" remains an unresolved dilemma for me. Why would you want to enter \"USD in bank\" when \"keep cash\" is better? In control of your funds. To be honest, the dollar looks better against stablecoins due to its longer life cycle and age, which makes it more reliable. The project that created stablecoin will cease to exist earlier than an entire country that ensures the world's use of the currency thanks to its economy.I'm not sure that there is an alternative in nature that is similar to bitcoin, independent and possessing the characteristics of complete control. If you are willing to speculate on the price of bicoin, then you will have to risk converting it to stablecoins or usd. This can't be avoided. In fact, this is a payment for the profit that you receive.",

DAI is backed by other stable coins and most importantly USDC. If USDC fall out of peg today, DAI will fall out of peg. If USDC becomes useless today, DAI also will become useless.",

However, if it's just for investment turnover, I prefer to keep it in stable coins like USDT because it's more flexible to buy other cryptos.Apart from that, if you are looking for something that is like bitcoin, but has a physical form and full control, then I suggest buying gold. Gold has full control such as storage and others, besides that gold is also easy to resell, and the price tends to rise. It's just that, if you are more inclined towards crypto, then saving bitcoin is a better thing.",

When you keep you money in stablecoin and the app or site crash, your money is also gone but if you keep you money in a dollar domiciliary account, you money is saved at all time. Dollar is even more appreciating than the Fiat currency so there is no need to keep funds in stablecoin. See what happened in Nigeria few days back, a UK based Nigerian citizen was sending money to bank account every month for years, and when she came back to check her bank account and wanted to withdraw money and what she saw just $4 and the money she sent was about $100,000 and she sued the bank to court and the court admitted that the money was withdrew by someone in the bank and the court said the bank should pay the money. So if such scenario Happened in the stablecoins savings, who will pay back the money. In stablecoin you will do KYC till you will become tired.",

I do not support keeping your money in a bank account due to its \"I want to know everything\" behavior. If I receive money from somewhere, banks ask where the funds come from. If I deposit money into my account, I still have to provide information about the source of the money. Even though I do nothing illegal, I do not like when banks want to interfere when I want to manage my money. It's a tough choice. What should I do to avoid inflation? My Average Income has not increased for the last two years. But inflation rose a lot. I am still surviving because I received my Income in USD. Previously, I was getting 88 BDT for $1, and now I get around 115 BDT for $1. So, I am getting 27 BDT for the same dollar. For now, I keep converting my Income to my local currency and spend it daily. I almost do not have any savings but what I have in Bitcoin. I accept when it falls; I get it when it goes up. I cannot rely on centralized entities. So, Bitcoin remained as my first choice at this moment.",

Of course I'm into crypto, we all are, however, we don't trust those stable coins from the beginning. Tether for example has been on a lot of troubles in the beginning, just like accusations that they are running on fractional reserves. So it's better to really just to hedge if we want our crypto or our local money to USD just in case and not go to stable coins, in my opinion.",

The local currency is affected by inflation and you may make a loss instead of a profit during this time. And keeping fiat in banks is a no-no. There's the fear of bankruptcy. And the problem with stablecoins is, de-pegging. Once it's de-pegged, it will lose its value like crazy. It is also a centralized asset with less safety than fiat money if you consider the risks. So the question is, what to do in this situations! We can choose other stable assets that have been with us for centuries, like metal or stones. Such as silver, gold, or diamonds.
