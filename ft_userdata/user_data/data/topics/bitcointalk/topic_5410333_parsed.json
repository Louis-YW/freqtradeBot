  "content": "Putin is getting a bit fed up with Ukraine tactics. When he promises a mini-nuke strike against an unpopulated area, Zelensky will think its only a threat. Then when Putin carries it out, will Zelensky finally realize that Putin isn't playing games any longer?How many baby-nukes will it take before Zelensky gives up?",

So, why is Russia playing around? They could send a burst of paperwork over all of Ukraine, telling the people what they were going to do, so that the people could move out, or remove Zelensky.This war is a big game, with people dying just to play the game. Who is behind why it is being played this way? As long as Russia keeps its baby nukes inside of the Ukraine, there is no reason for other countries, like the US, getting upset over it.So, what is really going on?",

      "body": "The Ukranian government wouldn't have much of a reply to nukes. However, using tactical nukes would create such an strong oposition in Ukraine towards anything remotly Russian, that it would ve imposible for the ocupators to hold the Ukranian territory in any capacity. And no amount of paperwork would makw the Ukranians accept the Russians anymore. That ship has sailed.",

      "body": "If you can believe the media, the world knows that Ukrainians are dying by the hundreds or thousands, being maimed, losing property, gradually losing more people and land as Russia moves forward. Zelensky's big boasts have turned into BS. And we don't even know for a fact that he was truly elected with all the election fraud going on.It's very noble to die for a cause you believe in. Russia doesn't want that for the Ukraine. They are sisters. If they wanted such, they would have started out with the nukes first day. But if Ukrainians really want to die, okay, nuke 'em. But be honorable about it and give them, say, a month warning to remove Zelensky, or to move to Lithuania or somewhere else.There is even the possibility that Zelensky, realizing the reality of nukes, might step down to save his own miserable hide, just to look good in the eyes of the people so they don't execute him.",

Currently, much of the West is providing weapons and other support to Ukraine, but a nuclear attack would likely turn that into actual troops being deployed, and war being declared.",

Currently, much of the West is providing weapons and other support to Ukraine, but a nuclear attack would likely turn that into actual troops being deployed, and war being declared. The Starburst missile in the video above is a British thing. The US is currently working on a transfer of some 800 of these to the Ukraine from Great Britain... to Zelensky's control. They probably wouldn't be nuclear, but you never can tell. Think of the damage Zelensky could do with these.Russia's pussyfooting around isn't a sign of weakness. It's a sign that Russia is trying to be fair. Russia was winning the world through trade. The US couldn't take being beaten in that arena. So, they made all this trouble.Russia has countermeasures that can take care of the situation. But they want peace and free trade with everybody. It only takes one bullet to stop Zelensky, or one little nuke. What other methods are there to stop the war, and Zelensky with 800 Starburst missiles? The West is gradually pushing themselves into a war that they can't win.",

Let Putin have his land and secure your country. Make sure innocent people dont die. Instead - Putin has now taken that land, plus extra and destroyed the whole of Ukraine - while Zelensky too busy taking photoshoots for glossy magazines with his trophy wife. Something funny going on for sure.",
