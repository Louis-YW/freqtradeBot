  "content": "Chives Coin (XCC) is a hard fork created by Volunteers in the Community using Chia™ code.It is a completely decentralized and Community driven Cryptocurrency, No Pre-Mine, No ICO.Chives Coin (XCC) is a blockchain system which consume low power and it's environmentally friendly.New exchange listing this summer. More detail:https://discord.gg/TbWT3ka3kv• Name: Chives• Abbreviation: XCC• ICO: No• Pre-Mine: No• Description: Forked from Chia™• Block time: 18.75 seconds (same as Chia™)• Block reward: 200 Chives (Chia™: 2 XCH)• Block reward distribution (stages 1 and 2): 90% allocated to miners (180 XCC) and 10% to the community (20 XCC).• Block reward distribution (stage 3): 45% is allocated to miners, 45% is allocated to Master Nodes and 10% is allocated to the community. -  Start in summer 2022• Reward halving: Halving in 3 years, to a block reward of 12.5 Chives from the 13th year (same as Chia™)• Total issuance: No upper limit (same as Chia™)• Plot supported: New K29-K30-K31• Need to Replot: Can not use Chia™ plots◉ 1 - How does it work ?Chives uses the free disk space on the hard disk for Proof-of-Space (PoSpace) consensus, along with another consensus algorithm, Proof of Time (PoTime) to verify the blockchain.The income of Chives farmers is proportional to the amount of allocated storage space; if you have 10 times the space, you will earn 10 times the reward.◉ 2 - What is a Chives Farm ?Running a Chives Farm is similar to mining, but using hard drive storage space instead of processing power. During block creation a snapshot the network storage space is taken;Personal income is determined by the percentage of storage space a user contributes to the total storage space on the network. The more storage space you allocate to a Chives Farm, the greater your profit.◉ 3 - What is Plotting ?To start a Chives Farm it must be plotted, a process that requires a read and write to the allocated hard drive farm space. Once your hard disk is plotted, you may become a farmer and harvest it as long as you keep the proof generated by plotting.The initial plot process fills the farm space with random input proofs, reads the drives through direct access to the API, and then sorts them to quickly find the proofs obtained.◉ 4 - Chives mining economic model:On the blockchain of the Chives network, there is no upper limit to the total number of Chives coins that can be generated through farming rewards (farming), but block rewards will be reduced over time.A block is generated every 18.75 seconds, and each block rewards 200 Chives. Of this, 45% is allocated to miners, another 45% is allocated to the master nodes, and 10% is allocated to the community. Halving of block rewards in 3 years, to a final reward rate of 12.5 Chives every 10 minutes from the 13th year.What are you waiting for, join our Community of Chives Coin (XCC) Network ! CHIVES COIN XCC OFFICIAL NETWORK:Website: https://www.chivescoin.org/Explorer: https://explorer.chivescoin.org/Community: https://community.chivescoin.org/GitHub: https://github.com/HiveProject2021/chives-blockchain/Discord: https://discord.gg/TbWT3ka3kvCHIVES COIN XCC OFFICIAL PAPERS:Green Paper: https://chivescoin.org/greenpaper/NFT Game White Paper: https://www.chivescoin.org/chives-farm-game-white-paper-english/CHIVES COIN OFFICIAL AND THIRD PARTY SWAP / EXCHANGE:LBank Exchange: https://www.lbank.info/invitevip?icode=LD3V&lange=en-USCHIVES COIN XCC OFFICIAL FORUM AND BLOG CHANNELS:Forum: https://chivesforum.org/Pools:https://miningpoolstats.stream/chives",
