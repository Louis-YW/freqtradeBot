Trading strategies are what you think and follow to trade inorder to make profit, but it may result to either profit or loss. Assuming I have $1000 and I use $100 to trade which is just 10% of the money that I have.Assuming I do not go more than 2x as my margin ratio that I am using it to open position anytime that I want to tradeAssuming I start the trade with 0.5x margin ratio and if the market do not favour me, and I go 2x maxAssuming I do not trade until the market fall to a significant level or using indicators for itAssuming I do not even trade futures but trading only on spot marketAll I listed above are strategies, everything you do that make you to make profit while trading is the strategy that you are using to trade. If you are still losing, that means that your strategy is not working and you will need to modify it or change it.",

As a beginner who wants to learn, you need to do research on what trading strategies are, how they are applied and which would work best for you. Following this steps, you are not copying someone else's style, but actually discovering your own trading style.Do some rudimentary research, get some background knowledge and then build on that.- Jay -",

So hopefully you won't lose too much by trading1. Never trade in panic as you may make wrong decisions and face losses2. Never invest the full amount on just one coin3. Don't panic and sell any coins even at a loss.  Wait until the loss is recovered.4. Do not invest according to other's decision or advice, research yourself before investing5. Invest a maximum of 20% of the total trading budget on a single coin6. Focus more on potential coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Matic, TRX etc.",

It is a criteria or a plan that a trader follows before they make an entry in the market. Every trader already has a different strategy and they have backtested it very much to prove that it is working with the modern movement in the market before they use a so-called strategy. Now there are many strategies that come out anywhere online, and that strategy is not very effective nowadays because many people already know even the market-makers. So because these strategy are now common, it is easier for market-makers to find the \"stop losses\" of small traders. They are the ones to manipulate to get their stop losses because the money is there, before the market continues to where it is going. The signs of manipulation are those very long wicks.",

It's from the demo trading that you can learn how to combine some trading tools and develop a strategy that really can work best for you.There are a lot of trading platforms, and perhaps if you have any in mind already, you can go on YouTube and search \"how to trade on...\" then add the name of the exchange you have in mind.Also, before trading cryptocurrency, you need to study about the currency pair you want to trade; for example, you need to know how volatile the coin is and also how often it becomes volatile. Also, do not use high leverage when trading because a higher leverage means more risk, and if you are not very careful, your asset can be liquidated.",

And if you do not know and haven't learned much, then you could learn from online sources, you can look at them on google or look at them on youtube and there are a million places that teaches you how to learn trading.Those would be pretty good for many people and should be used. You can't find the best advice here, this is just text and would take too long, this is why you should either read or watch some courses online which is designed for this purpose.

Trading strategies are always changing, a strategy that you are referred to today as the best will not be the best tomorrow because of how the market is dynamic. Rather than asking for the best strategy, ask how best you can create your own working strategy. If you learn how to create strategies, you will be able to change and modify them with the same tips as the market changes.",

Simple is that if you are newbie and want to initiate trading then just start from bitcoin and know about the price that at what price you will sell it or at what price you will buy. Also remember that whenever the price unfortunately goes down then be patience and think that the decision which you are taking will be better for you or not. If someone tell you about any coin then first make research and then select such coin because there are lots of coins which become died during bear market so always choose old and stable coin for investment.",

The best trading strategy is to conduct your own research and apply it to your daily trading. Listening to and following another trader's strategy could result in a large profit or a large loss, and the risk will be on you alone, not the trader you followed. It is acceptable to take risks in trading, but only those risks that you can afford to bear. As a beginner, having your own strategy plan and setting your limits after making your mind is the best strategy to start with right now.",
