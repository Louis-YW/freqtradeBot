  "content": "Cypherock X1 uses Shamir Secret Sharing along with distributed tamper-proof hardware storage used in the banking industry to prevent single point of failure with private key security. X1 has five components- 1 X1 Vault and 4 X1 Cards. Your Crypto seed phrases are distributed in these 5 components, such that you need any 2 out of those 5 to recover or even transact your Crypto assets. You can read more about using Cypherock X1 as seed phrase backup here - https://cypherock.com/wallet-backupThis is the product's 2nd use-case for people who already have a wallet setup for themselves and need a better way to manage their seed phrases, inheritance of their assets (soon) and aggregate their portfolio across the different wallets in one single place. You can learn how it works more here - https://www.cypherock.com/wallet-backup/how-it-worksThe 1st use case of the product is a hardware wallet without seed phrase vulnerability. You can read about it more here - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5459720.0Product Features:Allows you to secure 4 seed phrases with different PIN for each in a single product. Hence 1 Cypherock X1 is enough instead of buying 4 metal backups.Open Source with secure elements both on the X1 Vault and the X1 cards. Source code - https://github.com/cypherock Security Audit Completed by Keylabs.io without any major vulnerabilities found. Keylabs have found vulnerabilities in Ledger and Trezor before. Read more - https://cypherock.com/keylabsExtra security over your seed phrases with a PIN protection on top of shamir shares stored on the hardware to protect against collusionUse the same Cypherock X1 also to make emergency wallet transactions if needed. Read more - https://cypherock.comIt is BIP39 compliant. Hence compatible with the seed phrases of your favorite wallets like Ledger, Trezor, Coldcard, Foundation wallet etc.I would love to get the community's feedback on the same. Here is a coupon code for 10% off if someone wants to try it out - bitcointalk10",

With a multisig, you can have multiple participants on different devices holding their own keys that are required to sign transactions. You don't have one point of failure as with SSS. I agree. Multisig transactions are generally expensive and the user experience is still a big stretch for most users. I just feel multisig is more suited for an enterprise rather than for most individuals. We wrote a blog comparing SSS to Multisig - https://www.cypherock.com/blogs/post-multi-sig-shamirMoreover, you will still be able to create a multisig setup using Cypherock X1 also. That multisig setup will be more secure than any other wallet combination out there. Our aim with the Cypherock X1 is to create the best possible infra for securing a single seed.",

It is on the roadmap to support Multisig scripts soon. I am not sure how does the user know the seed after first signature. The seed is not even exposed during the wallet creation nor during transaction signing. Although there is an option on the device to generate the seed phrase back from X1 Vault and the X1 card + PIN again if you want to view it and still back it up somewhere.QuoteI don't trust that an NFC-enabled card will enhance the security of my coins.It does actually. The cards are EAL 6+ certified secure elements. Hence, they have brute force protection through a time exponential function enforced through a 4-8 character alphanumeric PIN. Hence, even if a hacker gets hold of 2 of the 4 cards, they still have to find a way to hack the card individually and bypass the PIN protection to be able to compromise your assets which is extremely improbable.QuoteI searched and did not find information about this emergency wallet transactions service, is it similar to Ledger Recovery?Not really. There is no emergency wallet transactions service. The same seed phrase backup product also doubles up as a hardware wallet. So, you can use the cySync desktop app along with X1 Vault + 1 X1 card to make transactions incase your Coldcard/Trezor/Ledger or any other BIP39 wallet is not available.

The card have 4-8 alphanumeric PIN based brute force protection to protect the share. As long as you have device + 1 card or 2 cards working, your assets are fine. If you think, you still require to backup the seed phrase separately, you can always do that as well.There are 4 X1 cards having the 4 Shamir shares. The 5th share is in the device. So you need the device + any 1 card to operate. It is currently static to make it easy for most users. We will offer customizations in the future.",

Hence you need 1 device + 1 card or 2 cards (along with PIN if set) to view the seed phrase or make a transaction.QuoteAgain, which one is it?Apologies on this. The older set of cards were EAL 5+.

If I forget the PIN to my cards, is there a way to reset it? Or, will I have to order a brand new set of cards? There is no way to reset it. Instead of deleting the wallet which could be more catastrophic if the user forgets the PIN, we decided to implement a time exponential function instead. After 3 wrong attempts, the timer to enter a new PIN attempt increases exponentially upto 100 years. You can as you mentioned can order new cards.For people who think they can forget the PIN, we advise the user to backup the PIN somewhere which is still exponentially more secure than backing up a seed phrase. We will as mentioned also launch a no-KYC inheritance service soon that will allow users to recover the forgotten PIN also apart from passing on the assets to their loved ones.",
