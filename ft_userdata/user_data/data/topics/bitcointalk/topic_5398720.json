  "content": "Want to withdraw btc from a gambling site to my nano ledger s and then send a tiny bit of that btc to another gambling site.  When i connected my nano ledger s to my laptop and click on receive in ledger live, i would then choose the bitcoin account segwit which shows the btc balance.  When you click on dropdown menu, you see option of BCH account which i have BCH stored there.  Also there a is a btc account native segwit but it has no btc there.  Now when i click next when it is on the bitcoin account segwit and it shows my balance next to it, it then displays a btc receiving address that starting with the number 3.  So i have to look at the btc address on the laptop screen and on the nano ledger screen to verify it is the same address to verify.  What i then noticed was this btc receiving address that is displayed on both the laptop screen and the nano ledger screen, i seen this btc address many times and come to think about it, i might have used this receiving address many times.  The btc address i am close to positive i used this as a btc receiving address many times or almost every single time i received btc to my nano ledger.  So is that normal and default?  That is not good right?  But i only send and receive btc to my previous other wallets and gambling sites and exchanges and that is all.  Thus not to a regular person.So by default, whenever you click on receive tab on ledger live and click on the btc account you name it, it always displays the same receiving address each time?  How would you generate a new btc receiving address? Had thought nano ledger generate a new receiving address each time by default... but when i saw this receiving address, im positive i seen this address many times.Also could i copy and paste that btc address showing on my nano ledger receiving address into blockchair and it would display how much btc i have in that address?  is it very likely based on what i mentioned, the entire btc balance is in this btc receiving address?  Now im not even sure if my nano ledger ever showed a receiving address different from this one each time i get btc received?  Can someone here clarify this?  But since im withdrawing btc from one gambling site to nano ledger and then sending tiny amount of btc to another gambling site, is there much privacy concerns?  Can't imagine they would care much at all?  Then again, the people who process the btc cashouts most likely do no get paid much at all.Also does ledger live sometimes display your btc or other coins or balance incorrectly?  The balance is correct shown on ledger live but should i ever clear cache just to make sure?  Each time i open ledger live, it takes a short while to synchronize but does synchronize and the coin and balance seem correct.  Did recall a while back for some reason some old transactions on my ledger live history wasn't there and disappeared but clearing cache made those old transactions reappear.  Anyone had that happen a while back?  This was a long time ago.But right now, i want to know is this normal with the btc receiving address that shows to be one that i seen many times?  Why does it not generate another btc receiving address?  How do you make sure you have full access to your coins that shows on your ledger live?",

      "body": "That's not how it works. If you generate a new receiving address in Ledger Live and fund it with Bitcoin, the next time you try generating one in the same Bitcoin account, the software will display a new one. But for that to happen, the previous one needs to have received coins. If you just generate an address and never send Bitcoin to it, the next time you click on the button to get a new receiving address, Ledger Live will display the same one.  If you want to check if that particular address has ever received any coins, just enter it into a blockchain explorer. If you want to use different receiving addresses, or more than one because LL can only generate one at a time per Bitcoin account, just connect your Nano with Electrum, go to the addresses tab, and pick from one of the 20 unused receiving addresses displayed at the top.",

      "body": "Hi.  Well the thing is i am pretty sure i seen this receiving address before yesterday when i had this btc receiving address shown yesterday.  So is that possible? i meant when i check my previous transactions on ledger live which showed when i received btc from a site or me sending it to a site, i never saw the btc address that i saw yesterday generated on the nano ledger in any of my previous transactions in the FROM or TO.  That is normal right?  For example when i look at all the times i received btc to my nano ledger when looking at the ledger live history of transactions, there is a FROM and TO when you check each transaction.  FROM means the btc address that was used from the site that had sent me btc correct?  And the TO is the btc address that i had gave that site to send to and then they sent it to me? Because each time i received btc a while back from these sites, the btc i received would be added to my btc balance segwit account.  The thing is the last time i received btc to my nano ledger was months ago... and the time before that one was a bit before.  But when i check that transaction, i saw a different TO receiving address each time which is normal right?  i don't remember the btc receiving address that was generated to me last few times and then gave that btc address to the site for a withdraw...but if it shows the address in the TO as completely different, then its obviously not the btc receiving address that was displayed to me yesterday right?  Thus i gave those sites a different btc receiving address months ago when i requested btc from them?  i did not do any transaction yesterday and thus did not copy and paste that btc receiving address to the site i want to withdraw because i was confused why i am positive i seen that btc address before recently.  Does that make sense?So how do i check how many btc addresses i own in the nano ledger s that contains btc and how much btc is in each btc address?  For example with electrum years ago, all you had to do was go to look at the tab addresses and change addresses and you literally see you could have btc in like 25 different addresses and many could contain like 0.0005 btc whereas another one could be 0.5 btc.  So if you had them all up, it would be your electrum btc balance right?  How would i do this with the nano ledger s then?  Because all you see is your total btc balance in portfolio or accounts tab on ledger live.  Do you need to click on each receiving btc transaction on the latest operations to look at your history?  And if so, what do you need to check?  is it all the TO receiving btc addresses that shows in your latest operations for btc?  Then you add all the btc up?  Don't you also need to add up all the btc in all the FROM addresses transactions where you sent btc out as well?  What about the transaction id or that doesn't matter much here?  The FROM shouldn't matter since that is the address from the sender to you right?  i do see that each btc transaction shows the words bitcoin account segwit each time i sent or received btc previously to my nano ledger s when you want to view the details for each btc transaction.  Do you view each transaction in explorer? When i click on view in explorer, for some reason my antivirus program detects the site has dangerous?  Site goes to blockstream.info.  How do i check how many btc addresses i own that contain btc and how much btc in each address?",

I already explained that receiving address 1 has to be funded before Ledger Live will generate and display receiving address 2. It's logical that if you generate a new address, close the software, generate an address again, LL will display the same address in both cases. The first address never received any coins, you will be seeing it until some BTC is transferred to it. It's normal.I can't concentrate on your unnecessary walls of text. I will only answer what I remember reading it the first time. When you click on any transaction you received in LL, you will see the transaction history. No idea why you have problems understanding the information shown there. But there is also a link taking you to a blockchain explorer where you can see the addresses involved in the transaction. Click on it. Alternatively, connect, and open your wallet in Electrum and check the addresses tab. It will show you all funded addresses and the balances.To check your portfolio in Ledger Live, click on the \"Accounts\" tab. All your Bitcoin and altcoin accounts will be displayed there and the balances will be clearly shown for all of them.",

      "body": "Okay so i went and clicked on each of the oldest transactions in ledger live in latest operations.  This was when i sent btc from electrum in increments and did many of these transactions.  To make the math simple, say you sent 1 BTC each time say 5 different times from electrum to nano ledger and had nano ledger generate a new btc receiving address each time.  Assuming those were your only 5 transactions ever on your nano ledger, when you check the history of each transaction and copy and paste the TO Address on blockchain explorer, it would then show 1 BTC received and 0 BTC sent with a 1 BTC available balance on that btc address correct? The same would apply to those other btc receiving addresses correct and you know there is a 1 BTC balance in each of those 5 BTC addresses? Now say you done many transactions after that.  Let say many of them were you rece iv ing 0.06 btc and send ing around 0.05 btc etc where the BTC balance never goes below 5 BTC and thus it would seem any BTC that gets deducted from you nano ledger should not touch the old BTC you sent or ig inally... but thats now how it works right?  Thus, its not like a last in first out?  When you click on each of those receiving btc transactions when you sent btc from electrum to nano ledger, you check the FROM and TO.  You then copy and paste the TO Address because well that is the btc address that btc was sent from electrum to each btc receiving address in nano ledger.  But if you look at it on blockchain explorer, you would see then see how your old btc rece iv ing address that re ce ived one BTC now shows two transact ions and how another transact ion of you send ing 0.05 btc and now that one BTC  in one of those or ig inal btc addresses that received btc from electrum... now has not only went to another btc address... but now it got deducted 0.05 btc so that btc address has 0.95 BTC?  And when you look at all your old TO Receiving btc addresses when you first received btc from electrum 5 times, you see the total btc balance available of each would be 0?  Thus the btc in each of these addresses moved to another btc address because of new btc transact ions you did years later on?Made a very long detailed post in bold in my other thread which explains what i saw on blockchain explorer when i copied and pasted each To Address in the earliest transact ions i d id on ledger live when btc sent from electrum to nano ledger.   The portfolio and accounts on ledger live does show all the btc and alt co in accounts and balances but i wanted to know how come it doesn't show all the addresses where you have btc balance in... similar to like how electrum is.",

      "body": "So i am planning to do maybe two btc withdraws within the next few days and want advice here.  i will be requesting a btc withdraw from a gambling site soon either today or tomorrow.  Normally i would connect my nano ledger to my laptop and use ledger live and i click receive tab and choose the btc segwit account where the btc is and then it would generate a new btc address where i would copy and paste to that gambling site for btc withdraw  The issue here is this site doesn't do withdraws quick and they take a few days.  Normally that is no issue as i wait few days for the btc to arrive.  However, i am also planning on trading some of my online gamblings funds or neteller/moneybookers for someone else's btc, but im not sure when that would happen.  Example i request btc from the gambling site by providing them the new btc receive address generated by ledger live today.  However, this site would take a few days to send the btc because that gambling site takes few days to process btc withdraws.  Now if i want to trade funds with someone else for their btc.... thus the time period is anytime after i requested a btc withdraw from the gambling site and when i actually receive it, thus few days after that, then how would i even generate another btc address for that person i would be trading with?  Example, i request btc withdraw from gambling site on Tuesday, and the time they will process the transaction will be Thursday most likely and that is when the btc will most likely be sent to me.Now if i were to do a trade with someone for their btc, from anytime after i requested the btc withdraw on Tuesday from the gambling site, till before i receive the btc on Thursday from the gambling site, what btc address would i give that person that would be sending me btc?  Because when i go on ledger live and generate a btc receiving address, it will be the same exact one that was generated earlier which i sent to that gambling site correct since the gambling site does not start the withdraw process yet for another few days?  Because even though i gave that btc address to that gambling site for withdraw, well they are not going to process it for few days which mean ledger live would give me the same btc receiving address correct?  And thus few days later, i will receive the btc to the same btc address from the gambling site, so two transactions to the same btc address because of this situation?  Or is there a way to not have this happen?  Of course if i do trade with someone first and receive the btc would work... since after that, ledger live would generate a new btc receiving address when i give the gambling site a new btc receiving address.  Or i do a trade with the other person after i receive the btc from that gambling site.  But anyway i can generate another btc receive address in this strange situation?",

That's unfortunate. It seems that Ledger Live is the poorest wallet in terms of user experience since it doesn't provide its user even with the most basic functionality when it comes to bitcoin transactions. Then why is this wallet so popular? You should probably consider switching to a more user-friendly wallet like Electrum which doesn't hide essential information from users and allows for creation of unlimited amount of payment requests on demand.Or you can try the following guide which explains how to regenerate a receive address using some technical tricks for advanced users: https://help.vault.ledger.com/Content/accounts/acc_receive.html",
