Disguised as a conceptual art project, theLimited Edition pieces of The Times Traveler contain an intricate crypto puzzle which hasbeen carefully embedded into their design. Whomever is skilled enough to find the secretsand successfully unlocks the key, claims all of the BTC locked away in the canvases! Thewinner earns the BTC and bragging rights, and every contestant own's a 100+ yearfade resistant conceptual art canvas with a very unique history attached.In actuality, each Limited Edition piece is in fact a \"one off\" that has been printed from it'sown unique source. You only need one Limited Edition piece to unlock the key of The TimesTraveler, however, having a prototype or proof may help! The best part about our cryptopuzzle contest is that you do not need to destroy any of the pieces to unlock the secrets ofThe Times Traveler, it is hidden in plain sight!CoolStorage.org Presents...\"The Times Traveler\" Limited Edition16x20 Gallery Wrapped LOADED Canvas Crypto PuzzleWho will discover the secrets and unlock the key to The Times Traveler? Â Only TIME will tell! Â CONTEST RULES:No up close images of the canvas posted on the internet.This could compromise the integrity of the contest.If one of the contest pieces is re-sold it must be made known in this threadby the seller confirming the new owner to be added as a replacement contestant.CONSULTATION:If you think you've discovered a secret but want confirmation, please usethe CoolStorage.org EMSG App.  Â PM your EMSG linkto consult with me, and I will confirm and/or deny what you've found.ONE CLUE:There will be one CLUE posted here in the form of a riddle. Â THREE WISHES:The contestants shall have a total of THREE WISHES to use at any time during the competition.Contestants should discuss any ideas for wish requests to agree upon in this thread.Once a WISH is discussed it can then be VOTED on by contestants.There will be a (1) week voting period for contestants to submit their vote here,otherwise the vote is fore-fitted and we tally the total votes submitted by contestants.Certain wishes will not be allowed, like a wish for more wishes, for example.WISH EXAMPLES:I had intended on keeping the public address of the canvases a secret, andallow whomever solves the puzzle to reveal the grand prize, however,if the contestants were to vote on a wish revealing that and the votepassed, the public address of the canvases would be posted in thread.Perhaps you are all stumped and need an additional CLUE, make a WISH. Â Maybe you all VOTE to ask a technical question about the puzzle?How many secrets in total? Are there areas of the canvas we should ignore?Maybe you decide to VOTE for help from all collectible community members This could mean the contest winner ends up not be an original contestant,but if it is your WISH and the VOTE passes, it is done.THE CONTESTANTS:Icedminerjonesminerjonesgarciaor2002ragilabXYZoMrCryptHodlEst2013pinky1234DernosteGeoMoparMiningLLCHookzup1Hookzup1raghavsoodThank you for your support everyone!

Alright back to examination table ðŸ˜‰Right on buddyÂ   the OP has a section on the 3 wishes and some examples, but let me clarify this for everyone just in case. You are all competing against one another to solve the puzzle and win the grand prize, however, contestants will need to work together to use a wish.Discuss what questions to use a wish on, then vote on what question to ask, and after one week the votes are tallied and the question with the most votes is answered.If there are any other questions about this, please do not hesitate to ask, thanks everyone!Â   Quote from: Dernoste on September 10, 2022, 05:00:07 PMso we scratch?Hey buddyÂ   I was just having a little fun showing off our bonus round scratch off game.
