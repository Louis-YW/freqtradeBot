      "body": "Death to me a private matter but with today’s technology, social media shares information instantaneous.I think the videos posted of Takeoff’s murder is unsympathetic. The lack of concern is devastating to family and friends with posting his corpse on social media.Imagine if this happened before 2000, the man could rest in peace and privacy. I wish that people can just stop and think before posting. One should have dignity and respect for family and friends.",
