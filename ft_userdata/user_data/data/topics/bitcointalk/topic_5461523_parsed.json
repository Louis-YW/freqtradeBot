I have heard about PGP before, but I never tried to learn about it. It seems like the signature we generate from Bitcoin wallet software like Electrum. I followed his post. Quote from: SeriouslyGiveaway on July 31, 2023, 02:41:56 PMA Tutorial for Beginners to PGP - Pretty Good Privacy (University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown).But it seems the tutorial is outdated. From where can I download the PGP software and other tools (if required)? http://www.pgpi.didisoft.com/download/ Is it the official website of PGP that Phil Zimmerman developed? Or do we have multiple software? I don't want to rely on Google search results.",
