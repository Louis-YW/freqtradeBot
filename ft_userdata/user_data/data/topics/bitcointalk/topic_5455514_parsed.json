Will be hard during summer season. Any advice to keep them running cold except maintenance ofcource?",

I am almost certain that no Antminer 17 series miner could run for over an hour at anything near 110-120c, let alone 135c.Honestly, I don't have a source it only came to my mind because maybe they are similar to S9 Chips that have 135 max temps.However, I recently realized after checking the Skot project called Bitaxe that the max temp shouldn't be more than 90c my reference is the temp he share on his Twitter, The PCB temp and the Braiins auto mode dangerous temp.I couldn't find any data so this is just my own guess collected from other user's posts.",

      "body": "The S9 chips are at least two generations behind, and are different.This happens a lot with CPUs and GPUs, some can take a temperature, next model has a much lower limit. So what you did with S9 does not apply with S17 or S19.The S17 tends to desolder itself so i bet it would get damaged from that, way before the chip real limit.If you want to believe the manufacturer, PCB is roughly 15° less than CHIP and you can use that as reference, so 75+15=90 max.I wouldn't trust it, let the miner slow down itself with dynamic power scaling using either default temperature values or lower.",
