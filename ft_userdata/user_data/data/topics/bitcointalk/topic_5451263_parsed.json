No wonder they are easily ban because they have channeled their efforts for easy profits. But believe me or not, these sets of people are quickly swiped off by bear market and they can't be able to watch their investment sink down nd I believe they will hastily sells off out of panic.",

      "body": "The sole purpose of bitcoin is to act as a payment gateway or alternative for fiat. But due to its volatility people can get profits off it either through holding for long, which is considered the safest option or through trading. It is not false that one could actually earn $50 or more daily on bitcoin through trading although it depends on the amount and the depth of your knowledge or experience on trading. One cannot invest less than $1k and be expecting such returns. This has actually been the mindset of most newbies coming into cryptocurrency. Newbies have associated bitcoin with all those pump and dump coins that could make a 1000x in a day but they also haven’t compared its risk. So it is normal reading there threads on how to get such off bitcoin.

When we back on bitcoin white paper, in the title bold write: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, I don't know why people, especially newbies out there still ask the profit. A main goal of bitcoins is Cash System not investment which can rises your money over 100X, 1000x or million x. If newbie or any people create thread how to make profit $10, $100, $1000 daily with bitcoin, I think what we should do is give them bitcoin white paper. And the problem finish.

      "body": "Wanting multiple profits, I think all bitcoin investors also really want to get it, because having the desire to get big profits is a natural thing for all investors in bitcoin. But many people, especially beginners who invest in bitcoin, want big profits and want to achieve them in a very fast time. Such a desire is not wrong, but in my opinion it is not quite right. Because basically if you want to get big profits from bitcoin, it takes a long process. Because behind all that there must be a long process, which must be passed by every investor in bitcoin. So beginners should know this, don't become an investor in bitcoin, but don't want to go through all the processes and stages.I honestly think there are a lot of beginners starting to invest in bitcoin, but most probably don't learn about it first. So the result is that many beginners act and think inappropriately when investing in bitcoin. But I can still understand, if it is a beginner, and my message is for beginners, don't stay too long in an inaccurate thought like that, as soon as possible you have to be more able to understand and study bitcoin as a whole, so that inaccurate thinking can be fast removed.So the point is to be able to enjoy the process more, don't want to see the results right away.",
