  "content": "As it becomes abundantly clear that I cannot be everywhere by myself, I am looking for a blogger who is willing to write developer-focused content on NotATether.com.When I say partner, I'm not referring to investment - read on.This is not like my previous offer. You will only be writing articles, but you will not be paid for them immediately. Instead, we will try to monetize the site with ad revenue (eventually), and find an arrangement to share the revenue.As you can see, I have done a complete redesign of the website and as a result, most of the irrelevant content has been hidden but still accessible.What I am doing at the moment:- Building tools. Although there are no web apps on the site right now, I have figured out a quick and easy way to create them and embed them on the site.- Running the Youtube channel and creating videos for it: https://www.youtube.com/@notatether9583- The Background Eraser service, a relatively new addition to the portfolio that hasn't been included on the site yet: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445228.0- and of course, I'm running the whole backend, wordpress installation, and domain.I prefer working with reputable forum members who have some time to spare. That is not an absolute requirement, but in any case, make sure you have time to spare. Because this will demand a couple hours/week.Interested people can reply on this thread and expect a PM from me with further details.Please only apply if you can write 900-1500 word articles about coding & tech, with good grammar, without my intervention. Last time I tried this, the amount of hand-holding I had to do took a lot of time away from other stuff.I am not expecting SEO-optimized articles - but I need people who can write with their mind.I hope we can grow the site together.",
