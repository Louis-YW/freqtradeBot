  "content": "Hi everyone, it is adviced to be highly careful and vigilant with some sites as well as metamask right now, most especially if you are a metamask user on pc, some sites we have previously visited, like etherscan.io, dextools, coingecko etc, have been said to be compromised, visiting any of this mentioned sites forcefully prompt metamask to persistently ask you to connect to an nftapes.win site, with a false claim that you won an NFT....Please do not connect, cancel or close the prompt as many times as it appear, it's a scam.",

You really should get out of crypto since that is the equivalent of giving someone who randomly calls you up access to your bank account.Harsh by true.-Dave",

Even with lots of shady/malicious ads on Google services, google rarely sued.Oh yeah, you're right, i almost forgot that even as big as google and facebook who has millions of users that might engage on those ads have these kind of shits yet this companies still accepting such kind of ads. How much more on just a mere fraction of users who from the partnered website of coinzilla.",

But it's also the users responsibility to read the transaction details before approving it and clicking the sign button.I hope not many users were affected!",

I highly recommend to have at least uBlock Origin installed in your browsers as it does the job it's supposed to do. Mine are Avira Browser safety and Kaspersky if you are not using an adblocker you should start using one I get at least 50 ads blocked by these two anti-viruses, it's alarming if you are not using any and you are involved in Cryptocurrency, these coded ads are created intentionally to hack your wallet so better safeguard your coins by using a good anti-virus or ad blocks Ublock is free and reliable.",

Even big companies like Google are approving various types of fake ads which are very dangerous for crypto users. And if this continues, it will create a dangerous situation for new crypto users.
