  "content": "This is something that I can't still understand, why is there so much pressure to tip in restaurant, in taxi, tip to the delivery guy, etc.They are doing their job, right? If they are getting low salary from the company and can't live without tips, that's not my fault. The business model that restaurants have is that they pay very low salaries to their employees and get most of the profit in their own pocket. Why is it socially accepted in western countries? Especially in the USA and Canada? Instead of social pressure to leave tips, why isn't there pressure on business owners to pay them more? Why is it socially accepted that pig businessman should get high profit, work his employees on low wage and the customer should compensate it? Why do we tip people who work in restaurant, delivery, barbershop, etc instead of people who work in constructions? I have never seen anyone tipping to someone who works as a manual laborer. Do you guys really think that manual labor is easier than being a waitress? Or a delivery guy? Or do you think that they are paid higher? Manual laborers are working very hard with very little wages, their wages can be smaller than the wages of people in service industry. Also, working in manual labor is very dangerous for health and most of them have health problem while they aren't offered insurance and other benefits.It's unfair that people in service industry are tipped but people in manual labor - not. And if the manual laborer somehow managed to go in restaurant, some shit waitress will get mad if he won't tip her.",

      "body": "I can't confirm your statement that \"social pressure to leave tips\" exists in the US & CA since I don't live there. But, assuming that it's correct, I disagree with this culture. A tip shouldn't be mandatory, but as a gratitude for great service other than simply saying \"thank you.\" Before thinking about it deeply, I was sold on the idea that giving tip money is always good and felt good about it. But the days of me tipping is over. Now, in most cases, I only say thanks and save the tip money for other purchases in the same shop if I like their service, or tipping if the service gets extra personal. It's the best way to keep the business run and profitable. Tip money is an unnecessary overhead that can make a business less profitable in the long run and generally get a bad customer experience. Hence, many service companies now ban tipping for the same reason in the country I reside.",

Just buy food and learn to cook.I don't use food delivery services because I'm not lazy enough to just sit in my home, instead of going to the store and buy some food.I've never lived in a western country and I don't know about such \"social pressure\" of giving tips to waitresses and food delivery people.Maybe there is such social pressure, but giving tips shouldn't be mandatory. The restaurant industry is really competitive and the profits margins are low, so the restaurant owners give low salaries to the waitresses. Perhaps in the not-so-distant future, the waitresses will be replaced by robots, so the customers won't have to give tips.",

If you pay your bill with LN, then theoretically you could tip the waiter the same way, which wouldn't be a bad promotion for Bitcoin as a currency.",

Pizza car maintenance is high.   Many don't bother and buy utter crap and drive it in to the ground.   Can be cheaper to replace crap car with another crap car then to fix them.  So they also get to spend time replacing the car.  Tip your fucking driver!  Be happy hes even working!   He might even be an asshole but he gets to deal with shitheads all day long on the road and at the door.  saying to him... but you got your delivery fee right?",

Even if there are rules about tips, don't they all mean things that are mandatory to give? Moreover, this is a cultural problem where culture is thick with western habits, they do it because it is considered a form of concern. If we look at the other side of the construction workers, of course they rarely even never interact with customers or provide services. Let's say they work in the open field, conditions that never bring in customers to serve.",

If the industry doesn't pay well enough, shouldn't there be lobbyists that will help the plight of the workers that are \"underpaid\" and needs to receive tips to compensate? I understand there is nothing mandatory about it, but the fact that this culture is so spread far and wide in the United States makes a foreign visitor feel bad and ashamed that he/she will be forced to tip even if it's out of the budget. Then again, perhaps it's a form of a personal and direct acknowledgment on a job well done for the server, the driver, or whomever that did something for you, and I'm okay with that. But there are some exceptions though. There are restaurants there in the US that make it seem like tips are mandatory and doesn't directly give the tips to those who actually did the service for their customers. That's just straight up hustling the workers and being greedy for the restaurant's operations managers part, and I guess that's what ticks people off in the tipping culture there in the US.",

Therefore, your attitude towards how delivery people should be treated is completely opposite to mine - although in recent years, food delivery in my country has changed because they are delivered by young people on bicycles/electric scooters for companies that have appeared as intermediaries between fast food chains and customers. I'm not a fan of fast food, so I don't use such services, but when I see these young people delivering in all weather conditions, I would be very happy to give them a tip in addition to what they will officially receive for each delivery.",
