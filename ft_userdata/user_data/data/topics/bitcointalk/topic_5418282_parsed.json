  "content": "I was just browsing some random stuff on Google and then this appeared on my search. See image below.It's shown at the top search and I'm sure that many of us know that Google don't really filter these phishing and scam websites. After I've seen the ad, I'm aware of it that it is sketchy and tried to visit it. And this is what it has shown me, the website is asking for these two wallets to connect to them. I'm safe since I don't have those wallets installed on my browser.So there it goes, not so unknown conclusion that many have been hacked through this. The forceful asking for the users to connect to their Metamask, Wallet Connect and other wallets before accessing into these fake websites and services lead the victims into stealing their funds.And that's why for newbies and even those folks that have been long in the community, be careful. This isn't just the one and there are other websites that they are copying. For example, the popular crypto websites like exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, etc.) and other wallet services aside from Coinmarketcap.Let's report these suspicious and harmful phishing links, not just this one but the others too through the link below:Quote from: BitMaxz on October 25, 2022, 05:12:55 PMI think we need a volunteer here to report them to Google below - https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/?hl=enIf more people report it I'm sure this domain will remove immediately from their Google ads and it also help our community to fall into this trap.The links below are the phishing links that has been also caught by other forum members, if you've got spare time, let's report all of them.

Getting rid of trackers by using brave is a good start but you have one of the biggest suggestions you're into crypto if brave declares itself as brave browser to the websites you're connecting to (unless they've managed to mask that). Don't trust any ads with funds too even if they look legit. It doesn't take much time to retype a Web link or search via multiple search engines to see if what you have found is the legit site before parting with any information. Even buying something with a card, it's much safer to use a site that's trusted and searchable than to use one that's findable from.an ad.I think these sorts of scam trends are generally ones picking on people who are either tired or distracted (not concentrating too) as a lot of users who know what they're doing under normal circumstances would just reject or close such popups (just closing comes with its own problems too because then you probably still have it as a pending request you might accidentally click).",

Technically, this can be avoided when one has got to learn about those adblockers or is a checker of URLs and attentive to detail for spellings and also active in the community knowing how these attackers come but, they're not targeting us. As for the browser wallets like Metamask, I think most users would agree about can be used conveniently but they ignore that fact that phishers are targeting them because of how many they are.Quote from: gantez on October 25, 2022, 02:14:57 PMFor record, this is the website of https://coinmarketcap.com/.I do save such web address on my home screen to avoid doubt or to be confused on the address.

I remember there's someone from the forum, I can't remember that guy exactly that has became a victim of the same attack and then he admitted that he's tired at that time and haven't checked the letters correctly. These scammers uses that unfortunate moment and sort of psychological factor to trick their victims.Quote from: Renampun on October 25, 2022, 04:59:12 PMThe scammer uses a phishing trick to capture people who rarely open CoinMarketcapTrue and literally newbies that aren't aware that there's no need to connect wallets just for accessing CMC.
