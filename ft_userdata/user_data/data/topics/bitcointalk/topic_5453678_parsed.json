      "body": "I am not really sure how taxation will reduce the green energy production because most of the countries do not levy heavy tolls / sometime zero taxes on the green energy products. Not sure what is the structure in the USA but that has got to be free one. Apart from this, miner and electricity is one of greatest relationship one see because nothing works without that. USA electricity cost is already skyrocketed and with the time it is going to be more than that per unit consumed. The reason is short fall of electricity production due to high consumptions in the countries like California, New York which are main hub of all. Anyways, Miners are not giving much preference to the US. There are number of nations which are already providing green energy with no taxes, fresh environment and much more. So there it is, more ways to do it.",

      "body": "Miners are profit driven. If the cost of power + 30% is still less then the base cost of power in some location then it is in another location then all other things being equal (labor, rent, internet costs, insurance, etc.) then miner will mine there.Upstate NY is a prime example. Labor is expensive, but hydro power is cheap, rent is cheap, insurance is average. So even without other intensives a lot of miners moved there.There have been a few posts about Mississippi & Missouri passing bills to help protect miners. But, we are not hearing about miners moving to those locations since the cost of power is only OK at best.There are some remote locations with just about free geothermal power. But there is no good multi-homed reliable high speed internet and good luck getting people to work in the middle of nowhere. -Dave",

The same way a tax on alcohol in Canada  will produce a drought in Egypt!The whole ecosystem has evolved and new players have entered, most of the largest companies don't care about anything else than profits and their shareholders, they will say whatever it takes to protect their business and avoid taxation even if they know they are wrong.Tesla or Enron, Mara or Bitmain no difference.Quote from: Flexystar on May 24, 2023, 05:32:50 PMAnyways, Miners are not giving much preference to the US. The hashrate distribution and Foundry share might prove otherwise.Second, it doesn't matter how much incentive other countries have, they need the capacity and there are few in the world with enough to spare, and short of Canada and Russia I don't see anyone able to get a huge chunk of what the US has.Quote from: DaveF on May 24, 2023, 05:50:08 PMThere have been a few posts about Mississippi & Missouri passing bills to help protect miners.

The industry is based on short and medium-term profit.

Automakers won't suffer a loss if they change the engine in a car, but how will they deal with the pollution that comes from the production of these cars?New policy : 1 family 1 car.I don't think that such policy will ever be a reality because what will you do with those vehicles that are used for transport, and what about the ones that are mainly used for industrial purposes? There are many measures to stop the pollution of the environment, but the humans won't follow any rules when they are earning profits and enjoying their life by driving their own vehicles.The Bitcoin mining contributes very less pollution to the environment and yet it's impact is very high because with that little amount of emission the miners are generating a currency that's very useable and could help many people to get employed in future. It's a savior to the ones who want to be free from the restrictions of the governments and they want to spend their money according to their own will.I know that pollution should be controlled because if it reaches high levels than our planet can face some bad events, but the environmental scientists should find a proper way to fix that problem rather than putting the whole blame on the miners. The best measures to protect the environment is to replace all the vehicles that operate on fossil fuels to the ones that should run with rechargeable batteries.That way the emissions will be less and within few years the environment will be safe from the air pollution problem. But, there isn't a single solution for the problem because the population of the world is increasing, and they also contribute to the environmental pollution. It's better for the scientists to find an alternative way where those useless gasses should be utilized for other purposes rather than polluting the environment.I know that thing isn't an easy thing to do, but with many trials the project can be done successfully and the environment of the planet earth can be safe from any kind of pollutions. I think there should be some kind of devices that could capture the CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases, and then convert them back into biofuels. I believe such thing can be a reality in future, but the scientists should definitely work on that.",

Plain stupid as far as I am concerned, so now that green b.s out of the way, let's talk \"economy\".Demand for energy is great for the economy, show me one economy that prospered without increasing demand for energy, or a country that has reduced its power consumption by a large portion without shrinking its economy and I will change my mind.",

Yes, there are and if they actually release that tax law, they'll clearly see that the number of such countries will increase, there are developing countries that are willing to offer low taxes, cheap electricity and cheap labor to these business owners. Not related to this theme but overall, if you think about it, you'll analyze how funny and painful at the same time how governments leave loopholes for business owners to avoid taxes but average citizen has no chance to escape it. Companies can register their businesses in offshores and pay less taxes, taxes just make it super hard for average person to start a business.",

If the USA governments tax miners with as between 2-9%, that will be fine and acceptable for everyone. So, by keeping low tax rates, government will still collect money from miners and will keep this business in their country instead of collecting 0 money and losing mining power.

If the USA governments tax miners with as between 2-9%, that will be fine and acceptable for everyone.Now we're talking numbers, you see, that's why I am asking you to read the financial statements again.You said 2-9% is acceptable, not please check how much have those companies paid till now, cause you're going to be in one hell of a surprise!Quote from: Synchronice on May 30, 2023, 03:27:10 PMYes, when you are the United States Of America, you have to remain top in everything, including mining.Why? Seems like none of the G7 is interested in that and we can only find two G20 countries that could replace the US if this stops being an option.What major breakthrough is Bitcoin mining? I would have understood if it would be making the chips, but just hosting gear it's nothing out of the ordinary! And if we talk about revenue, the US could buy more coins that are mined in a day just by mooring one carrier rather than having it sail around the globe!",
