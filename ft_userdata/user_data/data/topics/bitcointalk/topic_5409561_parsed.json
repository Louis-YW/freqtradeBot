This will allow the project to become the leader of the crypto industry for all Gala participants to create the most efficient business among the largest projects. And in the future, the Gala token will be able to show an excellent result.",

With that kind of development, I don't think it's enough to push a project on such price with a lot of total supply circulating in the market, additionally there's also a problem with their ecosystem that needs to be address first. GALA is one of the top performer games last year, and right now they are still struggling better for them to address those issues first so they can retain their loyal investors and attract more in the future.",

They keep on innovating and finding ways to broaden the length of possibilities in injecting cryptocurrencies to where they are good at. Until now, I am playing Townstar and it doesn't even get me bored. Gala Music and Movies are unknown to me right now, but their gaming platform is way better than other NFT games that I encountered and that's why I stayed. I cannot find a better one yet.",

I dont see any slacking with their development.Nothing is impossible. Check all basis for a $1 price if feasible. Marketcap based on circulating supply and its correspondening volume on exchange. If a strong project is destined to go there then its not impossible. Development and series of upgrade is important on a certain project and use case is being polished. Tokenomics played a huge role on progress and if the ecosystem is alive and all in places. Even at higher price you could see gala tokens rise.",

The article[1] is in February 2022, so there might be some less marketing since I haven't seen it or anything. If they manage to take over the different industries, they can be more than $1.

Like most projects around games, it doesn't last too long. For example, the Theta token project, which until now has a lower token price.",

With the price now at $0.06, I think it will need more support from investors and traders to increase to $1. The highest GALA price was $0.8 9 months ago, while the current price is the lowest GALA price. So it will at least take more time to raise the price unless there is a pump from the team or investors that will attract a lot of traders to seek profit from the GALA. So if you have already invested in GALA, you have to be patient for a while.",
