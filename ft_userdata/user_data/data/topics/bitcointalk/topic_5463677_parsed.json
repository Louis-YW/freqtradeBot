What's the plan from there? You're just gonna grab a cheap \"crypto exchange\" script from somewhere like Codecanyon, slap it on your domain, and call it a day?Yes. I'm a bit skeptical, but I hope you've got a solid plan to make this \"service\" truly work for all users. Looking forward to seeing how it pans out next month!",

But if you wanted to make P2E platform then you need less money plus the chances of getting success in this service are more and i do not like lottery and lending platforms but let's see what is on your mind.

I won't discourage you at all, but you must have to have a proper plan for the launch of that product because without proper plan and marketing you would be only wasting your time and money. Any product would be good for you, but you must keep in mind that you won't be able to make money from that products anytime soon. I would say that you'll have to do every step of product launching in a professional way to avoid any kind of failures.Launching of your own crypto-exchange isn't going to be a simple task and for something like that a user needs a lot of time. one month is a very short amount of time and something like crypto exchange may not be built properly in that short time duration. I would recommend you to purchase your own domain first if your intention is to launch your own crypto exchange because the first step is always the hardest one and in this case the first step it the purchasing of a good domain name that can be used to present the exchange. An exchange may need some good amount of time, but it's also possible to creating an exchange within a month. However, there won't be a lot of features in a exchange like that.",

Serious dedication is required, and you don't seem to be able to manage three complex and unfamiliar ideas at the same time. Everything you listed above is already seen and the market is crowded with similar successful or less successful businesses. As FatFork says, your desire to start it in the next month only shows that you have not properly understood the complexity of what you are talking about, and that shows your, to put it mildly, unprofessionalism.",

But, that whole casino fiasco in his past? First impressions count, after all.So, to the OP, here is a piece of advice: Make it good, like really good. It doesn't matter what you do, as long as it is worth the effort. Don't be satisfied with a half-product; those kinds of things never hit the mark. Your audience, your potential users - they can tell when something is slapped together versus when it is been crafted with care. It is not just about throwing stuff out there and hoping it sticks; it is about nailing every detail, making sure it works like a charm, and delivering something that people actually want and need.",
