      "body": "Is this confirmed news by Freebitco.in? As an old member of Freebitcoin, I have made a nice profit back in 2019 but I doubt the new websites may offer the same amount of free claims on a monthly basis. What is main difference between Freebitcoin and other free faucet casinos for you? Ofc, many users miss those good old days P.S: Just checked the countdown, looks legit as usual, nothing wrong trying our luck again",

All I did was make a piece of art to celebrate freebitco's success in the space .I think there's a language barrier going on here, because I had a difficult time understanding what you are trying to say.I personally think that giving away 200,000 dollars at the frequency they give it out is truly an astonishing feat. Nothing else to that.Finally, I asked some questions to facilitate discussion, as I want to hear the opinions of other like-minded bitcoiners.For old-timers or old members of this forum then it is really that impossible that they wouldn't know about Freebitco and yes out of those early years even up to now on which they are really giving out that service whichgamblers do really love and this is why even upto these years where loyal users do really still engage with this platform.Im not sure on what are the changes when it comes into their faucet considering that they've been known for because of this faucet thing way back and then becomes bigger until it do expand out its business and offered others which they could possibly give out.When it comes to bonuses and promotions then they are the ones who do able to have that Lambo jackpot prize on their lottery.",

I have tried several faucets and such, but almost all of them are not the real, while some actually gives you satoshis, it'll take a long time for you accumulate enough satoshis to withdraw.Back then I remembered, it was early 2017 that year when I won the pot money of the roulette, that was also the first time I have become a member of this forum. Although I have won only a couple of bucks around $10, it was sti helpful for me, coz it paved the way on my trading adventures. I made it my initial trading investment, and as far as I can remember that tiny bit of satoshi reached $500 after practicing trading with stratis and xrp. By the way I started my trading adventures on poloniex, cheers to those who knew that platform.",

I checked my account, and there was \"Earn BTC\" which I didn't realize since when.Users will follow the freebitcoin business transition and use as they serve. When I first came to claim sats every hour, slowly glanced at several betting options that were increasingly varied. To be honest I have gambled more on the site in the past and only used the faucet rewards.",

I thought it was a good way to earn, but considering how paltry it was and how impatient I am, I just used the amount I get to gamble on their site when I can back then lmao.
