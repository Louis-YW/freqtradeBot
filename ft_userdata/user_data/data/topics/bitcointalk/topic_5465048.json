Apparently it doesn't, it just protect the app on a UI level. Regardless, biometrics are probably  not the way to go by it.

IMO if you are using a good device like iPhone or Samsung Galaxy then face unlock or fingerprint scanner should not be an issue. As we know those two brands have the best security & safety feature. You still can add pin code with the finger print scanner to add an extra layer of security. I haven't seen any mobile wallet integrating face unlock feature yet. If you know such a mobile wallet then do share here.",

I agree that this method is even less secure than fingerprint protection, but also both methods can be very easily abused in various situations. Whether it is a physical attack in which the attacker will unlock your device without any problems, or one of your family members will use your face or finger while you are sleeping and peek into your device.When it comes to mobile wallets, we always have the option of additional protection for each app on the device with a PIN or additional password, so that even if someone manages to unlock the device, they still cannot access our wallet without additional actions. Therefore, I would recommend for everyone who uses Android to additionally protect all apps that contain sensitive information - and information on how to do this on different devices can be found at the following link -> How to Lock Apps on Android Phones in 2023.",

Password combinations have always been proven to be the best means of security.Face unlock and that of finger print are just fast means of unlocking one's device, saving you the stress of not typing your passwords from beginning to end, but what has an advantage has a high disadvantage most times. Unless one activates both fingerprint and face unlock on their device, they should never give it access to their wallets. Wallets always make it optional, not a compulsory or mandatory kind of thing.You can have finger print and face unlock but still not use them on your wallet app, and you can only use your wallet combination pin to access your wallet combination. But if phone security is compromised, it's only a matter of time before the wallet becomes compromised, as with a phone password, anything can be activated and modified.",

Because then there is a higher risk that an attacker will not only steal the funds, but also harm you in order to gain access to them. For me, it's better if they try to guess the password than cut off my fingers.As for the accidental loss of the phone, I would say that a regular password is enough. It is unlikely to be hacked quickly anyway, and as soon as you discover the loss, you will have time to transfer all funds to a new, not compromised address.",
