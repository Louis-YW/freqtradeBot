These services typically require a fee and have limited capacity, so they may not always available but you can try.or maybe try to wait for the transaction to be dropped from the mempool, if your transaction has not been confirmed after a certain amount of time ( usually 72 hours ), it will be dropped from the mempool and returned to your wallet. you can try sending the transaction again with a higher fee. also try contacting wallet or exchange support which you sent the transaction.

Isnt that a bit too muchIf the tx is 550 bytes and you paid a total of ~20000 sats, that makes it around 40 sats per byte which is far below the average required fee at the moment. And yeah, you have to pay ~100 sats per byte according to the estimation from mempool space. It's not too much, you possibly have no idea how Bitcoin transaction fee works. It's too much for usual time but not now as the network is congested right now. However, it can increase or decrease within a few hours. If you are in a hurry, you have no other choice but to pay the fee and if you don't hurry, you can wait.One tip for the future- Always consolidate all the transactions when the fee is 1 sat per byte. With single input and single output, your transaction size will be too low and you don't have to pay a huge fee. Learn more about it here- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2848987.0",

It depends on what you mean by \"set effectively\", let us take it to mean tx priority or how quickly you desire your transaction to be confirmed by miners. You can set the fee rate in any way you want, even as low as 1sat/vbyte and if the mempool is not congested your transaction will be confirmed after sometime. So to \"set it effectively\" is to pay enough fees if you want your transaction confirmed fast, and to pay low fees if you have time on your hand. To add a little more to it, your transaction fee is mainly calculated on the size of your transaction, so you should try to consolidate your UTXO's, so you would pay a lower tx fee with whatever fee rate you use.",
