From user YogeeQuote from: Yogee on May 24, 2022, 10:58:47 PMThere was a report last year about Tether's reserves but the problem was it's conducted by an audit firm called Cayman. Tether opened their books to them as part of their compliance but you cannot really rely on reports released by another shady company can you? Why did they not seek the expertise of top audit companies like Ernst and Young or the PwC?Here's their reserve breakdown as reported by Coindesk,- Cash & Cash Equivalents & Short-term deposits & Commercial paper: 75.85%- Secured Loans: 12.55%- Corporate Bonds, Funds & Precious metals: 9.96%- Other investments: 1.64% From CNBC about the NYC Lawsuit - Ryan Browne - Feb 21st, 2021 - *Note that their investigation was highly limited in scope.* QuoteThe state’s top law enforcement official had been investigating the firms over allegations that they moved hundreds of millions of dollars to cover up the apparent loss of $850 million of commingled client and corporate funds. Tether and Bitfinex — a popular digital currency exchange — are owned by the same company, Bitfinex.QuoteNew York Attorney General Letitia James’ office says it found that Tether sometimes held no reserves to back its cryptocurrency’s dollar peg. It said that, from mid-2017, the company had no access to banking and misled clients about liquidity issues.In a 2019 filing, the attorney general’s office said that Bitfinex handed $850 million to a Panama entity called Crypto Capital without disclosing it to investors. Executives at Bitfinex and Tether then allegedly engaged in a series of transactions that opened up Tether’s cash reserves to Bitfinex.“Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered-up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines,” James said in a statement Tuesday.“Tether’s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie,” she added.“These companies obscured the true risk investors faced and were operated by unlicensed and unregulated individuals and entities dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system.” Accounting Firm Report Card - Coindesk by: Helene Braun - March 30, 2021 QuoteTo be clear, an attestation is not the same thing as an audit. The latter is designed to look for potential risks, while an attestation only evaluates whether the data being examined by the auditor is accurate. However, no stablecoin issuer has been able to secure an audit, including companies regulated by U.S. entities like the New York Department of Financial Services. In other words, the attestation puts Tether on par with stablecoin issuers such as USDC’s Centre, GUSD’s Gemini or PAX’s Paxos, at least when it comes to financial clarity. Coindesk Report about Moore Cayman (Auditor) - now known as MHA Cayman - Jan 26th, 2022 QuoteFRC is looking at MHA's audits of the financial statements of MRG Finance UK for 2018 and 2019, ahead of a planned shakeup of the nation's audit market, according to the FT. MHA is a subsidiary of Baker Tilly International, the 11th-largest auditor of London-listed companies by market value, according to the FT, quoting Adviser Rankings.",

The day of reckoning will arrive soon enough. Maybe a few more years before this speculative prophecy comes to fruition. USDT is everything crypto is supposed to be not. Tether's basically got all the fiat issues of the dollar it's notionally pegged to, but then with additional dimension of them being allowed to print tether that doesn't even correspond to a dollar. Even more worrying is htf they managed to become unpegged from the dollar and be forced to rely on (mystery) paper. If you've printed ~ $75 billion worth and can manage to locate a backed investment that pays 0.1% on your saved dollars - that's still $75 million a year to run your company and buy everyone a lambo with, each year, forever.You get the impression that they thought \"not good enough\" and overlooked their entire purpose.",

So for now who knows about the lack of evidence of the biggest stablecoin?QuoteUSDT will become the biggest scam in crypto history, bigger than XRP by 5-fold.

If these speculative forecasts come to fruition it will certainly be catastrophic for those who like to hold and use USDT in everything they need.Although at the moment I still like USDT, but in the future maybe I will switch it to another stablecoin if the evidence you are referring to has not been found.",

Honestly speaking nobody is sure whether these stable coins will not collapse like ust in case crypto market goes through another Teraa Luna like crash. The USDT has huge market cap of 70 Billion dollars if it is not backed by real dollars then it is certainly vulnerable and we should diversify our funds in different stable coins like BUSD & USDC,",

Maybe a few more years before this speculative prophecy comes to fruition. This is why i were leaving USDT for BUSD. I don't know why people are still using this non transparent stable token. Even UST that was being transparent can be destroyed easilly but in my opinion when people realized about the truth and massive sell will be happening like UST even USDT was not a algorithmic stable token. Last week i have seen the price of USDT was also dropping. This stable token was not viable anymore to be used for the daily interaction with the market. The worst thing may come when public will know about the truth of USDT reserve",

The day of reckoning will arrive soon enough. Maybe a few more years before this speculative prophecy comes to fruition. I am well aware of all the controversies that are surrounding USDT for a few years now. As far as i know this all started back in 2019 or so, when the company behind USDT changed it's wording regarding the backing of all the USDT that are minted. Before it was always stated that they have enough USD to cover every USDT minted 1 to 1 but then they changed it to \"we have enough reserves to cover every USDT minted\" but the big problem is no one can really check what kind of reserves that are and if those reserves even exist.If we would see the same thing happen to USDT then to UST a few weeks ago then the impact on the crypto market would be extremely devastating in my opinion and the current bear market caused by the Terra collapse will look like nothing in comparison to that.",

Without a doubt you are right, at some point USDT will collapse as we know it is not truly backed one to one with dollars, however taking into account what happened with luna and ust I think there are not many people that will want to ask questions about tether either, after all if that happened and tether collapsed tomorrow it is difficult to imagine how low the price of bitcoin could fall, even if bitcoin is not directly affiliated with it the fall of tether will without a doubt affect bitcoin.",

So we will see, although this case has been settled as far as I know, and as what we witnessed recently, even these so called stable coins can collapse anytime.",
