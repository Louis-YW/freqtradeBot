In my understanding, a crypto or bitcoin broker is a person or firm that acts as a middleman between you and the cryptocurrency or market. Can you share some of your insights from working with brokers? What is your worst experience?",

Can you share some of your insights from working with brokers? What is your worst experience?Does this mean you have no knowledge about trading and wanted to seek the help of professionals? This could be a good one if you’re a busy person and let someone handle your money, you just need to make sure that you are dealing with the right broker where they are responsible enough if something bad happen. Actually there is no need for a broker in crypto trading, but again it will depend on your situation and if you are willing to pay for the broker, then why not.",

What is your worst experience?I don't think in crypto it is needed to working with brokers and usually brokers will be used more often in stock and forex trading, my experience with brokers is in forex and it goes very badly and maybe because I chose the wrong broker and my experience actually cannot be used as a benchmark that brokers in trading are not needed.",

In the crypto space where the average exchange can serve global users, the role of brokers I don't think is really needed. Or if the broker you want to work with also offers other services than buying and selling crypto which will not be offered on exchanges in general.At the moment I don't have many references to the advantages of using a broker over exchanges, except for only flexible transaction fees (which is useful for high trading levels.",

Back when I first got into stocks around 2009 to 2010, I started working with a broker, and I explained to him that I wanted to deal with stocks that have dividends because usually before the dividend payment date the price goes up, so you get the dividend AND the increase together, and he kept on insisting that other companies do not pay dividends and goes up higher because of that since they use all of that to grow.I explained to him many times that simple math would be like that but they don't, and they won't, it is not just about math, it is about humane psychology on the market and that's how I wanted to invest, and after a while I got annoyed enough to stop.",

When it comes in crypto it’s not really that popular since the market is too wide and there are many altcoins to consider with unlike in stocks that only known companies should be study and the price didn’t move that much. Broker mostly in my country were refer as agents or finance coach, they are hired to trade the money but only in stock market some even have broker in real estates and insurances. But never heard  yet if also have in bitcoin, though there are financial wealth coach who do talking or seminars about crypto.",

In the normal circumstances you don't need brokers for Trading,  for Trading what we need to know concerning Trading is the ability to interpret the chart of the market, so the aspect of brokers is like marketers who is looking for the easiest way of making directions of how you can exchange your btc in that domain.",
