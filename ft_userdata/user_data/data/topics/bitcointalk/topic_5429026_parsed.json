There's no way on doing that but instead it would be sensible that you would rather go along on what would be their movement.But how?This is where own analysis and skills would really vary since each traders would really be having their own way on how they would be placing themselves into the market.Uncertainty and doubts could really be always there since this is really volatile one since in the first place.There's no way we could determine on when the market would make out some significant movement.This is why its important that you should only invest on the amount which you can afford to lose which is always been the primary rule.",

Immediately i read the post i began to imagine how you think you can convince people over here not sell rather to empty the whales. Do you know their investment plans or portfolio? So, they aren't selling now and you alone can't even manipulate, control the market compared to millions of people holding bitcoin and how do you plan to put people over here together make them adhered to you post by not selling their bitcoin. If i were you i would have been buying gradually because that is the only way i think you could take back from the whales but believe me or not, they also buy whenever they thinks the market is dip.",

Because, due to its decentralized nature, I believe traders do get panic out of any FUD quicker than other market traders.

No matter how much we give in individually, we wouldn't be making that much of a dent to move the market in our favor. We will be needing more than deep pockets in order to be able to move things around.

What he said is wide adoption, then more small individuals. One or few individuals can beat whales if these individuals are too powerful enough or wealthy. They can easily counter what the whales are trying to do. A hodler is different from a buyer. There might be a combination of both but for those who only want to buy a coin, they will likely be having a tough time doing it anymore once people became a hodler.The only best thing that whales can do this time is to sell their bags and I think that still can shake the market but not as heavy as before because people won't panic anymore and will do the same thing.",

Let's prepare more money to buy more bitcoin It would be a huge loss if someone with experience in crypto ignores the current downturn to invest in bitcoin. When we see how good the potential of bitcoin is in the future, we should prepare a bag to fill bitcoin at a cheaper price. All of us are expecting a new ATH in the next few years, it is a possibility but without the preparation and belief in this potential then I think they have missed the opportunity.In essence, the advantages and disadvantages are in our own hands. A good decision will start a good result, and vice versa until they regret it in the end. I've been investing in bitcoin regardless of what the market is like right now. It doesn't matter because I still really believe in its potential.",
