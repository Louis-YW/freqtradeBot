The winning she got from the jackpot actually made her can't to control herself to continue gambling and start using bigger money than she used to play.I personally have never experienced this still able to control myself, it's just that I lost all the gambling results that were saved in an online wallet because the wallet was hacked, I think the pain is the same as experiencing a loss from gambling",

In order to attract more people, some cash rewards were set for the winner of the night, those severely addicted to the bingo ended up losing it all the same night or the next one by paying for large numbers of cards to have a higher chance to win again, most of the time they ended up losing the money gotten from the initial strike of luck.",

I'm talking about the old times when bitcoin was under $1000, but still a huge win. That player was a high roller and he had the chance to walk away with his profit but he stay on the site gambling for 8 hours and ending with a lost of 40btc. And this happens when people do emotional gambling and not smart gambling. The fact that you win big ones doesn't meant that you will keep winning.",

I was losing thousands of dollars so I realized that I needed a vacation and to stay out of gambling for a while. I am still betting up to this day but with very small limits. If I were that person in OP's story, I would've called it a day and then come back the other day but of course with a betting limit. It is greed versus discipline. And sometimes, we only realized when the damage has been done.",

And is there a payment when you enroll on a self-exclusion program?Quote from: Poker Player on September 24, 2022, 03:19:18 AM Has this ever happened to you or do you know of cases like this?I think everyone goes through that experience. Controlling our emotion is really hard especially when there's money involved to it. When we win, we tend to gamble more thinking that our luck will still continue and will be able to earn more profit. But when we lose, we can't just accept it easily that we come back trying to recover the money that we lose.",

I've experienced it many times, most of the time I spend little by little and make a small wager. My ultimate was to have winning momentum till the weekend, but this never happens with me. Most of the time I end up empty wallet by Friday or Saturday. This week this has happened too earlier during Monday.",

So that's enough for him to put food in the table for his family and maybe not work as a cab driver for weeks. But he chooses to go back and you know what's going to happen to those who wanted to stretch their luck. So he lost everything and now back to being a driver, ouch.",

Has this ever happened to you or do you know of cases like this?This happens when people wins big in gambling, they will think that they have mastered the method or the game that gave them the huge winning. They will continue to try that same strategy not knowing that it will not play out immediately. When anyone wins big, there should be a high degree of discipline to guide oneself. For instance if you play 10% of your income and eventually wins big, you can increase to 15 or 20% because of the big winning. When the allocated percentage finishes, you rest and go hime.",

Has this ever happened to you or do you know of cases like this?Pretty good example of gamblers who can't satisfy themselves and also being attacked by their own greed. We can't deny that there are many gamblers on a real casino who overspend their time playing and ended losing it all. We know that the more we spend our time on a casino is the more chance that casino will make money from us. I've experienced the same thing when I was still a gambling addict before and honestly it's hard to resist the urge to overspend my time and keep playing again knowing that the luck is on my side. Having a good gambler mindset or putting your own up could reduce the chance of this happening.",

But not about land based casino winning and online casino losing together. No land based casino in my area, only betting agents for sport matches are in my area, but I still just prefer the use of phone or computer to gamble. The problem I had before was that I was an addict, I prefer to use almost all my won amount to gamble at once, this made it possible for me to lose often and often.I prefer going on low odds, like home team or away team (not both teams to score) score in first half not to be up to 3 goals. I failed. Later I prefer going for in-play and failed too.For the home or away team first half score to be less than 3, I can win from Monday to Friday a very huge amount, but I noticed I always lose the whole money on either Saturday or Sunday. For in-play, I noticed I may win all through the day, but losing exactly at night when it remain just few matches to the end of the day which are mostly clubs in countries in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and those other clubs that play late in the night like 11pm GMT +1 to early in the morning like to around 2 or 3am. I will start the day good, but lose just before going to bed. I gambled almost all the time in the past.",

Has this ever happened to you or do you know of cases like this?It is tragic but this is a major reason for things like welcome bonuses in live casinos. They'll offer to register for a membership card on your first arrival and in return you might get certain freebies - like $25 free play. The hardest part for most casinos is \"developing\" a new player, the fact they've got someone through the door is a major win and they want to convert that person into a regular - or at least until they can clear out their bank account. Many people are creatures of habit, if they get a few wins under their belt - seeing all the flashing lights and loud noises celebrating a win, that will trigger happy emotions. Then, in the back of their mind, little seeds start getting planted where they store the happy wins but conveniently forget the many tiny losses that outweigh them.",
