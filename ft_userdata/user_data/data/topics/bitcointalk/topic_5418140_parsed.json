  "content": "There are lot of criteria that must be considered to become good in price speculation but i will like to see how far an observer can go with speculating Bitcoin price and maybe some few good altcoin out there. When it comes to speculation been active with price movement and managing greed level can also play a big factor in deciding the level of accuracy and precision once speculation can go this two seems much more easier compared to becoming diligent in observation.Observation is one aspect of speculation that even the pro-speculator still battle with. We will all agree that price is never consistent with the market because crypto assets are highly volatile and so therefore been observant on the regular changes as regards price, what triggered the change, how much of the effect was seen on the market as regard the cause of the change and how often this change in has occurred in the market.As regards Bitcoin which has been ranging around $19k for a while now there is a long bullish candle formed on 23rd October 2022 around 18:00 GMT +1 where price moved from $19,200 to around $19,611 before the bearish engilfing candle pushed price down at a resistance zone keeping the trade on till the next day 24th October 2022. It might not be a very significant change but that long Bullish candle is sending a strong future message because since then we haven't seen a bearish candle that has contended with it till date. It can be a powerful signal to keep buyers at alert for possible bull run maybe a short one or a long term push. Like i mentioned earlier the effect might not be immediate on the price but i believe it is a message for a some positive future moves",

Its the scale that makes it looks like that. Bitcoin is locked in consolidation for last 4 months. Volatility is constantly going down. Last 1.5 month bitcoin is going super flat. Thats why as small as 400$/2% daily candle looks so impressive on small scale. But not so long ago we've seen 5x longer candles -f.e 10% daily bullish candle 09.09.2022 19200-21300.

Be observant enough the last time we had similar candle stick around 0ctober 19' on a 4hrs chart price hasn't close below that very candle you can check your chart to confirm. I am not saying this is a buy signal but it is a call for alertness we might be expecting a small price action anytime soon.",

I tend to buy in dips, while trying to save my real-world monthly income for investment. In the short term or daily, I think the candle will really help the trader to maximize profit opportunities, but about the long term I think I really should ignore the small shocks.",

It's natural that there are many observers in this forum and outside the forum I mean on social media, Twitter, many observers share about the analysis of price movements today and tomorrow. but if we look at it at a glance everything is almost similar in the style of analysis that is shared. maybe for me as a futures trader it will be useful to compare with the analysis I use but the fact is that there are often discrepancies when the market situation changes rapidly. perhaps an important option, the more wise observers, the more helpful it is for traders to find the best level of accuracy.",

So tell me, what's your price prediction of Bitcoin tomorrow? In the next 3 days? Or next week? What's going to be the price of Bitcoin next month?Here's my long-term prediction: Bitcoin would reach $100,000 in 2025. That's an easy prediction.
