  "content": "Alik Bakhshi Towards the revival of Turan          All known revanchist projects, such as Greater Germany and Greater Italy, were unsuccessful. The same fate awaits Putin’s revanchist project Great Russia, which consists in recreating an empire within the borders of the USSR. The very first and longest in time, the chimerical project “Great Armenia”, which originated at the beginning of the 20th century, cost a lot of blood both to the Turks of Turkey and Azerbaijan, and to the Armenians themselves, also ended in failure.    It’s another matter when such grandiose national projects concern the unification of the people. For example, the idea of pan-Germanism, which united many German states (except Austria) was successfully implemented. In our time, in connection with the collapse of the USSR and the upcoming inevitable end of the Russian Empire, as a result of which the Turks of the Volga region, Urals and Siberia will also be freed from colonial dependence, the opportunity has arisen to bring to life the idea of pan-Turkism.(1) It should be noted that the very word “Pan-Turkism” inspired fear in the Russians, for the Turks were the most numerous colonial people of the empire.(2)       The revival of Turan on a grand scale from Angara in Turkey to Angara in Siberia in a form similar to the EU is quite feasible. This association will become more effective, because unlike the EU, which includes various peoples, Turan will become the unity of one Turkic people. The core and successful prototype of such a union today is the union of Turkey and Azerbaijan under the motto “one people, two states.” It was thanks to this alliance that it was possible to put an end to the 30-year occupation of 20% of the territory of Azerbaijan by Armenia.      The unification of the Turks will be the key to their security and economic prosperity.      1.
