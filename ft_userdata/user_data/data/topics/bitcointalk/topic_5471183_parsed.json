  "content": "My country men una well done, So I was just relaxing and surfing on the internet, trying to entertain myself a bit, then I came across this interesting skit by some user on the platform TikTok which really got attention because of the specific message he was actually trying to pass and as I watched it I tried relating what he was actually saying to my immediate environment and it fits so well that I thought I should drop it in the community today and hear your own personal view and take on this. So we all know how the country be, and how boys for the streets dey continue involved themselves into fraud and many scam related stuffs just to make ends means and the funny thing about this is that some of these guys actually aren't really that educated and have found it really hard to do things the right way and, by this I mean actually following the right path to make money and some of the reasons most guys actually get involved in these scam ethics is because they actually deem it very easy which is actually a big fucking lie, but the lifestyle most of these fraudster lives makes fraud business looks so easy which is actually a mirage because nothing is actually ever easy especially when it's comes to making ðŸ’° money. I have some friends who have actually said that doing fraud is actually the easiest way to make an ends, but when they actually tell me what they pass through day and night for this, then I start to think how funny it really is, how we are willing to some extent of a certain desire to actually do  THE WRONG THINGS FOR THE RIGHT REASON Â .I imagine not sleeping all day and night trying to convince someone for them to actually do your biddings for the purpose of trying to scam or learning all the technological stuff about hacking, sending constant fake mail, claiming multiple identities and so many other hard stuff, and of which scammers are of the mentality that it's supposed to be easy and we all know how hard it is to actually learn and dedicate your mind to things you are not familiar with especially when it comes to tech stuffs but for these guys the dedication and committed is really on another level and this really make me wonder how funny the world is and how people are actually willing to the wrong things for the right reasons.Why not just channel all this energy and time and actually follow the right path, because obviously, trying to scam too is actually not easy and if you are caught there is a penalty that follows it, but following the right way holds no sanction and requires the same commitment too.Please, what's your take on this, make we yan small Tori for this issue.",

I could remembered one of my girlfriend who always acts classy and making mockery of me that I don't associates myself with classy men saying all manner of things about me, today she has nothing to count on even for her to fall back to start something very useful for her life were too difficult so today she has no work and not yet married. Just like an abandoned property.The fact is that whenever anyone plans well she will end well, she it's to scammers some of them thought is easier to scam people but is the most deadly business to associated with why because whenever they are being caught some of them are being jailed. So the fact is just develop yourself and do something that is legit to sustain one's life instead of involving oneself in evil activity.",

Scammers are very intelligent than you think. You talked about how they get there information? One thing you should understand is that, when you are trying to scam somebody, you will go extra mile to get what you want. Just like the way you spend time here to lean about crypto currency so do dey study criminology. So getting information is a minor issue. Some online form you fill with your full details applying for something, do you know the owner of that website? Some link you click which takes you to another page are scam link. Another one is registration using Facebook or Gmail sign-up can hack your phone and get any information.Quote from: Roseline492 on October 22, 2023, 07:56:20 AMPerhaps this days they are finding it difficult to scam people because they have known all there tactics now so no matter the pattern they use they can hardly succeed. Like I said scammers are very smart. When dey notice people have started knowing their format dey change to another. Those set of people, The way they will scam you, you'll never know. You can only be free from them If you know there ways. and by always avoiding clicking everything that pop up on your phone screen. because most of them are virus dat can be monitoring your activities on your device. So you can say \"no matter the parttern they use, they can hardly succeed\" but if preventive messures are not taken you can still fall a victim.Quote from: SmartGold01 on October 22, 2023, 08:22:26 AMThey said time waits for nobody why because when they should be learning hand works or be in school is when they will use it for something that won't benefits their lives after years passed and they think is too hard for them to start afresh they will look for illegal business to associate themselves, thinking that is the best way or right.

Just like an abandoned property.I disagree with you on this. I am not on the opinion of supporting fraudulent activity, but those people are not what they are painted for. If am not mistaken, you said when dey should be learning hand work or going to school they chose what wouldn't benefits their life. most of them have handwork and working. but when the responsibility dey have is bigger than their earning. They star looking for a way out. Some did once and achieve their goal and start up from there and never went back to it. But some choose to continue and make it an office.Educational aspect you said? Someone who is not educated how come they scam people online? These people have tarlent but chose to use Dem in the wrong direction. If most of them are given an ideal opportunity,Â  dey will do beter. What most of them need is to show them the write part that's just all.",

But truth be told, the reason these guys venture into scam most times is that the positive skills are mostly unrecognized by the government and clients tend toÂ  take advantage of upcoming professionals with positive vibes and mindset towards money making.Most of them keep trying and after persistent rejection from clients and job offers, they lose patience and venture into scam. I must say that most guysÂ  venturing into scam is an evidence ofÂ  a failed government.I know of many people who were very promising quite alright, but the condition of the country coupled with pressure from home and many responsibilities prompted them to embrace any faster and available route to making money to relieve too much pressure. Most of these people were pushedÂ  into this by their parents too. I watched a skit on a guy that used his unborn children for ritual cos his mother asked him toÂ  make money through any possible means and spend on her.I am not justifying them scammers, I still believe in struggling and making money rightly. I also know how long it took me to make the little breakthrough I now enjoy in my career. Its not any easy man and it takes a thick skinned individual to persevere until he succeeds.I'll advice scammers to remove their back hat put on a white hat and with the burning desire to succeed, they must enjoy a favorable breakthrough one day. But they've to be patient, work hard and believe its possible.",

Everyday na new things dey come scammers ready to scam oh.To add to this valid point of yours, is to say that, why is it that scammers have the whole of the day, time, efforts and sacrifice to learn the skills that they need scam people and they will not use the same time and effort to do something better and more positive. It baffles me a lot that one will take all his career to learn something awful to other people by defrauding them through different formats and ideas and they go as much as looking for updates to improve on it by the day.Why can't the same effort and brain be put into something more positive and impactful to the people at large. For instance, there's money in Graphics designs, Copywriting, Digital marketing and other online jobs you can learn at your comfort zon [most of these skills courses are out there for free]. There are also platforms such as Upwork, Fivrr, amongst other platforms where you can sort for clients and social media platforms where you can build your clientele. Why not take advantage of these opportunities availed to you to learn something impactful.QuoteAnd now the new method is they have converted that scamming method to begging, now that Mark has bought whatsapp and whatsapp is no longer private, the reason I brought this whatsapp matter here is that scammers are hacking through peoples whatsapp now using QR scan code or link device and they will start begging for money using your whatsapp, most people have fallen victim to this and it is not funny. Why will a normal human being with his right senses decide to hack peoples whatsapp and be begging for money. Make we dey careful make we no go fall into the hands of scammers I have advised a lot of friends who are always eager to open mouthwatering fake and unprotected links in the name of winning giveaways, grants or loans. Most of those links are malicious and can only lead you to scammers and hackers who engage in phishing sites to steal your information.Another aspect I will advise people to be careful of is when you receive a class from an unknown number requesting for your One Time Password (OTP). The truth is, you are never advised to share such vital information with friends and family not to talk of someone who is claiming something else that you don't know.Lastly, avoid logging into your WhatsApp on other devices and whenever you do, try to log out immediately you are done especially on desktop computers. What I have also learnt from life experience is to quickly uninstall your WhatsApp application on your device and reinstall again once you notice an unusual activity going on in your WhatsApp. Do not forget to always activate your two factor authentication in the settings of your WhatsApp whenever you got a new phone or if you have never done it before. Try and make Whatsapp backup on your Google drive to avoid missing vital messages when you mistakenly erase your device or when your device is stolen.Quote from: DaNNy001 on October 25, 2023, 10:12:38 PMThat's just the stupidity of everything, I mean people actually do the wrong stuff for the right reason all the time, it's as if doing the right thing is really hard and way beyond realization, but not actually true as these wrongful deeds are sometimes more stressful and time consuming.

How on heaven's earth will someone take all his time to learn how to take people's account from them and go to their contact list to start messaging them and asking for money from them.How useless will that person be to go through that route. But this goes to talk about how degraded the behavior of our young people are right now. Their thinking capacity and their laziness as young people. If hacking people's account is what someone does for a living at his prime when he's supposed to work hard to find a niche and a sustainable source of income.",

      "body": "Becoming a scammer shouldn't be an excuse that the government failed to handle her responsibilities, because I know that in a second world country where live is easy because the government has set a standard of living, there are also scammers in such countries. Scammers are everywhere in the world, sometimes these scammers are working for people, who force them to scam people if not they might get killed due to some selfish interest of their Boss. At the end any money that the scammer gets, the Boss gives them little and takes the lion share.In Nigeria, the lack of patience and confidence in themselves that they can make it without scam is a major problem in the country, because people think that life is all about competition. Because Mr A has made money over night without Mr B knowing how he made his money, or because Mr B is jealous of Mr A, this will make Mr B goin into scamming because he wants to buy the new car that Mr A bought with his legitimate funds. Another thing is that our country government and leaders are not encouraging the youth to decease from fraudulent activities because the government and leaders are also scammers.The government display their own scam through corruption, because when public funds is giving to the leaders to use in construction of roads and building of schools and hospital, they syphon these funds and give some percentage to the person that they know will be able to challenge them why the road is not done.Imagine our new president was finally approved by the Supreme court yesterday that all allegations made on him by Atiku Abubakar was fake, when it was clear that Tinubu presented a forged result in the presidential election, and the court ruled it out. Is that not the biggest scam in Nigeria presently, using a forged result to become the number one citizen of the country because he wants to loot the country's funds. These leaders are teaching the youths and the children not to be sincere with things but to continue dwelling in fake lives and lies, all these are attributes of a scammer.",

Â No be only Naija way this problem day oo, ee day everywhere and to come reason am naija no be country with the highest rate of scammers. Countries like the UK and United States even with their better government and economy they still pass us for this scam thing. No be today scamming don start ee day tey but na because say we don come day too expose to the internet way make us they information. Everything way day sup day happen for reason, no be everybody go be doctor or lawyer, even when we get police dem we still get people way go still theft, na so life day, day bring equilibrium to life.Â Â  We Nigerian we sabi over do our own things, they no day hide their own thing, some don even day see am as occupation sef, you go see small boy way still day secondary school day involve for fraud. Make we no feel say yahoo na normal thing, na wrong thing and ee day break the victim.
