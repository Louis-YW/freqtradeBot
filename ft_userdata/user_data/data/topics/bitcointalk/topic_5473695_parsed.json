  "content": "Hey all. Just wondering why Binance doesn't account for its fees into unrealized and even realized PL for futures? Technically if the position is open, it's inevitable that you will pay the transaction fee when will be closing it.You see + $50 dollars in unrealised PL section for your position, you close it and your balance decreases. Here are details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V15p4TL-eyg&t=54s&ab_channel=Financenerd",

      "body": "That is how it is on exchanges, including Binance. If you open a position, fee would be deducted. If you close a position, fee would also be deducted. Assuming the trading fee is 5%. 5% would be deducted if you open long position and another 5% would be deducted from your money plus PnL after closing a position.",

On all the exchanges that I am using, I do calculate the fee. I have calculated the fee for opening position and closing positions on Binance before, several times, but the fee is accurate, although I do not know of now but I still calculated it several times this year and I saw no fault. This thread supposed not to be in scam accusation board, it supposed to be on exchanges board.",

It is the usual behavior when you close the future trade with leverage. By the way, have you tried to trade on any other exchange and did not face the same issue ?For binance trading fee and how it works, you may go through their trading fee pages.https://www.binance.com/en/fee/futureFee",

As I texted before, you may see green unrealized PL and then close position and get negative (not because of slippage but because they hide fees)How do you expect them to calculate it under unrealized PnL lol1. You open a position using market or limit order, they deduct their fee which you know they have to.2. And then there is an 8 hourly or 4 hourly funding fee depending on the positions you are holding3. You close your position (They don't know when you will do this and/or whether you are going to use a limit order, market order) so tell me again how you expect them to include this in Unrealized PnL if they don't know which type of closing order you are going to use because the fees vary.There are no hidden fees...
