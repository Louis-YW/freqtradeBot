  "content": "Hello ladies and gents,I'm selling one AvalonMiner 841 with Raspberry Pi + AUC3 dongle controller set and a Enermax psu (Revolution 87+, 1000 Watt).It is a sha-256 algorithm miner (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, ...).Some things about the miner:- It has been running without problems.- I've been using it with low level settings & firmware, with 8Th/s hash rate and about 700W power consumption.- I've installed a Noctua industrialPPC 3000rpm pwm fan. The original fan is also included in the set.Something to notice about the psu:- One of the psu 6-pin cables has been glued in to the Avalon, because the clip has been broken. - Cooling fan has been renewed and so the psu comes with a SilentiumPC fan installed.I'm asking 200 EUR plus shipping for this set.Location: FinlandPicture:https://mega.nz/file/hlc2DQJS#dyFq6sE467itNbP8mr86avb0PCzCuRFUYs6ep5UDeJwCheers,Hagss.edit:This is now sold.Thread is closed.",
