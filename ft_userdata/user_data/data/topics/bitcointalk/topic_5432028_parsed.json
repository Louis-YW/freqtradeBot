I can see a blank page only there & I guess the site isn't ready yet. make sure to complete the site before you launch or if you are looking for reviews before that. I guess you should post it service announcement board as I said in your other thread.Well, it's great to see such a site including Monero & Bitcoin only which clearly serves the purpose. It's going tobe interesting I guess. Good luck.",
