  "content": "My wife's assets was wiped out a day after our wedding, the only reason why I suspected the hotel we lodged in is because I found two hidden camera in the room the following day of the incident and my wife claimed she revealed her wallet seed because she needed to import her seed into trust wallet from Atomic wallet after we lodged out of the hotel that day all her assets was wiped out, this include 1000 PYR token I got for her as a birthday present months back, I went back to the hotel claiming I forgot a sim card and the room was still empty, here is how I knew the room had hidden camera, could be useful for anyone.  Make sure that everywhere is dark by switching off the light and bring out your smartphone, ON the camera and start waving it around slowly, cameras have something like infrared that flashes light, that light can be detected with your smartphone camera.You can try this with your smart TV remote too, press a button while your camera is on you will see red light blinking. Stay safe out there people UPDATEThere is more to this story that I am not ready to share on here but I have said the important part already, I am only trying to warn others most especially those from corrupted countries that hotels aren't safe no more, I have tried to take some legal actions but all I am getting is warnings not to go up against the owner, I will be a threat ( trying to spoil the owner's name ) they say, moreover the cameras might be removed already, this is not America, and there have been few cases like this here that justice was never served, I heard a lot even from  the police, I don't want to sleep at night with one eye open.Thanks for all your concerns",

However I wonder what's the purpose of your wife to import the seed from Atomic wallet to Trust wallet, it's actually a same unsecured and closed source wallet. If you're know the hotel have a hidden camera on your room, why you're not make a report to police and documented the whole evidence instead of suggest it to anyone?",

Nothing else was recorded because we were so exhausted when we get back to the hotel, we slept off straight away, also I couldn't find any hidden camera in the bath room which would have raised some alarm already, thanks for your concern.Police case? Where I am from the law can be bought with money, I am not a rich person to win this if turned to a case but thank God nothing else happened.As for the wallet it's real, not the fake one, I started my crypto journey years ago and we were together through out the journey, I thought her all that's need to know.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on September 25, 2022, 03:03:16 PMI'm sorry for the loss of your coins, but there are a lot of things you (or your wife) did wrong here:Atomic wallet is closed sourceTrust wallet is closed sourceInteracting with your seed phrase anywhere except the security of your own houseProbably doing all this while connected to a public WiFi networkQuote from: Outhue on September 25, 2022, 02:16:59 PMMake sure that everywhere is dark by switching off the light and bring out your smartphone, ON the camera and start waving it around slowly, cameras have something like infrared that flashes light, that light can be detected with your smartphone camera.This will only find cameras which are emitting infrared light.

The hotel deserves to be investigated and shut down as that is clearly against the rules of hospitality especially for a room you paid for where your privacy is supposed to be priority. In all, the moral you can learn from this story is that you should never let your guard down even in areas or places that you think is a private space.",

Did she create any wallet or enter any seeds on that device previously, especially recently?But regardless of what happened, it's still a good advice to be wary of your surroundings when you do operation with seeds. Maybe in the future there will even be cases of crypto heists where people would get robbed in their own homes as attackers would install hidden cameras into victims rooms to take a picture of their private keys.",

No wallet sends its seed to internet or to any network. If one would do it it would be already empty. Nowadays almost all traffic is encrypted through HTTPS/TLS protocols so even if one evil maid would be spying the wifi network, she wouldn't see anything. The most dangerous threat is not always the one we think. And I wouldn't recommend anyone to bring outside his home any wallet with a critical amount into it.",

While it sucks that you lost your coins, a recording of you and your wife by some sicko sounds way worse to me. Your privacy is much more important than money. Sometimes, it might not even be the hotel planting the cameras, but some previous sick guest who rented the room. As others have already suggested, it's best to avoid accessing your wallet in public places or networks. It's better to be safe than sorry. However, I could never have imagined being screwed over in this way. Last month, I lost some XRP due to a fake Google Sheets extension that installed itself. Scammers never fail to impress me.",

In addition, you write that you came to the room and were very tired. Could this work against you?
