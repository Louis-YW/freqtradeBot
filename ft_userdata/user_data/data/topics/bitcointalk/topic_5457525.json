You probably designed that according to your current bankroll but do you plan on adjusting that if the casino grows in the future?",

You explain well here how to play, it's good for beginners.QuoteSimply bet on the number you think the wheel will stop at: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 or 40. If you bet on the correct number you will win a corresponding payout (e.g. 1 to 1, 2 to 1, 5 to 1, and so on).Maybe we will see the experience for wheel game fans on your platform, are you fair or vice versa, generally what users want to ask is generally difficult to answer,¬† for all that in the help center, whatever the story, for sure the games on the RollCat.io site, made a lot of curious people want to bet there, good luck here for RollCat.io and their users, I will try one day.",

I suggest to have a good marketing team to handle this project and have some promotions as well, this can be a big help to attract investors and the players too.

What surprised me is the next number that wheel rolled was 245x. That‚Äôs freaking High multiplier man and how is it possible if there is simply no range for that number? Is it something related to so called multiplier stack as mentioned in the OP or it‚Äôs just for the demo purpose?I hope not because I clicked original URL which shall take me to the live site no matter if I‚Äôm logged in or out. As far as site is concern, UI seems simple and easy to understand. As we can see you seem to have only one game so far. Hope to see some answers and more real vouches from the users. Good luck.",

It‚Äôs same mechanism on Crazy time and Dream Catcher which your multiplier adds up when you keep hitting that same multiplier spot.You can a have a better overview if you will notice the wheel appearance.",

Don't you need to put in a tour video for someone like me who is new to gambling? As you have a single game you need to have an introduction that makes the understanding of a new gambler easy. What I felt is that this platform assumes that everyone is into online gambling. Otherwise, they would have made a simple to use interface.",

On roulette game like this means multiplier of your profit. A X1 will give you 1:1 pay so if you bet 1$ then you will be paid 1$ aside from your original bet that will bring you 2$ in total same with x2 that will give you 2$ profit and 3$ total money including your original bet.This is how roulette works with multiple multiplier available. They multiply the profit in contrary to the typical multiplier like dice that multiply the base bet.",

In general your site isn't difficult to understand, especially since there is only 1 game currently on it. Multipliers stack is also very interesting, I have never come across this system in any crypto casino. one question about multipliers stack, as i understand so far, we'll get the highest multiplier i.e. 280 if we are at 40 after getting x7 multiplier right? then is it possible for players to get x7 multiplier in a row for the second time? so the highest multiplier will be x1960?",

Do that and make your thread more presentable.I was about to write about creating a token that allows users to test the site before I saw the faucet, that pretty much does the funciton of the inbuilt token so kudos to you for that, I have tried it just once and I do have a sugggestion for the fauce: Could you implement a timer into your faucet? so that users can be aware of the exact time when to come back and claim their next faucet, I have seen it in other faucet and it's very nice.I have gone through everything in your website and as such I don't have anymore suggestion to add, but I'm sure I'll be revisiting your site for proper analysis, good luck OP.",

And then you can make a full announcement through your account. Apart from this, many facilities will be provided for you such as signature code option where you can add a signature of your choice which will be displayed wherever you post.

Seeing out that you dont have much when it comes to bankrolland trying out to build it up over time.Do you have plans or budget allocated for marketing? This is something that crucial or something that would really be giving out exposure on any business.",
