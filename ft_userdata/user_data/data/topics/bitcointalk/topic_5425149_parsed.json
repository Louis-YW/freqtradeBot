  "content": "QuoteSomebody or something out there has been buying a lot of gold — 400 tons of it in the third quarter, more than $20 billion worth at today’s price.  That’s double the amount that changed hands in the second quarter, and more than quadruple that of the first quarter, all according to the World Gold Council. Central banks bought a quarter of it, but the rest? Nobody knows. Maybe some country or countries. But who? And why? When Ken Kuttner worked at the New York Federal Reserve Bank back in the ’90s, he sometimes went into the basement. “Buried deep in the Manhattan granite was a gold vault, and there were, if I remember correctly, there was 800,000 bars of gold in our basement,” he said.One time, he got to pick one up. It was superheavy. “Behind the main set of bars were a whole set of cages, and each cage belonged to different countries. So if country X wanted to transfer gold to country Y, one of the guys down in the gold vault would open up the cage, take out some bars of gold, wheel it around in a dolly and take it over to the cage for country Y,” he said.Now Kuttner is an economics professor at Williams College, but by the time he left the Fed in 2003, a quarter of those gold bars were gone. There wasn’t some heist, central banks had just sold a lot of it off. “Gold, well it really doesn’t earn any interest, for one thing,” he said.Banks preferred Treasury debt. They earn interest and they’re easier to sell. This move away from gold was the trend for many years.“There are maybe two dozen or fewer central banks that are buying gold, and then there are other central banks that are not buying gold — maybe 160 of them,” said Jeffrey Christian, managing partner of CPM Group. At this point, most countries’ gold reserves, he said, are just residue from an age decades ago when the world was on the gold standard. “Most of these central banks still only have 15% or 10% of their reserves in gold,” Christian said.But since 2008, he said, while most central banks have been selling gold or not bothering with it, a few have been buying it up and then some. There are reasons gold could be useful. Central banks can use it to control their currencies’ value or pay for imports during a crisis. “Another reason is if you have trouble paying off foreign debts, having some reserves could come in handy,” said Joe Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.But reason No. 1 right now, Gagnon said, is avoiding economic sanctions.If a country holds U.S. Treasuries, the U.S. can seize them. See: Russia. Gold in a vault at home is safe. So whoever is buying all that gold — Gagnon thinks it’s Russia, others suspect China — may be doing it to evade the long arm of the U.S.https://www.marketplace.org/2022/11/22/somebodys-been-on-a-gold-buying-bender-its-not-clear-who-or-why/....Interesting line of thought here:QuoteAt this point, most countries’ gold reserves, he said, are just residue from an age decades ago when the world was on the gold standard. “Most of these central banks still only have 15% or 10% of their reserves in gold,” Christian said.But since 2008, he said, while most central banks have been selling gold or not bothering with it, a few have been buying it up and then some.

      "body": "Things are definitely getting interesting regarding \"countries\" buying up gold. As I said a while ago there are multiple countries that have been increasing the amount of gold they have (Russia, China, India and Iran are a few of them). Rulers of other countries with half a brain have been joining this trend too but they are trying their best to keep it under wraps. Part of it is because fiat currencies (namely US dollar) are getting weaker and part of it is because of the fear of a worsening global conflict in which case gold could be a good option to have.Another reason is that many countries have been moving to a new parallel economy (with the new World Order) where they no longer use USD as international trade currency. There are a couple of replacements and gold (and surprisingly bitcoin) are among the options..This is not new either. It has been going on for a couple of years. For example the 5 oil tankers we sent to Venezuela in 2020 while Trump was shitting his pants over their content were sold mainly for gold.AFAIK China has also been accumulating gold for a couple of years.",

      "body": "The fact is that gold has great power both in terms of trust and values that have been passed down for a long time. And coupled with the modern fad now there is Bitcoin which has gained the trust of the public without the need to force them to sign debt contracts with banks. Look at the other side, the dollar is currently weakening, losing value and public trust due to banking manipulation which is now starting to be questioned. Society is now starting to be critical of something, including the essence of paper money itself. As a result, gold has demonstrated throughout civilization that its value was in the public trust even before paper money was invented.This could also be a compelling reason why Russia dared to openly wage an economic war with the West. The Middle East, China, and countries that have now recognized the weakness of fiat have moved a step further, and broken away from the Western way of thinking about paper money.",

Kinda started feeling gold is more integral as compared to bitcoin if we are not able to track down heavy metal like that? Also Russia can be in picture because they already have oil as precious asset with them and if they want overpower others then what could be best way than buying another precious asset like Gold and that too when global recession is piling up day by day. Russia might have thought this through. What world needs most right now is good financial reserves in the national treasury to survive the upcoming apocalypse.

However, for Russia to succeed in remaking the world, they don't need to hold a ton of gold. Just look at their balance sheet, they have the absolute best balance sheet in the world of any country even without the gold. Very little debt, both public & household. Plus they are the commodity super power. To help the world move away from this fiat Western corrupt system, they wont be holding too much gold at any one time, and really its more of a tool to help peacefully de-lever the world off the corrupt Western financial system. I see the future system as being China as the anchor (by backstopping the yuan, which helps them maneuver their country away from being purely export driven manufacturing hub, which is Xi's intended goal) and Russia as the world's new creditor like the US was post-WW2, since they control the marginal price now of oil moving forward.",

So these is an obvious need for gold, and also obvious reasons to buy it secretly, to avoid sanctions.I must say I'm not pleased with how little the sanctions seem to have impacted Russia, allowing it to comfortably continue spending hundreds of millions of dollars per day of the war for a very long time, and they can probably do it for another year if not more.

No country can guarantee that its claims of gold holdings in vaults are consistent with the money supply. No country will allow an independent audit of gold reserves. No country will give a complete picture of purchases, production and real volumes of real gold in vaults. A more or less objective solution is the minting of gold coins, which have a real value and are backed by their weight in gold. But these are decisions from the Middle Ages. Well, plus gold - it cannot be called a rare or difficult metal to mine. Well, and most importantly, its distribution is such that most countries where there are no deposits of gold sufficient to provide a \"collateral\" for fiat money will not accept such a standard. It is easier for them to ensure the weight of their currencies with a strong economy, high technology, etc. which has a REAL value and is difficult to repeat",

So these is an obvious need for gold, and also obvious reasons to buy it secretly, to avoid sanctions.I must say I'm not pleased with how little the sanctions seem to have impacted Russia, allowing it to comfortably continue spending hundreds of millions of dollars per day of the war for a very long time, and they can probably do it for another year if not more. If they're buying lots of gold, this can help them stabilize even further.In my opinion, gold is a rather useless tool for circumventing sanctions.  Gold bars are all numbered and registered, and it is very easy to limit their turnover.  At the same time, gold is a very inconvenient means of payment.  With gold, there are a lot of questions about its storage, transportation and authentication.  Gold in the gold and foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank is good, but adequacy, reliability and trust are much more valuable in the financial sector.  Yes, there is a lot of gold in Russia, but it is not clear what to do with it.  Carry across the country to the border with China to exchange for Poco, Redmi and Xiaomi smartphones?  Now Russia has canceled VAT on the sale of gold bars and is trying to sell gold to the population.  But the population of Russia does not really understand what to do with these shiny yellow metal cubes.  In real life, they are absolutely useless!",
