      "body": "That means Binance moves their funds including deposits from their customers to new wallets and consequently create and assign new wallets for their customers.The notification is important as many people save their deposit addresses and use it for their personal deal (trades with others, loans, salary payment, etc.). They might not log in their accounts each time they want to send their receiving addresses to a trade partner.If they reuse the old address, that is risky and perhaps lose their coins.Again this one warns us that \"Not your keys, not your coins\". I am sure Binance will still have access to those old wallets and addresses but if you send your coins to your old addresses, I am unsure they will support you to recover your fund.",

      "body": "I got a similar message a few days ago but it was titled differently: \"Thank you for retrieving your new address under.\" This is because I usually check my deposit address all the time. If I am to make a deposit 10 times a day, I will go back 10 times to generate the address. I don't pin my addresses or save them anywhere because I always believe that exchange addresses can change at any time. To avoid any form of mistake,Â  it's always advisable for you to recheck your deposit address before making any form of deposit.Another good thing about this Binance change of address is that the old address is not completely useless. For those that copy and save the address on their notepad or wherever, deposits made won't be lost; they will still be deposited into the user's account. But no one knows how long until they are completely eradicated from their system.",

But no one knows how long until they are completely eradicated from their system.I'd still discourage users from reusing the same address after this. Even if you can still use it for as long as Binance exist, who knows what kind of move they will pull later down the line if you newer 'renew' your deposit address. I also believe it is bad practice to copy-paste from a notepad or something similar instead of always checking your deposit address since malware might alter your data and so on. In short, better use the new one and ditch the old one asap.Quote from: Renampun on April 28, 2023, 02:09:43 PM I don't feel I have coins in the wallet that on mention, I won't respond to it.It is a deposit address anyway, your balance on Binance won't change because of this. It just affects your new deposit for those coins/tokens in Binance.",

I have made the mistake of sending some coins to the wrong address, and after that mistake, I usually check if the old address is always the same as the one I am sending to. Sometimes I just pin the address to my notes for easy access, but more often, when I am trying to send, I still walk back and check if it's accurate. And some people who also like to pin their address can definitely fall for this Binance expropriation of wallet because some people don't even read their emails on a regular basis, and Binance customer service cannot begin to call ðŸ¤™ customers individually, telling them not to use the old address. Even if not in this forum, there are crypto users outside here that may not know about this.",

I believe this event will teach people valuable lesson most especially the victims that'll need extra service to recover their coins, at least they'll now learn to stay up to date and stop storing addresses to be reused especially those that come from a centralized wallet service providers like exchanges.",
