  "content": "It appears that the next storyline will be if Lightning Network has failed, what is the next roadmap for scaling bitcoin?Coindesk is owned by the Digital Currency Group. This is founded by Barry Silbert. Barry Silbert was removed from his position in Grayscale. Barry might not be very busy anymore heheheh. The skeptical me thinks that Barry's next project might be something that he will declare to be bitcoin's best scaling solution.Hailed for years as Bitcoin’s saving grace, the off-chain solution needed to finally make Satoshi Nakamoto’s “peer-to-peer digital cash” an actual functioning payments network, today appears to be losing faith.Similarly, Joseph Poon, another co-author of the Lightning white paper, has seemingly become more interested in blockchain scaling solutions happening on other chains, like Ethereum’s Plasma. He is now working on a new type of decentralized exchange.Other bitcoiners have raised concerns about Lightning’s many privacy issues and that the scaling solution often can be surprisingly expensive to use. In particular, they complain about the design of “inbound capacity” on Lightning, which limits the amount of BTC you can receive, so that users sometimes pay to receive funds (or, that payment is subsidized by startups).The latest round of Bitcoin Lightning discourse appears to have been kicked off by longtime bitcoiner John Carvalho, who was once one of Lightning’s biggest champions until he tried building software solutions on top of it. His recent interview with Vlad Costea caught the ear after Carvalho derided the “complexity and fragility” of the protocol.“Going through that experience has made me realize that the design is kind of a joke,” Carvalho said. “We can make it work. We can do our best, but all of the narratives that came with [Lightning] in the first couple years were really exaggerated.”Indeed, it seems like there is a turning tide in sentiment around Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, which has been hyped as a potential replacement for Visa’s payment rails and the spur that will bring about “hyperbitcoinization.”Read in full https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/02/are-bitcoin-developers-losing-faith-in-lightning/",

Bitcoin will go mainstream and this fud can not prevent it.Coindesk talked about it 4 years agoIn 2023, Developer exposed potential security issue on the Lightning Network",

(you gotta put alot of IF's to even envision it in a working state, but lets pretend it was)its not suppose to emulate a Visa debit system, its suppose to and ends up as a visa CREDITCARD systemshuffling unsettled balance around is a IOU credit system aka DEBT system...renting/leasing liquidity. is where you ask for a credit agreement to borrow someone elses funds (a credit provider) and it even comes with debt interest. the longer you rent the more you pay even if you dont use the balance..yep change the word 'rent' for 'credit card interest' and you start to realise the business plan for LN",
