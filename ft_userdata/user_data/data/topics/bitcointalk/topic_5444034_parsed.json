Any blockchain project can develop within a period of a bear market. You need to check the below points for that.1. Use case of the project 2. Roadmap:Â  You need to check they are achieving the milestones one by one on time as mentioned3. Social media hype4. Whether it is a Coin or a Token: If it is a coin, then there will be more chance to grow the ecosystemThese things matter to grow the project in a bear market.",

      "body": "it highly depends in the quality of the project itself, aptos could succeed partly because the devs was already known to the masses to be quite reliable honestly.moreover their project are that of good quality, they having massive airdrops really works well with their marketing and their coin could still retain their high value mainly because many knows that regardless of the correction after massive airdrops distribution this coin gonna still valued high enough and gonna recover eventually.",

Many people got jackpots from doing testnet of aptos. People triggered to earn more after seeing some people were able earning so much money easily from doing tes net. I think that the time span of development didn't matter a lot in this case. Remember some projects like sandbox has been developed during the bearish market but it was able going as high as possible at 2021 that reached almost 10 billions marketcap. The project that developed during the bearish market has the same possibilities at this moment with the chance to go up even higher once bitcoin will able to reach higher market than the current marketcap. I just suggest you to dig the history of some tokens based from all time chart. You will get so many answer there.",

Testnet airdrops are trending right now. Aptos drop create a fuss on the market about the capability of airdrop. The of it is the current trend. Projects started to do a testnet airdrops and most of testnet airdrops today are anticipated by the airdrop hunters and the investors. It's the current trend and I think we will still encounter many more token that will come with the same airdrop concept as projects are hoping to get a boost because of the airdrop popularity. Just be careful of scam projects as it is expected to come because scammers will always utilize the opportunity.",
