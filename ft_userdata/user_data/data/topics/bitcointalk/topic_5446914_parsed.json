What is in your bucket list and what are your opinions about AI + Crypto in future? It's definitely just a marketing tactic. Most of those projects are not going to deliver anything even mediocre if anything. They drive on buzz words and promises and eventually blame others for not adopting their tech that isn't wanted or needed anyway. New people don't remember but we already have seen this hype years ago in crypto. None of those projects that were working on AI didn't provide anything, or anything interesting. And i am not saying there wouldn't be people working hard to build some cutting edge AI, but i am saying it's unlikely it will have anything to do with crypto.",

Still personally I would like to see what artificial intelligence can do for the crypto-currency community.",

Without a doubt AI will change the way we live our lives, however make no mistake a great deal of the projects which are being released right now that are supposedly researching this field are using AI as nothing but a buzzword, they know the topic regarding AI and its impact is hot on the minds of investors and they are using it for their benefit, and with this in mind I do not recommend you that you invest in any of those coins as there is nothing but hype behind them.",

I believe we are just scratching the surface, people will likely jump on the hype just like what happened in 2021 with Metaverse and people have realized that a lot of work is needed to be done to deliver an actual product. I read yesterday that Fech.ai raised new funds to scale up its development, so I will need to follow them more to see how things work out",

Because I don't find anything about AI technologies that they are talking In their websites or whitepapers. When something gets hyped, many new crypto projects come into the market using it.  As we've seen the hype before Defi, thousands of NFT projects have come to market with such concepts.  Hence the current global hype about AI.  So it is only natural that many crypto companies will use AI and new tokens will appear in the market that token companies will work with AI. But it has to be accepted that AI is a powerful technology and AI will definitely control the whole world instead of humans in the coming days",

Before delving into the application of AI in cryptography, it's worth considering what practical benefits AI could bring to the table. In my opinion, many such projects simply generate hype to attract funding, without any genuine application of AI. While there are many AI-based solutions available for various purposes, I fail to see any significant utility of AI in crypto projects. Moreover, I've observed that some projects that claim to utilize AI often fail to deliver on their promises and ultimately fizzle out. Hence, the AI slogan often turns out to be just a marketing tactic to secure funding",

Let's say that some of them are genuine for the innovation of technology and use AI for the market that they're about to conquer. But most of these projects are just the same as those newly launched projects during the hype of meme coins. As you know in this market, whenever something new is on the trend, many developers will go that path and will take advantage of it for them to market the project until it stays there, yes, just for the market and be tradable until it has got enough value for them to dump the token that's made for that ai project. It sucks and sad but that's the reality on this market where it's already saturated for every niche that one can think.",

If we think about investing in new projects, this seems to be the best option to take but of course, research is very important as we can't deny the fact that scammers will also be taking advantage of the situation why AI is on the hyped condition. Many people had already used this project and it looks like they are comfortable using it - you can hear some good feedback as well regarding chatGPT.We can say that this new technology innovation is relevant to the current era and it make us a little bit easier especially if you are in doing paper works and typing.",

Throw a complex problems to ChatGPT and it should still break for sure plus considering that business owners should still know if that code generated by AI is even reliable. I do not have a good projects of a suggestion so far due to craze of AI these days, but my opinion all in all is that it is going to help devs, but it is not going to entirely replace them.",

I don't know but i am not really convinced, that the whole AI narrative is really the next huge thing, especially in crypto. I mean back in November or Dezember of 2022 when ChatGPT was first released and everyone was surprised how good the quality of it's answers were most of the time, there definitely was a big hype for AI within the crypto community too. As always with big hypes and trends, new crypto projects that were focused on AI where created back then to hop on the hype train. Obviously those projects mostly only had AI in their name and were only created to earn some quick money from naive investors because a \"real\" projects needs development time.At the moment i feel that the whole AI narrative is not so in the focus anymore.",

Though note as I have already stated, the example you gave, robot and payment mechanism, can simply be solved without any blockchain or token, there is no significant utility that it could give. If we analyze what drives AI hype, nowadays, is a mainly for-profit company that builds an awesome product and offers the flexibility to build something on top of the program. That is zero utility and contribution that cryptocurrency projects have or could provide on AI development, especially recently.",
