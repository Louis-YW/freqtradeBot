This plagiarism show that this project have no idea and no real service/products and only to mislead investors/Service user. I checked out their social pages but didn't found any link.

      "body": "Yes, this is an identical copy of the DarkCoin (DASH) whitepaper. They even used the same graphics from the original WP. However, if we take a closer look at the upper-left section of the image, we can spot a discrepancy. \"Hellar\" in the title is written in a different font, and just below that, \"Darkcoins\" still appears in the subtitle. This clearly proves a blatant attempt to plagiarize someone else's work and mislead potential investors. Source: https://hellarwiki.notion.site/Hellar-WhitePaper-d3c843b9b4e942b892d70ca1de9b9adbThis definitely warrants a negative tag!",

They deleted the post of one of the people who advised members to scan their wallets for viruses after downloading it. On the Hellar website, there is a wallet that anyone can download on Windows or MacOS. They could have answered him instead of deleting his post, and this may indicate their evil intentions and that their wallets are not safe.There is conclusive evidence that they have a plagiarized whitepaper, so I will support your flag.",

      "body": "Good catch by the OP. It's yet another project with a lazy team that couldn't even create their own unique whitepaper. What can you expect from them other than an exit scam where they will run off with the participants funds after all. The situation is getting worse with the amount of these scam projects created and announced here in ANN section. The reason is that some people are still investing out of greed for quick profits while these project owners only aim to gather a large sum of money from investors and then disappear.It's important to do a good research before investing in any new project or even just trading their tokens. Some of the things you should do include reading their whitepaper, visiting their community if they have one(compare if it has real chat or only bots and fake accounts), and checking their smart contracts for any suspicious or malicious code.",

I actually forgot to open a flag accusation against them but with all these overwhelming evidence, this is indeed a 100% scam. The funny thing is, they in fact so lazy to replace or to do anything that they blatantly copied everything from a well-known crypto.Will edit the post and add the flag!

I remembered around 2-3 years ago I was really into busting scams in the forum. I guess my real-life priorities got the best of me but I guess I'm back! Every once in a while, I will definitely scan the ANN section to look into ANNs manually and check their WPs and team members for potential plagiarized posts or fake team members.This aint the last time you'll be hearing from me! Appreciate it, thanks Ultra!",

If such a thing should happen and there is a full repetition word for word, captions for captions on the white paper then there is every possibility that both project  have something in common. It is either the both projects are owned by one person or their is a relationship between both projects for them to have used the same content which seems as if the other was caught in the act of plagiarism. Otherwise what would make a project team committing such blunders in a new project without doing any proper work on their project. This is a very terrible mistake they have made",
