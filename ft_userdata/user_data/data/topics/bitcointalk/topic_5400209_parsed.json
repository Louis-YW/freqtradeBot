  "content": "there are some things that we can agree on. Web3 is: Decentralized – Web3 will be owned by the people, developed for the people;Permissionless – anyone and everyone can get involved with a deconstruction of the restricting mechanisms of Web2;With built-in payments – the boundless, frictionless movement of money with an emphasis on peer-to-peer trading. the role of programmers has changed slightly with this generation of the internet. They’ll no longer create and deploy applications that rely on a single server or cloud-based provider. Instead, Web3 applications will be designed to run on blockchains, decentralized networks consisting of many peer-to-peer nodes.Whether you love it or you hate it, this fast-approaching ‘internet of the fourth dimension’ is likely to come with some big changes to how we interact with the internet.",
