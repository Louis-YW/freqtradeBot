      "body": "I checked this Linea faucet that you are talking about and I said that it should be in my metamask wallet, that's why this is the reason why I can't continue to advertise it in my metamask because it could harm my desktop and I might even become a victim of phishing because of what you posted OP.So for those who try to add this to your network in your metamask, please research carefully before doing it in your metamask account. So for me it's not okay, based on what I've seen.",
