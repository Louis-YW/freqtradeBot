Tokens hurt the reputation of Ethereum and other Etheruem-based (evm) chains from the dawn of ICOs to today. While knowledge about tokens has matured (in the sense that people should by now know that Tokens are completely irrelevant to the trust maintained by the main-net currency) I do not believe at all that tokens would nor should give the token deployed on the bitcoin blockchain anymore trust than being deployed on any other blockchain, nor would it increase the trust in Bitcoin (if anything it would hurt it, as with the enabling of Tokens means the enabling of new scams/schemes, as we have seen on other chains like Ethereum).Quote from: YUriy1991 on March 29, 2023, 09:07:05 AMQuote from: BenCodie on March 29, 2023, 09:03:03 AMQuote from: YUriy1991 on March 29, 2023, 09:00:45 AMIn my opinion, While it is possible to create tokens on the Bitcoin network, the process is not as straightforward as on other networks, and transaction fees can be high.

Yes, I've heard of Liquid and Omni layer (however I can't find any direct links for omni layer to reference. Can you?). They aren't the same as the solution provided by Ethereum (tokens directly on the main-net) and a solution to create a token directly on the Bitcoin main-net does not yet exist. I believe that this is what Taro is aiming to achieve.",

Using the same scenario, if it going to start leveraged for paying fees for collectibles and other digital assets, isn't it will put more load on the BTC blockchain? You raise a fantastic point! The answer will circle back to \"priority\". The highest fees paid will get confirmed the fastest. The way ordinals (dubbed \"bitcoin nfts\" but aren't really nfts) work and how they are working kind of outside of the blockchain right now, is that they are placed inside a block with the remaining space. This way, ordinals don't take away from transfer transactions, rather using up the remaining space. In terms of tokens, I believe that the purpose of zkSTARK proofs is to compress transaction data to help eliminate the possibility of effecting scalability. How exactly it will be implemented into blocks is something I have not fully dug into yet. I'm not sure if any of zkSTARK/Taro documentation/posts address this yet or if I have just not read it yet (I'm sure they have at this stage, I'll come back if I ever look further into it in my spare time)",

If you create a token based on bitcoin, it is also shitcoin and not bitcoin, there are no guarantees. Projects and tokens are created only to scam and disappear. I am not a developer, but I think it is still possible to deploy tokens on bitcoin, but it is more difficult and expensive, so developers are afraid to deploy on the bitcoin network. Because if the project fails, they will suffer heavy losses and lose time, while using the altcoin's network saves many things.",
