Feel free to send me your offerYour project should be good and has criteria to be listed here.  Also its easy to apply on coingecko just fill up their applicatiom form.  If you pass the requirements then they will list it.  Of course your project has good volume and has considerable amount of potentials. If you noticed some listed easily cause their project got listed on a lot of dex and cex.  More volume of your project on trading can be notice easily.",
