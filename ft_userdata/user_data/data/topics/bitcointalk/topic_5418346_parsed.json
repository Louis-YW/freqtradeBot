This is sick to my stomach that they would even name this guy the World’s Dirtiest Man. It's an insult to human society to have someone refuse to take a shower simply because of a few emotional setbacks. The man could have asked for him but no it took a while to convince this guy to finally take a shower after 60 years is absurd and should have been arrested since the first year he began with this nonsense. The problem was not solved by isolating the old man, instead, they could have locked him up and other prisoners would have forced his disgusting self to shower.",
