  "content": "We can make a decision as a plan to guide our life. The biggest concern of most job seekers is what to do after they retire. This question comes to the mind of most of the employees very late, almost before retirement. I think leisure time should be planned from the start of employment. Planning at the beginning gives you longer time to make the plan a success.As part of the plan we can build a self-pension fund. Which will be governed by DCA system and will have a long tenure till retirement (about 25-30 years). An employee has 25-30 years of service. Then he retires, in many cases it is less or more than 25-30. If we build a self-pension fund early in our working life, we can extend it to about 30 years. This fund we can manage through monthly savings where a certain amount of income will be saved regularly. It may be 10% of income or more. If a person's income is $1000 then 10% of $1000 is $100, so in 30 years his savings will be $100×12×30=$36,000. Assuming 2x the profit in 30 years we get a return of at least $72,000 which I think would be enough for a retired person to live on.Of course this is part of the long term plan and the holding period is 30 years which is too much. But if we use it as a retirement plan, it won't seem like much time.",

That need an effort to keep saving some amount from their salary in Bitcoin and hold it until they pension so they will have the profit when the time is come. They can get more money besides of their pension because they have an investment in Bitcoin that can give them the profit. Before they do that, they must know how much money they still have so they can know how much money they can use for Bitcoin investment. Without doing that, they will get difficulty to running their DCA system because they can not allocate some money for their Bitcoin investment.",

That way, if you grow that business, you might retire earlier than planned without worrying too much about Bitcoin’s price swings.",

      "body": "I agree that it's often good to make long-term plans when it's possible. But sometimes it's just not feasible or people are not organised enough, which is why I believe that things like pensions should be largely handled by the state and employer, not by employees. That being said, accumulating BTC for long-term holding isn't a bad idea, regardless of state policies on pensions. It can be a safety net, a college fund for kids, or perhaps become a retirement fund indeed.2x return with BTC over 30 years is very modest, I think we should expect much more. But also, I honestly don't think $72k is enough to retire, unless you're planning to still work part-time or have some sort of passive income at that point. Even assuming extremely modestly that you have a place to live and only spend $500 per month, that's just money for 12 years. Sure, maybe you'll live less or die after 12 years, but you can also easily live 20, 30 years. Also, $500 per month is not enough even for basic needs in many parts of the world.",

Pension funds usually prohibit withdrawing what you contribute or only allow you to do so, and penalize you heavily if you do so before the established retirement age. In addition, they usually provide tax advantages. As neither of these two things are met, nor any other that makes it look like a pension fund I would simply call it a wealth building plan using bitcoin, which is what many of us do on the forum.

If we build a self-pension fund early in our working life, we can extend it to about 30 years. In some professions there is a possibility that for 1 year of work they get 1.5 years in terms of the time needed to retire - but in ordinary professions people need 40+ years to retire. Maybe the rules are different somewhere, but in Europe people can usually retire at the age of 65, although there are plans to raise that limit to 67.Quote from: Jewan420 on September 12, 2024, 09:38:18 AMOf course this is part of the long term plan and the holding period is 30 years which is too much.

Of course, something like that is not impossible, but you should always keep in mind that we don't know what the future will bring, so it is always wise to invest only what we are ready to lose.",

What if you keep waiting for btc to dump before you buy and yet it keep increasing, does it mean you will wait forever? Although Bitcoin is volatile meaning we can take advantage of the dip in price to buy more, but we shouldn't  forget the fact that as it dips so does it rises. we can't neglect the rise and only think of the dip. This reason is has made Most people have lose interest in BTC investment or where unable to invest in due to disappointed because when you expect btc to dip to your satisfaction before buying them it keep appreciating and you feel it to expensive to buy. The slogan says yesterday was the bet time to buy and today is another best best time to buy. So you should think of combining the strategy by not focusing only on buying dip, you can answell implement the DCA and the lump sum to make it a complete investment strategy.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on September 12, 2024, 12:18:02 PMsomeone who saved $100 in every 12 months will have $1200 and imagine this person use this money to buy BTC at $17,000? They will have more BTC than someone who is buying from $57,000. You should think of a more realistic figure because btc has surpassed the $17k WMA. Like I said if you only think of BTC price to dip to the old price of bitcoin  before you invest, you may find it difficult to inves or feel left out.",

You can see how Bitcoin's history and try to compare from year to year Bitcoin's volatility is getting lower and it is estimated that in the future it will be lower and more stable.
