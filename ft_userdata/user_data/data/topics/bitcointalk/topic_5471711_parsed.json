  "content": "- In recent years, along with the development of the crypto market, a new method of analysis has emerged and evolved, known as Onchain analysis. It can be highly effective if we seriously invest time in studying it. Currently, I'm using this method in combination with technical analysis for my daily trading and long-term investments, and I find it really helpful for my purposes. - Below, I'll list the Onchain analysis websites I use and provide my personal opinions about them. I hope to receive some feedback and additional recommendations if you know of any other useful Onchain analysis websites or tools.Website|Features|Fee|User|Level of Assessment|_________________|___________________________________________________________________|______|_________________________|_________________|Coinmarketcap.com|Check all the details for any coins / Check specific wallet addresses along with the quantities they're holding|Free|Suitable for all|Highly recommend|___________________|_____________________________________________________________________________|______|______________________________|_____________________|defillama.com|Check TVL, Volume, Fees / Check Revenue of all of chains and Dapps on those chains|Free|Perfect for people looking to make a profit with Defi|Highly recommend|___________________|_____________________________________________________________________________|______|______________________________|_____________________|arkhamintelligence.com|Tracking personal wallets or investment fund wallets with exceptional features|Free|Suitable for all|Highly recommend|___________________|_____________________________________________________________________________|______|______________________________|_____________________|Cryptoquant.com|Check number of tokens push to the exchange / Statistics on the buying orselling cash flow of a coin / Check Miners' wallets tend to hold or sell / Check Stablecoin reserves of exchanges  |Free|Suitable for all|Recommend|___________________|_____________________________________________________________________________|______|______________________________|_____________________|Theblock.co|Check information about Spot, Future transaction volume or information about which Blockchain Stablecoin is on|Free|Suitable for traders|Nice to have|___________________|_____________________________________________________________________________|______|______________________________|_____________________|Coinglass.com|Where you can find LONG/SHORT spreads on exchanges, Liquidation, Funding Rates|Free|Suitable for traders|Recommend|___________________|_____________________________________________________________________________|______|______________________________|_____________________|token.unlocks.app|Review the coin unlock timetable and details|Free|Suitable for people who are investing new tokens|Highly recommend|___________________|_____________________________________________________________________________|______|______________________________|_____________________|coinfirm.com|Real-Time and Automated Blockchain Investigations for Crypto Assets|Free|Suitable for all|Recommend|___________________|_____________________________________________________________________________|______|______________________________|_____________________|elliptic.co|Identify the owner of a wallet and its source and destination of funds even as funds flow between blockchains or change assets.|Free|Suitable for all|Recommend|Hopefully, one of them can help improve your trading strategy.",

I prefer Coinmarketcap because it's been around longer, and its interface displays more intuitive parameters such as trends, news, and the fear and greed index right on the homepage. Both CoinMarketCap and Coingecko offer specific information about individual coins and the overall market, allowing us to perform our own analysis. Regarding data analysis services, I haven't come across them yet.

Otherwise some of your links like CMC are only good for finding where each shitcoin is traded not for analysis.There are also some third party tools that can help with technical analysis like the tradingview.com website.",

Emotions are an inaccurate measure, and I do not think that these services have a deep analysis of a large number of user bases, so they are a direct reflection of volume. / Volatility, which we can obtain using relative strength indicators, without the influence of a third party.Quote from: SeriouslyGiveaway on October 29, 2023, 03:14:59 AMQuote from: Yamane_Keto on October 27, 2023, 09:06:00 AMChain analysis is very expensive and its outputs are useful to traders, although in many cases the results are highly misleading as some of Glassnode's predictions were far from accurate.You really need to define what list you want to create.-  I want to make it clear that onchain analysis is just an additional tool in my trading approach; it's not a magic solution.

I do acknowledge that monitoring whale activities is significant as it can help anticipate future trends. Nevertheless, the transactions and behaviors of regular traders also offer valuable insights. - For instance, examining the performance of wallets holding less than 1 BTC can provide valuable statistics, helping us gauge the current market phase. It's like putting together a puzzle; if any piece, regardless of its size, is missing, the entire picture remains incomplete.",
