  "content": "Understanding the concept of fair odds is a pivotal step towards grasping why the vast majority of bettors continually face losses in the realm of sports betting.Let’s start with a simple coin toss, where each side holds a 50% chance (or 0.5) of landing face-up. The fair odds here would be 1/0.5 = 2.Now, consider a six-sided dice roll. Each face possesses a 16.67% chance (or 0.1667) of landing face-up. The fair odds, in this case, would amount to 1/0.1667 = 6. If you bet on five out of the six faces, you secure an impressive 83.33% chance (or 0.8333) of winning. The fair odds for this scenario equate to 1/0.8333 = 1.2. In other words, if you place a $1 bet on five out of the six faces and win, you’ll receive $1.2.At this point, you might be tempted to think that betting on favorites with low odds would ensure long-term success. However, that’s not the case.Let’s delve into some calculations:Expected Value (EV) in statistics is a predicted value of a variable. It is calculated as the sum of all possible values, each multiplied by the probability of its occurrence. In the context of sports betting, EV represents the long-term average payoff from an event. If the EV is positive (+EV), the bet holds the potential for profitability in the long run. Conversely, if the EV is negative (-EV), the bet is likely to result in losses over time.EV = (Fair Win Probability) x (Profit) - (Fair Loss Probability) x (Loss)Consider an operator that charges a commission for the dice roll game, causing the favorite to have odds of 1.17 and the underdog odds of 5.85.What would happen if you bet on the favorite in the long run?You’d end up facing losses. Let’s calculate:EV = 0.8333 x ($0.17) – 0.1667 x ($1) = -$0.025In this case, for every $1 bet, you’d lose $0.025.The result would be the same if you bet on the underdog with odds 5.85:EV = 0.1667 x ($4.85) – 0.8333 x ($1) = -$0.025It doesn’t matter whether you bet on low odds or high odds; in the long run, you’ll lose money.Now, imagine a tennis match where two players are evenly matched, each holding a 50% chance of winning. The fair odds for both players would be 2.0. However, bookmakers offer lower odds, such as 1.9 for each player. This discrepancy represents the bookmakers’ commission.Let’s calculate the EV with odds of 1.9:EV = 0.5 x ($0.9) - 0,5 x ($1) = -$0.05These examples highlight one of the main reasons why the majority of bettors struggle to make profits in sports betting. Placing bets based on guesswork simply doesn’t work!So, how can you break free from this cycle of losses?To beat the bookmakers, you need an EDGE, a strategic advantage that maximizes your chances of success. Here are some proven strategies that bettors can explore:Value Betting: This strategy involves identifying differences between perceived probabilities and bookmakers’ odds. Experienced bettors gain an advantage by strategically placing bets on outcomes with higher odds than the actual probability suggests. A simple way to find value bets is by comparing the odds offered by different bookmakers and considering the odds from “sharp bookmakers” such as Pinnacle as the “fair value.” If you find a significant difference, you have identified a value bet. This approach sets the foundation for long-term profitability, although some variance is expected.Arbitrage Betting: This simple yet clever technique capitalizes on variations in odds offered by different bookmakers. By placing wagers on all possible outcomes of an event, you guarantee a small profit, regardless of the result. However, it’s essential to be aware of potential risks, such as the cancellation of bets by bookmakers.Bonus Hunting: Exploit bookmakers’ bonuses to maximize your earnings. The term “bonus” refers to promotional offers (free bets or deposit matches) that bookmakers provide to new or existing customers as an incentive to sign up or continue using their services. You have to use the bonus hunting strategy along with value bet or arbitrage.In addition, effective risk management and emotional decision-making are paramount. It’s crucial to allocate your funds wisely, set a budget, and avoid impulsive bets driven by emotions.To consistently accumulate wealth with low risk, two standout approaches have proven their worth: Bonus Hunting and Arbitrage Betting. I have personally employed these strategies since 2011, experiencing consistent success with profits exceeding $1 million. However, it’s important to remember that individual results may vary.To further enhance your knowledge about bonus hunting and arbitrage to increase your chances of long-term profitability, I highly recommend checking out the eBook “Be The Hunter.” This comprehensive guide provides step-by-step instructions on implementing a robust betting strategy, managing risks, bonus hunting, and maximizing your earnings.Get your FREE copy at https://bethehunternow.com/how-to-make-money-in-sportsbetting",

      "body": "We have some discussion in the past about using expected value to calculate the profitability of a sport match. I do not bet often and I only bet with low amount of money, I do not think I should be so selective after any match can go the other way.What I mostly depended on in sport bet is analysis. Once I check the previous matches played by a team, check how often they are scoring in a league, check their head-to-head and knowing the players they are going to use. I use that to determine the match that I should bet on or not. Arbitrage betting may not be illegal, but if bookies know that a particular person is using the strategy, or having more than one account for arbitrage betting which can be against the gambling site, because most gambling sites tell their users to have only one account. Such person if known to the gambling site as an arbitrage bettor, the money won won't be paid, if having more than one account, his accounts would be merged. Doposit bonus hunting is good, but with one account per site would be profitable. But it is totally against the terms of service of gambling sites for their users to be using more than one account for bonus hunting.",

      "body": "Not only with sportsgambling but to all gambling games. Reason? Winning is never certain therefore playing more often would expose you to higher risk. Even if you happened to won big, it'll eventually be turned into loss; you won't win always. Higher exposure means higher risk unless you are lucky enough. Analysis would work indeed in sportsbetting but as we all know, anything could happen within a match. Even underdogs has chances to win and if you would be too greedy of winning because you have a lowe odd bet, then be prepared to suffer big time as well once the unexpected happens. We are all prone to greed and frustration.",

Nicely written intro until I realize it was actually a pitch about this \"Be The Hunter\". You find it BS because lets you believe that you'll lose money regardless of whether you bet on low odds or high odds. One good thing he told though is checking the odds on other bookies.

You need to realize that it's mathematically impossible to keep winning because the odds are against your own good and even at the best mathematical chance to win, you are ignoring the mathematical chance of losing on the long run anyway.Just take the flip of a coin for example, you said it's 50%, that's true, and you can act accordingly and win, but you are forgetting that it is also quite possible that you would be able to see 10-20-30 losses in a row there as well.

As a sports gambler myself I believe that taking breaks and only betting on games where you have a good knowledge about it can greatly increase your chances of winning. If you continuously bet on matches involving teams or players you are unfamiliar with, you'll likely end up losing in the long run.

This is because occasionally there are favorable odds available that could yield returns of x2 or x3, which are comparatively less risky than betting on a team with odds of 1.3 or 1.4 especially if you have limited knowledge about that team or you don't even know anything about the game, like just follow the lowest odd thinking that you'll win it easily!",
