This hand-signed print, mounted on an acrylic panel with an oak frame, ans is loadable with satoshis and won't exist more than 12 artworks.But this artwork is not just a pretty face - it also carries a powerful message. The story behind the piece is a commentary on the destructive nature of fiat currency, which has plagued humanity for far too long. As we work to overcome the COVID pandemic, let's not forget the other virus that has been spreading for decades: fiat currency.This artwork offers a solution - a \"vaccine\" for the fiat virus in the form of Bitcoin. With its decentralized, borderless nature, Bitcoin has the power to bring freedom and healing to the global community. Don't miss your chance to be a part of this important movement - make an offer today and own a piece of history!",

      "body": "I don't have many new images of this artwork, but it has been exhibited in London twice, as well as in Miami and Manchester. Despite this, I managed to find a couple of images. The inspiration for this piece came from a real skull I had in front of me, blending it with my emotions at the time while sketching it in a clinic.Another noteworthy aspect of this artwork is its significant size and the presence created by the acrylic glass and shadow gap. The oak frame complements it perfectly. Additionally, I drew inspiration from one of my earliest art collectors, who once expressed disbelief that this artwork was still available. I look forward to reconnecting with him soon! 11:11",

      "body": "Hey guys, the time is coming to share my story behind everything. People are starting to ask about it across various media platforms, wondering about my story and its origins. But the fight began back in 2015, that year, I fell into a coma, and it took a long time to recover - to speak, move around, and so on. Even as I opened my eyes, surrounded by many crying faces, I couldn't understand why they were crying. After weeks of pain, I gradually regained consciousness, but I still couldn't communicate properly. Instead, I tried to sketch out my feelings and needs, rough as they were, and people understood. That's when I realized the power of my art - a universal language like Bitcoin, usable worldwide.There's much more to tell, even after nine years, I can't shake off these memories. Little things still happen, like removing shards of glass from my body - the last two were taken out from my mouth, causing pain whenever I ate. This is my reality.Regarding this artwork, the bureaucratic struggle began swiftly. The person who drove over me while under the influence of drugs and alcohol also had good insurance, but they didn't want to pay up. They offered me a small settlement, threatening long legal battles if I refused. Out of this struggle emerged art, reflecting my experiences - leaving home, frozen accounts, and more. The fight continues, and I began sketching this artwork in the clinic. The doctor even gave me a model skull to sketch, a reminder of what happened to me. Despite my efforts, I often forget what happened yesterday, undergoing daily training for years to be where I am now. Art has become a part of me, without it, I fear losing myself.That's why I turned to Bitcoin art - it's my lifeline. If there are no lovers or collectors of my Bitcoin art, I may disappear one day, unable to survive, draw, or remember. It's a scary thought, every day, I fear forgetting everything. I even considered creating comics to tell my story and preserve it, perhaps opening a crowdfunding campaign to make it happen before it's too late.As for this artwork, it will be a historical record of who I am, showcasing why we must fight for financial freedom, care about privacy, and embrace Bitcoin. Through my experiences, I hope others can learn and understand.There isn't much information available about my story, perhaps you can find some fragments here and there, but there's no comprehensive account of what lies behind this artist. However, from time to time, I do share some insights and comments. I'm considering creating a thread behind the scenes and this will be the very first place where people can find the story. Perhaps you, my friends, have better ideas on how and where to share it. Just let me know. Thank you, everyone!",

This is more than just a display, it's a significant step forward. Thank you, @Bitbollo, for taking such good care of this artwork. I appreciate everything you do, while Bitbollo may not ask for anything, I would be delighted if you could add the main bitcoin and lightning addresses, perhaps start a new thread where we can track everything. After the exhibition, I plan to lend the artwork to Bitbollo for a year, or perhaps half, and I will cover the shipping costs so it can be enjoyed at more places and possibly for extended exhibitions. Thank you for all the information about the event.Without you, a post like this wouldn‚Äôt be possible, I appreciate it immensely.

      "body": "Quote from: mx12.levins on April 25, 2024, 12:22:33 PM...Dear mx12.levins, thank you for your message and your availability in this initiative  FIAT VIRUS AGAINST HUMANITY has been on my \"list\" for a long time. Being able to purchase it was a little wish of mine come true There are many tools to \"explain\" what bitcoin is and its peculiarities. I believe that art is one of these.As I have said several times in the Italian section, there is practically no trace of this technology IRL except to speak of it in a negative way. Being able to provide a space for discussions and provide a point of view that is different from this narrative is a nice gesture that can benefit the entire community.I hope that from this initiative we can find many interesting ideas both for those who know the sector and for those who are interfacing for the first time.As we would say here in Italy: Ad Maiora!",
