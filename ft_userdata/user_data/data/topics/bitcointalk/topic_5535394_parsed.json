  "content": "Hello everyone,I hope I’m not writing in the wrong thread; if so, please excuse me.I recently read about the new integration of USDT on the Bitcoin blockchain, made possible by Taproot addresses and the Lightning Network.However, I couldn’t figure out how to actually move and use my USDT within the Bitcoin network, and I haven’t seen any services or exchanges that support this integration yet.Did I miss something, or am I just looking in the wrong direction? Could you guys kindly point me to the right resources to explore this integration practically?Thanks!",

I made a topic about this when Tether first announced that they'll support Taproot assets: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5528322.0;topicseenBut until now, I don't believe it's used anywhere yet. It's just something they're planning to launch, not sure when.",
