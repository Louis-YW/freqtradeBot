A Bitcoin wallet doesn't support Forkcoins, you're going to need to use the respective Forkcoin wallets. I wrote a topic about this years ago. The prices in that topic are outdated, but the warnings are still valid. Move your Bitcoins to a safe new wallet before doing anything Forkcoin related, and learn what the lack of replay protection means before doing anything else.",
