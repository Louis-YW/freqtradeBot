I'm currently trying to transfer my bitcoin from an exchange to a cold wallet for the first time, but I'm wondering if it's safe to keep everything in one wallet from one company.If you own thousands of BTC, you most probably want a dedicated, airgapped machine that uses nothing but Bitcoin Core or Electrum to generate addresses where you deposit your funds.Whenever you want to spend them, you create the transaction, put it on a flash drive, bring that flash drive to a different machine which does have internet access and broadcast it from there. You will also want your own node such that when broadcasting large Bitcoin transactions to the Bitcoin network, they aren't tied to your IP address - something that can put you at personal / targeted risk of attacks (digital and physical).You will also absolutely want to look into multisig through multiple such airgapped, cold storage machines.My guess though, is that some of the large Bitcoin investors don't do this, instead they are probably so wealthy that they leave their BTC with an exchange or personal broker, in an insured fashion. Such that if the funds go missing or anything else happens to them, they can sue them to death. Just a hypothesis, though.",

Cold storage, maybe with multisig would be the proper way. Also splitting, especially to not attract attention for the amount held in one address, may be in order. HW is great for smaller amounts, like what they'd keep with them when going out.However, I would also not be surprised if there are whales keeping their coins at exchanges (!), especially in order to use them for trading, earning more, and, why not, manipulating the market a little when they can. Clearly, I talk here about whales who don't rely only on bitcoin for having all the goods they want in this life.But.. this is how I imagine them. How do they behave in reality... we may never know.",

Whales have different perspective and opinion about protecting there money. Maybe some of them is spreading there Bitcoin in multiple wallet and some is using just one wallet to easily securing it. Having multiple wallet means you have multiple assets that needs to be protected. The only advantage of using multiple wallet was you can’t loss everything with one hack.",

I'm currently trying to transfer my bitcoin from an exchange to a cold wallet for the first time, but I'm wondering if it's safe to keep everything in one wallet from one company.Every whale has its own way of protecting its bitcoins and we will never know its plans. Maybe they can explain what the plan is but not with details because it's their secret.But if I were a whale and had, let's say 1000 BTC that I just made from trading, I would split it into pieces.I'll be using 1/3 on Trezor, 1/3 on Ledger, 1/3 on Bitcoin Core, and a few small pieces in the wallet I have on my phone. And the rest of the rest I will keep in my trading account to trade again and try to make more BTC. The way you use it is fine to keep everything in one wallet if that makes you comfortable. But if not, you can divide it into several parts. It's all about convenience in storing all your BTC; you need to find it yourself.",

Millions of people use hardwallet, but if it's safer for you, then no one forbids storing btc on several wallets. It is not necessary to follow the examples of whales for this.",
