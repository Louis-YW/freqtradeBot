  "content": "Now that the votes have been counted, I thought it would be worthwhile to have a more graphical representation of the results.I made a graph for each of the 10 categories, as well as a final one with combined votes.I figured this would take me maybe 45 minutes, but 6 hours later and I was still battling with matplotlib to produce that final graph. Anyway, I think the effort was worth it, and I hope that these are interesting for some of you to look at.",

I could swear there was, and I was personally expecting some known banned member from last year to manage to \"win\" that specific category.Yeah, there was a category called \"fail of the year\" but it didnt include any banned members in it as such, actually thats not very important to know as well. We can just take examples of top failed experiments made in the crypto space for the particular year so that it doesnt get repeated again Btw, I m surprised to see nc50lc in the last position for \"bitcoin geek\" title/category. He is actually very knowledgable",

Those didn't have prizes attached to them (there were 30 prizes this year: one for each of the 3 places in each of the 10 \"real\" categories). Also, I didn't want the final graph to be a mixture of \"people\" and \"things\" (not that people aren't things, of course, but you get what I'm saying).

He is actually very knowledgable  That may well be true, but from what I saw there were a lot of voters who probably don't frequent the sections nc50lc does, and his name probably didn't come to their mind immediately--and that's if they knew his name at all.  I honestly can't remember the last time I saw one of his posts.Props on the graphs, PowerGlove.  I always like to see pretty pictures when I'm lookin' at data, know what I mean?And I swear, I still don't know what all those categories are supposed to represent.  I'm not even sure if \"antihero\" is a concept that most members could figure out someone appropriate to stick in it.  Royse777 was certainly controversial this year, but I would not consider him an antihero.  I can't even think of someone I'd vote for in that one.  Maybe it should be changed to Blackest Sheep or something like that.",

Every other category was my real opinion but this particular category was just a popular vote for me. Maybe that gets removed if they decide to do the awards next year. Seems like a confusing category anyways. FYI to all those who voted me Miss Bitcointalk let me say again I HAVE A COCK, it might be small but it's there!!!",

In my opinion, they are Miss Bitcointalk [should be one] because we can clearly differentiate the gender. But I don't know why one of them doesn't win this category, someone has to answer, maybe.QuoteAlthough girls are now in the minority on Bitcointalk, 5 to 1, they are still wonderful, interesting and important to us.
