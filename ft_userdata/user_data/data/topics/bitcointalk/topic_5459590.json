It's said that he pegged BTC. But they are not real bitcoins, as there is only one bitcoin; any other ones are altcoins, as already explained by Charles-Tim. Don't get deceived; always hold your Bitcoin, as those pegged can be depegged anytime and the value might turn down to zero. As their price is being backed up by the developers, if the project that pegged it fails today, then the price will definitely be no different from other shitcoins out there. We can use UST as an example of what happens to peg tokens; they're supposed to be equal to $1, but the Luna crash has made it otherwise.",

You shouldn't mistake wBTC for BTC's alternate, an altcoin is an altcoin nothing more.Like I said wBTC is an altcoin and as such the price can change at any time; I for one wouldn't want to gamble with my money by purchasing a cheap copy. Btw, what's there? If you're to buy any coin why not just go for the original? wBTC ≠ BTC I have seen a lot of people make that mistake thinking they are both the same thing since it's pegged to BTC, mostly when they are to withdraw their coin from an exchange.",

Can’t say if that’s the proper name for the activity but, it is what it is as, it typically explains the situation in simple terms.Pegging simply refers to having the value of a commodity maintained by the value of another. Don’t know if you got it but, that’s the idea. Like you’ve stated in OP, you have wBTC at $20 and so is BTC. The value keeps being maintained through all market conditions. It’s called pegging and you can say wBTC is BTC pegged.Any commodity could be pegged this way but that doesn’t mean they assume the same value. wBTC is by far an altcoin and as such, it can’t be seen in the same way.",

You never know what they do with the custodian party to back their token. They can back the token with less than 1:1 ratio and the token can be de-pegged when it is brought to the light.Their team advertise that they do it to bring Bitcoin to DeFi but why Bitcoin need to exist in DeFi which is for altcoins?Wrapped Bitcoin is a token, an altcoin, not Bitcoin. You don't have to buy the token and have risk that it will be de-pegged. If you want to join DeFi, buy any token on ERC20 like USDT, ETH and you have that token on its main chain.Buy WBTC and think you have BTC but it's not bitcoin.",

Wrapped Bitcoin was dipegged multiple times in the last 24 hours. The coin was developed by a company named Bitgo. Buying wrapped bitcoin means buying an altcoin that can be zeroed anytime. The current Bitcoin price is over 30K, and the current wrapped Bitcoin price is around 23K. I won't be surprised if wrapped Bitcoin loses its value. I consider it a scam coin. Do not buy wrapped bitcoin in any case. There is no use case for it. Do not stake your coin in centralized exchanges to get some profit. This greediness will lead you into a big lose.",

So, dear OP i have suggestion that you should then stick to the BTC.And, as many other members had indicated that WBTC is a ALT coin then simply you have to consider the logic of how BTC effected the ALTs.

There's a possibility that wBTC will be gone out of its price and that's why if you're wanting to hold it, just hold Bitcoin - the OG and the real one and not with these wrapped bitcoins.",
