Banks claim to be blocking people and businesses because of the FTX collapse. How many banks have they stopped because of the ugly past of many UK banks that went insolvent?The problem of one establishment out of many should never be a yardstick in judging others. For me, these banks are anti-crypto and their actions are high level of hypocrisy.",

The so called crypto-friendly govs like El Salvador and St. Kitts are crypto friendly only because they are using this to attract crypto investors and there is nothing wrong with that... However, these investors don't really prefer countries like El Salvador to make investments, they prefer countries such as France, USA, Germany, UK etc... Let's be honest El Salvador is not a country most of us would dream of living in. In this big picture, as far as I understood it, the UK simply don't give a damn about crypto investors. :/ I guess they don't need our money.",

The collapse of these entities would be used to spread misinformation or rather stereotypes about bitcoin just to make people think twice about them. Just like what _act_ said there are many that even use bitcoin or cryptocurrency outside banks.

What I noticed was that the money deducted as fee was very high, just like if you want to withdraw bitcoin from exchanges. The banks are even using the means to earn.",

They will always do the bidding of the political class. The political class wants to control everything about the citizens including how they keep or save their own money. Banks like Nationwide are placing some restrictions like not allowing customers to buy cryptocurrency with debit or credit cards. They have also restricted the amount that can be transacted using cryptos. Their common excuse will be that they are protecting citizens from scams or loss of funds caused by the fall of exchanges. If the government really wants to protect its citizens from fraudulent exchanges, it should promote awareness programs that encourage citizens to use decentralized platforms to engage in bitcoin transactions. FTX will always be the defense of the government in its selfish quest to silence crypto.",

Yes, banks decide for you how you can manage your own money, we already know this, which is why we are here.And, frankly, the mentioned Binance and Coinbase, as for me, do not look any better than banks, these are the same centralized organizations that decide for you how you can manage your money.The real bitcoin is only on the bitcoin blockchain. All these centralized intermediaries, who in reality control all your money by 100%, will behave as they want, because they can.If you want to retain the right to manage your money, try to deal with such centralized intermediaries as little as possible.",

Perhaps, if they notice the correspondence of citizens using more of cryptocurrencies, the taxes would be increased, stricter rules would be set.It should be considered more or less a test to see usage and acceptance from the citizens. It is to also keep an eye on possible criminal minds and transactions too.

Consequently, it is uncommon for them to endorse decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It is unrealistic to expect widespread support for Bitcoin from banks and governments since they are uncomfortable with its inherent lack of control. Bitcoin's decentralized nature makes it impossible for them to exercise authority over it, which goes against their preferred system of control. As a result, they are likely to continue finding excuses to hinder Bitcoin's progress and undermine its viability, despite their inability to fully ban it.",
