  "content": "Hardware wallet became more popular today after the FTX failure because it reminds again all user to not keep money on exchange or any wallet that they don’t have control its private key.I’m planning to buy my hardware wallet since there’s a Black Friday sale until Monday on Trezor shop but my country is not supported anymore to make any order. I do some search online and I found a solution. It adds extra cost to shipping but it’s worth it rather than purchasing on local seller that is not a licensed distributor that gives risk on my wallet before I even use it.Answer: Drop shipping Service I found a trusted company (https://www.shippingcart.com/) that doing this service in my country with good feedback and I think there are same company to yours that offering same service. I’m planning to organized a group buy on our local board and my social account to share the shipping fee within the participants. I think the total cost that we will spend on this service will be close to the amount that we will save on the Black Friday discount which is why buying now while sale is the perfect way to do this.Happy shopping!",
