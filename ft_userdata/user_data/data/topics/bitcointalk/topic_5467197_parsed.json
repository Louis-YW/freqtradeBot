You'll get the numbers that they are promising for your subscribers.But the real deal here is the organic followers and subscribers that you'll be getting and that's the best deal that a content creator will get through his/her own hard work.Having that number of subscribers as you start could give you more encouragement because you'll see the numbers. But doing it with organic ones as you start and you're doing it slowly but surely will give you better motivation.",
