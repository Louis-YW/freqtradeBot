  "content": "QuoteWhen the students at Hermidale Public School in western New South Wales planted 85 hectares of wheat at the beginning of the year, harvest seemed a lifetime away.The children dreamed of raising enough money to fund an excursion to the beach, but never thought they'd make enough money to send the whole school around the country.\"We can't believe what we have been able to pull off,\" teacher Rebekah Coddington said.Seven students from kindergarten to Year 6 attend Hermidale Public School, more than 600 kilometres west of Sydney.The town had endured an anxious few weeks as flooding has engulfed much of western NSW, but Hermidale was spared the worst and this week the headers rolled out for the harvest.Local farmers gave up time and machinery to strip the kids' crop.\"We didn't get bogged once, which was really great,\" local farmer and parent Darren Mudford said.Ms Coddington said the children had \"been given the opportunity of a lifetime\".\"Every member of our small community has contributed in some way, whether it be small or large, and it's been amazing to see it come together and to finally get the crop off,\" she said.Unique learning experienceFor most of the year, students swapped their school uniforms for work shirts and boots to tend to the paddock.The land was donated by a former student and while the students weren't able to be operating the machines, they watched on as their hard work paid off.\"It was so exciting to get to come down and see the headers in the paddock and learn how they work and then watch our grain go off in the trucks,\" Year 6 student Ruby Mudford said. The students were then able to visit the grain depot to see their grain being tested, graded and weighed.Hard work pays offThe students' wheat crop is expected to raise up to $50,000.About 170 tonnes of prime hard wheat was taken to the local grain depot where it will be stored before it is sold.Former student Elly Jeffery just happened to be working at the local grain depot when the students' crop came in.\"It's very high in protein, the protein went 13.9 and the grade of wheat went H2, which is a really good grade of wheat,\" she said.About 1,700 loaves of bread can be made from 1 tonne of wheat, meaning the students at Hermidale Public School have effectively provided enough grain to make 290,000 loaves of bread. \"We can't believe the tonnage,\" Ms Coddington said.Funds from the wheat sale will be given to the school's P&C for its educational, social and cultural immersion project, which sends students on excursions around the country.The school hopes to travel to Newcastle early in the new year to see their wheat being loaded onto a ship at the port.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-11-27/nsw-hermidale-public-school-wheat-crop-sale-to-fund-excursions/101688622....Farming land was donated by a school alumnus, local farmers volunteered to provide equipment and the local community contributed towards helping school children grow 170 tons of wheat valued at around $50,000 to fund future excursions around the country. Aside from financial gain, this type of vocational program could also provide valuable learning and life experience for youth.Australia isn't the first to attempt this type of program. Brazil had incorporated communal gardens in city regions to create jobs and produce food locally, making regions less dependent upon foreign food imports. If there are future food shortages and food production becomes deflationary in nature off global production declining. Perhaps this could become a more common trend for many nations of the world who previously relied heavily upon food imports.States and governments hold large quantities of land in trust which could be donated to these types of programs to produce higher quantities of food in emergencies. Local farmers might also be incentivized to provide equipment and manpower on an incentive basis.",

It was a good harvest since they will have more than enough for more excursions as this will help them in learning well, it will also encourage them to put in some of their time into agriculture when they are grown up. In my country importation of foods is high and that is why inflation is hitting our economy seriously because there are small people into farming and importation devalues our currency.Presently,base on the inflation people are now going back to farming because they see it as a means of survival and making profit. There is so much money in farming but people have neglect this and are looking for office jobs everywhere, farming can be used to boost up the economy of a country.",

      "body": "Should we say the recent events of people turning back to agriculture and farming due to lingering or the anticipated recession. I have seen government initiatives of recent trying to help farmers with incentives for farming particularly the irregational wheat farming. Also schools are not left out because I could testify that most universities here in Nigeria are given students of Agricultural related courses Farm lands from the large hectares of the school's. Other students could even pay as low as 2,000 naira ($170) to get 1 hectare. This has help some students from average homes carter for there needs and sometimes pay tuition fees.Outside school environment, business people this days are known to be buying agriculture produce for hoarding. Before this was bad for the economy because of the lack of large produce. But with the large number of produce even during winter period through irregation hoarders cannot increase the fee anyhow.The question now is are people turning towards agriculture because of the issues in energy/gas or because of the last recession experience??",

It's just sad that our government is not that supportive of agricultural sectors, instead of supporting local farmers they buy their lands to create subdivisions, export agricultural products, and let farmers sell their crops for a lesser price. This is also one of the reasons why fruits and vegetables are really expensive nowadays. May this be an eye-opener, if the agricultural sector is supported well by the government it can help sustain the economy.",

There is huge market in the GMO, modern techniques calling for high quality seed germination by applying scientific knowledge and ongoing research. In America most of the people are trying to be in the race of white collar jobs. However, nobody wants to keep doing agriculture due to status symbol or whatever thinking they might have behind it. However, if they try to enforce more and more agriculture associated education and ask families to attend more farming then it could change the entire scenario explained above.",

The land was given, the machinery was given, and probably the initial capital to buy the wheat seeds and even watering it must have been covered and on top of that, do we really believe kids ranging between kindergarden to year 6 ended up driving those tractors? Of course not.So, what we have is bunch of kids doing maybe just a bit of manual labour, like carrying some hay or something here and there, but 90%+ of the job was done by others and the capital required was paid by others, so the kids made 50k in profit thanks to that. If it was a real farmer, all that extra 50k would have gone to machinery and land and seeds etc etc.",

Most farmers in the rural areas have emigrated to urban areas because they want to work in the oil and gas sector. Many major farms have closed down because the government is now focusing on the oil and gas sector, while they abandon the vital agricultural sector.  Currently we are now relying mostly on other countries for food which has led to unfavorable balance of payment and overdependence on the dollars. A rich country is the one that has the ability to produce the food the country consumes. This program is a very good initiative. It would not only inculcate agricultural skills in the students but it can boast food production. Such program in my country can reduce crime because most unemployed youth have now embraced crime. But if government can use massive uncultivated lands to start up program like this, most youths would become gainfully employed.",

When going into investments, there are some risks you would just have to come across and that’s why planning and some research is important. With agriculture, there are various pesticides used in destroying harmful bugs and other things harmful to the plants. The only setback I see to agricultural investments is the weather which exactly can’t be controlled by man.",

In fact, private farming, in the optimistic case, allows you to more or less support yourself and your family, and sell a small part of the surplus to your neighbors ... At a very low price.I'm just familiar with agriculture, and I will say that as an option for COMMERCIAL earnings - for small farms it is almost unrealizable, unfortunately.For example, I will say from this area but in a slightly different direction - milk. Conventionally, milk costs 1 dollar for 1 liter. And the purchase price from private owners who have 1-2 cows is only .... 5-15 cents per liter.In a word - for general development and conditional income - you can do business, build a business - no. More precisely, you can but the scale must be multiplied by 1000000",

The balcony was glazed and looked like an almost finished \"greenhouse\" for growing vegetables. Part of my balcony was stagnant, and a large amount of sun created a greenhouse effect. The way out was simple - cover the sun with PLANTED food  Were bought and installed near the glazing - decorative shelving, a hydropump irrigation system, small cells for growing \"crop\". From April to September I had mine:- salad- dill- parsley- green arrow bow- arugula- cilantro- Strawberry...as well as a great aroma on the balcony So the decision has the right to life. And in reality, we bought only those vegetables that we did not grow.PS Cheri wanted to grow, but did not have time, he moved.",
