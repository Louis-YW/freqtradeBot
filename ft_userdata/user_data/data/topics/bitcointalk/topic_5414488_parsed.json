Women have different reasons for what they do and the actions following that and it is also funny with deep meaning attached to wearing red in a wedding. This cousin and friend longtime ago have some good hook up at night like one time love escapade with the (now the groom of the other girl) before she met the guy as they are deciding to marry. The other lady asking the sister not to marry that man because she has slept with him in the past but the sister did not accept to let the groom go so she decide to come to wedding wearing red colour dress which meaning to announce to the public she first slept with the man but read what the bride did, I like the smart idea   The Bride Outsmarts Her",
