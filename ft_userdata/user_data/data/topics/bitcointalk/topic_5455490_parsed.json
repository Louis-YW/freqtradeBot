I can see that you only have 2 activity and 2 posts. This shows you are only interested in promoting your services and get paid for it. But you are not on the right board. Your post is not gaining good number of views. Only 52 people have read it.Look at the bottom left of this post you will see an option to move topic so that you can move this thread to services board as hugeblack has recommended above.",

But you know that you must first show elegance to your prospect clients here in the forum.Because you have a long experience but you have no record to show that you have served clients using your skills, or if you don't have one you should first build trust here on this platform, just a piece of advise only.",

What can I do to prove I am just an honest person looking for legitimate projects to work on?I have just been busy maintaining both the testnet and public Cryptops blockchains while advancing an application that runs on them and have not had much time for social media. I am now pivoting into a new project and looking forward to earning the trust of the bitcoincointalk community.The new project is decentralized community blockchain marketplaces if anyone is interested in using blockchain technology to advance/enhance the capabilities of online social media platforms for the benefit of the members of their communities (not spamming just genuinely looking to build a community that wants to make this project happen).",

The sites looks more suspicious OP and very poor design. you made mention of executing many projects, why not present them if they could be able to make a good presentation for you as the other two website you claimed you designed are nothing fit to convince a prospective client in coming your way. If possible, any reputable member here to vouch for the deal you have had with them in the past can give you a pass for deals.",
