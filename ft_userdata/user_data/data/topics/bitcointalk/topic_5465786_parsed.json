The number of alt coins in existence nowadays is crazy, over 30k? Maybe slightly more when you count in the smart contracts, tokens and NFTs.. It's just becoming more ridiculous with the exception of some very few useful projects.In short, if you'd like to compete in this highly-saturated market, you have to do more instead of writing some text, providing an explorer, a github, a wallet and a discord for a new coin..",

Block reward for miners will be set at 9 coins per block at the beginning.Mainnet launch countdown: https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/launch?iso=20230908T13&p0=4508&msg=PowBlocks+Mainnet+Launch&font=slab&csz=1",
