And sometimes FUD break a stable market to volatile as mk4 said about the news which may create FUD among the traders. So we should wait for some more hourly charts to observe the current situation. And already Bitcoin pumped back to above 30K.2. This little dump can't be a sign to end the second quarter on Bear because from last week Bitcoin have done a nice growth and people started accumulating Bitcoin for the upcoming Bull Season. I am expecting a few dumps are remaining before the Bullrun which will be some small correction.3. Bitcoin can't be predicted only based on the monthly chart. We can go more upward in July and obviously in the 3rd Quarter as we can see a vital growth in weekly chart. Already Bitcoin passed a long Bear Season and it's time to move to make history again.",

Yes, so that is why we see some price drop in bitcoin at least this is the best explanation I can come up with(I may be wrong but I do not see any other explanation). I have checked it on many news now that it is because of the spot bitcoin ETF that the United States SEC did not approve. mk4 is very correct about this. The bitcoin spot ETF that SEC turned down has been the reason bitcoin price decreased from over $31000 to below $29500. https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-overreacting-sec-etf-filings-btc-price-dives-6The price has risen back a little and it is at $30400 after it rose to $30500 recently.",

This is why implementing ETF is still not possible with SEC, they have so many issues about it. Again, don’t panic and see this as a buying phase again. ^ I agree and that is definitely right the line that I highlighted above, don't panic.Instead, make this opportunity to fulfill your bag again and hold it while it has a BTC price resistance. I suggest also doing a DCA or buying BTC, instead of making a single large purchase, you may consider spreading your investment over time using a strategy called dollar-cost averaging. This involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of the price. This strategy can help mitigate the risk of making a large investment at an unfavorable price. The main reason would be all CEXs were facing the same issue against on SEC which is government pushing it right now.",

I'll say the next quarter of the year will be good for Bitcoin because more people will be buying Bitcoin as the preparations start heating up for the halving. So many reasons can be presented as the reason behind the recent price falling but I see it as the market relaxing.We'll continue from where the market stop next month and keep rising, I see Bitcoin breaking pass $35k next month and also trading at the price for a very long time and not just testing it and retracing back below the price. Next month would be bullish that's my prediction.",

If you predict that price will move up to $35k in July but what do you feel if it won't move up, but down.Have to consider that if you buy and wait for its rise, you will feel disappointed. If you have a Long position and it falls down, you will have loss with your leverage trading by your cut loss or forced liquidation.I look a wider view, till 2024 halving and I DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) to stack more bitcoin in last 10 months till halving.https://dcabtc.com/",

They did not reject it but require additional information before they can consider more, then approve or reject it.The process takes time even companies will fill in additional information quickly.
