Also theymos did not mentioned to use the most popular trust wallet ¬† The problem with trust wallet is that it isn't an open source wallet, and since the warning reads \"do not keep your money in online accounts\", it will be kind of an irony to recommend a wallet that is owned by one of the \"online accounts\" we are warning people to take their money away from, because Binance crypto exchange are the owners of trust wallet.Quote from: UmerIdrees on November 15, 2022, 08:09:05 PMWhich wallet is meant by \"Trustless here \"?

You are in crypto and you do not want to have a hardware wallet is just a stupid thinking. Have one, if you have not yet. Losing even $10k worth of asset for not having a hardware wallet does not make sense. It's the safest.Desktop, mobile all are for the amounts you need for your weekly or monthly expense. When you are crating a wallet save the seed in the physical form. Use master public key to restore the wallet for checking balance and if you need to send coins then restore the wallet using the seed saved in physical form, once payment sent then remove the wallet. This way you will be able to feel a bit secure in both desktop or mobile wallet. In my opinion both devices are vulnerable.",

For example, buying from Amazon and eBay can be risky too.I basically have a rule, if someone else has had physical access to something which I intend to be used for sensitive things i.e storing Bitcoin, and you don't 100% trust either the hardware or the person handling it, you should probably consider it compromised. Now, with certain hardware you can verify or at least undo a lot of that. A hardware wallet would likely be a little more difficult. There's a certain degree of sophistication with these types of attacks though, and they're usually quite rare. However, it can happen. If you're storing a decent amount, yeah I'd absolutely recommend only using official devices, which you know have come directly from either a authorised reseller or from the manufacturers themselves. However, it would take some decent degree of sophistication to compromise an existing official device, and it'd take some level of sophistication to manufacture a look a like device. So, it entirely depends on the individuals threat model.",
