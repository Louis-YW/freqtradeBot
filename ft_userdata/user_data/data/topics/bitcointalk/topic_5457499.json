      "body": "ah good point, guess its just a matter of personal preference. Yeah thats true there is interac and wire transfer but seems like not many of the exchanges outside Canada accept it and wire transfer ive been hesitant due to the settlement times. Hows your experience been with wire, any fees? how long does it take to settle? Thanks.",
