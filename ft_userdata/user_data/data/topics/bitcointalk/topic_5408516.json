  "content": "Realistically how much would someone need in Crypto this bear run to become a millionaire aide next bull run?I know it depends and one alt that pulls a Shiba could mean a small amount. I guess I’m just figuring a general BTC ETH type investment and maybe other higher-ranked Alts.Assuming we break ATHs again and maybe even clear above a $100k BTC how much money should someone try and get in during this bear/sideways market now?I’m afraid you would still need like $50k or more to make that kind of money and I do not make enough money to hit that goal within the year...but I’m hopeful maybe $10k could make at least six figures as that seems more realistic for many people here.What are your stacks like? Goals? Any thoughts?",

Another way how to become a millionaire, it's not easy. You may need to gamble here, high risk high reward. There is some project with a still low market cap or new projects that are not yet pumped but you need to be careful and accept the risk here. One of the example before about meme coins where most of them are shitcoins and no use but when they pumped, too much and lot of people earned huge profits.",

Volatility of each project is unknown but there are some in the past who only need a $20 to $100 to become a millionaire based on the gains of the project. Example of that is shiba inu. In our local community, there are some who really become millionaire for such value of their holdings due to massive gain it bring which even them cant believe it themselves.",

It's not a bad number if you want to bet with lower risk assets.You can choose other coins/tokens lower than BNB but still with a decent marketcap and a healthy ecosystem. If you want, you can slowly accumulate and then let it sit in your wallets or let them grow in staking platforms like mycointainer.",

The more money invested and it doesn't mean you will get more chance to achieve it easily. Even people with 10k USD can also become a millionaire easily as long as this guy can get the right investment. You must also aware if the fact that how much your money didn't matter a lot but it's like about how good you are picking the right coin.

But since the price is just $20k already, might be good if you have like half of it and then just invest and hold it till the next bull run.But for those early adopters, I doubt it, I mean they have been investing when bitcoin was maybe like $10-$100.00 in price. So they obviously doesn't need huge capital. But they really have that mentally to hold it for so long to be able to just made a huge profit and become a crypto millionaire.",

Have 10k right now, and 100k next bull run and 1 million on the one after that? It is just under 10 years and could definitely happen.
