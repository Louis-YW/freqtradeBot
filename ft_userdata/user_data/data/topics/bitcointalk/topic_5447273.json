  "content": "I am not happy with the unprofessional attitude of @Royse777. Since there is nothing written on his signature ANN about creating a topic against the BM, which I am an active participant. I am going ahead and writing about my discomfort with the April fool prank. I confident I will be removed from the signature campaign and may be blacklisted or might get a negative trust after this topic but if I am not doing it meant he/she will continue with his unprofessional tactics. I never expected or thought even in my dreams that he/she is so childish! A BM reposting a signature campaign with the intent of playing a prank. True straits of an unprofessional BM. This is sad for me as I have to create a topic against my own BM whom I respected. As many like me are not going to forget this embarrassment when he/she announced that it was and that the signature campaign has been renewed, I personally thought that it was not genuine but later on realized it was as BM replied to one of the queries about its authenticity of this campaign. I have edited it as per my requirement but my question is Why would someone do that? Quote from: Royse777 on April 01, 2023, 06:15:52 AMThe following slots are already booked because they are reserved for last campaign participants.It means open slots are:16 * Legendary17 * Hero16 * Sr. Member11 * Full Member.We have 4 * avatar only campaigners. You will get paid in full in the next pay week.Cheers,Is earning Bitcoin through a signature campaign a prank? Can anyone believe in such an ideology but Royse777 was able to convince most of us that it can become a prank? How can someone as a BM play a prank on members who are giving their everything to make this forum better? Just check those applications most of them were genuine even @Ratimov applied who is always available and has immensely contributed to this forum.After knowing it was a prank he replied casually as there is nothing you can do when you know you were fooled by the BM after you have applied for the signature campaign.This is what he wrote on that thread.Quote from: Ratimov on April 02, 2023, 07:40:59 AMThe best April Fool's joke in years. A lot of people actually believed it. That moment when a manager sees how someone is seriously counting on such a high payment for posts: https://i.imgur.com/d4tQ58u.mp4 What @Royse777 did was not right as he lured everyone with a high-paying offer to his signature campaign and later on announced it was a fake signature campaign on the pretext of April fool prank that eventually made me look like a beggar.",

This prank is just brutal because it was timing to the recent competition for the signature campaign just to scoop ex-Chipmixer participants.You will not get any negative feedback by just stating your mere honest opinion towards your BM. And I doubt that he will removed with this kind opinion. I knew that there will be some repercussions on pulling that kind of prank.

But despite that it was on 1 April, I still believed it was genuine. I even posted about it in the morning in our local Croatian thread where we keep track of new and existing BTC signature campaigns and said I believe it was real and gave it a 70% at being genuine (damn you again Royse777).

That’s already satisfied all the action that he did on the prank. You said that you already agree on this rules, Regardless of the prank side. This is really what happened on his recent action.",

Ok, well assuming you were included in the pay upgrade as you quoted in OP (which you weren't), then consider yourself added and removed as quickly as it happened. This generic terminology is designed specifically to be able to remove participants to a specific campaign as quickly as they were added. So in this sense, Royse had definitively \"covered themselves\" from breaching any type of contract in this sense.Quote from: elevates on April 02, 2023, 04:15:39 PMDoes it says anywhere that you will be pranked by me whenever I want to.On April 1st, it should be assumed that you will be pranked by anyone over anything.
