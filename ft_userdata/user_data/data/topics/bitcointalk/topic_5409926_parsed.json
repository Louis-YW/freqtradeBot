  "content": "Hi!I ask for help with the import p2wpkh address from Electrum to Bitcoin core.I use the command importprivkey ********* , but I get an error in response This type of wallet does not support this command (code -4)I tried various options, but unfortunately it didn't work out to import. After spending a lot of time in Google, I realized that it was about some descriptors, but I do not know how to use and add them. And maybe it's not about them at all. Please help me.Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTSLinux 5.15.0-46-generic #49-UbuntuClient version: v23.0.0",

It works!I am very grateful!Do I need to do rescan?If you haven't added \"false\" flag after importprivkey, it should automatically do a rescan. If it didn't rescan, you need to since it's necessary to update the balance.Also, you can also use a blank wallet (non-descriptor) wallet if you do not want to have other private keys in your wallet.For descriptor wallet, you can try this (to import your whole Electrum wallet): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5399337.msg60178631#msg60178631But instead of \"xpub\" key, import the \"xpriv\" key that you can get using the command in Electrum's console: getmasterprivate()Also, you must add \\\"active\\\": true, to the 'receiving' and 'change' descriptors to set those as the active descriptors.",

Thank you.I removed the \\\"watching-only\\\": false, from the descriptors also.Would this work also on a non blank wallet? Or will it cause problems to have multiple active descriptors?",

Or will it cause problems to have multiple active descriptors?Since it's not a blank wallet, it will be pre-loaded with active descriptors for Legacy, P2SH-SegWit, Bech32 (SegWit) and Bech32m (Taproot), plus another set for change.If you set a new descriptor as active (the tutorial doesn't include active flags), it will deactivate the previous active descriptor of the same type,but your wallet can have multiple active descriptors as long as those are for different script types and for change (internal) or not.Importing more descriptors will work but only the active descriptors will be used when prompting for a new address/change.The non-active ones will still be scanned for transaction/balance.",
