  "content": "What is GoodMorningNetWork?OverviewIn an increasingly digitized and decentralized world, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are gaining unprecedented attention. Standing at the forefront of this tide, GoodmorningNetwork offers not just a novel cryptocurrency built on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, but also innovatively intertwines real-world assets (RWA) with the virtual gaming economy. With its unique block participant incentives, gaming reward tokens, and masternode incentives, GoodmorningNetwork aims to create a comprehensive, reliable, and highly interactive ecosystem.Core FeaturesPoW Consensus MechanismGoodmorningNetwork utilizes the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to ensure the network's security and decentralization. This mechanism, through complex algorithms, requires participants to invest computational effort to complete tasks and receive corresponding block rewards. GoodmorningNetwork allocates 70% of these rewards for block participants, ensuring the robustness and sustainability of the network.Gaming Reward coinsFor users who revel in the virtual gaming world, GoodmorningNetwork offers an entirely new way to profit. By playing popular games like PUBG, LOL, NARAKA, DOTA2, and CSGO, users can earn 15% of gaming reward tokens. This not only enhances user engagement but also builds a bridge between the virtual gaming world and the cryptocurrency sphere.Team IncentivesIn recognition of the team's tireless efforts, GoodmorningNetwork reserves 15% of block rewards as incentives for the team. This fund is allocated for ongoing project development, market expansion, and getting listed on various exchanges. By doing so, the platform assures long-term growth and sustainability.Real-World Assets (RWA)Most notably, GoodmorningNetwork plans to integrate real-world assets or products, referred to as RWA, through blockchain technology. This offers endless possibilities for interaction between the real and digital worlds, drawing them closer together than ever before.GoodmorningNetwork is more than just a cryptocurrency platform; it's a multifaceted network ecosystem with multiple layers of incentives and a high degree of interactivity. By seamlessly integrating with real-world assets and the virtual gaming economy, GoodmorningNetwork is redefining the boundaries between digital and real assets, marking another significant milestone in the maturation of blockchain technology. Join GoodmorningNetwork to experience this innovative, diverse, and highly integrated new world.## Importantlinks - Website [GoodMorningNetWork](https://goodmorningnetwork.org) - Block Explorer [GoodMorningNetWork-EXPLORER](https://explorer.goodmorningnetwork.org/) - Discord [DISCORD](https://discord.gg/yZehDDGZsp) - Github [GITHUB](https://github.com/GoodMorningNetWork/GoodMorningNetWork) - Telegram [TELEGRAM](https://t.me/GoodMorningNetWork) - Twitter [TWITTER](https://twitter.com/MorningWor94299)## GamingYou can earn coins by playing Rust,Narnka,Pubg,LOL,Dota2 on the Gaming boards, here is the link on how to do the bindings check it out! - Rust [RUST](https://goodmorningnetwork.gitbook.io/goodmorningnetwork/gaming/how-to-rust) - Naraka [NARAKA](https://goodmorningnetwork.gitbook.io/goodmorningnetwork/gaming/how-to-naraka) - Pubg [PUBG](https://goodmorningnetwork.gitbook.io/goodmorningnetwork/gaming/how-to-pubg) - LOL [LOL](https://goodmorningnetwork.gitbook.io/goodmorningnetwork/gaming/how-to-league-of-legends) - Dota2 [DOTA2](https://goodmorningnetwork.gitbook.io/goodmorningnetwork/gaming/how-to-dota2)##Coin SpecificationsCoin Name: GoodMorningNetWrok [GM]Pow Algorithm: RwahashBlock Time: 1 minutesMax Supply: 10BNetwork Port: 6666Rpc Port: 6667Production Reduction Rules: each 1 months,1%Block Initial Reward: 3000 GMBlock Reward Structure: 70%[POW] , 15%[Gaming] ,15% [Dev Team]About 15% [Dev Team]:For development funding, marketing, exchange listings, eco-developer incentives##Exchange listUniswap: https://app.uniswap.org/swap?outputCurrency=0xd85969bf29731D4Dc2c9c1b6411bfFa3f976d94f (Switching to Arbitrum network)XeggeX: https://xeggex.com/market/GM_USDT## WalletGoodmorningNetwork-main-linux.7z:  https://github.com/GoodMorningNetWork/GoodMorningNetWork/releases/download/v1.0/GoodmorningNetwork-main-linux.7zGoodmorningNetwork-main-windows.7z: https://github.com/GoodMorningNetWork/GoodMorningNetWork/releases/download/v1.0/GoodmorningNetwork-main-windows.7zGoodmorningNetwork-main-macos.7z: https://github.com/GoodMorningNetWork/GoodMorningNetWork/releases/download/v1.0/GoodmorningNetwork-main-mac.7zGoodmorningNetwork-main-linux.7z virustotal link https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b8bec3d7cba37b2c33c2b95d0a5c8dd8eb14025beffe1751d936ac478404375f?nocache=1GoodmorningNetwork-main-windows.7z  virustotal link https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7f2a468921dcc7b274a5817460e77855cd58581343b268e0c777cadac40d58da?nocache=1GoodmorningNetwork-main-macos.7z    virustotal link https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8d300afabeeff422bda6b11216181f545316b5b43ecc5c85fe8d82c7a22415c7?nocache=1GoodmorningNetwork-main-linux.7z   SHA256: b8bec3d7cba37b2c33c2b95d0a5c8dd8eb14025beffe1751d936ac478404375fGoodmorningNetwork-main-windows.7z SHA256: 7f2a468921dcc7b274a5817460e77855cd58581343b268e0c777cadac40d58daGoodmorningNetwork-main-macos.7z   SHA256: 8d300afabeeff422bda6b11216181f545316b5b43ecc5c85fe8d82c7a22415c7",
