  "content": "Came across two (edit- they have quite a few in their eBay store) eBay listings claiming they have a  “100% safe” bitcoin hard wallet for sale. The first one looks to simply be a USB stick that works in conjunction with Electrum. The seller simply plagiarized the same exact wallet description that can be found on KeepKey’s website wallet description (as seen in the photos below).Ebay listing  (notice how they even left the name “KeepKey” in the description. Also how they state the wallet has a display, which it does not )KeepKey website description ( https://shapeshift.com/keepkey ) Though noted on the photo as “box for illustration only”, they designed a fake box to give the illusion of a legitimate hardware wallet package.https://www.ebay.com/itm/265792575291?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=aGSPCmA-RLm&sssrc=2349624&ssuid=6B7-avqJQ5K&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPYHere is the second listing. This I don’t understand. They label it with much of the same information as the other listing, and as a hardware wallet, yet there is no physical wallet, just a DVD labeled “GNU ZONE” (their User Name). I’m assuming it’s just a copy of Electrum on DVD? https://www.ebay.com/itm/265792577362?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=aGSPCmA-RLm&sssrc=2349624&ssuid=6B7-avqJQ5K&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPYNeedless to say this is not a legitimate hardware wallet, and could easily be set up to scam someone. I obviously don’t know for sure if that’s the case, but being a phony listing that plagiarized KeepKey, this seller obviously can’t be trusted. Seller has quite a few of these fake wallets for sale in their store -   https://www.ebay.com/str/gnuzone?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=aGSPCmA-RLm&sssrc=3418065&ssuid=6B7-avqJQ5K&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY",

Any idiot can figure out how to do that with a simple google search. Download rufus, insert USB, select ISO file, and hit Write lol.. ... I almost want to order one of his cheaper items and runt it through some tools on Kali linux just to see what the fuck is up there...

Yeah I mean I have no idea if there’s actually any malware built in to these, but dude is straight up lying about its features and functions and just plagiarized KeepKeys exact wallet description, which proves it’s all fake nonsense. I reported the listings, but considering messaging them. Would be interested if you do buy one and test it out. I would if I knew how to do any of that stuff, as of course you know I don’t know how to do lol.",

I’m assuming it’s just a copy of Electrum on DVD? It could be. Even it could be an Electrum fork with malware injected. Install it, send coins from exchange or any wallet, the script will take the coins out before you know anything. Ebay, amazon are full with internet frauds. Quote from: ChiBitCTy on July 31, 2022, 07:55:34 PMconsidering messaging them.It obvious he listed it to scam naive crypto users. You will not get a response at all. Ebay do not care to handle reports from regular users. Let's hope you are lucky.",

Probably it's electrum, but he should list everything correctly in descriptions like normal people, not doing this bs gymnastics.There is a notice written on the bottom of his page saying this:QuoteTHIS IS NOT A COUNTERFEIT LISTING.
