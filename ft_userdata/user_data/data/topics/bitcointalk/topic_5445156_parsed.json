This trend is not going to end soon. More news of downsizing people are on the horizon and will come out in next couple of weeks. And when such mass firing happens, it's usually not a good news for the economy. The demand will slump and corporate spending will go down as a result. Which will create room for more job losses. As of now, the situation is quite complicated and can't be concluded on what's coming up next.",

Individual investors do not have such luxury, so why should the banks?I'd expect for larger banks to purchase the assets of SVB and every other failed bank at a discount which would provide some liquidity for their creditors.

Like OP advices it is not good to put one's egg in one basket. There is need to learn a new skill, get a higher degree, establish a business or invest in any other business to make one get other sources of income. Report shows that many US banks has very high rate of uninsured deposits range that could lead to their collapse.

The US Federal Reserve have already promised to bail the Silicon Valley Bank. Customers losing their deposit will give the US a bad reputation and I think the government might not want that to happen.",

Should we take the collapse of SVB and Credit Suisse as indicators of multiple economic woes ahead?I think the question is: how did people live in previous eras when there were no police, no state pension, no state funded schools, firefighters or universal healthcare. If people wake up one day and realize they can't rely on the government to help them. What is the rational and logical course of action?Organized and networked communities could become a thing. If people can't rely on the government, they might turn to their neighbors and nearby friends. If they're professionals they will begin to communicate, organize and cooperate to achieve mutual goals. As well as to organize mutual defense to protect against rising crime during times of crisis.To an extent, we might observe these trends occurring in places currently being hit with natural disasters, with little or no state intervention or aid. But the adjustments and adaptations could take time. Months. Years. Perhaps even decades, if they happen at all. It is possible society has become somewhat isolationist in nature. Most of us have an army-of-one mentality where we will try (and perhaps fail) to do everything themselves. The value of team work and cooperation is somewhat underrated in the current era. Which could mean that the next mutant superpower people will race to develop is better leadership skills and greater investment in learning to cooperate better within group settings. While an army-of-one makes for good movies and good tv shows. Its not a good format for communal gardening and other basic societal formats which could become fundamental and necessary moving forward.",

Of course, this does not mean that the banks are safe, especially the small and less well-known ones that probably no one will save. Credit Suisse has problems much deeper than the lack of liquidity. The bank's downfall began a year ago when it violated centuries-old Swiss neutrality and froze some 19 billion Russian money. After that, the outflow of funds from Asian clients (mainly from China and the Middle East) began from the bank. Only in November last year, 84 billion dollars were withdrawn from Credit Suisse - this is to understand the scale of the problems. The current credit line will last for a maximum of a month if the bank fails to urgently address the loss of confidence among Asian customers.",

I would argue the '08 recovery was attenuated with the actions the government took in bailing out the institutions that were giving sub prime mortgages knowing their investment to be high risk.

It's heading towards a recession. A recession is a normal part of the economic cycle. The capitalist economy can't just continue growing forever without any recessions. The global economy has been running on steroids for several years(really low interest rates, quantitative easing, money printing, etc.). It's pretty normal for all those financial steroids to have negative side effects.It was pretty much expected for the interest rate hikes to cause trouble for the weaker and not-so-well managed banks(like Credit Suisse).Higher interest rates lead to the price of treasure bonds going down, which means that they are harder to sell.
