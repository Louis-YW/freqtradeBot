I must say this though our young people are very much aware of this recent development of technology and are very active in it's use because Nigerian are known everywhere all over the world for their success rate when it comes to full dedication to achievement, but that doesn't deny the fact that not all are in this category so the LAZAY Nigerians are the ones that fall under this category and for a country of this massive population, it won't be hard to see the actions of the LAZY ones, plus the fact that the government also contributes by fucking some of these people more through the bad government.",

      "body": "OP, first, I would start by saying that there is no reason that is justifiable for any bad act or habit, but in reality, situations push people to the wall to the extent that they even get frustrated and don't know what to do again. When you see some people with bad habits or evil acts, don't be quick to judge but ask questions, trying to confirm and find out why it's so. Going straight up to the judge doesn't provide any solution but leaves the situation unsolved. There's always a saying that \"you can't resolve a conflict unless you find the root cause of the conflict.\" In my country, there's no reason to justify why someone committed the act of stealing, but what if the people stole food? I believe you would say it's because he or she was hungry; that's what caused them to steal food. So what I am saying in essence is that some people need help and care, but since they are not getting it, they become frustrated and can do some ill things. Some are gambling because they feel that they will at least win some money from it.",

      "body": "To me, I don't even blame people who looks like being addicted to gambling because take a look at years back you will understand that gambling wasn't this popular at all as majority of people show less concern to gambling or see gamblers like some kind of wayward people that doesn't have anything tangible to do with their money because our economy was gloomy and a lot of people were doing well as at then.Now, compare and contrast how the economy is currently and how it was then you will notice a huge difference. Moreover, the money people make in their petty businesses isn't enough anymore due to high cost of living now, the money gotten from a business isn't enough to provide daily needs again and for salary earners sometimes their salaries are not paid in due time and before their salaries are being paid, some persons that doesn't have any other means of earning a living apart from their salaries must have been involved in series of debts before their salaries are being paid and even when they are paid they use the money to settle previous debts thereby leaving them with no money again to carter for daily needs.Now, the reason why most people are involved in gambling is because they're being optimistic that someday they might win money that will elevate them and make their life better and sometimes when news comes up that someone won a bet, people begin to have the feeling that they too can win someday so in the quest of being hopeful that they might be lucky to win someday; it now looks like addiction because they continuously place bets with the money gotten from other source with the belief that one day might be their lucky day.So to me; our economy is what has really pushed a lot of people to be involved in things they never even bargain to do all their life but due to the economic crisis now, one can never say never to anything as things you never wanted to do to earn a living you might be pressurized to do them simply because you are trying to make a better living for yourself and your family.",

They strive to learn and benefit from anything worthwhile. That is why you seem Nigerians dominating in anything they are involved in that is worth their time and energy.In contrast with OP's opinion, Nigerian youths are super hardworking, especially amongst our peers in other developing countries. One could say it is because of our resilience, consistency and our ability to survive in harsh and tight conditions. It could be as a result of our system of governance where the young people are availed with little or no opportunities and further downgraded by their efforts tomake their contributions to the government of the day. Yet, we are the largest workforce in the nation. The older guys in their septuagenarian and octogenarian, have beclouded the space with their influences and will only allow you to perform as a drudge.QuoteAnother things is that any young man still depending on the parents, when they should be on their own, ia definitely in serious pain and never enjoying it.

Illigal na bad thing anyhow you view am so many people are only joining it because of peer influence or condition, although no justification for evil.The system have already been designed in an aristocratic manner in the sense that you are denied the very basic rights and privileges you should enjoy as a countryperson. You are being denied the very basic amenities and access to the resources of the state for good use like grants, softloans and the enabling environment for the small and medium sized enterprises to thrive.Why won't they remain under their parents when there's no reward to hardwork and no opportunity for good works. You will work a whole day just to have little food on your table whereas in more sane and developed worlds, those are some of the high paying jobs as a foreigner.",

Secondly, to impact positively, you must need skills or funds, most times both, and building a venture takes a long time and needs a lot of dedication. Now how do these people take Care of themselves during the building phase??. Can you make contributions actively on empty belly?. These people you're victimizing, if you go close to them, you'll see that they're not even happy in that situation. They cleanly and clearly need help,  but most times it doesn't come by.   Most of them are illiterates who don't have access to those information, lest they would've made good use of them. Most don't have android phone to surf the Internet and get profitable information.  Most  young ones are even influenced by their environment as what they see there makes them comfortable in their conditions without an opportunity to thrive. Bet me, most of these people you think are never do wells, if they're exposed to the kind of knowledge you've, they  would excel. Alright there are few exceptions to these conditions, some people are just nothing to write home about, but all I say is this. All underperforming youths need help and we should be discussing about how to avail the required help to them . That's What humanity is all about. I'm campaigning that we become more human in our  judgment of people.",

Firstly I don't see anything wrong with quick money but people who are making money with the illegal means are just being selfish, everyone needs quick money even you talking you need quick money but not the illegal way. But why generalizing what you just said making it look as if everyone is like that. When talking about a lazy youth or lazy person, the word lazy is someone that cannot make good use of his/her skills or resources. And despite the Nigeria economy Nigerians youth are not lazy am not talking about those tout on the street because the way you put this topic you're talking about people who need help and support them too dey lost for life so na help them need, let's be realistic why will a normal human being or a youth play gamble for a living that one no be life na them too need help o.

This is untrue and you have such mindset for long, you should discard such from your mind. The Nigerian youths are informed and have knowledge of the unraveling technologies that are coming out daily, they just lack the right environment, and equipment to employ that means. About serving host to themselves, is because they don’t have the means to start up one for themselves but rather join an existing one and get a share from it, I don’t blame them for that. Meanwhile, you don’t have to generalize everything, despite the hardship here, many people still find a means of survival and it’s working for them perfectly.QuoteThe youths are also done, how can you explain this, a full-grown man continues to depend entirely on gambling to feed, it's ludicrous because this is the modern period and everything is progressing to the next level.That’s not a modern period mindset, he is just making himself financially handicapped by engaging in such act which he should be blamed entirely for such actions. There is no reason to gamble to make a survival means through it, making it your main source of income. It will fail you one day.",

I would like to use my vicinity for example because there are so many cases of actually grown men with wives and children children actually depending on gambling for them to actually feed their family which for me is an error because gambling isn't something that one can put as a means of putting food on the table. And alot of these cases are acclaimed to the pitiful excuses that there is no job in the country which is understandable but no responsibility youth would be in such an environment and not actually plan ahead of his or her future by establishing himself at a very young age .",

Things like this dey to dey remember us to be honest and look for means for survival the legit way but make we still dey appreciate people wey dey really hustle well to make am and them no do anything illegal to take achieve am. The number of people wey dey gamble plenty but e no mean say as them plenty like that, plenty of them na him dey use that means as their only means to take survive, make you sef reason am say no be so e be and you no suppose generalize am. Some dey do am for fun and you no go talk say them they use am for survival or take escape poverty.",
