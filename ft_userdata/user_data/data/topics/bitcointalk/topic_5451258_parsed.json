  "content": "I had about 5467 staked ZIL in ATOMIC wallet and now I only see the 148 ZIL I had not staked which were needed to confirm the staking,I know that there is an ongoing upgrade on the ZIL network but where did these coins got?Yesterday Atomic wallet said that all stake,deposit and withdrawal operations were suspended on the ZIL network because of this ongoing upgrade,did something nasty happened to me?I don't think so as I don't see a suspicious transaction nor I am hacked or something like that as I use Linux and my machine is super clean,I have all other cryptos here and they are all here.I hope I have not lost my ZIL,a couple of screen shots below to proof what I am saying.",

If there's none to be found then you have nothing to worry about because if you've been hacked or what, then there's nothing left the hacker will allow for you to see. Probably this could just be a glitch since as you've mentioned that ZIL is currently upgrading and the status of your wallet has been affected by it. A version of Atomic update could also be a thing here, check out if they've got some new release and update it but if there's none, then we can conclude that it's just an upgrade matter so wait until it's finished.",
