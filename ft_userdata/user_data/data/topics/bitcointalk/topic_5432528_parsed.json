  "content": "Anyone using BitKeep?Multiple BitKeep crypto wallet users reported that their wallets were emptied during Christmas after hackers triggered transactions that didn't require verification. Company confirmed the problem and linked it to 'unofficial' version of program:QuoteDear BitKeep users, after preliminary investigation by the team, it is suspected that some APK package downloads have been hijacked by hackers and installed with code implanted by hackers. If your funds are stolen, the application you download or update may be an unknown version (unofficial release version) hijacked.Now for the safety of user funds, if you downloaded the APK version, please transfer the funds to the wallet downloaded from another official store (App Store or Google Play). In addition, it is recommended to use the newly created wallet address, the address you created through apk may be leaked to hackers.Anyway - whatever you use, always make some effort to ensure you use the original program, not a hacked copy!More read: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-steal-8-million-from-users-running-trojanized-bitkeep-apps/",

While App Store is more security oriented and its much harder to upload a fake app there (but it happens from time to time), Google Play is a scammer's heaven as they are not as thorough as Apple is. Some time ago I started looking for and reporting those but eventually gave up as it was nothing but a whack a mole game.With that being said, the only place where anyone should download the app is from the official website, but even then you may end up being victim if you click on a phishing website.",

But then if this is not what happened I'm pretty sure people will post on social media rebutting their statement. I'm not sure how APK update work in detail but Android should add something like an update will be rejected if the apk is not signed by the same publisher. This should help prevent installing a fake app on top of the real one. However, no one should rely on this and download/verify the apk themselves.Quote from: Rikafip on January 02, 2023, 11:44:22 AMWith that being said, the only place where anyone should download the app is from the official website, but even then you may end up being victim if you click on a phishing website.Another option would be to build it on your own. I don't think this would become mainstream since a lot of people are using closed-source app nowadays. At the end of the day, every method has its own risk. We just gotta deal with it.Quote from: robelneo on January 02, 2023, 07:44:00 AMit's negligence on their part they are lucky if Bitkeep reimburses them its not their part anyway. IMO some people still don't understand what decentralized means. Whether the app is terrible/secure or not, expecting reimbursement from a decentralized wallet app when things go south should not be the guarantee for the security of their funds.",

This should help prevent installing a fake app on top of the real one. However, no one should rely on this and download/verify the apk themselves. Android OS already requires that all applications have to be digitally signed before they can be installed on your device. If there is an update to an already installed app, the OS will check if the new certificate matches the one of the app you already have installed on your phone. If the certificate matches and belongs to the same developer, the update can be installed. If the certificate doesn't match and there is a different signature, you can't update the old app with the same name. But I guess you can install a separate app with a slightly different name, which will be the fake app. The way to get around that is to steal the developers' signing key and release a malicious app by signing it with the correct keys, or if the developer releases that malicious update himself. You can read more about it on https://www.xda-developers.com/application-signature-verification-how-it-works-how-to-disable-it-with-xposed-and-why-you-shouldnt/.  There is also an option to disable signature verification on Android, but that is an unnecessary security risk.",

Many people unfortunately don't realize how dangerous it is to trust such sources. Google isn't helping either with their negligence and willingness to advertise scams on top of search results if you pay them.  At first google was wary about cryptocurrency related adwords on their search engine, but such ads are now allowed, which is quite risky for users. Besides, most of these hackers and malicious app owners have authority websites that promotes their links too, which lure people to download their apps on app stores other than google play store. Moreover, android phones like huawei has its app store which seems to be less secured regarding the need of certificates before installing apps. On the other hand, some people are careless about all these requirements, and go ahead to confirm that they trust the app.  QuoteHowever, since the current attacks result from users getting scammed by trojanized APKs, it’s unlikely that there will be any refunds.so since this is as a result of a careless company and uninformed users it's wrong to say that the affected users should be neglected with no refunds, it is suspicious.Considering that the Company has taken this step to inform users about the hijack, what are their plans of stopping such a continuous attack on affected users, as the news may not get to everybody? The internet is not a place for the less informed, truly. Especially, on the cryptocurrency niche, a group of developers can conjoin and build a project, promote it, gain customers and feel reluctant about their safety. Exposing them to the wild world of hackers.",

The legitimate package name is \"com.bitkeep.wallet.\"QuoteThe Singapore-headquartered company, which was founded in 2018, said it has traced the wallet address used to carry out the theft and that some of the siphoned digital assets have been frozen.This is not the first time BitKeep has been breached. On October 18, 2022, it disclosed another security incident targeting its BitKeep Swap service that led to losses of about $1 million.It seems Bitkeep is one of the most targeted wallets and those Bitkeep users should be more educated on how to protect their coins and know the difference between fake and legit wallets, phishing sites are such a big concern in the industry, and only through education can we beat scammers.This will not end yet as long as people are lax in how they secure their assets, and they are the ones scammers are targetting.",
