That cryptography, in many cases, dates to work published in the late 1970s and updated in the decades since.“The good news is that this is not an insurmountable problem,” the official said. “The National Institute of Standards and Technology — NIST — will soon be publishing new cryptographic standards that can protect against these future attacks.”Biden’s memorandum mentions quantum-resistant cryptography more than 20 times as it lays out tasks for agencies such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency and NIST, which has an authoritative role in setting cybersecurity standards.Those agencies will have about six months to “establish requirements for inventorying all currently deployed cryptographic systems, excluding National Security Systems (NSS).”NIST and CISA also would be required to set up outreach with the private sector, including critical infrastructure operators, on transitioning important systems to quantum-resistant cryptography.Biden also issued an executive order Wednesday that would create a National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee including White House officials and up to 26 experts from industry, academia and U.S. national laboratories. https://therecord.media/biden-quantum-computing-national-security-memorandu/There is a past precedent for correlation between quantum computing headlines and declines in bitcoin price. There was a BTC downtrend when google claimed to achieve quantum supremacy. Other news relating to quantum computers are correlated with BTC price declines.Is anyone enthusiastic about this proposal to create and deploy new cryptographic standards announced by the US government. I would be interested to know where public opinion stands on this issue.",

They could petition bitcoin developers to replace BTC's elliptic curve signatures with a new encryption algorithm which was created by the government working in concert with intelligence agencies like the FBI, CIA and NSA. To prepare bitcoin for the coming \"quantum computer\" era.Existing standards like SSL and SSH could also be replaced with new \"quantum compliant\" encryption.People may not grasp the significance of this initially. But if they thought about it, they might realize it could carry implications depending on how its implemented.",

After all, the timing seems right, so there probably was some panic that can be attributed to this memorandum. That being said, it's also true that the topic isn't new, and some have been worried about cryptos and quantum computers for years. But the memorandum statement says that much of cryptography used for digital communications might be cracked, it doesn't mean that cryptocurrencies would be. Also, sometimes predictions about the 'not-too-distant future' are very wrong, so we don't know how much time this will take. And if they can make new standards to protect against these events, I'm sure things can be done with cryptos as well when the threat gets real.",

From what I've read on the subject in dozens of forum topics, Bitcoin can become resistant to such computers even through the implementation of a soft fork that would introduce a quantum-resistant digital signature. I am sure that this issue is on the agenda of many developers who will act in a timely manner to enable Bitcoin to be protected from possible attacks.Quote from: bitmover on May 10, 2022, 12:51:58 PMBut I don't think the downtrend has anything to do with UST.

But one should know that other central banks are also raising interest rates, and that this is being seriously considered in the EU. Money always moves where investors feel most secure, even if it doesn't mean they will make a profit in the long run.",

Crypto has also deviated from its historical norms since it became traded by institutional firms.
