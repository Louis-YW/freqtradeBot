I saw online there are some people who are telling that it's no effect at all because they said, there are a lot of manipulations on Futures markets.",

      "body": "Well, referencing it to a currency that does not stop falling is not clear to me. For people in the Eurozone who have investments in dollars, as many investment funds do, these investments have helped them to compensate for the decline in purchasing power.I do not quite understand the move, I guess they do it to diversify supply, or because they expect the euro to continue to fall further against major competing currencies, and thus the price of Bitcoin and Eth will be higher.",

I saw online there are some people who are telling that it's no effect at all because they said, there are a lot of manipulations on Futures markets. I'm sure it must have some effect or they wouldn't bother offering it.  It seems like a natural progression of the market though.  A good sign that they're continuing to offer more services instead of closing up the ones they have.  I doubt it will enable more manipulation, but would assume the more access investors have to things like this, the more stability it offers as a result.",

I saw online there are some people who are telling that it's no effect at all because they said, there are a lot of manipulations on Futures markets. In 2017, the all time high of Bitcoin was triggered by CME and CBOE future trading news. Now these news don't have too big effects like in the past because future tradings for Bitcoin are very common nowadays, on many exchanges, many platforms.Another method for Bitcoin futures is like another payment method to buy and sell something in super market or in crypto marketplaces, it does not have big effect like the first one.",

Unless you're going to include leverage, I don't think it's going to have THAT huge of an effect. It's just that futures gives people have the opportunity to bet against bitcoin, which can definitely put some sell pressure due to how shorting works.",

CME will not buy or sell physical bitcoins or ETH and also not allow settlement in cryptos. So it's more like a gambling! No money flow will happen in and out of the crypto market due to CME derivatives exchange. So I would care less in what they are introducing and why!",
