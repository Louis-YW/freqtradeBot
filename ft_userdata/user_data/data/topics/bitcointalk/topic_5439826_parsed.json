Seeing that you gatz go online generate some kind of token, the layman or an illiterate person cannot do all that process and the activity is just for 3 days, from Wednesday to Friday under stipulated time. Last last, most people go lose money seriously, I pray God replenish it back for them in the soonest.",

I dun call my customer care to the extent they sabi my number now lol. I know how hard the situation be for the country right now. Infact make I share my own small experience today. So after I roamed up and kept my eyes peeled out for any POS with available cash to dispense, I finally stumbled upon one that had cash and was the only one for a long distance. I paid the agreed charge which was more than 10% and he wanted to give me more old notes and fewer new ones. Thank God I declined and only took a thousand naira in two 500naira piece. I spent one on food, but when I got to the market, everyone refused to accept the old notes all of a sudden and I had to start doing transfer o. Thank God again for microfinance bank, OPAY. I for hear whiiim today, mostly as aboki cut my meat, I no get cash and network no come agree to work again o. The transfer finally worked and I just carry my small foodstuff run to my house. All effort to use the other 500naira note has been futile as no one agreed to accept it. Which way Naija. Never thought we would go back to trade by barter system or buying naira for naira. I will frame the note and hang it on my wall as a reminder of a country called Nigeria.",
