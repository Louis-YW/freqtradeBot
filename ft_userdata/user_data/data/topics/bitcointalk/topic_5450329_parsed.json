      "body": "Most of exchange or wallet only require at least 1-20 confirmations to get credited, it's impossible for over 600 confirmations your coins still not credited yet.I guess you mean about right address instead of right wallet? because if you use non custodial wallet, you can input your seed phrase or private key in any wallet, but it show a same address which you owned.You need to check the receipt address and the network you used, if you send Bitcoin using BSC network, but you use on chain Bitcoin address, your coins are gone now.",

Your Bitcoin TxID, or the address of your exchange or wallet, can be entered here. A brief synopsis of the transaction, including its confirmation count, will be displayed. I'm hoping this helps clarify your bitcoin transaction. It's also a good idea to double-check the wallet address you're supposed to send money to, just in case.",

If you are sure about the address that you send the funds to, are you sure you are using the right network? You could have chosen the cheaper yet wrong network option.",

If sent to the correct address, likely it is an exchange or custodial wallet address. If it is an exchange or custodial wallet address, contact the customer support and tell them what happened. Always know that if it is not your key it is not your coin.Or sent to a wallet, and you are not yet seeing it. What is the name of the wallet?",

Tell us more about this because we're not fortune tellers to tell if your wallet is from an exchange or a typical desktop/mobile/hardware wallet where it should be. If it's the latter, try to update the wallet and that's probably one reason why the balance is not appearing or displaying.",
