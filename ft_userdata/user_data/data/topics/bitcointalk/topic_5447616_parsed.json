I go agree with you say some of the tech skills dey in higher demand than others but e nor mean say the other ones nor dey important too. High in-demand tech skills dey very good to learn because dem go quick give you job and money go start dey enter your hand sharp sharp. Only say, this same high in-demand skills still get disadvantage because of the competition wey dey inside especially when you dey find job.My advice na say make pipo learn any tech skill of their choice, especially the one wey dem go fit put all their mind. All tech skills dey relevant and lucrative, if you get passion for am, e go surely reward you last last.",

Cyber security courses are expensive and pay well, but you must consider other options to learn, earn money, and return to cyber security. Technology is vast, and it is advantageous to be versatile. I'm currently finishing up my data analytics course and intend to pursue UX/UI design and full stack programming before the end of the year. Sooner or later AI will take over most of the physical work and most people will be left with nothing.",

Currently, the space is getting much notice it requires and bigger players are coming in looking for the right gate keepers who they can trust to deliver in various fields. Just as OP had mentioned, these areas of specialization are very much needed in the technological space as they are the major work force to move projects faster.

Interest is also something to be considered when choosing a skill. Choose a tech skill that you know is around a field in tech that you have an interest in, do not follow the majority without considering your interest and love for that skill. Learning a skill is the number one thing, the next thing is application of the skill, and without you being able to apply that skill you have learnt, the skill becomes useless. Interest and Passion is what will determine how committed you will stay to applying that skill. Interest and passion is what will keep you going. It is easier to keep doing what you like.",
