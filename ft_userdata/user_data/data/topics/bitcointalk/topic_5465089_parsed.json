  "content": "According to this new and damning report, the average scammer that you see on the likes of Telegram and other social media aren't professional con-men but are merely forced to work for them in order to gain a living (think like child trafficking and sex trafficking).Lots of these people are being forced to work for a handful of overlords who ultimately reap all of the benefits of the stolen money while the trafficked scam worker gets just a tiny cut of it, less than minimum wage and keeping most of them in poverty.Only after the economies of all those countries improve like China will people's average wages go up and make this kind of work gradually become infesable and peter out into the darkness.Think about that next time you are greeted by a scammer - don't give them any money of course, but it makes you feel sorry for their situation (not the fake made-up story that they tell you). Quote from: https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/08/hundreds-thousands-trafficked-work-online-scammers-se-asia-says-un-reportGENEVA (29 August 2023) – Hundreds of thousands of people are being forcibly engaged by organised criminal gangs into online criminality in Southeast Asia - from romance-investment scams and crypto fraud to illegal gambling - a report issued today by the UN Human Rights Office shows.Victims face a range of serious violations and abuses, including threats to their safety and security; and many have been subjected to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary detention, sexual violence, forced labour, and other human rights abuses, the report says.“People who are coerced into working in these scamming operations endure inhumane treatment while being forced to carry out crimes. They are victims. They are not criminals,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk.“In continuing to call for justice for those who have been defrauded through online criminality, we must not forget that this complex phenomenon has two sets of victims.”The enormity of online scam trafficking in Southeast Asia is difficult to estimate, the reports says, because of the clandestine nature and gaps in the official response. Credible sources indicate that at least 120,000 people across Myanmar may be held in situations where they are forced to carry out online scams, with estimates in Cambodia similarly at around 100,000. Other States in the region, including Lao PDR, the Philippines and Thailand, have also been identified as main countries of destination or transit where at least tens of thousands of people have been involved.The scam centres generate revenue amounting to billions of US dollars each year.The COVID-19 pandemic and associated response measures had a drastic impact on illicit activities across the region. Public health measures closed casinos in many countries and in response, casino operators moved operations to less regulated spaces including conflict-affected border areas and Special Economic Zones, as well as to the increasingly lucrative online space, the report says.Faced with new operational realities, criminal actors increasingly targeted migrants in vulnerable situations – who were stranded in these countries and out of work due to border and business closures – for recruitment into criminal operations, under the pretence of offering them real jobs. As COVID-related shutdowns saw millions of people restricted to their homes, spending more time online, there were more ready targets for online fraud schemes and more people susceptible to fraudulent recruitment.Most people trafficked into the online scam operations are men, although women and adolescents are also among the victims, the report says. Most are not citizens of the countries in which the trafficking occurs. Many of the victims are well-educated, sometimes coming from professional jobs or with graduate or even post-graduate degrees, computer-literate and multi-lingual. Victims come from across the ASEAN region (from Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam), as well as mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, South Asia, and even further afield from Africa and Latin America.While some countries in Southeast Asia have put in place legal and policy frameworks relevant to counter trafficking, in some cases they fall short of international standards. In many cases their implementation has failed to respond adequately to the context and sophistication of these online scams, the report says.Victims of trafficking and other human rights abuse are erroneously identified as criminals or as immigration offenders and, rather than being protected and given access to the rehabilitation and remedy they need, they are subjected to criminal prosecution or immigration penalties, it says.“All affected States need to summon the political will to strengthen human rights and improve governance and the rule of law, including through serious and sustained efforts to tackle corruption. This must be as much a part of the response to these scams as a robust criminal justice response,” said Türk.“Only such a holistic approach can break the cycle of impunity and ensure protection and justice for the people who have been so horrifically abused.”",

Most of them are paid peanuts, some do it because their family security also depends on it and it is what’s use to threaten them. In as much as I agree with you that policies are to be set aside to different the real cohorts and the victim-scammers as I will put it, I think it will be hard because most of the them when caught will actually use this umbrella even the real culprits.Do you even know that most of them are the once that actually present themselves to this established scam bodies just because they want to live a life with luxury. Yeah the economy of most of their countries are not good enough but come off it some are just to greedy and want a go at life the easier way. That’s why they end up been used for stuffs like this.",

They are forced to work but in the end, they are busted because what they are promoting is some illegal stuff like a Ponzi scheme investment or something like a scam call center that is offering technical works in the computer but in reality, they are just simply scamming others and steal their money.",

When their education level might be not high enough to work in an reputable industry they are basically forced to do whatever in order to feed their families or them selves.Often enough, when people go to job interviews they thing they are applying for a regular job, just to find out they actually need to scam people. Some of them feel bad about it and are left with choosing between being hungry or scam stranger they don't know and who they think have more than enough money anyway, because they live in the west.This is a very sad situation and terrible for both sides.Of course there is also total scum, people that love their \"job\". Mocking and insulting their victims and proudly showing off what they have accomplished.",

The point is at the end of the day they get brought to this business by their greed. I know they are puppets there can the reasons but the weak time chooses the wrong path and it never ends well. I have never heard about any operation confronting the real ones. For the growth of economies, I think from where the most people get brought into this business are underdeveloped countries where they suffer from the hard times and eventually choose this way.",

Trafficking of different kinds exist of course, but is the number of people forced to work as online scammers so large? The quote you shared stated that it is \"difficult to estimate\", but i think it is arguable that most online scammers are working voluntarily and many of them even submit themselves to these scam networks to add to their workforce. Nevertheless it is the work of the authorities to stop these trafficking networks, but i am going to tell off any scammer trying to scam me.",

I mean, the mentioned countries are facing a lot of financial problems, and to face their daily expenses, one or two of the family members from each house or the third house are almost going away to work. How are they going? That's another discussion, but it's really not good to use someone when they are in need of money.I hope governments will take action, and this information must be spread among loved ones who eagerly wish to go abroad for work while having good jobs here. I hope people will learn about this scam and how they can prevent it.I did not wish to go abroad, but once I gave an interview in a call center quite a while ago, and there the interviewer asked me to read a script. I read it and explained it to him. But what I did not understand after reading that script is why we have to ask for personal information from others. Then that interviewer said we would use that information to break into their credit or debit cards, and then we would blackmail them to buy our product or use their cards. And I was stunned there after hearing that and tried to report the center, but I did not have any proof at the time. A few days ago, those scammers changed their office and moved to some other place. The point is that these types of people use the talents of others when they need help, either financially or personally. And that is so immoral.",

Only very few people out of billions resist it. The rest have been caught and have become part of the Matrix in the hands of a puppet master to run & maintain the system.It's interesting to note that the puppet master will find it hard to thrive on a decentralized and transparent system. Decentralization weakens his power and transparency exposes their evil. He thrives in darkness of centralized systems where he controls his victims. They are only able to successfully use crypto because they operate from their centralized darkness,but could easily be exposed on True Cryptocurrency Network where everyone will be monitoring the system for scammers and evil doers. Those caught get bad reputation and everyone will try to avoid them.",

You've made a great point by encouraging civil disobedience on the scam lords. But, we forget that these people are forced to suffer other people, and not everyone have the courage to exit.  Consider the risk of traveling illegally to a different country. A move to the police or leave the house they hide in, can't come to mind. What happens to them if they get thrown out, who is going to accept them. So, their predators, use many con skills on them, torture, starve them, and risk their life in the eyes of the law. UN human rights provided good, but, rare to achieve solution to this, because these scam hubs can be sponsored by connected people. Thereby, knowing how to escape the law enforcement agencies. Moreover, these people are not citizens of the country, the both parties must end up in trouble. In many occasions these slaves are not forced to the house, greed also lands them into such a horrible condition.",
