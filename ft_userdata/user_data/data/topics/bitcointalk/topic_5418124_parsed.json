      "body": "this altcoin is listed on binance although it is a good thing that at least the altcoin is listed on binance and I need to be careful with altcoins as the altcoin price is highly influenced by the altcoin creators if the altcoin creator goes public and badmouths of altcoin or there is some scandal that involves the creator of altcoin then the price of altcoin will go down a lot even if the market is not even going down, this is a negative point that altcoins have, another point is that when the price of bitcoin drops a lot all altcoins fall a lot against bitcoin, but when the price of bitcoin starts to recover then we see a bleak scenario in altcoins where the price of altcoins against bitcoin does not go back to the same price, this happens because people have so many other altcoins to invest that are looking to put little money in a lot of shitcoins, but as the price of bitcoin has gone up in dollars people look at the altcoin price and think that everything is fine em, as the person bought the altcoin at 1$ and then sees the price at 1.50$, he thinks everything is fine, when in fact that altcoin only has this price increase because the price of bitcoin has increasedQuote from: Charles-Tim on October 24, 2022, 09:02:17 AMJust know that if you are dealing with altcoins, it is like you are gambling, there can be big profit or big loss.buying altcoin is different from gambling, in gambling the person only has two options: lose or winwhen buying altcoins the person can sell if the person sees that the price will fall and the person will not lose all capital, he will probably only lose 5% or 10% of the capital",

Litentry all time high price was 12$ but having a short time frame for a target price is very hard to predict due to crypto volatility. There's a chance that LIT can hit that 1$ but I'm not sure if that's possible this weekends since Bitcoin is showing some weakness in reaction with DXY possible uptrend movement.",

As you can see that Bitcoin is having a hard time staying above $20,000 these past few days, so expect that altcoins will dump hard too especially those mid to small-market cap altcoins.If you take a look even there is not really some bad news on the project or FUD, price is still falling.",

While this token was pumped almost to your stated price.So if there is any upcoming event/news of this token, it can pump again possibly to $1 ( or to its previous high, $0.960 ) If there is no event, then wait for bitcoin to recover.",

Im feeling skeptical for this week but you may wait until the end of year. it may reach $1 again. You can expect a big announcement to come and then the price will be flying to the moon. Bitcoin is slowly recovering again and i hope this pattern will be pretty much the same like the end of 2018. Next year will be another year for recovery phase of crypto after it has been facing a huge dump gradually. The token has been pumped caused by a bad news but it was facing another correction again. Litentry developers needs to rolling out another good announcement.",

What is the trend now, bear? But we have been on this trend since last time and yet LIT still manage to rise on its own. Sorry, but I think reaching 1 usd for this coin is not that hard as you think. Can you see the recovery? It recovered 10% only in just a day. I think that was a good one and if that continues on the next day or two then we are finally on that price target the op is aiming about.I am not familiar on this project as well but maybe they really have a good fundamental because where will be the demand coming from? We are at the bear and everyone is silent but it does not mean that they aren't hunting for a potential coin which can be a great addition to their portfolio.",

It is possible for Lit to get to $1, or increase above the price, but also it is possible for the coin to fall significantly and fall below what you may be expecting. Speculators should learn that depending on how the market is behaving their actions should change as well, if someone feels like investing in new altcoins during the middle of a bull run, even if I still think it is a bad idea I can understand it because at that time almost all the coins in the market are going up so they have better chances to make money, but to do so when there is a bear market is a huge mistake, and even if they happen to win once in a while the odds will always be against them.",

November might be a good month for this, and this project actually looks good with a potential to rise. There’s a good volume as well with LIT, and if the project made some update as well I expect $1 can be hit and even pump more. Bull trend will also play an important role here, let’s see if the whole market recovers.",
