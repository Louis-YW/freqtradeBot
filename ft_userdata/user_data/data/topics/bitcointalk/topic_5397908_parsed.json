  "content": "There is one thing I have come to understand about gddr6x graphic cards, before the hundred percent LHR unlock came I used to get 58MH on my 3070ti using 176watt and my memory temp is around 86°C max but now that the unlock came out I am getting 82MH and GPU is taking 190watt to run perfectly but the memory temp is 103°C, the higher the watt your gpu is using the higher your mem temp goes.",
