  "content": "if you are not the house, and have full control you cannot win. and you would also loss everything.the 1933 incident tell me only one lesson, the reason president potus going full crack down on gold bars and gold certificate is all due to the government want to have control over the gold, by confiscating every gold bars they can have the control over the gold, also the control price of the gold, by having the control, the government can be the house of this gold market, price and the volume. Yes just three element they want to control to be the house, price, volume and the market, market is also called the buyer and seller, or called it bidder and asker market. Did the governemnt suceed in controlling the gold market to date? They seem to be having some success, but the gold is always unregulatable. Government confiscate gold bars is a certainty, unlike value investing which is a made up intellectual assumption and a lie.what about the warren buffett always sing about his philosophy of value investing wherever he goes? A lot of young people on the /biz follow his books and some of them invest his life saving many of them even take out home loan to invest based on his value investing philosophy, some of the kill himself over the loss? well in my opinion, warren buffett is a senile old man, and irresposible with his political views, he is politician in nature. For his value investing student, they become the victim of natural selection, by foolishly listen to a well known oracle of the omaha, they ended up commit a sin of crime without a victim but themselve to be blamed, they kill themselves over the loss and become part of a statistic to the eduacted one, despite many have been killed it would not changed the warren buffett opinion on his irresponsible advices.Lastly why are the SEC now cracking down heavily on the cryptocurrency? in my opinion, the SEC is trying to capture as many control as possible, they can't allow the cryptocurrency to be completely free of restriction. the SEC want to be the house in this cryptocurrency, by being the house in cryptocurrency they can always win, there really isn't much lesson to be learnt, it is whether you are the house and you always win, or you believe in value investing and thinking it is truth like the religion, and loss your life saving.but how about the many young people who follow the value investing advices and end up losing everything and some took it to themselves and end their own life? they are good and decent people who follow rules obediently but they end up having to kill themselves? idk I didn't create this society, I am unable to change this world, but the very little I can do is try to educate people on what is absolutelt wrong about this world, and I try not to be keep all to myself, and share as much as I could, so some can be saved, although many would still fall victim.",

There are many ways to win if we refer to investments that are not value investing, one of them is to buy bitcoin, and the SEC that you criticise has done very well to consider it a commodity and not a security like the thousands of shitty alts that exist and that do not stop being created.

      "body": "There are many who beat the house on a consistent basis. I think the biggest opponent isn't the house. But rather people tend to be their own biggest opponents. Many lottery winners who take a fast track to wealth end up poor again, within a short span of time. They cannot control themselves and spend their way into debt, no matter how much money they have. Having self control and discipline is a super power that not everyone has. The key to beating the house is having some degree of discipline. Being able to avoid being impulsive and not making critical choices based on emotion. Many do not have this. They must beat themselves before they can beat the house.I don't think topics relating to finance, politics and the economy are rocket science. Most people are intelligent enough to figure out everything about them. But choose not to. They see it as a burden and avoid it. If they see something about COVID-19 being a lab leak. They work extremely hard to forget what they saw so as not to be \"burdened\" by it. While this may be a sad precedent. It is the area in society where the biggest gains can be made. The biggest gains for civilization cannot be made by the most motivated people being more motivated. It can be made by the least motivated trying harder. The biggest gains for society can't be made by the most knowledgeable gaining more knowledge. The biggest gains are found in the least knowledgeable people trying harder to learn. We face a strange situation where the least motivated and the least knowledgeable believe that their key to salvation is the most motivated and most knowledgeable fighting for them. But this is not where the biggest gains can be made.",

(kill yourselves, you want to argue it is worth killing yourselves, just for the sake of making profit and become instant internet celeb?)investing is one of them not even worth trying. it make zero sense to try to enrich the owner of the conpany by buying and propping up their stock price. yeah you would likely say i can make money flipping his stock price, by any means you think it is worth trying for making profit for yourselves, that is really toiling too hard to me. you are not the house too.now would you think about why it is always the professional, such as teacher engineer lawyer doctor accountant who often loss lifesaving on investing all over the news? i strongly convinced they are professional who dare to trying in life, since they enjoy trying the impossible, and it become their habit and they doesn't even grow suspicious on it, even though it would harm themselves by investing all of their life saving.finally i begin to wonder whether go to school, get good grade, get a good paying job with benefit is even worth trying when the job security is  totally uncommon in today competitive market where the company you worked for often go bust?Quote from: Hydrogen on March 03, 2023, 11:49:52 PM...Many lottery winners who take a fast track to wealth end up poor again, within a short span of time... The key to beating the house is having some degree of discipline...many lottery winners, in fact i have seem lottery gambler making winning bet, they made some few thousands dollar of prizes money from their lucky numbers pairing, but they often failed to say they also has a lot of losing bet which sum up to a few thousands dollar of loss too. what about the prize they win after the occasional lucky bet? obviously they didn't stick to the old adage of \"you should quit gambling as soon as you make some small profit in casino and never look back.\" a lot of untold horror stories from the gambling addict, obviously i would not even interest in listening to their rant. but that is the reality in life, nobody would listen to the poor and unimpressed, if you are rich and successful everybody would listen to you.Quote from: Hydrogen on March 03, 2023, 11:49:52 PM...I don't think topics relating to finance, politics and the economy are rocket science.

But this is not where the biggest gains can be made.i believe you are trying to say making mistake is exactly how to improve vastly in life. i am completely vouch for making mistake in life, because every miracle in life obviously must come from people who willing to challenge the unknown, aeroplane didn't just magically appear in the wild, light bulb didn't existed naturally unless thomas edison experiment on it, nuclear energy is a work of mistake created by einstein, they are all unlike what warren buffett tout about his magically compouding value investing, he said it is just existed so you just believe on it and you do not ask why, or even trying contradict with his point of views.Quote from: Solosanz on March 04, 2023, 05:07:42 AMYou're forget if most of cryptocurrencies are centralized... it's good if SEC want to have a control over the centralized coins in order to minimize the scam coins exist on the exchanges......But even though SEC want to control Bitcoin, they can't 100% control it ... via P2P without need permission from the centralized party.most crypto is centralized, that also include bitcoin itself, the segwit in the bitcoin itself is unironically highly centralized, to help lower the transaction fee. why is centralisation gaining traction, idk?SEC would try to regulate, but before the SEC come in and trying to regulate, there is too many attempt to control the bitcoin, a lot of hackers try to control the code and they are all failed, i do not know what is SEC is capable of, i do not think they have a chance, the SEC can't even take down the bit torrent protocol.Quote from: crwth on March 04, 2023, 05:20:16 AM...mindset in which you are blaming ...proven and shown credibility with his wealth is wrong?...it is the same as the principle of the value investing? warren buffett prove himself to be bailing out by the fed, with massive bailout in the expense of taxpayer money, that is a lot of courage and credibility to me, and he become the shiny example to the generation to come to emulate this success, by getting bailout when they screwed up trillion dollars in life, bravo, no wonder we have ftx, and lunatic today!",

But saying all investments would only end up at a loss, I have to say it’s only happening for those who only invest without risk awareness, without prior knowledge and skills about the investment, and with greed as their motivation to invest. Surely, investing this way will never be successful. However, if you invest in the right investments, if you know your investments well and you are doing the right thing, then you will have the advantage to win over the market. But if you invest like when you are gambling, then definitely you can never beat the house and win over it.",

But you can always increase the chance of winning if you invest in those investments with high potentials to succeed and those who have been proven profitable by a lot of successful investor.

well i hope i can make it clear, i would hope bitcoin to last forever, but in my lifetime that won't be my concern, i won't be living 200 years in this world to see bitcoin still existed in the future society, but that is more than enough for me survive without having to worry too much on bitcoin getting obsoleted, my only concern now is fiat would face the same fate very soon and in 200 years fiat would die and it is very near to its dead, it is too near to be honest, i need to escape or i would die too, which make bitcoin much appealing, better alternative to fiat which is about to die, bitcoin could last another 190 years that is enough for me to feel safe since i would have likely died by the time bitcoin getting obsoleted in the next 190 years.back to topic, \"you are not the house, you cannot win\", it stand very true, you can never dream of beating gold, real estate and casino, even though you risk your life to try, you would still loss, you simply stand no chance to beat them. many try to beat the house, many have failed, many have died trying to beat the house, do not believe me, a lot of gamblers commit suicide trying to beat the house, read the news and horror story, do not just believe me.about why it has to be 200 years? in my opinion, money is a form of memory in our mindset, in other word a perception \"fiat is money\" that live rent free in our mindset, we spend time resource and energy (opm opt opr) to make a piece of paper money work, \"buying a piece of memory\" make a lot of sense, fiat has value on our hand, because the bank spend a lot of time resource and energy to combat the counterfeit fiat, it is said \"visa spend more energy on running the fiat currency than bitcoin protocol,\" it is true, the vast amount of energy on visa transaction is spend on combating the counterfeit digital fiat money, visa did a lot of verifying in their computer system to ensure the digital money they received through the mechant is \"valid and genuine\", all the anti counterfeiting digital fiat procedure required a lot of computing energy that's also why visa is a very energy hungry money, (that sound like fiat is also a Proof of Work), when it come to oversea money remittance the energy used to combat counterfeit fiat get more tedious, and bitcoin protocol make a better alternative to visa in comparison, \"bitcoin consume less energy than visa in the same hundreds of billions dollar transacted with POW\" which is a very big milestone to the money transfer system, because the energy saving is jaw dropping! and why money could only last just 200 years? because people would forget the piece of memory as time past, when the last person who accept the fiat cease to existed in this world, that is also spell the end of the memory of the fiat money they hold.\"your wealth won't last more than two generations\" hold very true, two generations also means just 200 years, when the last person cease to existed it is also spell the memory with the person would also be gone, just within 200 years, nobody can recall the memory from the 200 years ago, that also include they can't recall the money that is traded by the people from 200 years ago, the memory of them are all totally forgotten. look at the paper money from world war II, anyone care? zoomers try very hard to ignore every memory concerning the world wars, zoomers also do not want any paper money sourced from the world wars II? also the loss of memory of the paper money also result on nothing of value is loss to the future generation, your grand son do not need your obsoleted money and they would still live well in the future society. memory loss and money getting obsoleted might be the only reason warren buffett getting very pervasive on value investing, his approach although is questionable but he did successful in trapping a lot of young people with debt and loss money on investing, the youth who have debt would likely help keeping the money strong and never be forgotten and obsoleted within 200 years, the more debt the young people have, the stronger the money, the stronger the economy, and the less likely the money to be obsoleted. warren buffett going insane on bitcoin is clear proof that he is insecure about the money (notably his money too) getting obsoleted, when youth all get out of debt and making insane profit out of bitcoin, it make his money getting less and less relevant, and eventually the money is totally obsoleted when all the youth pay off their debt with the profit coming from bitcoin.now you challenge me to explain what is \"being the house\",it is as simple as to be doing nothing, just be the house and always win. to be the house and always win, all you need to do is buy gold, buy a house and lastly be the casino owner. to be value investing, you do exactly the opposite, believe in you can beat the house, do not buy gold, do not buy house, do not be casino owner, but believe you stand a chance to beat the house, you think you are more powerful than a house and can beat the house alone and like the superhero who beat every villian in the video, and believe by sticking with value investing, looking at the value on the screen, the stock screener, you think you saw an opportunity to make a winning \"the beat the house\" bet and success, fat hope.",
