This might indeed cause a further issue for it but certainly not much for the crypto space.Source: Silvergate Issue",

Is it just FUD?If FUD is mentioned then for sure it's real!Lately, I've seen this happening so many times that I know when bitcoiners scream FUD is as clear as the sky is blue.So, we have a report from January they sold assets to cover an enormous 8.1 billion withdrawal, they have laid off 40% of their workforce, they have shelved their plans for a stablecoin at a loss with millions spent on developing and now they have asked for a delay in publishing their annual report and are asking another audit firm to do the job. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1312109/000110465923027353/tm238251d1_nt10k.htmQuoteAs reported in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 17, 2023 (the \"Earnings Release\"), the Company’s preliminary, unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022, included a net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $948.7 million compared to net income available to common shareholders of $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.The Company sold additional debt securities in January and February 2023 and expects to record further losses related to the other-than-temporary impairment on the securities portfolio.These additional losses will negatively impact the regulatory capital ratios of the Company and the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Silvergate Bank (the \"Bank\"), and could result in the Company and the Bank being less than well-capitalized.How do you call a bank that is less than well-capitalized?FUD? No, a clear statement was received by the SEC of their estimated losses and further losses as well as the inability to produce a report!95% loss currently in one year from the highest point.",

If people don't deposit funds then how will the bank survive. The bank was holding many assets owned by the famous platform FTX, and it was not originally expected that it would last so long after the collapse of the platform. It was announced earlier that the bank sold part of its assets to cover withdrawals at a very high value. The wave of withdrawals began after the bank disclosed that it had failed to submit the financial reports for the year 2022 and that it intended to change the company responsible for auditing. The widening of the difference between the amounts of withdrawals and deposits is what exacerbated the matter, as evidenced by the bank's inability to pay the dues of its customers and its necessity to sell its assets.",

This could in theory happen to every single bank, but it seems to be specifically caused via their connection to fiat currency, which have been in the sights of cryto regulators lately and could be under the microscope. Even the most stable bank works on the basis that they take deposits in and lend based on those deposits, but don't necessary have the full amount of funds to cover all costs immediately if there is a bank run. It would seem to have crept in and had an effect on the Bitcoin price today with a little drop.",

It was very convenient because it kept arbitrage and hedges tight so the crypto coins and tokens had good liquidity when it was needed. If silvergate goes it'll make it difficult for market makers and arbitragers to keep prices constant between exchanges. Anyone know how FDIC insurance works if say Coinbase keeps like $100M in an account on Silvergate? Last I heard FDIC only covers like $250K per account.",

This happened about an hour ago. His twitter is @OliverBCBI think if Silvergate can survive the weekend then they might recover from this. Some exchanges such as OK Coin said they will still use them. Not every exchange has left the bank. However this brings back memories of Lehman moment (or Bear Stearns). They basically got shut down on a Friday, and FDIC took over during the weekend and it was sold off to JPM (or some other bank) by Monday with people's deposits. Going to be a VERY dicey week.

Things will not change even with full adoption if the largest payment gateway between major crypto exchanges is going down and is facing bankruptcy the problems would still be there with or without mass adoption, the only difference might be in the amount we tumble for bad or worse. Just look around you and see how interconnected all economies are, how every commodity or asset varies based on market conditions, bitcoin will not be exempt from those in case something bad happens, it would be weirder if this wouldn't happen!You need to understand that global adoption and institutional investors also come with disadvantages, we haven't invented in some magical assets that are immune to the market woes and last year should have proved to everyone that.",

And also within 24 hours most of the exchanges in the SEN decided to cut ties from the bank. Why did this all of a sudden? I think the exchanges probably know something that we don't. Also SI is typically institutionally owned if you look at the %'s of holders. Since it went down so much, it was the institutions which were selling and they also must of known something was up. Since the bank is still alive and stock price seems stable its a good sign.",

There was a bank stock I remember seeing that went from $5.00 down to $0.03. Then after the bank bailout was announced within a few weeks that $0.03 went up to 3.00 for around 100x gains.I'm not certain what percentage of crypto banking services silvergate provided or what their exposure to the crypto market was in millions / billions. I think those could be the critical factors moving forward. Finance gurus typically use terms like \"house of cards\" and \"fallling domino effect\" to describe worst case scenarios associated with bubbles and big crashes. Hopefully the crypto industry is decentralized across enough nations and separately banking providers to be effectively insulated from FTX and silvergate asset contagion.
