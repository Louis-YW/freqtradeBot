Please let me know. Looking at the alt coin section, Ethereum will surely come to mind. Because its trading volume is close to 670 million per day. The most trading is in the Ethereum section. So without a doubt Ethereum coin can be called the king of the alot coin section. And if you want to invest in a second place other than Bitcoin, you must choose Ethereum.",

I don't consider it as a King or whatever it is at all. I think using the word \"King\" to an altcoin is kind of irrelevantat all. The word \"King\" is being used to a male person or maybe some animals, but not on an altcoin or any coin.Let's not make it more complicated at all. Let's just say that Ethereum is the top altcoin in terms of market cap.",

While bitcoin is the king of all cryptocurrencies and the market then ETH is specifically the king of altcoins.You may think of any other altcoins that's being considered as the king of alts but, the sole basis right now is the rankings that they get from websites like cmc that we used to visit and that's basing through their market capitalization.",

Each altcoin provides multiple success stories of its holders or adopters, so they have their own favorite altcoins. After all, the competition between altcoins is not over yet and development is still continuing. I think the title as \"king\" changes with every hype. During the nft hype, many creators were using smart contract PoS systems due to more sustain scalability, and then ETH surprisingly hardforked to keep up with the competition.",

I noticed that Ethereum is worthy of mentioning the king of Altcoins.The funny thing is, over the years, there have always been a lot of new projects coming out and saying they will replace ETH, but so far, there has not been any altcoin that can replace ETH. ETH deserves to be called the king of the altcoin market, and I firmly believe that, like BTC, its place will be irreplaceable. Even I am pretty sure that it will give better returns than BTC in the upcoming bull season. The 2021 bull season has already happened, so it's no surprise it will happen again.",

Please let me know. I think in a sense, ETH can be called \"King of Altcoins\", when measured in terms of capitalization, cost and user community. Will it always be like this? Unknown. If another project becomes more popular and more expensive, and most importantly, finds a better application among mankind, then the \"King of Altcoins\" ETH will no longer be. So, this can be called a temporary and passing title, for the time being.In fact, no matter how you call this or that project, the main thing is the acceptance of this by the user community and the presence of usefulness.",

Please let me know. Looking at the last few years and also right now i would definitely say, that Ethereum is the king of all altcoins. As you say, you just need to look at the current marketcap of the cryptocurrency projects and it is already obvious that Ethereum is by far the biggest crypto project, besides Bitcoin itself of course. It's marketcap is more than 4 times higher than the one of Binance.I also think that ETH is the king of altcoins for another reason. ETH was the project, that invented smart contracts, which was probably the biggest and most important thing that happened in the crypto space since it was invented. Without smart contracts we would not have Defi, NFT's, Tokens. Dexes and so on.",
