Well they could be but meanwhile Jito out of blue giving $10k bare minimum airdrop is quite a feel, let's see how projects you mentioned give airdrop or not and if they do, how much.

Happy for the Solana devsOne good thing about solana is transactions are cheap compared to ethereum, plus I don't think it's team rectifying mistakes as it's projects built on Solana giving airdrops not or Solana itself, but yea if you mean Solana devs making platform welcoming for projects to come in, that I agree.",

I posted about it last month 2 weeks before the snapshot, hopefully someone read it and implemented the strategy.Quote from: dbshck on November 11, 2023, 03:41:58 PMQuote from: R1dwanRz on November 11, 2023, 03:10:51 PMFor me, staking during a bull run has been akin to hitting two birds with one stone as enjoying the rewards from staking and potentially benefiting from the rising value of the staked assets.Same case here. Staking Solana in the past months has been not just hitting two birds for me, but more because of the potential airdrop from several projects. I mainly stake it on Jito, then deposit those JitoSOL into margin.fi. Both protocols (Jito and Margin) have points system which likely is meant for their upcoming airdrop. So with that strategy I got:7% SOL yieldRising SOL priceJito pointsMargin.fi pointsThat's four birds with one stone.Anyway, good list OP! Jupiter airdrop will also have 4 phases, so it's still highly recommended to use the protocol regularly (where else would you swap duh ). Another thing, Solblaze already had a token $BLZE, though they still have a reward system for users who stake and provide liquidity for $bSOL",

Didn't knew such term \" wrong airdrops \" exit either, lol. I don't think we can call them wrong, only because their value is lesser than the other ones. The amount of airdrop that we can get will also depend on our performance and other requirements, so some can still get a good amounts from those projects. Cryptos aren't only or mainly about the airdrops.In fact, they are only like a bonus for supporting some crypto projects. Layer Zero and ZkSync are I think still good performing coins, and that is also what the majority are saying, so we can still benefit greatly on them if we utilize them properly (e.g through investing, or trading).",

Obviously it is. No one has money to put into every project, staking and trading etc in hopes of hitting right snapshot date and getting something back. It's pure luck or you need to know the people who are organizing the airdrop. i am guessing my friends missed out this too. I still won't be hunting airdrops myself, even though it's almost as tempting as gambling. But i feel with gambling i have better odds.
