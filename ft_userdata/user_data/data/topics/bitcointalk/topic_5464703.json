Not entirely correct, in 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2022 there were short dump, that's mean not every Bitcoin declared is dead will make Bitcoin price came back stronger. Many people already trust in Bitcoin, if you look the occasions after 2019, it's full of economist, investors, bankers etc that are the real Bitcoin's haters because they scared if Bitcoin perform better than the bank and the other commodity.It's like judges vs lawyer since each of them will argue they're correct in their opinion.",

Diarrhea cryptoworld detractors also cite price appreciation as the reason for their disdain for the instrument. In fact, what I see is that they expect a little truth and a lot of care in their statements and actions. Yes. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the entire digital currency market have generated tremendous enthusiasm from their supporters and detractors. So relax, it's like smartphones and other technological innovations in recent years have allowed us to carry sophisticated cell phones, cameras, computers and more in our pockets.",

Yes, let's say there is still some truth, but it seems to be a little out of 100%. There are other articles that are just fake news or misleading content, and there are others that are also true if we just do our own research on whatever the topic is being talked about.Then, if you think about what you mentioned at the time, that a bitcoin was only 30 dollars, it seems that if I had just reached that, I would probably have bought it for sure, if this is my knowledge and understanding here. Besides, I have read many articles saying that Bitcoin is dead, but all of them are not true. And obviously, they are just Bitcoin haters.",

I will definitely share these with those who speak wrongly about BTC and always criticise it; instead, they should criticise the methods one follows to make money.Like many times, people come up with hugely greedy and risky ideas to book some more profits, and they stick themselves in huge problems besides financial ones, and at the end they talk bad about BTC.On the positive side, this graph could be used to motivate ourselves and others who just got hit or lost assets due to the manipulation in the market. As we all know, these dips in BTC are temporary.
