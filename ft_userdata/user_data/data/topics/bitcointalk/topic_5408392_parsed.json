You just need to stick to positive principles, take what you need to take advantage of for example eliminating third parties and cutting unnecessary costs. Regulations should be obeyed consciously, so you will not violate them even if you are on free space.Decentralization or centralization will not turn good people into bad people, and vice versa. Regulation has been around for a long time and it doesn't reduce crime rates. No matter how good prevention is, criminals are always one step ahead of finding other methods of crime.",

As for the decentralized nature, of Bitcoin in this case, what is happening is that it has been centralized through various entities such as custodial wallets or centralized exchanges. You can use Bitcoin in a decentralized way, like if you hire me to do a job and send me Bitcoin as a P2P payment, but nowadays many of the transactions go through centralized entities in one way or another. Some people see it in a very negative way, while others see it as practically inevitable.",

You are right to have your reservations about regulations, and it would pretty much invalidate the decentralization of the crypto industry, while not solving rug pulls or eliminating scams.Decentralization means you do not rely on any central authority, and do not need to trust a middle man. Regulation is the exact opposite as with it, a central authority can control, freeze, or lock your funds, and request you to prove why it should be released to you.",

But decentralization, freedom and lack of accountability enjoyed in the crypto sphere have given much impetus to fraudsters and ponzi scheme operators pretending to be genuine crypto operators. Their operations have given rise to the birth of countless worthless shitcoins pre-designed to fail. These scammers keep giving the crypto space bad reputation and to a large extent discourage people from venturing into the real and genuine crypto palace. I totally support deregulation or decentralization, but some sort of regulation or control to limit and discourage the entry or operations of these crypto bad-eggs should be put in place.",

Let me give you two opposite examples.First is the case in New York some years back. They \"regulated\" bitcoin businesses by requiring them to sign up for a license that had a lot of restrictions and high taxes. Not only it didn't facilitate mass adoption, it did the opposite by forcing business out of NY.Second case is in Japan where they accepted bitcoin as a legitimate currency and also removed all taxes from payments made in bitcoin. That helped the bitcoin adoption speed up since businesses were more comfortable to accept bitcoin.It didn't change anything in adoption of cryptocurrencies aka altcoins though.As you can see regulation on its own is not good or bad. We have to see this as a case by case basis to figure what kind of effects it is going to have on the bitcoin adoption.",

Regulations are not bad as they are helpful as preventive solutions for newbies to avoid or at least reduce risk of scam exposure and being scammed.However, I agree with you that having more regulations (better regulations) does not mean we should again trust governments and put our money into their finance system from either fiat currencies to CBDCs. They are completely centralized and unsafe.Let they regulate Bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry, exclusively crypto market but don't store your Bitcoin on any centralized platforms. No matter whether those platforms are controlled or regulated by governments.\"Not your keys, not your coins\" means let's use non custodial wallets.",

      "body": "I think that in the regulation of what we call cryptocurrencies, two currents are breaking down that want to go in two different directions. The first direction is an ordinary wild west in which everyone does what they want and mostly passes without serious consequences, and is supported by all those who want to continue running their crypto Ponzi scheme indefinitely. The second direction has nothing against the regulation of the crypto sector, on the contrary, it encourages the authorities to get serious and disable various entrepreneurs who earn billions of dollars through their projects, leaving behind millions of defrauded people, and thus they harm all honest people who do not have any bad intentions. When I talk about bad people, I am primarily referring to narcissistic maniacs like Kwon who publicly admit that they enjoy watching everything around them fail, and then cause a mega earthquake on the crypto market with their actions. Bitcoin is something completely different and in a separate category, and it is difficult for any positive regulation to harm it.",

That's everything to most and regulations would only take that away which would make it no different from the CBDC out there. Contrary to mass adoption, I think it would just fade off and that's so much not what we need.Talking about criminals, I guess they've never stopped from the beginning of time, its left for users of the cryptospace to grow wiser.",

They are totally free to start a project anytime, even with unsustainable and simply ridiculous tokenomics, start an ICO or IEO or whatever, and make money. The project fails; they create another one and, again, make money. There is no office or agency whatsoever which scrutinizes or approves any of these projects.",

Why the adoption affectes cryptocurrency it's because cryptocurrency have a influence over More buying and selling in the market",
