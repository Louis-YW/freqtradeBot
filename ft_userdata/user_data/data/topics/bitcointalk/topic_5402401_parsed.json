But I do not know which kind of script, address etc should place if I just need to import bulk of keysIf your private keys start with \"5\", it means their public key is uncompressed. So, it's P2PKH. So make sure your wallet is not descriptor. Quote from: ArthurY on June 13, 2022, 10:58:32 AMFor example which request should I run to import such of keys?Why don't you loop importprivkey?Code:bitcoin-cli importprivkey \"private_key\" \"label\" falseWith RPC, it'd be:Code:curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\": \"curltest\", \"method\": \"importprivkey\", \"params\": [\"PRIVATE_KEY\", \"label_x\", false]}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/wallet/WALLET_NAMECreate a txt file and insert your private keys there like:Code: (\"foo.txt\")5Jza3odChZ1vfzmRSSK6qJZCuGdXYR4RndFHXx1KEWq9AiDkwCj5JebES9429R4HNFUcX5kFgR7FAoFWxpHZ3XrvAf4bSNNxijzxRB5J4WYCjKqG7JxY3fjj2ukusd36mXMVas42bTh2nesd6HwaFtwh7Now create this bash script. It reads every line of your text file and runs the curl command.Code: (\"test.sh\")#!/bin/bashfor i in `seq 1 3`;do    line=\"`head -$i foo.txt | tail +$i`\"    echo $line;    curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\": \"curltest\", \"method\": \"importprivkey\", \"params\": [\"'$line'\", \"any_label\", false]}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/wallet/WALLET_NAME;doneReplace USERNAME, PASSWORD and WALLET_NAME accordingly. On linux you can run it with:Code:bash test.shI'd make sure I connect to my Bitcoin server via a secure transfer protocol, because there's sensitive info transferred.",

      "body": "Just a little observation on the code, that one will work only for 3 Private keys, we could change this line:Code:for i in `seq 1 3`;for:Code:for i in $(cat foo.txt);or another solution is to change the 3 for a variable:Code:z=$(cat foo.txt | wc -l)for i in `seq 1 $z`;This way the script will work for any number of Private keys in the file.",
