It offers complete traceability, protection against counterfeiting, authentication, and abuse prevention. In other words, it makes the art market safer, more reliable, and more efficient.Riwa Tech doesn't stop there. By utilizing advanced IoT technologies like E-Tag and Smart Warehouse, the company ensures the security and transparency of physical assets. Artworks and antiques can be linked to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), thus increasing their value and providing a new financial channel for art and antique holders.A particularly innovative aspect of Riwa Tech's proposal is the introduction of F-NFTs, which allow for the fractional ownership of an artwork. This means that multiple individuals can own a share of an artwork, making art more accessible and democratic. For example, a painting by Monet could be owned by several people, each having a portion of the artwork.But how does this exactly work? Let's take the example of a Van Gogh painting. With Riwa Tech's solution, this painting would be equipped with an E-Tag that records all relevant information on the blockchain: authenticity, provenance, previous transactions, and more. If a collector wants to purchase this painting, they can verify all this information in real-time, ensuring a secure transaction.Riwa Tech envisions creating a meta-space for art galleries and museums. This virtual space would allow artists and collectors to exhibit their artworks and collections, conduct transactions, rentals, and auctions through a secure and authenticated virtual identity. Imagine being able to visit the Louvre or MoMA from the comfort of your living room!In addition to these innovations, Riwa Tech also offers an AI-based service, adding another layer of sophistication to their offering.Riwa Tech's innovative approach has the potential to transform the art and antique industry, making it more transparent, secure, and accessible. The fusion of art and technology promises a bright future ahead.Network: Polygon networkTotal Supply: 100,000,000 RIWADecimals: 18Contract: 0x6ea68e3E7d1443c15b13C02f61DFB1556D57B94aDiscord: https://discord.gg/veavNDt6Twitter: https://twitter.com/riwatech_ukTelegram: https://t.me/riwatech",
