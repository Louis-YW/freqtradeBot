  "content": "A few years ago, let's say, probably more than one year ago, there was an ominous transaction occurring in the Bitcoin Blockchain that generated a lot of discussion and controversy. Apparently, the transaction hash was too unexpected or quite impossible to have been generated randomly and there would be a chance that it could be generated by someone who had enough computational to do so. This generated a lot of theories, one of them being that the transaction could have been generated somewhere in the future by Satoshi himself. Or even by Hal Finney who in the future would have been brought back from its cryogenic state and healed from his illness and capable of sending this transaction back to the past as a message.I know there was a thread about this matter, but I cannot seem to find itâ€¦Does anyone know or remember this?",

      "body": "I never came across such a thread, but it's really amazing how people always want to make weird theories when itâ€™s something involving Satoshi or the early Bitcoin users. Of all things, why would someone think a transaction getting sent from the future?I guess some people just don't prefer simplicity anymore.",

This generated a lot of theories, one of them being that the transaction could have been generated somewhere in the future by Satoshi himself.(.....)I believe it's just pure random. Even Satoshi Nakamoto is still here, it's still random. Not unless that transaction came from the suspected Bitcoin wallets that is identified by Satoshi Nakamoto before but up until now, there are still no transactions made on those Bitcoin wallets that connected from Satoshi Nakamoto.Bitcoin network is already good now, with or without Satoshi Nakamoto so overall it's all fine for me and these things I really considered as theories only.",

Either case we see things like this semi-regularly. Here is a somewhat similar topic on Satoshi being back because of a signature, if someone doesn't read the replies or if the clarifying answer is overlooked people could believe the title of that topic and remember it years later as Satoshi having signed a message in 2022...",

I know this was very talked about in themedia as well. But at that time, my belief was that if we had already built the AI singularity, it simply could be able to send information backwards in time, and that specific transaction would be proof of both the AI singularity and proof that information was totally independant from time itself. At least this is what the black hole theory tells us.",
