QuoteWhats make you think if RENEC would be next ETH and BNB? Is it L1 same as both coins? Renec Blockchain is an L1 Blockchain, and has Renec as its native coin, the project was developed by a reputable cryptocurrency exchange that have been in operation since 2014.Renec Blockchain is a blockchain that other projects can build on, so this should tell you that in the future, Renec coin will used to pay gas fees to transact on the Renec blockchain, the same way Eth and Bnb are used right now.Renec has a total supply of approximately 75,000,000 coins and most of it are locked for up to five years, this should tell you that the coin supply is very limited and this is just a tip of the iceberg.visit explorer.renec.foundation to find out more about the total supply, current circulating supply and total number of Renec coin staked on the blockchain.Quote from: jaberwock on December 22, 2022, 11:52:21 PMQuote from: SeeBiscuit on December 22, 2022, 07:15:52 AMThe \"Forum\" on that website and the \"Blog\" on that website all look A.I. generated.

I see you're exaggerating when you try to compare it to Ethereum or Binance smart chain, it's a pretty lame comparison. It just launched this year which means it has a long way to go and find a way to survive this bear season before thinking it will become as big as ETH or BNB.Remitano was doing great before Binance was born, but since the birth of Binance, it has almost eclipsed all other P2P exchanges, I doubt Remitano's existence in the future.",

However I still see more risk with RENEC token than with ETH and BNB.BNB now has very cheap price and from $250 to $4000 like ETH made in 2020 bull market, it's enough for me. x20 with BNB is enough and I don't want to take higher risk with RENEC.",

I think supply doesn't really matter but what matters the most is if the coin is not a scam and then it has a great utility. The OP already state some of its features so you should refer to it and decide if Renec is a good investment for the future or not. One of the features of this coin is said it was highly decentralized. I like this to be honest because when we saw decentralized means we can be anonymous and then it was also free from manipulations. Not many crypto are decentralized and if ever there are, I think they aren't really that good except from BTC of course.",
