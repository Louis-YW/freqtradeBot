However, trezor has many issues before even it is open source it doesn't mean it's secured.",

However, it is by strict definition open source since you cannot modify and sell it. as @mk4 said it's not the friendliest ui to use but they do have a lot of videos on how to use just about every feature.It's also fairly indestructible. Mine met a large cup of coffee with no issues.Also, it depends if you just want a HW wallet for BTC or if there is other crypto you want to store. ColdCard is BTC only.-Dave",

Everyone wants to get it, but it is basically impossible. There is no such thing as perfect security and safety. There will always be vulnerabilities that we may not know about at the moment, but one day they will be found and the issue of HW device security will become open.Again, you put the question in this way, \"what do you think?\". I can think one thing, but it will be completely different from the real situation. I may think that ledger are the most secure wallet, but will it really be so?There is another point. To voice my opinion on this question, I need to have experience using all or most of the hardware wallets that exist on the crypto market. If I had only trezor and ledger, then my assessment will not be objective. Although, of course, of these two options, I will choose trezor.I'll try to answer your question. I don't believe that there is or will be the most secure HW device . Each wallet will be good for certain situations, as well as have its drawbacks. Your question is most likely rhetorical.",

Yeah, considering the past activities we can say that trezor has quite good advantages over ledger in terms of privacy. However, one who travels a lot might opt for ledger as it offers mobile application, i.e., ease of connection on the go via bluetooth service (on nano x), etc. In case of trezor, you have to carry a USB cable everytime for connection.It depends on what type of user you really are otherwise both are good imo.",
