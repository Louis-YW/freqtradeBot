Coffee shops/cafes don't have a bad return if you're in a place a lot of people go to work or shop - even ones that sell drinks to go (especially if you can rent a profitible business or are in a good place - like near the end of the strip or the middle). Offering services as well could bring more peace of mind to you knowing chargebacks are less likely (if someone sells you crypto) if you can watch the first confirmation while they're still in the building. Also it might be worth offering currency exchange services too to allow for the cost of buying things like currency checkers.Realistically if you're on a high street that's that busy, you shouldn't be too far from a police station or security for carrying large volumes of cash and you also should be in a place that can deal with accepting cash (just note that not all banks are insured to carry large amounts of cash - a lot may only be licenced for up to $20,000-$100,000 which could be an issue if everyone expects to spend/invest their cash on payday).",

Yep, I use them occasionally as here in Croatia we can sell/buy bitcoin up to certain amount in physical exchanges with no KYC, and exchange fee is very similar to the one you mention (which is pretty decent and usually better than ATM ) and they are quite popular over here.

If the status of bitcoin in the country is legal and not banned so it won't be considered illegal if it is traded or exchanged or P2P. This is normal and has been happening a long time. If the owner of the shop decides to collect his sales in bitcoin then it should not be a problem. It is owners of business that are suppose to promote bitcoin to a greater extent, like PayPal introduced it already.Quote from: cloudybtc on October 18, 2022, 08:04:36 PMHowever, I am unsure of the safety of random people walking in your store...This shouldn't be a problem if you understand blockchain technology.
