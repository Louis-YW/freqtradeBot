  "content": "Good news today from the FTX lawyers. They said that over $7.3B has been recovered and they are considering actually rebooting the exchange somewhere in the Q2. FTT is rallying over 40% on this news, almost topping $2. The only issue with this is that if assets such as SOL drop back down to <$10 then obviously they won't have $7.3B anymore. Since their largest holding is SOL with owning over 10% of the supply. Either way its a good win since many will get some of their assets back at least. Hopefully this wont be another MtGox which took over a decade.",

      "body": "Does anyone know if Justin kept his promise and credited TRX tokens on his exchange swapped for TRX stuck on FTX?Because after the news the price of TRX spiked to like $0.25 and the price on other exchanges was $0.05. Meaning if you had $100 stuck you had to overpay by 400%, so you pretty much had to take a 80% haircut. And there was maybe hundreds of millions of dollars of these TRX/HT/BT trades that took place. So if the exchange restarts, the $100 which lost 80% of its value would only be worth $20. That is assuming TRX trades at 5 cents when it restarts, Justin has other issues going on right now which can cause the token to tank even more. Feel bad for those that took a 80% haircut instead of just waiting and getting perhaps a 20% haircut.Most likely those that swapped to TRX lowered the exchanges liabilites however and made it easier to get solvent again. If $1B was shaved off the balance sheet because of these 80% haircuts then there is less assets needed to remain solvent. So I am wondering if those trades will be reversed or are those people at a loss?",

I assumed this meant they had liquidated assets such as SOL and others, based on the news reports that they have \"recovered\" $7.3 billion in liquid assets. Maybe I read the news wrong, but generally low cap shitcoins aren't considered liquid assets, but rather illiquid based on low order books. Either way it's good news for creditors, minus the re-opening of the exchange potential, that really isn't the best idea imo.",

Considering on restarting? I dont know if they would really be still to get the same trust before the hack which we know thatonce an exchange does have that hacking incident or history then restoring up 100% trust is something impossible but lets see on what would happen aheadbecause we know that doubts and anxiety would really there which i couldnt blame it out.",

From what the news comes out, they only have plans to restart FTX, they haven't made a final decision yet, so who will run the company won't be an issue at the moment. What we should hope is that their victims can get their money back, which is what we most expect. Because I believe that even if FTX works again, no one will have the courage to use it again.",

Collapsing exchange, stolen customer funds, CEO in prison, biggest financial catastrophe in crypto and one of the biggest overall... yet FTT continued to be traded on binance and other exchanges and interestingly had strong support above $1 ($500M marketcap). $0.5B is a lot for dead exchange token with $10B in liabilities and close to 0$ in assets.\"At Binance, we periodically review each digital asset we list to ensure that it continues to meet the high level of standard we expect.

Why has it had such strong support at $1 for the last 150 days? You can say binance was greedy for commissions ... but FTT/BUSD trading pair was pretty much dead. Like 1-10 mln $ daily volume...
