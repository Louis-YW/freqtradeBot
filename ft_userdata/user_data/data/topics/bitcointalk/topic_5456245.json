What I do know for sure is that no matter the price at which I see Bitcoin at the end of the year, it doesn't define it as the final bus stop, and as such, there is a need to put more faith in hodling and bagging more until the expected bull run hits the market.Quote from: nitrobetting on June 13, 2023, 03:19:13 PMA U.S. digital currency would hinder Bitcoin’s price because the government could decide to temper enthusiasm regarding the world’s first cryptocurrency.I don't think that analogy is ever going to work, we have seen more of those in the crypto word, we know the US government have the power to manipulate the market but it's only to an extent, if they decide to create a digital currency which they can pump in money control the price to hit the top then that's their problem, people will buy and hold the assets no argument with that, people will also make profit from it if possible, but their is one thing that they can not do, which is controlling the people, they can't force everyone not to buy Bitcoin and hold because they now own their own digital currency, they can't on their own reduce the value of Bitcoin, Bitcoinners will decided the value of their holdings not the government of any country.",

As interest rates rise, almost all assets of value fall.Ok, i get it, Recession is coming due to many crises, like, the banking crisis, debt ceiling crisis, and many other factors are also in the list but how can you say that BTC hasn't acted like a deflationary asset? Because AFAIK, BTC has proved itself to be a hedge against inflation and it is the best source to store your value of money other than Chinese Yuan and Gold. Let me give you an example:A person \"Anonymous\" had 1,432.93416847 BTC in the early days of BTC which was worth around 218,941.38USD and when he made a transaction of those 1,432.93416847 BTC the worth was 37,717,692.94USDSourceNow tell me one thing, if he had converted those BTC at the rate of 218,941.38 USD, will it have the same value as it has today? Absolutely Not. And you know that. Because his/her money will lose its value. But hey it's proved that BTC is playing its role completely as it supposes to and it would save many money holders in the next recession. (i hope so) because Quote from: nitrobetting on June 13, 2023, 03:19:13 PMIt turns out that Bitcoin is a store of value. So what does that mean? It means that investors have poured into BTC as a way to create a backstop should the stock market, real estate market, and other markets fall.If a recession is coming, and it appears it is on the horizon, Bitcoin’s price could fall because investors will turn BTC into cash to pay debt.Well, halving is also coming and we all know that after the halving of BTC, a bullish/bear trend come and BTC touches to new ATH. And you are worrying about those who will sell their BTC to save them from bankruptcy as the FTX exchange did. Well, AFAIK, if that's happened before halving then it will be a good opportunity for buyers and long-term holders, and my instinct saying me there is a 40% chance of it happening because which exchanges are facing difficulties in finance and has the most BTC as reserves? Quote from: nitrobetting on June 13, 2023, 03:19:13 PM2. The Biden Administration isn’t a fanCBDC and BTC are two different paths leading to two different destinations, so how can CBDC impact BTC, CBDC has a very mere impact on BTC, i am wondering if you haven't watched the latest news about SEC. (haha) because currently, SEC is making moves against the market but hey Gensler has not declared BTC as security yet instead in a few interviews, he declared BTC and 2 other assets are not security.Quote from: nitrobetting on June 13, 2023, 03:19:13 PM3. Bitcoin utilization hasn’t increased as much as many expectedBTC is a currency and many big companies had adopted BTC as payment method and are using it too, in fact a country had made BTC a legal tender and (El-Salvador) and there are many people making there living out of it, living a there dream life. Then how can you say BTC has not increased its utilization, AFAIK it have been just 14 years.",

Investors have been cautious and may choose to watch rather than act, so sideway or downside trend is unavoidable.If the bitcoin price can break another $30k in July then I can expect another move to break the $40k resistance.
