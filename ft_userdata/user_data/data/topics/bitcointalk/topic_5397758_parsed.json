Topics and replies in this section can't be modified or deleted.There's a long known \"bug\", which I've just tested and confirmed: if I move a topic from Auctions to another board, I can edit or delete my own posts, and then move it back to Auctions. This shouldn't be possible.Proposed solution: users shouldn't be able to move topics into or out of Auctions.I broke the bounty requirements:QuoteYou must report the bug to the bugs email address listed on the contact page. You must not publish it elsewhere or share it with anyone else.This was on purpose because this bug has been mentioned before. I'm only posting it now because it's explicitly mentioned on the bounty page.",

I just didn't know it's in the Security bounty list. And since it's about deleting or editing your own posts and not someone else's posts, I assumed it isn't what the bounty was meant for.Following the bounty protocol would make it look like I'm after the bounty, for something that looks like \"semantics\" to me.",

Once it's been discussed and out there bringing it up again is fine.Actually it's better since it means that if something does 'go wrong' because of it there is no hiding the fact that it's known.Don't know what could really happen except some people doing some bad things in the auctions section in terms of bids, but that is somewhat easily resolved with your and other post scrape bots.-Dave",

Just like how you can start a thread as self mod and remove that feature, even though it should not be possible.This is definitely something that can be exploited, I'm just not sure it is in accordance with the bounty agreement.",

The only abuse I can still think of, is reporting the topic to move it to another board, after which OP can \"do evil\" and move it back",
