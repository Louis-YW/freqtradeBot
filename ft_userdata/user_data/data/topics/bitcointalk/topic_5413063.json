  "content": "Some cryptocurrency community members on Twitter attack Apompliano's handle for removing bitcoin laser eyes from his profile and changing his thoughts on bitcoin. They view him as the kind of bitboy who praises bitcoin during the bull season and back-off when it gets bearish. Though he didn't avoid the attack, he went ahead to make a write-up about his recent decision on bitcoin \"bitcoin can humble anyone Apompliano said; It allowed me to amass a large online audience, it gave me the opportunity to travel the world, and it opened up opportunities that I could have never dreamed of\" But one thing he stated for sure about the claim in the article which I understood as indirectly saying, I need a time off from the Twitter bitcoin community is, Twitter is not real life he said; there is an inverse correlation between the amount of time someone spends on that website and actually getting shit done. Someone pointed out that he made that article to retain his followers that may be sad about his action. In my opinion, some influencers like Apompliano know little about bitcoin. They promote bitcoin for the fame attached to the niche. Read through where he said; don't believe your bullshit and don't be the main character. He clearly stated that he is hungry to learn. That backed up my claim that he's not deep into bitcoin and wishes to study the technology better reason why he hated predicting bitcoin in 2019 to hit 100k in 2021. His prediction was close, anyways he was wrong. Technically he doesn't want to be the main character. Instead, he wants to be the learner. In a nutshell, Many people believe those with plenty of Twitter fellowship, and they get disappointed along the line when the said influencers disappoint. They are many critiques tagging him on Twitter because he edited his profile - to them, it means changing his mind on bitcoin. lol. They are no point in deceiving people - when the market is bullish, those influencers go bullish with their tweets, and once it's bearish, they'll stop tweeting bitcoin. However nothing is wrong with anybody's decision on bitcoin its theirs but, its normal to get ill responses on social media when something doesn't sit right with followers.",

His prediction was close, anyways he was wrong. I don't blame him for that prediction at all and he shouldn't blame himself. Nobody can predict the market that depends on so many external factors. Nobody in 2019 knew that Ukraine would get invaded and the West would block their gas pipelines in return. Nobody knew that Powell would decide to not increase rates for years and then suddenly wake up and go berserk to crash the stock market. Nobody knew that Bitcoin that always managed to go up 1000% in the bull market would only make 350% this time and achieve the worst bull market in history followed by the worst bear market in history if we count the number of red weeks and the lack of any significant rallies. I don't get why he removed the laser eyes, but it's his choice. Let him be.",

Although there are those who sincerely share their knowledge and do not try to sell fake stories and sensations, most of them not only do not know what they are talking about, but quite consciously promote crypto projects that are doomed from the start.I think that in this whole story, Bitcoin was certainly used the most as bait for the masses, and perhaps the most obvious example was that of the late John McAfee, who first attracted people with his statement that 1 BTC would be worth $1 million, and then he used his Twitter account to promote various altcoins. However, some people are more influential than others, such as Saylor, who has about 130 000 BTC and only 2.6 million followers on Twitter, while the famous Mr. Mars has over 105 million followers, and before he got into the whole story with Bitcoin, he had only about 40 million or even less.",
