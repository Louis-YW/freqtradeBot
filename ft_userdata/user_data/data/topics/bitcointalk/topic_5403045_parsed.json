I don't see any of those point fulfilled. Maybe this will change in the future, but I highly doubt it.Then those predictions. They are normally fed with the data from the past to tell you future prices. Those models are very simplified and do not take into account new innovations or unexpected events which can heavily influence the price in both directions.",

      "body": "I have never been so appreciative of short-term trending coins as to hold them for a long time. In terms of profits, I don't like to take risks with things like this, but if I like to try my luck and look for future opportunities, thinking it will turn out to be profitable over and over again, I think it's no different than lottery games. If you put in a small amount of money and never look at it, and then wait a few years until a new growth cycle can occur, this is also a way to experiment.",

I think memecoins that entered the market before the bull run and have now dropped over 90% will not have a chance to return to their ATH. Maybe only DOGE will manage to do it someday.However, when it comes to investing in memecoins, I think now is a very good time to look for projects that have just entered the market and are quietly waiting for a new bull run. I really liked https://twitter.com/PussDAO. I think when the trend changes, that may be another memecoin that will earn x100 or more.",

      "body": "I think that there shall not need to forecast the meme token caused by the future can be predicted easily if the floki inu will become another dead token in the future. There were bunch of bullshit promises and its supporters were also crazy enough to spread the fake news to create the hype. Any meme tokens must not be forecasted caused by people know that meme token was not worth as an investment. It's pure to be a gambling token for the guy who like the volatility",

I think when the trend changes, that may be another memecoin that will earn x100 or more.I will not invest in any memecoin especially given the current market, potential altcoins are also unable to hold their own during the bear market, so memecoins with no utility and only hype should not be invested. The bear market is not a conducive environment for memecoins to generate hype, you should therefore stay away from them.",

Perhaps when the bear season is over, the floki inu whales will decide to have some fun with the price who knows.In addition,  5 years is a long period in crypto and most of alts investors particularly don't have the patience to wait that long for a high reward. There is also a possibility the project no longer active due to unforseen circumstances, you never know.",
