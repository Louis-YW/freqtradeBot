Based on what am experiencing from this bear market show that Christmas this year will be boring for BTC investors because, the price of Bitcoin is still reducing and it's not giving investors hope of celebrating this Christmas in a different styles. Two months and some weeks to the end of December, and the price of BTC is still $26k and if the price continue dumping till 25th of December, I don't think, many investors will sell their BTC to celebrate the Christmas than to be bored through out the day. If this bear market continue till December 25th will you sell your BTC? Or you will continue holding till next year and remain bored on the December 25th or you will sell to join people to celebrate the Christmas as usual.",

Bitcoin is Bitcoin and i dont see the dumping as a hindrance to Christmas. Before Bitcoin came into existence people has been celebrating xmass. And moreover Bitcoin can not be predicted because it's movement is control by demand and supply. Who knows if buy oder will be higher than sell oder. If so it will be a great deal for those in the crypto space.Another thing is that Xmas is not celebrated by everyone. Some Bitcoin investors don't sell their BTC for frivolity. Most of the accumulated BTC is for long term investment of about 10 to 15 years. I can't even advise anyone to sell BTC because of fun. Except for a serious issue.",

Me I dey always talk am, before you go talk say u wan invest in bitcoin, make sure say ur store dey full, no go invest money wey u suppose use chop in bitcoin, if you do that na u go still use your hand sell the bitcoin or u no go enjoy your life. Money wey we no go use for now na Wetin we suppose dey leave for bitcoin. And as a investor u suppose get another source wey money go dey enter, you no suppose depend on the money wey u invest in bitcoin alone, we never know when bitcoin will pump and u no go talk say u till bitcoin pump before u go commot money.

Things like dis go make ur children eye self dey outside, the best thing is no invest all your money for bitcoin, and make u get another source of income.",

I don't know why you said if the price of bitcoin remains between 25k-27k range that Christmas wouldn't be fun. By now we should all know that it is after the halving that we can see a good price from bitcoin, and that is why every investors shouldn't rely on short term investment because the price of bitcoin can disappoint you.Moreover, we are to have cash reserve for our needs so that we don't end up selling our bitcoin when it is not at your will. I don't actually pay attention on the price of bitcoin because I am still hodling and accumulating till the next bull run. Na just the hardship for the country go worry the poor people. It is not even wise to sell your bitcoin during December, if the price reaches 30k because bitcoin price will reach 3x this price during the bull run. So whichever means that you can survive with is what you should do because if you can survive without selling your coins because the price is low, you can also use that same means to survive when the price reaches 30k, because there is a better profit upfront.",

      "body": "I don't know where this is coming from, or should I say you are probably misrepresenting facts here as Bitcoin did well this year, not otherwise, holders should have a good celebration for it on the 25th of December if so desired. Judging by the BTC/USD chart of my primary broker, Bitcoin opened for the year at $16606.59 and it hit $30,000 today even as it has a bullish outlook on the weekly and monthly chart that signals more hope of ending the year at a higher price.Your concern would have been valid if it were last year or even the year before. Inflation was a major factor that made Bitcoin fall in recent years, and it continued last year which made holders have a very bad year. But the narrative changed this year as inflation subsided and the price of Bitcoin maintains its green till now just as it had a good start with bullish power from the beginning of the year. And of course, there can't be a smooth bullish path for any asset, which is why Bitcoin moved lower after almost reaching $32,000, but did not hit the opening price of the year at $16606.59 anymore and doesn't have the view/hope of doing that again this year. This can only mean that the holders have been in profit since January and will have almost x2 of their investment, if not more at year-end.There are no Bitcoin holders who will complain much based on how well the coin has performed so far this year. With the whole chart outlook, it can't be extremely bearish anymore, all pointers are towards the north side which is particularly a good reason for those who want to buy towards the halving period. If not opting in now, it might be bought at a more expensive price.This is why I still suggest that those planning to squander money for the X-mas celebration this year should think twice, they might want to shift that to upper year's X-mas as this is a time to think more of investment rather than spending.",

People with multiple streams of income and are doing well won’t feel the boredom you claim will be this Christmas. We still have some who have  solely prepare their income just to lavish it on the Christmas holidays, because most of them it’s the only chance to get to meet with family and friends and so will want to make the best out of it. This is not the first year in the bear market, we have been in this bear market for about 4 years now and counting. It’s not the first Christmas to be celebrated in the bear market. People will still spend and enjoy their Christmas the way they can irrespective whether it’s the bear market.    The bear market should have teach us that we need more than Bitcoin investment to stay afloat, it has been a hell of a roller coaster for some us, some have even lost their capitals which lead to their depression. You can only experience this if you place all your cards in the market. Financial experts won’t advice you to do that, despite being a very promising investment. It’s is wise to establish yourself in multiple areas so that you will have options on where your income is coming from.",
