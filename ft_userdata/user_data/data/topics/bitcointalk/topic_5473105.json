I believe using bear run to invest is a good strategy many investors are using to win from their investment.This has always been my suggestion and advice to people especially those of us in this forum. We should not only rely on the Bitcoin earned from campaigns,  we should make effort to buy and hold especially now that the price us still very low. Even though those coming from campaigns will help, it will never be a bad thing see many Bitcoin millionaires from this board. The advise of such people will make more impact than the advice of those who have experience could not boast of a good Bitcoin stash after spending time in this forum. I am happy you have out the Bitcoin accumulation knowledge to practical use... you are not a lone on this.",

Op you do well for understanding bitcoin and invest in it. The small amount you start with will bear good fruit for you. But you have to top it whenever you have something. 12k monthly is a very good decision but one thing you have to know is that bitcoin is not stable and in these days it on the rise. If you would have known, you would have started this investment since but not yet late. I wish you all the best for the investment. Saving money from salary to invest in bitcoin in Nigeria but s not easy because things are very cost and salaries are not increase. If your salary is some how big then increase the 12k to like #20+k because of the rising way of bitcoin. In bitcoin the more money u invest in it the more profit you get.",

You should stop listening to those that said bitcoin is not going to last forever, as if they know the future of bitcoin already, i think they really want to block a way to increase your success, bitcoin have move many people from grass to grace, turn many people to a millionaire. It's still good that you will still buy more after receiving this month salary.

I have involved long hodling, I will leave that money for a long period of time and by then the price of BTC will reach $80k before I will be convince to sell and prepare for another bear run that will make me to hodl till $100k show up which is the major price Many investors are waiting for in the market.

That's fine. Never go far enough to invest $50 and only use $50 on your expenses so that you will not get choked by your expenses. If you allocate only the money you are willing to hold for a longer time, you can hold your Bitcoin until the bull market, but if you invest more than you can handle, then you might get some new financial problems that might force you to sell off your Bitcoin, and at that time, the price of Bitcoin might have dropped compared to what you bought.",

If yes then you continue but every decision you're taking consider if things doesn't work the way you expected if you can be OK with it.Nevertheless, life itself is risky and it's risky for one not to take risk in life as sometimes our risk lead us to achieving unexpected goals, so if you have a source of income, then keep buying and hodling bitcoin now till the bull run arrives",

I no know how much you dey earn monthly but ₦12k no go be much stress to dey put inside Bitcoin as your savings account.When it comes to investment like Bitcoin, e get wetin I dey always tell myself. It's better it was a scam that I invested into and lost then when it was legit but I missed the opportunity to make life changing wealth because of fear. You no go fit live with yourself knowing you miss the opportunity to change your life by just having trust in Bitcoin which would have been possible if you had a little patience and did your research. Any amount wey dey you comfortably to Invest is a good amount, no dey follow others suggestions because dem no dey your pocket. No dey use another man pocket to rate your own investment.

BTC investment is a very wise decision that you have made. I hope you also learnt the security details of BTC investment like not linking your wallet to any exchange, using decentralized wallet to store your coins instead of leaving them on binance, and keeping your seed phrase safe. This decision you have made requires great discipline and commitment so you don't sell Immediately you start seeing small gains, if you can wait until like 1 year after the halving, you will reap tremendous profits from your investment. One very thing I must assure you is this, you are on the right path and let no one change your mind about that.",

You have made a very good decision and I commend for that. This is a very good strategical approach into bitcoin investment and you will reap the reward of it in the later after the bull run happens. This approach is called the DCA method which many of the high ranked members and professional investors have suggested for one to take when accumulating bitcoin gradually. Before the bull run comes, you must have accumulated a lot more and be preparing ahead of the bull run. Try not to take from this investment and have other means to cater for your needs even if the remaining salary won’t be enough sometimes due to unforeseen circumstances you never expected. I wish you all the best in this bold decision and step you’ve taken into the bitcoin investment ahead of the bull run season.Quote from: Cryptoprincess101 on November 09, 2023, 07:43:06 AMQuote from: Zanab247 on November 06, 2023, 05:07:14 PMHope this decision I made to be investing #12k in BTC monthly is a good decision?

If yes then you continue but every decision you're taking consider if things doesn't work the way you expected if you can be OK with it.The amount to invest in bitcoin shouldn’t be about the amount of money you earn in a month, but rather the expenses you pay for within that one month period of time. We might both be earning N60K monthly and that doesn’t mean we can invest the same amount in bitcoin monthly. I might have more problems to solve, maybe let’s say I have a family and I’m married, I will have to spend more in a money than the person that is single and lives alone. So expenses varies and that will be the determinant of the money to be invested in bitcoin. It is not really the amount that we earn that matters now.",
