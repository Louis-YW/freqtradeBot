The fractional reserve system is a total scam, a literal ponzi scheme & it’s starting to unravel.Hopefully many people see the logo & decide to look further into bitcoin & what it can do for them. Fiat banking is under severe pressure, buying bitcoin is a hedge against it.",

As banks around the world keeps collapsing, people will surely take time and try to understand what it is all about.

I agree with you, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly mainstream and it seems that people are finally starting to realize the potential that this cryptocurrency has as a viable alternative to the traditional financial system. The growing inflation and banking crises are only increasing the need for an alternative and decentralized currency like Bitcoin.With banks starting to shift their views on cryptocurrencies and embrace this emerging technology, we can expect more countries to follow in the footsteps of El Salvador and promote the use of Bitcoin in their economies. We are in an exciting time for Bitcoin and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this revolutionary currency.",

They cannot equal the bank trolls that have been wreaking havoc to people's lives for a very long time. Imagine the banks trolling all of us by not giving us the money that we entrust them for custody. These bank trolls are enriching themselves with our money and when we make withdrawals we are even dictated on how much. And then they will also freeze us our very own money with interest. We are even fined for not keeping a certain amount in our deposits. And when there's no activity in our accounts, they would lock our own money. LOL! These banks are hardcore trolls!",

Fiat banking is under severe pressure, buying bitcoin is a hedge against it.I support this initiative and hope people will learn to use bitcoin as an alternative when the banking system is in crisis. But we should not propagate that the banking system is a ponzi, scam and we should use bitcoin against them. We have and will continue to use banking for hundreds of years, it is the backbone of the world economy whether we like it or not. Furthermore, our saying banks are scams is no different from the government calling bitcoin a scam.

Nevertheless, it is a good means of advertising Bitcoin and the world needs to get the message that fiat is not the only currency. Bitcoin is a superior money that outshines fiat in all ramifications. Although this action is not lawful, I still give kudos to these bitcoiners that planned and executed this publicity. We need more of these actions to spread the message of bitcoin so that people can be liberated from the influence of central banks.",
