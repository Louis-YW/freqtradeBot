It's given the exchanges that they can crowdfund through ICO and that's what the majority of the exchanges that has tokens did. Those that became popular during that time, many of those projects are likely the ones that are still remaining in the market today.The perspective of investors has changed a lot with ICOs and it's like anything you invest in the ICOs market during that time, it's most likely going to be successful no matter what the project is. And good thing that it has come to an end because the bubble was pretty much obvious.",

Since then, icos have evolved from ico (initial coin offering) to ieo (initial exchange offering) to ido (initial dex offering) and so on. None of this have affected exchange platform because after every successful ido/ieo/ico event; these tokens end up listing on exchange platforms.I think the major factor that affected market of exchanges is overcrowding; there are too many exchange platform in the space today with many redundant and without volume.",

It is mainly impacted by Bitcoin and you can see it very easily by market capital domination.https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/",

      "body": "ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering. One is an old means by which a new project sells their tokens.  Of course ICOs then played a lot of role in getting a coin into a good position in the market.  But now this medium is not used much.  Because now IDO, STO etc. mediums are more common.  But they only bring investment to a project and help them sell coins. But in addition to this, there is marketing. Marketing is the life of a project.  And to manage and develop a project or an exchanger well, a strong team is needed.  So I don't think Crypto exchanges market affected by ICOs",

Exchanges can listing any token, as long as it meets their internal rules and the developers of the token are willing to pay for the listing. Most ICOs have been insolvent scams, so they have passed by the major exchanges. So I think the answer is obvious, they didn't affect them in any way. The ICO market rather affected investors and their attitude towards cryptocurrencies, especially after 2017.",

Exchange only want to get as much coin they can listed because they can gain more customer on their platform + getting a payment from listing the coin.My answer, is no but if they listed a scam project and other think their exchange marked as shitty exchange.",

ICOs were giving very huge impact not only on the existence of exchange sites but so many projects that are running now started from ICOs. I can even mention some like ethlend and many more. ICOs have been evolving in various ways now. People were starting to explore the potential of icos to be evolved into various kinds of fundraising in the crypto. ICOs were also making market have so many coins too. ICOs were greatly impacting so many things right now. People were saying ICOs were not impacting exchange site while binance as the biggest exchange site was coming from ICOs. that's pretty funny to see that. https://coincodex.com/ico/binance-coin/",

It affected them positively although for sure, a lot of investors and traders were burned to these marketing strategies because these ICOs usually are gone after a few weeks. That's why there was an intense ban on ICOs past 2017 due to the damage they brought to the crypto economy and to a lot of investors as well. Exchanges side, positive; everything else, negative.",

At least, profitable on the peak of the popularity of such tokens. On the other hand, the impact right now is inexistent, since the hype finished and investors migrated to another niches of crypto market, like NFTs. If you are attempting to profit through ICOs, I believe you should not have many hopes on this matter. Better to focus in something else related to the currently trends of the market.",

Overall, there are still a lot of people who are manipulating these kinds of token sales ways.",

The competition between exchanges were vibrant. During the times when ICO was so strong and many even reach their hard caps easily, what everyone anticipated with so much excitement afterwards was when the coins or tokens are listed on exchanges. When the announcement comes, everybody would flock to the exchange and either buy or sell the coins or tokens. It wasn't even surprising to see a coin pump hard upon listing. When the time came when ICO slowly died, the tendency for people to follow the coins to their exchange are also slowly dying. Exchanges must have lost a lot of revenue ever since.",

They can list a lot of ICO coins but it doesn't make them successful because we know that most of those ICO coins are only just a scam. ICO coins doesn't also contribute on the standard cryptos (ex. BTC and ETH). Their value is the only thing that pumps if ever they got lucky and many people have invested on them but when the time they dump the standard cryptos are also affected because the investors think that all cryptos are the same that all for them are not to be trusted. Not only ICOs but even the new type of crowdfunding can still affect the crypto exchanges if they will support shady and scam projects.",
