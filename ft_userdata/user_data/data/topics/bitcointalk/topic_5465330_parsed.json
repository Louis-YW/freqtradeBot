  "content": "Ol Bitboy went down in flames a few days ago. It's really not that shocking given the way he carry's himself.I really don't care either way but I do wander through the Youtube/Reddit blow hards. So I hedge against what the collectively say because they are mostly wrong most of the time. There are some REALLY big names that seem to foster a pump and dump cabal. I chuckle when predictions are cast, it mostly hope not real data.Be careful who you listen too",

There is so many cases right now where they are being sued for advertising scam projects and rub pulls.Â  In your example Bitboy he made a apology video. And he says he is very sorry but I do not know to believe him or not. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QLRCirF8YY",

If anyone is that good at predictions they would be in Manhattan, not making pictures of falling wedges and head and shoulders pattern in moms basement.",
