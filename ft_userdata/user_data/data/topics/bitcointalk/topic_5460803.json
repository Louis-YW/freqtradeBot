I have this question, will the Vultor Card be available after the ICO? and what's the difference between these 2 factors? I didn't quite understand them. Like what's the difference between transaction limit and transaction limitation? Your project seems legit and I am already getting interested in it. But I will only observe your platform for now. And keep growing. And wait one more question? I as a shopkeeper, do I have to integrate your APIs or anything or install your setup (maybe an app) to accept payments from others using your NFC card? i think the answer is yes but let's hear it from you.",

      "body": "I did not find a mention of bitcoin or how the card works with you? Is it more like a central service where you send bitcoins to the service address like Binance PAY and then you can pay using it like a payment card or is it dedicated to the VULTOR currency.NFC is a non-contact technology and it is dangerous unless it is encrypted, and I did not mention any encryption mechanism or any details.I'm sorry to say that, but your site does not provide any benefit, and you are almost selling a currency that is completely different from Bitcoin.",

Well that will be outstanding then. But i hope the rates will not be lesser than other market rates. And one more thing, what's the availability criteria for getting NFC card and can we get it in countries where crypto is banned or not legal? If yes then how can we get it.",

It's a straightforward and convenient process that allows you to seamlessly connect with our platform and enjoy the benefits of our innovative system.So, as I said in the past, it is similar to binance PAY, and even binance did not think of establishing its own system, but rather its cards are accepted wherever Visa and MasterCard cards are accepted, while it can be loaded in bitcoins or some altcoins.Your service can only be loaded with one cryptocurrency, and your card must be purchased to complete the payments, so why would the store owner accept it as a method for settling payments, and the number of users will be very limited.THIS IS NOT ABOUT BITCOIN.",
