  "content": "There have been lots of reactions about the role of economists to the recent world financial crisis; inflation, food hike, increase of poverty rate etc. I thought about it, when I was reading this story of John Reed as Citicorp CEO from the book \"Origin of Wealth\", that economists do not efficiently represent the world in times of economic crisis. You can read the story to better understand the thread;Quote\"In 1970, Citicorp, along with other major American bank had lent aggressively to the government of developing countries, in particular to those in latin America. Reed’s predecessor, Walter Wriston, had proclaimed that such lending was “safe banking” be soverign government did not default on their debts. Wriston was proved badly wrong. When in August 1982 the Mexican government was unable to roll over its massive debt This set of a chain of event that resulted global financial crisis. The next several years saw widespread defaults, currency devaluation, and economic collapse in several countries. When the dust settled, millions of poor people found themselves poorer and banks found that $300 billion had evaporated from their balance sheet. Citicorp alone lost $1billion in a year and was sitting on 13billion in bad debts\". Few questions from ReedReed wanted to know how it happened? how the crisis had happened? and how it could be prevailed from happening again?  He consulted several experts, involving leading economists from Academic, Wall Street and government. Reed himself was well versed in economics from his student days at MIT. Yet the economists had little new or useful to say about the crisis. In fact reed believed that their recommendation during the crisis had been dead wrong.Reed wanted a new way of doing things in economics, the old methods doesn't contribute to positive changes.think of it, a high number of the ideas of the industry or fields are more than 100 years old. Then the economics formal theory and mathematical theory are now handicapped by impractical assumptions or directly contradicted by real world data. What do you think about economists, who study the theories of economics and brag about being vast in the study of economics, yet doesn't help or contribute sufficiently to control or stop world economic meltdown?",

You wouldn’t fault just the economist for failing to contribute sufficiently to curb economic problems in a country and the world at large. In a country, Representatives in government are the ones who votes on new policies being put forward and they tend to vote more on policies that would put more money in their pockets and that of their already wealthy donors thus constantly increasing the gap between the rich and the poor.",

Therefore, economics provides impact work, monitors indicators and develops them to know whether the impact is successful or needs to be modified, and so on. There is no rigid idea in the economy and all the economies of the world now are not capitalist. Completely or completely communist, and some are a mixture of the two to suit the economic situation of a country, and what may suit this country may not suit the rest of the countries.The United States is trying to put its people and the US dollar first, so it is taking all measures to make this possible, which may lead to harm to some other countries and peoples, but this does not mean the failure of politics because those countries are not concerned with it.",

Like the story, you'll notice how Wriston trusted the people he lent money and didn't worry about the possibility of loan defaults. Time and problems are different, similarly, solutions should be unique according to the current problem. Optimizing the old theories to fit their personal greed, is a waste of resources, which effect affects the society. The less privilege will suffer more and companies will see losses because the allocated loans are not utilized proficiently to yield returns to the bank. The intriguing aspect of it, is that these economists occupy the top of financial institutions. And all these happen at their watch, yet they can't solve the problem they create. Contrarily, similar things happen in cryptocurrency projects, exchanges and some defi projects lend huge amount to different start ups whose management isn't capable or eligible to meet up the standard of replenishing the borrowed funds. Thereby causing a crash on the lending project, and affecting other customers and businesses linked to the Lending project.",

They just advise and give their own professional opinion, it's left to the people with real power to effect change. I remember a certain time in my country when economic and financial bodies were stressing that we were heading into a recession at this rate, no nobody listened. The people in government just kept on with their daily lives as if nothing would happen. IMF even made warnings. They told the central bank many times to take caution but nobody listened till we went into recession.So how do these economists stop economic meltdown when people don't listen to them or take them seriously?Some climatologists have been singing about climate change for a long time but nobody takes them seriously. Would you blame them for the natural disasters and hazards we face because they refused to listen?Another thing is Economics is not a pure science. The theories don't give the same result everywhere at all times. Chorine turns litmus paper white anywhere, but an economic theory needs certain factors to give certain results. An economic or financial theory or system that worked in an Urban area might not work in a rural area.",

If after their warnings, the economic meltdown occurs, and the Government runs to them for solution, they don't come up with great solutions. Such things can as well demoralize the Government from adhering to their further warnings and advise. If they worked effectively to repair the underlying problems, which the Government or banks may need their assistance, a lot complaints about the less important theories.

Imagine people doing farming work in the past and earning while contributing to the economy. Now you can earn just by sitting in your room. The way of earning has changed so has the economy. Analyzing the data from the present will never be similar to the data from the past. So we will need new ways to deal with new problems. Some old methods still might work, but that won't be perfect. You are limited to experiencing things that happen around you. You can also gain knowledge by researching other places, but still, you can not know everything. People may be able to solve many economic crises on a small scale but to do it worldwide, that's a tricky job. Because not everyone thinks the same way. Different people have different goals and motives. So even if economists are able to bring out a solution, not everyone will be able to follow that or not follow it intentionally. So it all comes to every individual. We have to think about ourselves. We need to help ourselves to secure our personal economy. That way it will help the country and others which will help the world economy.",

But that doesn't mean it doesn't provide positive value. It depends on the economic system adopted according to the goals you want to build. Economists put forward theories based on observed facts so that solution after solution is born. If we don't know the history of the economic role of each country, the place we live in might not be freedom until now. The crisis is not meant to be stopped immediately, but rather to minimize the possibility. Look at the crisis period that has been experienced, we have evolved to be able to repair a broken system. In the case of practitioners, the solution will not completely disappear. The crisis arises over time, so it must be resolved gradually.",

I think it is like they are showing us everything is very normal, we have enough credits, loans are running perfectly, and prices for day-to-day life things are in line but it's nothing like that. The thing is, it doesn't matter if they are studying the economy properly or not, there is a whole bunch of corrupt government authorities that will run everything for their own benefit and nothing else. Even if there is a way to overcome things easily they would not start implying those solutions immediately because that would be dangerous for their profits. They will let the chaos happen, use the stones to throw when elections are at the doorstep, and then start recovering things. I never understand why it is the highly developed countries with the best minds that are getting the worst hit if they can overcome everything in a year or so. Isn't it tricky?",

Moreover, laying out ideas, knowledge, plans, and theories is different from implementing them, believe me when I say that implementation is the hardest part of any project or action, I'm sure a lot of people will agree on that.

The economy of a country or state is a direct correlation of the decisions the CBN of the state makes. A good economist like Dr Okonjo Iweala, who is the director general of world trade organization and one time minister of finance in Nigeria may  have done well to provide a good financial service to the nation in terms of her knowledge, application and models she set in place before exiting office and landing a big financial role of director general.

But again, this depends on the problem, sometimes to solve a problem you need a theory to solve it and this needs to be formulated and considered carefully.You need to know that when someone is involved in the world of economics and has a lot of experience, they work tactically, but in their brain they already have a formulated road map to take and that is the theory they got from their experience.What OP said about the discussion on how to stop the world economic crisis, I think it is very heavy and quite broad in scope, because talking about economics, there are many connections, such as currency, politics, policy, trade, cooperation, and many more that can influence economic crisis, so naturally they (the experts OP mentioned) don't say much.",
