It is difficult for them to understand the value that BTC will bring without tomorrow, but I have also experienced periods of asset loss when buying BTC and just expecting it to bring it. Give me a larger amount of money to spend on other things in life because each of us is different, the experience will be different. Just be positive and look towards a better future with the effort to do better at the job that you have as well as to build a more practical idea in life. Then everything is fine, and one day we don't want to sell anything except the BTC we purchased.",

We also have to accept that part is currently lost, and various speculations about whether it is 10% or 20% do not play too much of a role, given that there is more than enough BTC on the market for anyone who wants to buy.As for the current situation, we need to be aware that not everyone can afford not to sell, people are panicking because the bottom is not in sight and media campaigns are relentless in trying to portray Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme that is finally falling apart. This is a time for cold heads and strong hands, because everything is losing value.",

      "body": "1 BTC = 1 BTCIt's a simple tautology, and of course it's correct. But that doesn't give us any useful information. And if we want to use it as an argument, then by this tautology we actually mean that the price doesn't matter. Now that, however, isn't true. The purpose of money is to be a medium of exchange. And yes, you can exchange (sometimes) Bitcoin for goods or services. But let's say you have 10 BTC. Would it matter to you if you can get a nice flat for 1 BTC or just a good bike for 1 BTC? Or only one pizza for 1 BTC? I believe that it would. Because the purchasing power of money matters. So when 1 BTC is $60k, it means we can buy $60k worth of stuff with it. If it's $20k, we can buy three times less than that. Completely disregarding this fact seems unjustified to me.So while I agree about the long-term perspective and about hodling, I have problems with the 1 BTC = 1 BTC phrase.",

Though this happened last year, you can definitely see its potential of reaching that price when the market stabilizes in the near future. Given also that the nature of BTC is deflationary in nature, its supply (like OP mentioned) is capped at ~21 million. This means that its price would always increase as more BTCs start to circulate the market.Again, for long-term investors, HODL will be the key. People may judge your decisions but you will be the one reaping the benefits as soon as the price slowly starts recovering in the future.",
