In the context of a bitcoin/crypto wallet though, the right move(morally/ethically speaking) is to not do anything.",

For example, in Brazil, Bitcoin is legal and regulated by the government, while in Bolivia, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are banned.Here in the Philippines, Bitcoin exchange services are now registered with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.Just because you have access to a Bitcoin wallet doesn’t necessarily mean you have the legal right to the funds within it. If you were to find a wallet and use the funds within it, this could potentially be seen as theft.",

Is this more of a morality should you or should you not.At the moment, in almost all countries (including those you listed), bitcoin is not officially recognized and the issue of legality of access to someone else’s btc wallet remains outside the legal field. In fact, there are no rules (legislative field). Even if we assume the possibility that you will be very lucky to accidentally gain access to someone else’s BTC-wallet, then this should not constitute a crime, since there were no intentional actions in your actions (abuse for the purpose of illegal enrichment). Now, if you transfer bitcoin from someone else’s wallet to your own, then this will already be theft. Not within the field of current laws, but within the field of human morality. So far, everything is quite vague in the legislative field of everything related to cryptocurrencies and bitcoin.So it turns out that when accessing someone else’s btc wallet, if you follow generally accepted human morality, then you should not touch other people’s bitcoin. And if you look at this from the perspective of the “morality” of the villains, then quickly take these bitcoin for yourself. The question is, what morals do you adhere to?",

If I miraculously got a private key to a wallet that had Bitcoin in it but was not mine originally then does that mean I now own the wallet?Technically, the answer is \"Yes\" since It's because you have access to the private key of the Bitcoin wallet. But morally it's \"No\" since you aren't the true owner of that coin. But however, if you could have access to the private key of a wallet, I think the area where you could have deficulty is identifying which wallet do the private key belongs to (i.e Blue wallet, Trust wallet, Electrum e.t.c), because having access to a private key to a wallet, do not automatically grant you access to the coins in that wallet, you still need to figure out which Bitcoin wallet does this belongs to, and there are several of them today online today.Example: Because if only Craig White (i.e The Fake Satoshi) had have access to the private key of real Satoshi 's wallet with over 1million Bitcoin, I'm sure by today the world would have believed he is the real Satoshi, but since he couldn't, he remains fake.",

There are a lot of things that are illegal, but probably ethical and moral. There are also things that are legal, but unethical or immoral. Regardless of wether courts in various jurisdictions decide that \"finding\" bitcoins is illegal, the moral and ethical implications will remain.",

In the first place, the Bitcoin in that wallet, a wallet that you do not own, if I may emphasize, will not move without an act of stealing. That wallet isn't lost. That wallet is under the control of somebody. And there's no reason why the ownership of that wallet is transferred just because you have access to it.I don't suddenly own whatever is inside a house whose keys I found lying on the sidewalk.

The former is acceptable, so far it's a gift, but the two latter that I mentioned is criminality, that's how I see it, unless you can enlighten us with the details of how you miraculously got it. But frankly I don't know the extent of criminality it'll be if my second option being when the owner misplaced it, and another person finds it, without knowing who own it? Unless the Bitcoin is in a centralized exchange, where KYC can determine the original owner, if there's no other means of determining who the owner is, the I guess the finder can keep it, but I don't know about selling it.",

Is this more of a morality should you or should you not.Where did you find the private key? If you find it in a place where you can easily trace the owner, it will be wrong to claim the coin. The ideal thing to do is to look for the owner and transfer the keys. It becomes more complicated if you don't know who owns the bitcoin and it is impossible to trace the owner. Let's say there was a natural disaster like a flood and you see a metal that has these keys in your garden. And there is no announcement of any missing keys from anybody. At this point, your reaction will be based on morality. You might decide to keep it or donate it to charity. You will have to explain to the government how you got such an amount. They might suspect that you got it through illegal means.",
