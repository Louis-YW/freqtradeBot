  "content": "https://ibb.co/RTDX1qXThe GDIT token is one of the gold mining industry's premier tokenization projects. The token was created in June 2022 on the infrastructure of IWI Global, which operates 15+ mines in Africa, Asia and South America. Thanks to tokenization technology, the GDIT team was able to digitize and migrate their operations to a blockchain infrastructure for maximum transparency, security and convenience. Token holders get the opportunity to invest in gold mining with a minimum entry threshold and purchase real gold at the price of the mining company, but investors do not have to think about refining, polishing, logistics and storage as in the case of physical metal. The relevance of gold mining industry tokenization is due to the stability of gold - for centuries it has been a \"safe haven\" for investors wishing to wait out economic crises. Over the last 50 years the value of gold has only been increasing, confirming the thesis of the reliability of this direction. At the moment, GDIT is on Stage 8 of the presale and is trading at 14 euros per coin, which allows investors to buy tokens at a significantly lower price than at the open auction. According to the project's roadmap, once the token enters opensale later this year, it will trade at €60 per token, with one GDIT coin being exchangeable for 1 gram of physical gold. Thus, by participating in the presale, investors can get more than two X's as early as 2023.

      "body": "There were several projects like this before and I always remember the question from someone on the thread about where the storage of the gold be. Claiming the token to be backed by physical gold means it will be stored somewhere which will require tough security. But who will secure those gold? It's really something to be worried about before you invest in this kind of project. I doubt that a team can just protect a vault nor they themselves not stealing the gold.",

Quite an interesting business environment you have, a global company based in UEA whose main language and means of communication in Cyrillic.
