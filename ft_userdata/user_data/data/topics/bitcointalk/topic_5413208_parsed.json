Please only interested reader should reply most especially those from Nigeria who knows about their traditional can contribute I don't need a random post.QuoteHISTORY: The Story Of Attah Ameh Oboni - the Nigerian King who Chose Suicide Instead of Bowing to the Queen of England.Attah Ameh Oboni was a revered Igala King.At a particular meeting held in Kaduna which consisted of all paramount traditional rulers in Nigeria and which had the queen of England in attendance, Attah Ameh was asked to remove his cap to greet the Queen of England as others had done.Though he refused until they said he should leave the meeting if he would not remove his cap. But Attah was not like others, or was he?It was a taboo for Attah to remove his cap in the public. The entire hall where they were staying was occupied by swan of bees which emanates from the cap of Attah Ameh Oboni which he removed in order to greet the Queen.The Queen of England as well as other rulers in the meeting ran helter-skelter except the friendly Oba of Benin who was asked by Attah Ameh to go out before he removed his cap. The hall became empty as some were stung by the bees and the meeting ended.According to history, Attah Ameh Oboni was asked to be arrested and handcuffed by the security people, which they did, but the handcuffs fell off his hands.He was later locked up in a room on the instruction of the Northern rulers and guarded by the security personnel but only to find out later by the personnel that he had left the room. Yes, when the security were taking him to be locked up, he told his driver, Amanabo of blessed memory, to take the car and be going to Idah while the security locked him in the room.He then warned Amanabo not to look back until he felt a cool breeze in the car. Though Amanabo argued a little that he cannot leave the Attah there but later obeyed and started driving back to Idah from Kaduna.After some time, he felt the cool breeze in the car, and Attah Ameh was sitted inside the car.The incident in the meeting made many traditional rulers which were mostly northerners to be angry especially making kings run in such a manner because of bees.This became one important sin, and it was like “one sin too many”.The queen of Englnad was also not happy and they (the Queen and northern leaders) started looking for a way to remove Attah Ameh from the throne since he was getting tougher and uncontrollable like others, as well as searching for an obedient replacement.Igala has various cultural festivals, one of which is Ocho. Ocho is celebrated before farming starts, and it is the time that Attah Igala prays to God for sufficient rainfall, bountiful harvest, success in hunting. It is celebrated in the bush and the venue is called Ere-ocho, where the Attah will hunt until he kills a Buffalo or a strong animal. The community in Idah where Ocho takes place is called Ogo-Efa. He performs a little sacrifice to the ancestors using a fowl in the process, and this was to find out if there will blessings or problems in the land after the Ocho.Before this time, the enemies at home (among the Igala people), especially those having connections with the leaders of the northern region, were working hard to get any evidence either true or false which can be used to remove him from the throne. The blood of the animal used as sacrifice at Ocho ground now became what the enemies would use against him.Petition was written by these two Igala people to the Queen and some other Northern leaders that Attah Ameh was sacrificing humans during the Ocho festivals. Since they were looking for any means to displace him with, judgment was quickly passed that he must be dethroned, even when investigations were not yet concluded. In addition, all the Igala cultural festivals including the Ocho were immediately banned and this remained for almost 63 years until Governor Yahaya Bello unbanned them based on the appeal of the present Attah Igala.Already, before this time, the Oba of Benin who had such friction with the British had already been dethroned and banished from Benin. So, Attah Ameh Oboni knew that at that point, no matter what spiritual approach applied, it can only postpone the evil day as his enemies will never relent until he was removed by them.The result of the blood sample which was taken from the Ocho venue and taken to University of Ibadan for analysis had arrived and it was proved that it was the blood of an animal and not human. Sadly, the revered King, Attah Ameh had passed on before the result was brought.But Attah Ameh, being very sure that he was wrongly accused and framed up by his enemies, especially those from Igala who wrote the petition against him marking the beginning of his planned dethronement, made some pronouncements before his death.He was allegedly quoted to have said that ” the person who wrote the petition against him would have that hand dried up, and that the leader of the gang or petitioners would be buried three times”. And they all came to pass.While the hand dried as said, the other was buried as stated, first was the leg, second was his hand and the third was himself, all buried at various times at different locations.In addition, as this information of his dethronement was given to him in a meeting from where he was supposed to go back to Idah and prepare to leave the throne, he stopped on the way in another Igala land called Dekina.That was where he committed suicide.Before taking his life, he was allegedly quoted to have said that the town, Dekina will be popular but its development will not be as much as its popularity.He was also quoted to have said that because Igala was the genesis of his ordeal, there will be disunity among the Igala people until the reign of his own blood (son) as Attah, and all Igalas irrespective of their locations will be reunited again.I think from the reconnection and reunification of Igala people across Nigeria and beyond which has been going on and still going on under the reign of his son, Agabaidu Idakwo Ameh Oboni II, the present Attah Igala, that pronouncement of reunification of Igala people is also coming through.Source link and here as well.",

Their other way  the nigeria king would have shown her honour but not buying down.",

      "body": "Have you ever noticed how many countries that were rule by Britain, have gained their independence over the years? I say 'GAINED', because Britain has become a do-nothing country, that has harmed and killed hundreds of millions of people across the world. And those people who survived have worked at becoming independent. The goal was world conquest by the people who have made all the seemingly free countries into their puppets... including the USA. However, their victories over these people are rather hollow, because right behind their successes follows defeats in ways they weren't prepared for. Yet, millions die because of their actions.Take a look at the article below, to see how the Queen never let it be known what her empire was really doing around the world. Her beauty and the media made her popular and famous. But there are many who without a doubt saw through her appearance of goodness.I don't know how to think of these things for one major reason. She may have been a hostage in her royal position, having to say nothing so that she wasn't assassinated in some way.Cruelties of the Queen's ReignQuote from: https://consortiumnews.com/2022/09/09/cruelties-of-the-queens-reign/As millions of Britons and admirers the world over mourned Queen Elizabeth II's death Thursday, others — especially in nations formerly colonized by the British Empire — voiced reminders of the \"horrendous cruelties\" perpetrated against them during the monarch's reign.\"We do not mourn the death of Elizabeth, because to us her death is a reminder of a very tragic period in this country and Africa's history,\" declared Julius Malema, head of the left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters party in South Africa.\"Elizabeth ascended to the throne in 1952, reigning for 70 years as a head of an institution built up, sustained, and living off a brutal legacy of dehumanization of millions of people across the world,\" he continued.\"During her 70-year reign as queen, she never once acknowledged the atrocities that her family inflicted on native people that Britain invaded across the world,\" Malema noted. \"She willingly benefited from the wealth that was attained from the exploitation and murder of millions of people across the world.\"...",

He had shown an epitome of leadership and his history is still in existence till now because or his confidence not to take anything immoral from any leader. The queen is gone now ams I hope we shall all meet at the bossom of the lord to explain all our deed to our savior. Life is just an opportunity to see through this planet qnd what next is what we should considered.",

No historians will take this story serious. This is another way to speak rubbish against our respected Royal highness. In every culture and custom no one is superior to another,  on that note if this story is real. The king should be blame for disrespecting king Attah,  at that time who was the Northern leader that spearheaded his persecution? No name was mentioned,  the kings apparently were mediocre if this story is real. Because at Their level of leadership, they went unprepared. Royal protocol dictates in all cultures, even In England that before such a meeting inquire about the custom of each kings would have been done first. Another question is how the Northern leaders subserviently complied",
