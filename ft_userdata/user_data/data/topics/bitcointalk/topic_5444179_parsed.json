Money is truly powerfulIt truly is powerful and that's why even decent people make them indecent just to fulfill their desires and mostly, the major reason is to fulfill their needs. They've got no option as they say and that's the quickest way to satisfy and fill in their needs that need to be done. The world is rotating with money these days, with every step that we do, there goes money ready to be spent the entire world's economy is requiring money and that's why every single each of us needs to do our part in providing not just for ourselves but also in our family. But, don't let money take over you. Money becomes good if it's used for good purposes and becomes bad when the opposite is being done for a purpose.",

Because he has the superpower to control everything from money whether a person or a thing. We can’t even think a man who has no money in his pocket can easily rule the world. That’s the reason the world is only ruling by those who have money to do all the things that they want which is although a darker side of our lives.",

Money is a tool that allows us to trade things we have for things we need or want. But, there's a bit more to it than just that. The people who have more money have more power and influence in the world. For example, they can use their money to influence politicians or laws to benefit their interests. This can create inequality and unfairness in society. The people who have less money may not have access to the same opportunities and resources as those who are wealthy. So, in a way, money rules the world because it's a tool that people use to get what they want and need.",

      "body": "Today, money rules the world. Money is the force behind almost all corporate (and some state) activity and appears to be the primary reason for our economic decline.Money is ruling the world, because society has evolved around money and people have a very strong relationship with it. Money brings more opportunities to people who possess it and have an easier time doing things that they like doing. Money is also a medium of exchange and can be given as gifts in business meetings, even if it was not planned.Money is the reason why we are ruled by the world today. Money is not a creation of God, but it is what has become our main source of income and life. It is no longer something that we need to earn or live off of; people use it to fill their pockets with items they cannot afford and then try to hold people in line by telling them that they need to work hard for that money in order to get ahead. The sooner this is remedied, the better off the human race will be!Since the dawn of history, humans have relied on money to trade, purchase and sell their wares. Today, nations around the globe produce and conduct business in currencies that have evolved over time - from cowrie shells and seashells to silver bars, bullion coins and paper notes. The global economy relies heavily on printed money to facilitate commerce between individuals or businesses.",

Although I don't believe that love can only be felt with money or that happiness can only be achieved with money, money can indeed get you the love of your life and it can indeed make you happy.There are ways to somehow minimize your dependence on money, though.

Money is truly powerfulHumans cannot survive without basic needs like water, food, shelter, and clothing, and all these are bought with money. This means if you don't have money, you are going to fall sick and die. That's why money is very important. Apart from these basic needs, there are other secondary once that is also very important. If there are other means of satisfying these needs apart from buying them with money, money would have lost some of its influence. The government has been insensitive to the sufferings of the masses because it doesn't affect them, their families, and their friends. Nigerians are faced with inflation, increase in petroleum price, lack of fiat, and insecurity. People now have to buy the Naira as if they are buying another foreign currency. Economic activities have been negatively affected because most businesses and some customers don't have access to fiat. The most annoying part of the situation is that the bank's online and mobile channels are not functioning properly. Sometimes it could take more than three days for a transfer to be confirmed. Some people are currently living close to hell during this period.",

I agree with your opinion that money doesn't necessarily rule the world to an extent and I said to an extent because there are still few million inhabitants of the earth who still prioritize their conscience, integrity, beliefs and values more than than the figures of money and those sets of people can be excused from the notion that money is ruling the world and I would say they only make 5% of world population.That being said, it doesn't change the fact that money is ruling the world because the remaining 95% of world population can be influenced with money. The phrase that \"money can not buy everything\" I think was phrased by a rich man who wanted to give poor people genuine reasons to remain poor. Money can buy almost everything in the world and the very few things money can not buy, money will facilitate the means to get them thereby making money the sole facilitator of everything in the world.  That is why it is safe to say that money is ruling the world.",
