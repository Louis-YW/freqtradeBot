      "body": "There was a big news has come to the render. Matic was also being pumped caused by whole of markets are still pumping when bitcoin was getting a little bit recovery. The problem is if this gain was not for long term as the bitcoin is going bearish again and these tokens are also following bitcoin as well. I can assume that the pump was just temporary. We will be seeing another bearish to come again very soon. Market is not so stable at this moment and any recovery can be bulltrap",
