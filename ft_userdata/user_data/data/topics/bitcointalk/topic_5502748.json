  "content": "BTC price havs tumbled recently, sinking to around 53K USD. This has spooked many investors, with the market sentiment index plummeting to a level of 25, indicating extreme fear [1]. Several potential causes have been circulating. One is the news that Mt. Gox is resuming payouts of BTC and BCH to its former users [2]. However, the exact impact of this event on the market remains unclear and difficult to measure. Another contributing factor could be the recent sale of tens of thousands of BTC by the German government [3].I initially placed blame on the German government for selling BTC, leading to a downturn in the crypto market. This move seemed particularly unwise considering the recent bullish trend and the fact that BTC hadn't reached a peak selling price. However, new information suggests it was actually the German state of Saxony that liquidated the confiscated BTC. Following regulations, they were required to sell the 50K BTC seized from criminals in January.\"The general prosecutor's office of Saxony is responsible for liquidating confiscated assets, and the sell-off is hardly surprising,\" said Dr. Lennart Ante, co-founder and CEO of German-based Blockchain Research Lab. \"Seized assets are always liquidated within a certain period. This is a routine business process, although at a larger-than-normal scale.\" [4]Discovering this information calmed my nerves. I viewed the market's re-accumulation as a necessary step for a potential uptrend. Optimistically, the 50K BTC sell-off could even be seen as a temporary distraction from the Mt. Gox repayment of 140K BTC. Additionally, the German government's offloading of its BTC to Wall Street via OTC removes a potential future source of selling pressure. Wall Street's increased BTC holdings could even lead to increased support for the long-term health of the crypto market.I would like to know your opinion on this issue:Are you worried about the German government selling off 50K BTC?What positive perspective do you have about this event?Are you holding BTC despite the negative news that has been going on in the market for the past several months?References:[1] Crypto Fear & Greed Index[2] Mt.

      "body": "No, why would anyone worried though? It's good that they are dumping their Bitcoin already so that majority of us here can scoop some from their initial 50k holding. And now that they have been dumping, they are just left with just less than 10 Bitcoin so it means that they have dump so much but the price seems to be holding strong about $50k'ish.https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/germanyAgain, you can monitor that website and see if they continue to sell, if they did, in matter of days those 9 BTC will be gone and then we can all assume that it didn't put any dent in the market except those FUD's and then we can move on next month or even at the end of this month as if nothing has happened.Edit: it looks like they sold another 3 BTC, but we are just absorbing it like a sponge,",

      "body": "Sometimes the price can decrease from a mere anticipation of positive or negative change, but it looks like this time, it was both news and action. $50k is almost $3 billion, and billions of dollars do have some impact on the price as well as on the confidence of Bitcoin investors. What was unfortunate was the overlap between these $3 billion worth of coins with Mt. Gox $9 billion with of coins. That adds up to a very significant amount, and even though it's not unloaded all at once, it can have impact.But all things considered, Bitcoin is doing pretty well and seems to be already recovering from these events. The price is up nearly 5% over the last 7 days. So there's no need to be worried.",

I know those BTC they are selling are those that they have confiscated, but still though, if you can make profit out of it then why not?One positive thing that we learn is that Bitcoin is resilient, Mt. Gox and this news doesn't do much in the market. Those who have sold are either newbies or weak hands, or those who will make a buy back later, so still a win-win for us.Yes, and I think smart investors are still holding despite this negative news and could be accumulating and taking advantage as the price is at a discount.",

Many holders have long-term plans, so this kind of FUD wouldn't stop them from holding. There are still favorable economic indicators that the price will appreciate in the future.

According the fourth article OP referenced there are laws which stipulates the time frame for the sale of such an asset. Also a court can give an other for the sale of an asset based on certain conditions such as assumptions that it might lose value in the future.",

Just being worried won't change anything. But the truth is, there is currently an atmosphere of fear in the market, which I think has affected so many investors and traders. Traders especially might want to hibernate selling for the now, as they might want to focus on buying instead. Long term investors as well, clearly sees this as an opportunity to accumulate more.And again, we all know how the market works. It is never a win-win situation. We sometimes experience decline, and other times increase. I won't be surprise when I hear the German Government buying back some Bitcoin at $65K and above.",

We have the time of Chinese crypto crackdown and many other bad days that bitcoin will fall in price but later increase again in price. If the price of bitcoin falls, it is an opportunity for people that have not bought bitcoin to buy at buy price or for people that have bitcoin to buy more at lower prices again.",

Even if Bitcoin price dumps with that 50K Bitcoin sell, what will you lose? Nothing, you'll have the possibility to buy Bitcoin at a lower price. When you are in this game, you should have long-term aims, not short-term unless you are a whale. In the long term, Bitcoin is going to rise and surpass its all-time high, so you lose nothing. I welcome every opportunity that gives me the possibility to buy Bitcoin at a low price. This will be temporary, we have to acknowledge that.",

That amount is just a small chunk to the total supply of bitcoin and it cannot hurt the price of bitcoin not unless if there are to many people will ride on the dumping actions made by those officials. Then that situation will create a massive scare to those other investor doesn't have enough knowledge or thinking about that they are losing their money because of that situation.But if in normal condition people should not get scared about it. They should look at the current volume and for sure bitcoin could cater all those sell orders made by those officials. We can encounter the same like actions since lots of institutions hold a lot of bitcoin so people need to relax so that they cannot manipulate the mind of people and scare them about any possible dumps fud that might happen in future.",

I think they're just manipulating the market with this news as if then wanted to sell they should have just gone ahead and sold without making a big deal about the whole selling process.
