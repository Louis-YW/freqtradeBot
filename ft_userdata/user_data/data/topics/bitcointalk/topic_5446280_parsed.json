Prohibiting members from creating more than one topic in one section in one month may limit the potential for valuable contributions. Some authors may have multiple ideas or perspectives to share on a particular topic or section, and this restriction would prevent them from doing so.Perhaps there could be additional rules to discourage spamming or repetitive content, but at the end of the day, members should be allowed to create multiple topics as long as they are relevant and contribute to the discussion.",

Some sections could be excluded from those rules if such a system takes into consideration. For example, Beginner & Help, Bitcoin Technical Support, and other boards where people used to post only when they needed help. Still, I don't think such Idea will help.

Imagine having to wait for 10 new merits before creating a new topic on a thread that will be beneficial to everyone. There should be no restriction to how many post a user can create on a certain section as long as they are relevant and in sync with the aim of that section. Moderators are saddled with the responsibility of moving topics that are not meant to be in a particular board to where it rightly belongs which has been the best way of filtering sections and will still be the best solution.",

Having one person dominating a certain board only show how inactive or few people have interest on making a topic in there. I don’t see any harm with this issue.",

You can verify this by looking at the very subject of the new topic. These are mostly recurring questions that are created regularly. A beginner, if desired and lacking laziness, could easily find answers to his questions. But it was the beginners who had the opinion that the more often they are in sight, the more likely they are to merit a few merits. Talking about allowing new threads after 10 merits would be a good idea, but here, we're equating a good and genuine newbie with a spammer.You can watch how the most active spammers, who create dozens of topics, sooner or later disappear, having made this or that mistake. Therefore, if someone is bothered by topics from one person, it is very easy to get rid of them by clicking the ignore button.",

You are trying to change the concept of a forum. Of course, an unnecessary topic should be reported to the moderators for them to decide. I think if you want more engaging topics to be part of the forum then you would need help from signature campaign BM. I have seen a lot of signature campaign members who got merits airdropped only replying on a thread and not creating any topics. As there is nothing written on the Signature campaign ANN about it. I think the BMs should make it compulsory like a minimum of 5 topics required in a month for getting selected and the same for staying in the campaign.",
