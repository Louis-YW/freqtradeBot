  "content": "Most oft the time we make many mistakes or mindsets in handling money, which become the reason why we do not advance in life. Because we are too negative about money. This is bad and our minds are closed to the potential we can reach if we have the right mindset and only use our money in the right way.And as we talk about this, you will now know the different correct mindsets about money and first here are the following:[1] There is money everywhere - When we were young, many of us were taught by our parents to study hard and then enter a good company to work after graduating. And there is nothing wrong with this, But there are also many of us who until they are old know that this is the only way to earn money, but you will notice that this is not the only option because you can build a business, offer a service to earn money of money.It's not like before we were told to do IT because it's popular, or do nursing because it's in demand in other countries, do HRM, Police and so on. I'll just repeat, there is nothing wrong with these professions, it's just that the times are different today. And you can make money almost anywhere.Many people have not been able to do their passion or talent because there is no money there, such as those who want to pursue art, leverage their talent or turn their talent into a hobby and turn it into a business. But in reality you can make money from the above. Because someone is making money from designing, drawing and digital art is doing it now. Even though there are hobbies such as taking care of dogs, iguana cats and others, the others make content on YouTube and earn money, and these are just some of the things you can earn as a hobby.Bottom line is that you can make money as long as what you do has value. Because there are potential audiences or communities that need it for sure.[2] Your income is not limited - Many of us have the wrong mindset about money so most of us persevere or endure the salary. But the truth is that there are so many opportunities and there are no limits if you are open-minded to other things or jobs.Don't be like someone I know who has been working for 15 years and earns 350$ per month, Yes, there is nothing wrong with his job, but with the skills and experience he has, he could have earned more than his salary of triple if he just used his skills. That's why his perspective about money is too limited.Because sometimes, we think that's the perfect job for us that's all we've got. Who knows that other opportunities in other companies might be better. Or let's say abroad, because you just don't realize it. I remembered that before, my former co-worker changed companies and now his salary has tripled compared to before. Because currently his work is lighter and the benefits are better unlike what he used to work for.That's why it's not because it's your first job, it's there until your retirement, it's not because the people you work with have become your family or close to you, it's there for life. You should look for other opportunities and don't be afraid to try. And when your income is only up to that, it might be possible to learn other skills, like you might have a business, we don't know.Maybe the best thing for you to do is to get rid of the belief that that's the only income you deserve.[3] Spend to earn - You also need to have a mindset that is not just saving or saving or always relying on free money just to increase your money. But it's true that the aforementioned are important, But if you want to earn a lot, it usually comes at a price. Because you are investing for yourself and your future, that is why it is also spent and time is really taken.They say \"The more you learn is the more you EARN.\" So don't beat yourself up because that's for yourself too. If you want to learn something, buy a book, or watch youtube videos and type what you want to know. Attend seminars or study to increase value in any marketplace.And for that to happen, I think you need to invest in equipment, such as laptops, mobile devices or gadgets that can help you develop yourself.[4] There is money on the Internet or something new - Nowadays, posting is not the only thing you can do on the internet, because if you look at most of the communities on social media platforms, they are already making money, especially on Facebook and YouTube, Most of the million users of Facebook and Youtube are content creators because they know that there is money on the internet, what they think will go viral, they just take out their cellphones and record a video and they can earn money. just that simple, map travel, food, sports, hobbies, and others can now be turned into content on Facebook and YouTube.You really only need to leverage the things in front of you to take advantage of them, even Tiktok, Instagram, and others are really being used in terms of earnings via the internet. That's why if you are positioned in Shopee, lazada, milktea, Bitcoin/cryptocurrency and others, for sure you will make money, as long as you know how to use it correctly. And often on the internet what's trending there are many people who really earn money and many people ride it because it's viral and trending.But of course we must be careful and be aware because not all trending is okay, we still need to be balanced in this matter.[5] Your Money is Unlimited - It's true that money runs out but expenses don't, But if you know money, it can possibly prepare you for your old age, your children and the generations to come. So this is where investing comes in, the money you use should earn more money, instead of just spending it on useless things that just by saving that as time goes on the value will only decrease due to inflation.The moment you realize that you need to invest in yourself, and in things that will make you more money, for sure your life will change a lot, you need to invest in assets that will bring you money as long as you live. Like investing in business, stocks, building a platform or investing in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency that can provide profit in the future. And other things that can give you a good cash flow of money.[6] You don't have money forever - It's not true that until we get old you don't have money, it's actually a wrong mindset. We should not use the difficulty we are facing as an excuse just for that matter. If anyone wants to get out of poverty, you must change your mindset, think that there is hope, and you must believe in yourself that you can get out of poverty.A person will not really advance or become rich if he has a poor mindset in his mind, even if they don't change it. Because you feel like you're not like this, I'm just poor, I don't have the ability, and so on so you can't start acting.It must start with ourselves that you have a strong burning desire or drive to get out of your situation. Because if you just lie down and wait for what's coming, nothing in your life will ever change. YOU MUST TAKE ACTION NOW...",

      "body": "The world is filled with boundless opportunities that can make anyone live a comfortable life. One problem is to identify these opportunities because they usually don't look viable. People have failed to identify opportunities because they are expecting these opportunities to look like opportunities. They next level is to utilize these opportunities. Procrastination and excuses are always the main impediments to utilizing opportunities. Most people complain about the government, lack of finance, and others thereby missing out on an opportunity. Learning a new skill can be a good means of gaining additional income. One can learn a highly needed skill which can lead to a change of job or a side job. These side jobs can complement your normal income and make you financially stable. Wasting money on pleasure or unnecessary activities will lead to financial problems. It will be better to invest the money in other profitable ventures. The world is going through a lot of economic problems there is a need to spend less and invest more. But we should also note that it is not everybody that will be rich. Some people derive fulfillment from a low paying job and they are okay. They are not so much concerned about acquiring so much wealth but they just want to provide their basic needs and enjoy their jobs. Sometimes your passion might not necessarily lead to money-making, it could just be a source of fun, joy, and fulfillment. It might not also be out of place to monetize your skill but the focus should not always be to make money but to impact people's lives positively and derive fulfillment.",

But we need to realize that making money is not always easy but not always difficult. Sometimes we forget that the portion of income has been determined depending on how we respond to these results, whether trying is enough or should it be considered lacking. Every opportunity to make money is always open, but not everyone is able to fill that opportunity with the requirements. That's why there are skills that become demands, to achieve these conditions we need to learn, hone our abilities, and not give up easily. when there is a high will then there is always a way to achieve it.Content creation is actually not difficult, because each audience will come with their own categories and interests. There are not a few simple content creators but there are many viewers because what is conveyed in the contents of the content is indeed the most sought-after topic. For example, mastering a certain field can channel it into automatic content where visitors come, where the visitor likes the domain that we convey.",

I stay in between everything I do, there is time for work and their is time for relaxation and enjoyment, I got no time on earth, it's not my home, I will leave it one day no matter what I acquired on this earth. When you are pursing your goals always remember that one day nothing will matter because you will be dead, so hustle while you can but do not forget to play as hard as your hustle too.Not spending money on anything that wont give you back more money is a boring life, you need to go to cinemas, comedy shows, make someone happy, a wife? Your children? Don't take things too hard on yourself.",

People now a days are successful in business and they are engage in online business but there is a scarcity of job or lower salaries which is a big reason that educated people are a part of online jobs.I think that as we make a comparison so individuals with higher education and have ability to utilize their skills involved in businesses are more successful than those who don't have idea how to use skills and techniques.Educated person have dual opportunities like that of entering in business as well as continue their jobs.",

Yes, it would really be taking so much time from you but we do reallyneed up to do such thing for the sake of family and giving them that a good life when it comes to financial where you could give out on what they want.",

      "body": "True, a lot of the instances OP states do happen, but it isn't the only influence/factor that affects a person's capability to earn money. I mean just a simple regime of dumb people would be enough of a cause to reduce your worth in general. Granted with the internet you'd have more opportunities to not be (too much) affected by it, but well, it still happens. Well it is true that the change starts with us, but not everyone will reach the same end, even if the change did indeed happen. Quote from: Rruchi man on July 11, 2023, 02:31:27 PMQuote from: Mr. Magkaisa on July 11, 2023, 10:16:19 AMMost oft the time we make many mistakes or mindsets in handling money, which become the reason why we do not advance in life. There is one which is not mentioned, maybe it was overlooked, but it is as important as the others, and a big error that many people are making which needs to be corrected. It is better to Invest, than to save. It is better to spend money in trying to get more, than to spend time in trying to save the money that you have. It is even more terrible to save in fiat.Wouldn't that be considered in the Spend to earn part? OP did concentrate on the learning part but I reckon spending to invest and letting it grow could also be a part of it.",
