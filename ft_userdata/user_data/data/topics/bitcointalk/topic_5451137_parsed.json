You don't need any guarantee of any kind before investing in Bitcoin. By the way, who do you think will give you any guarantees? Perhaps during the early stages of Bitcoin, it was so cheap that those who invested in it did not really take any risk, like the way some people are selling their properties this time around to purchase Bitcoin. In the past, as you describe, I was not so.OP, Try to be more helpful by responding to topics that you can really provide good replies to on other boards or read and learn more. I don't know what others may think, but this is really a low-effort post, and even if you got a few members telling you some risk they took, you would not do anything with such information.",

The ignorance (in a good sense) of the technology, the economical and financial properties, etc. If one, knows about all that information, and also the basic conccepts of the technology put into Bitcoin, the risks were very very very.... but very dimm.I only regreat that I didn't have the knowledge I have today about Bitcoin, back in late 2018. I bought only a few bucks, probably less than 200 or so. Only a few months later, after Bitcoin raised its value more than 3 times or even more, I had some knowledge that made me way more confident and start DCA'ing.If it was today, I would have probably buy way more that time!",

This makes every move you make now to increase your holdings a risk. We've got FUD from both individuals and organisations, government on the other had and self doubt if the currency could really surpass all that is thrown at it.At the time, its good and I have no reason not to give it the time it needs to become all that I hope it to be which it would be. Ideas created not out of selfish interest most times do come off good and the bitcoin innovation is one of such ideas.",

So, people would just collect BTC and liquidate it as soon as they receive an offer for it. Remember the guy who sold 10,000 BTCs in exchange for two (2) pizzas? That is the classic example on how people viewed BTC before. Personally, majority of my BTCs came from participating in campaign signatures in this forum. When I joined here last 2017, I converted almost all of my BTCs to cash in order to purchase school materials for me and my brothers. I guess one you see a more realistic approach, you would think of quickly converting it to your designated currency.",

Perhaps during the early stages of Bitcoin, it was so cheap that those who invested in it did not really take any risk, ...If what you say is true, I wonder why not many people invested in it at the time. There are many stories many people know about bitcoin early on, but most of them ignore it. Bitcoin was very cheap at the time, but not too many people believed and invested in it. That makes me suspect everyone is risk averse and doesn't dare to invest in bitcoin in the early stages. In my opinion, although bitcoin was very cheap when it first launched, it is riskier than it is now, as it is so new, there is no reason to believe it will grow in the future. Unlike now, the price is very expensive but has received the support and trust of many countries, companies and investors...Bitcoin is currently very expensive compared to its original price, but it is much safer and worth the investment.",

And the longer you stay and be in this game? the better you realized that there are one fool proof strategy to invest, that is to do DCA, and invest what you can afford to lose. So to answer, non, it was just a slow process for me to accumulate what I have right now, there are times that I have to sell for emergencies and then re-invest again.",

They did it mostly because of curiosity and some belief.Quote from: TravelMug on May 04, 2023, 12:37:24 AMNevertheless, it's a bad choice as majority will agree that it's very bad to do that.

They only can guess but guess is not correct.Dollar cost averaging is a good method when you invest in Bitcoin. No guess, no prediction, no gamble is needed. You only have belief, knowledge, good discipline to DCA with time and good practice to store your bitcoins safely.https://dcabtc.com/https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet",

I was trading without much of a clue what I'm doing (again, bad idea, but, again, I was lucky and I didn't lose) and I was lending using the exchange's feature (which has be proven later to have bugs and I think that some people have lost money).Of course, the less risky step was to... sell some of my coins now and then or simply buy goods for bitcoin.While the initial (rather stupid) moves were lucky and I didn't lose money with that, if I wouldn't have been spending... I would have had now quite a nice amount.",

Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Pizzas for 10,000 BTC's because he believed BTC was a currency, Gavin Andresen gave out BTC's for free to people to show that BTC was a currency and to encourage people to use it, it was all about using this new censorship resistant currency for early adopters and not pump in value, guarantees or promises.Right now BTC has grown and developed so well, and its value continues to grow because of adoption and limited supply, but we have to thank the early adopters for the level BTC is at now, because of them people can now use BTC as a currency, investment asset, hedge, store of value, gift and whatever they want to use it for.",

That means why not now I have to commit to find out more about Bitcoin.I can safely say that at this time I am trying to set aside little by little to save income from work with the aim that when I have enough to buy even in small quantities.

What they did is simply asthonishing, they have courage and their vision is so good that they really trust that what they bought is something will be valuable in the next years.

That time I'm still student and doesn't have enough funds to make an investment. Did I regret it? no because I know that I'm still not yet ready in terms of financially, emotionally and mentally to enter this type of market. Still grateful because I have know a lot of knowledge that I can use to make unlimited profits in this type of market. I really happy for the people who bought bitcoin in the early stage because they proved that they have the courage and supreme confidence to take risks.",
