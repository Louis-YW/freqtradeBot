It's really good to see someone having a good experience on the casino that I’m promoting but you should follow @cryptsafe suggestion and move this on gambling discussion board which you can find on the bottom of the thread if you click edit. Also this post is about your experience on trustdice. Maybe you can just post this on trstdice Ann thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5126117 and lock this thread.",

Helpful support.Are you talking about the trust dice we all are used to in the forum?If yes then will you tell us what your position in the team and if you are a player on trust dice that have had a great experience and want to give a positive review about the casino,  then you need to put up a better review with enough evidence that you played on that casino.We know that Trusdice has a good reputation here in the forum and quite a lot of members here advertise the casino in their signature.",

I only read the first page that time because all the replies is already same. Thanks for providing the quoted statement on his thread.Quote from: yahoo62278 on June 16, 2023, 02:37:08 PMI'm not a fan of a 5x wager requirement, but if I am gambling I am not really paying attention to my exact wager and trying to cashout as soon as I hit it.Same here, Wagering requirements kills the fun of gambling because it will push the gambler to play more even if they are already in profit on early games. I remember most of the casino doesn’t have this requirements before while Curacao license is already available that time. The first casino that I remember to implement this requirements is Fortunejack then other casino follow.",
