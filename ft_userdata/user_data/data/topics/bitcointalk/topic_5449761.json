Anonymity isn't one of key principles of Bitcoin, if you not use Bitcoin mixer or Coinjoin, you're still can get traced because Bitcoin use a public blockchain where anyone can see your address, transaction, how much you hold, where your coins come from etc.Many people are still supporting centralized exchanges because they find it's more convenient to use and they feel safe to trust a top centralized exchanges. They're not entirely understand and use Bitcoin like the purpose, but they only focus about making money.",

Funds on cex are held only by those who cannot safely store them themselves (lack of knowledge) and those who need funds for active trading (thanks to them, bitcoin has liquidity and, as such, price stability). Traders can't let go of CEXs, because dexes do not trade real bitcoin, but wrapped in a centralized way BTC on BSC or ETH (not to mention the performance differences). So trading on CEX is no different than trading on dex in terms of bitcoin and safety of funds.",

But still people could track your addresses which could cause to many criminal activities suich as fraud and scams. People still prefer to have centralized system as some legitimate exchanges could guarantee the safety of your funds and can ensure you to transact with legit people. Imagine putting your funds in not centralized manner and it's up to your decisions if your fudns would be safe.",

Decentralized exchanges are much newer and much less well known and usually have large price differentials from the current price of Bitcoin - like on a decentralized exchange the price might be a thousand dollars higher, so that makes people not want to buy it through there.Centralized exchanges are also just more efficient and easier to use, which is what most people want when they are buying and selling, along with the best price.",

Traders uses CEX for easy exchange and to trade,because cex makes it more convenient,easy and cheaper for them. So many people uses CEX because they are lazy and can't take the responsibility of keeping their bitcoin safe in a noncustodial wallet. Lack of knowledge on how bitcoin is designed and how to store it is also another reason. Bitcoin is decentralized in nature and should be used in that way. You can buy any kind of cryptocurrency in Cex because they have all type of cryptocurrency.",

A centralized exchange is a platform where you can easily buy Bitcoin using your Fiat money, you could easily use something like your Debit or credit card to buy on the platform, and an easy way to trade your cryptocurrency to the different blockchain networks. Yes, most of us hate centralized exchange but it just has advantages and disadvantages, one of the disadvantages of it is it is centralized and we don't have complete control of our own funds.But it's still a legitimate exchange platform, it's easy, and convenient to use the platform, and most of the traders use the platform even though they hated centralized exchange because it's convenient, just don't put funds or invest in the long term on this platform. You could just buy on it, or exchange your crypto on an exchange then take the funds out to a more secure wallet.",

Everyone needs speed, easiness, flexibility and dynamism in what they do, that's what the centralized exchange is giving. They've given us a reason to own a coin without fear of how to sell it and how fast it could be achieved since there is easy access to using it the way we want.Is it for investment, skating, trading, exchange, you name it? The centralized exchange makes these so easy. And their P2P system is the best. Personally, I might have been discouraged without them.",

It isn't advisable to retain, and store any coins in exchanges especially in the centralized ones, but for some investors, it's a way for them to sell their coins way faster if they needed it. I mean if they store it in a hardware wallet, then suddenly the price of Bitcoin spiked up and they choose to sell it, they need to wait a few minutes because of the transaction, and in that span, price of Bitcoin might go low already, so I guess that's the reason why they are storing it there.Another reason is that they're traders. It's pretty obvious that traders will really store their Bitcoins on Centralized exchanges. Why do people use CEX? Because it's convenient, easy to buy, easy to sell, and trusted (only a few).",

What they don't realize is that most of these exchanges don't operate within their jurisdiction and could disappear the next day without providing them an explanation. CEX gives the illusion of safety because a 3rd party intermediary exists but it's that 3rd party intermediary that should provoke the most distrust.",

However, not all feature-rich CEXs can serve as a home for crypto traders and investors, but only those CEXs that have official permits and are supervised by relevant security agencies, both at the international and national levels. Additionally, pay attention to the reputation of the cryptocurrency exchange because every exchange has the potential to suddenly confiscate user funds.Always be mindful of how you store your money because when you keep your funds in a custodial wallet, your money is managed by someone else who could potentially compromise its security. So, be cautious even if you're using the most well-known exchange, as their security is not foolproof.",
