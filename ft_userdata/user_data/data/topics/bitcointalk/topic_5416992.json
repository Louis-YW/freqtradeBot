  "content": "There are \"coins\" that lie on their own blockchain (like ETH, BTC, Monero) and other \"coins\", that are tokens.Are there DEX, where it is possible to change \"coins\" that are not tokens, but have there own blockchain. Or can we only change \"coins\" with a DEX, that are part of the same blockchain and are tokens? Example:A) Are there DEX, where I can change BTC against Monero (I mean not tokens, but the real BTC and Monero)? B) Or can I only do this on CEX?C) Or are there \"copys\" of Bitcoin and Monero for example Ethereum, so that I can change Bitcoin tokens and Monero tokens on (for example) Ethereum chain?Would appreciate some answer. Thank you.",

Current list of exchanges without KYCOn centralized exchanges that has no KYC, know that it is jot your key it is not your coin. You account or coins can be freezed. Not your coin on blockchain and you have no full control.This would be helpful as well: https://kycnot.me/ But know that it comsists of both centralized and decentralized exchanges.",

      "body": "Yes bisq is a good option for a dex that can do this. If there's a dispute they get you to ensure you use a wallet that supports extracting relevant details (in the case of monero) to affirm the transaction went through and allow them to release the funds - I don't know if this is prone to social engineering but I doubt it, especially if it's automated.Non kyc dexes are also a good choice and might have more competitive prices depending on how much you're wanting to buy and sell and how long you're wanting to wait (if you open a trade on bisq you might wait a few hours for someone to take your offer - in my experience you can close a trade within about 30 minutes after that if the other party is responsive enough the longest time is normally block confirmations).For question 3, I don't think this is a good option if you're after maintaining privacy (ethereum is worse than bitcoin for privacy).",

There are only a few real DEX exchanges that are not using tokens, and best of them is certainly Bisq.Bisq suppoorts Monero (with highest volume) fiat currencies, and few more altcoins, but best thing about it that it doesn't need any kyc verification.For monero to bitcoin there is also Atomic swaps, and that you can find other wallets supporting atomic swaps like Liquality extension but it works only for Bitcoin and ethereum.Quote from: Mbidox on October 13, 2022, 03:30:46 PMA) Are there DEX, where I can change BTC against Monero (I mean not tokens, but the real BTC and Monero)?

You send them the/your BTC, exchange it for FIAT, then you can withdraw the FIAT to your Bank account number, so never give your account number to anybody but a trusted exchange for your country.",

You only try to help.Thank you all for the hint with bisq.For those who are familiar with bisq:1) Question:When I go to https://bisq.markets/ and then click on different markets (for example BSQ or Monero), then I see the buy and sell offers.But it looks like it is always an offer for the swap of a coin against BTC.So for example ...Monero - BTCBSQ - BTCDo I interpret this correctly?So when I want to change Monero against BSQ: Do I then have to make two transactions? first BSQ into BTC and then BTC into Monero? (I do not want to do that. This is only an example.)2) Question:Where can I see on https://bisq.markets/markets, if a coin is a token or a real coin. And if it is a token: How can I see from which blockchain this token is?Thank you.Quote from: dkbit98 on October 13, 2022, 05:17:32 PMQuote from: Mbidox on October 13, 2022, 03:30:46 PMAre there DEX, where it is possible to change \"coins\" that are not tokens, but have there own blockchain.
