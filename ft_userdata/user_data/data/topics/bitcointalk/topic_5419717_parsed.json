Why do you intend to sell BTC at 22'200? Do you see a crash coming? On the other hand BTC will not fall below 14k. For me that's the range to invest. It's not so important on the long run, if BTC is 19k, 22k or even touches 14k. This year we gona stay in 18-19k price range lowest there is a lot support this price zone.but today i see a lot support until 22k price range,definately i see ALTCOIN rally coming.If you entry in long position with 3x leverage you most definately will make profit with very low risk.But instead of futures i use bull bear leverage tokens If price going down i'll just dca more leverage tokens i prefer lev tokens instead of futures becouse no liqutation risk.If i have bull Lev tokens then i'll buy 2-3% per each token opposite direction leverage tokens just in case the Market goes another way then i'm insured against losses.This year i have the plan how to make profit when btc Are low i dca bull leverage tokens at price range 17k-20,500$ Once btc reach over 20,800$ to 21,500$ i sell bull tokens and i'll start buying bear tokens.  This year 2022 my highest target are 22,500$ and lowest Are 19k price range If i follow this i make profit most definately and sometimes i entry with 10x-30x leverage like i do it today becouse btc are in my low plan price zone today wich is 19k. I try to avoid trading when market are in between low and high like 20k price range then i would take 50% long and 50% short positions.I do also the oil gold and other market analysis not just the btc.Btw...Im interested about global macro economics and I been learning about fed markets and banking.(everthing self-learning)Our society don't ask what knowledge and skills you have they just want you to have education and paper that's why Im not working at wall street or in financial sector,so i trade myself my small funds just for now my own funds",

But I guess that CZ has just learned his lesson from the fiasco that he has met with Luna and UST so, he's just doing everything he can to avoid the same scenario that has happened before. And about the pricing of bitcoin, it's the same from most analysis that I've heard that the bottom maybe in between of $10k-$20k.",
