  "content": "The crypto market has plummeted to around $ 1 trillion today, with a liquidation amount exceeding $ 200 million within 1 hour. In particular, some tokens that have been registered as securities by SEC have been devastated:Like there, matic, sol, fil, sand and several other tokens are also affected, but Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) only experience a slight decline.https://www.coingecko.com/What causes this market decline?The fall of the market is caused by traders who feel significant selling pressure due to Robinhood's decision to remove there, matic, and sol. It is assumed that Robinhood stores around $ 1.3 billion in Altcoin and $ 583 million in the form of existence, matic, and soles.While Coinbase is preparing to fight against SEC by stating that he has no plans to delete tokens that are allegedly considered securities or will not stop his staking services until there are court orders, other US companies such as Robinhood and Grayscale are unable to continue to serve the token.Another reason came from the decision of the Moody credit rating agency which reduced the coinbase rating from stable to negative.What do you think of your friends to take advantage of situations like this, is it now the right time to buy a few coins?",

      "body": "Series of bad events. One thing I guess which caused the market ctash is the issue concerning the largest exchanger which is Binance. It happened that investors associated this instance with what happened before with FTX as we all know. Another is the CME Gap which is meant to be filled before an actual uptrend occur. Not only these two but there are more for sure. This is how easily demand can be affected both direct and indirect events could make a 'wave' towards the market value of cryptos. Whether it is the right time to buy or not, I think it would be better to check on one's capacity or tolerance with this industry's risk. Ofcourse an investor would want to buy at a lower market price but problem is, it would be hard to determine the exact bottom. The price could also increase in no time. Therefore, you should make a decision whether to wait for a little longer or to enter right now and endure possible market price downfall.",

However, if someone wants to take the risk and thinks that the situation will turn in their favor, let them gamble, because altcoins have always been more of a gamble than a serious investment.Quote from: ndutndut on June 10, 2023, 01:05:25 PMIn particular, some tokens that have been registered as securities by SEC have been devastatedYou ask a question, and at the same time you gave an answer - Bitcoin is not a security for the SEC, and thus it does not go into the same category as all those altcoins you mention. For those who refuse to accept reality all these years, it seems that they will accept it the hard way.",

I knew that you just summary the news but source is important to make your data legit.I’m not reading crypto news anymore but I’m surprised how chaotic the US market now the SEC is cracking down Binance and Coinbase at the same time.Quote from: ndutndut on June 10, 2023, 01:05:25 PMWhat do you think of your friends to take advantage of situations like this, is it now the right time to buy a few coins?Buy the dip.

So they open to attacked either by the government directly or it agencies. The liquidation is always there for bitcoin to move forward and any other altcoins that do well will also follow the trend. While all very true, I think the reason we are seeing Bitcoin correct further (as opposed to move higher) is because speculators are selling crypto right now, and the reality is the majority of it remains altcoins. So Bitcoin get's \"wrapped up\" in the selling fever, even if there isn't any logic to it or rational. Fortunately right now Bitcoin is very close (only 1% away) from reclaiming the majority of the crypto market, meaning it should be much less effected by what is happening to the minority of the market. At least in the past with high Bitcoin dominance as a majority, it becomes very unaffected and detached from the rest of the market.Of course subjectivity this can simply be because Bitcoin is rising while shitcoins are flat or falling, as there is the momentum behind it, but notably this only ever happens when Bitcoin's market dominance is already relatively high at a clear majority. This is more of less the point of the term dominance, because it's based on how dominant Bitcoin is within the market and therefore how unaffected it becomes by it.",

I think DCA and not going all in is the best plan to do considering there is a real uncertainty goin on right now, until there's some clarity on the market I think it's really best to avoid or put them on stables. Alts will surely bleed right now so it's best to buy either Bitcoin, ETH, or stablecoins.",
