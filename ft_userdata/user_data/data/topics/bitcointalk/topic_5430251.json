  "content": "QuoteBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett lambasted Wall Street for encouraging speculative behavior in the stock market, effectively turning it into a “gambling parlor.”Buffett, 91, spoke at length during his annual shareholder meeting Saturday about one of his favorite targets for criticism: investment banks and brokerages.“Wall Street makes money, one way or another, catching the crumbs that fall off the table of capitalism,” Buffett said. “They don’t make money unless people do things, and they get a piece of them. They make a lot more money when people are gambling than when they are investing.”Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett lambasted Wall Street for encouraging speculative behavior in the stock market, effectively turning it into a “gambling parlor.”Buffett, 91, spoke at length during his annual shareholder meeting Saturday about one of his favorite targets for criticism: investment banks and brokerages.“Wall Street makes money, one way or another, catching the crumbs that fall off the table of capitalism,” Buffett said. “They don’t make money unless people do things, and they get a piece of them. They make a lot more money when people are gambling than when they are investing.”Buffett bemoaned that large American companies have “became poker chips” for market speculation. He cited soaring use of call options, saying that brokers make more money from these bets than simple investing.Still, the situation can result in market dislocations that give Berkshire Hathaway an opportunity, he said. Buffett said that Berkshire spent an incredible $41 billion on stocks in the first quarter, unleashing his company’s cash hoard after an extended lull. Some $7 billion of that went to snap up shares of Occidental, bringing up his stake to more than 14% of the oil producer’s shares.“That’s why markets do crazy things, and occasionally Berkshire gets a chance to do something,” Buffett said.“It’s almost a mania of speculation,” Charlie Munger, 98, Buffett’s long-time partner and Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman, chimed in.“We have people who know nothing about stocks being advised by stock brokers who know even less,” Munger said. “It’s an incredible, crazy situation. I don’t think any wise country would want this outcome. Why would you want your country’s stock to trade on a casino?”Retail traders flooded into the stock market during the pandemic, boosting share prices to records. Last year, the frenzy was fueled further by meme-inspired trading from Reddit message boards. But the stock market has turned this year, putting many of those new at-home traders in the red. The Nasdaq Composite, which holds many of the favorite names of small traders, is in a bear market, down more than 23% from its high after an April crush.Warren Buffett has a long history of deriding investment bankers and their institutions –saying that they encourage mergers and spinoffs to reap fees, rather than improve companies.He typically shuns investment bankers for his acquisitions, calling them pricey “money shufflers.” Buffett’s $848.02 per share offer for insurer Alleghany reportedly excludes Goldman’s advisory fee.Earlier in the session, he noted that Berkshire would always be cash-rich, and in times of need, would be “better than the banks” at extending credit lines to companies. An audience member made an inaudible comment while he was talking.“Was that a banker screaming?” Buffett joked.https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/30/warren-buffett-rips-wall-street-for-turning-the-stock-market-into-a-gambling-parlor.html....Warren Buffett is notorious for his famous quotations and this piece is no exception:Quote“Wall Street makes money, one way or another, catching the crumbs that fall off the table of capitalism,” Buffett said. “They don’t make money unless people do things, and they get a piece of them. They make a lot more money when people are gambling than when they are investing.”Buffett bemoaned that large American companies have “became poker chips” for market speculation. He cited soaring use of call options, saying that brokers make more money from these bets than simple investing.“That’s why markets do crazy things, and occasionally Berkshire gets a chance to do something,” Buffett said.“It’s almost a mania of speculation,” Charlie Munger, 98, Buffett’s long-time partner and Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman, chimed in.“We have people who know nothing about stocks being advised by stock brokers who know even less,” Munger said. “It’s an incredible, crazy situation. I don’t think any wise country would want this outcome. Why would you want your country’s stock to trade on a casino?”These comments resonate with crashes and market failures in 2022. Even bitcoin's trading cycles might be defined in terms of rampant speculation and assets being traded like \"chips in a casino\".If the wealthiest and most successful stock traders in Warren Buffett is currently unhappy with current market conditions and trading behavior. Is there much hope for average investors having profitable runs in stocks, bonds or traditional finance?Is it accurate to say that investment has come to more closely resemble casinos or gambling parlors than areas of investment?",

      "body": "Investments seem to have started to lose some of the fundamentals but I think the trends of a lot of major companies still go in similar ways. I pick about 8 companies to invest in over the year (normally 4 in the first half and 4 in the latter) so I don't watch much in the way of individual stock moves.It would seem like the stock exchanges open to \"regular\" traders do try to push lists like \"biggest gainers\", \"biggest losers\", \"most volatility\"... But these have probably always been a thing, the difference now might be the factor of leverage and the amount of people that have the time to chase these stocks (and, potentially, the amount of money too). There's enough people not happy to agree on a race draw before the race has started for the hope they can win - you're probably going to face similar things with leverage day traders that have no clue on what they're doing and are just testing out a strategy (a few make money, most don't).Most big fundamentals still hold true such as value investing and investing in the team/employees.",

Everyone that came after Hal Finney and during that time of the first users of the Silk Road came because it made sense, AND because it's a good investment. I bought because of that reason first, I won't lie about it. BUT I have also understood its ethos, and its importance. I HODL, debate, and troll the trolls because of that reason.QuoteEven though human history is dotted with thousands of years of inflation and failed monetary policy.

At the least, he's not a hypocrite and he's telling the retail investors that what they're doing is wasting time and money, and that investing remains king all the while speculation will only get them to nowhere UNLESS they know something more than Wall Street or the big bankers. The guy obviously knows what he's talking about, and he's like giving us an extremely valuable piece of advice that we are ignoring just because we are reaping the benefits now. I personally invest and speculate, but the latter gives out faster returns than the former. And in today's day and age, speculation has a lot more avenues and platforms to start with compared to investing which kinda pushes the average Joe to go about and speculate rather than invest.",

I mean all those cocaine, strip clubs and unregulated markets where they were gambling, and yet how could it be worse today? Well, let me tell you one thing: bribery.Back in those days bankers weren't protected the way they are today, which means that if they lost their money then they lost their money, and that meant even though they were gambling a lot more than today, they were responsible for the losses, and they would be gone if they lost all the money whereas today if they do, then your money would be gone and they would just get bailed out.

The governments of the countries seem to have found an effective way against crises in the form of printing an additional amount of money, but thanks to this, the market is not healing and the problems are simply driven deeper, threatening even greater problems in the future. There is a kind of decoupling of the stock market from direct production, and because of this, the stock market really begins to resemble a casino that has less and less to do with the production of goods and services, for which the stock market was originally created.",
