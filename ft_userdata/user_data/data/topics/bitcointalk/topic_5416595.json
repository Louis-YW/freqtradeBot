Even if this occurred during a bumpy bear market, the results still go against original expectations.What do you think about this? Is the hype actually over, or is the bear market simply acting up?Well, the hype didn't do well for ETH itself and to the market. We thought that it's going to be a booster to its price but didn't do. We can have that conclusion that the hype was eaten by the bear market and if you've been here since 2018 bear market. There were too many good projects that have been eaten by the actual bear.That's why even if there was a good project and good news about it but it happened on a bear market, that won't contribute.",

This is understandable since transitioning from PoW to PoS doesn't give an instant result which means there will be no significant changes on Ethereum that worthy for a price pump besides of hype.The crypto market is now continuing to bear market that only halt due to short term hype of Eth.",

After that, we will see another hype wave with some reports on social media, cryptocurrency newspapers or tweets from influencers about it. I believe the next hype won't be big and if you want significant hype, you must wait for next updates on Ethereum network (after the Merge).We don't know when a next upgrade will be made because Ethereum team have history of repeated upgrade postpones.",

I think market did not even shown it at that alarming rate as it should have been because this was big event and the effect wasn’t much accelerated. Definitely currently we stand at much better position as compared to the expectations. However, market as we know is unstable and ETH is still in good position because staking is new world for everyone. They all seeing ETH as bigger opportunity via staking so more money is flowing in that sector.",

Lol you're lucky if you're stuck up right now and ethereum will bounce back shortly because for sure will become profitable at the end but if it stays and it continue to decrease then it will be a bad news.",

They thought that the merge meant that Ethereum would finally scale after all of these years, but alas, no such luck. In fact, all those people who staked are now unable to withdraw their funds, just because the core developers don't want people to be able to sell when they are trying to dump their bags. There are many better Web3 investments, like MATIC and ICP, each of these will do better long term and can scale to be used by the entire world, something that Ethereum will never be able to do on L1.",

We weren't sure how it would happen and that is why we wondered if it will work or not. Looking at how it worked out and it's fine right now, I think it’s doing great so far and there is no problem at all.I know it’s not a simple thing, but I believe it is certainly something I could enjoy and don't need the price to go up at all. It’s clear for me that we shouldn't expect every single improvement on blockchain world to cause a big increase in the prices, somethings are just good in a tech way.",

Is the hype actually over, or is the bear market simply acting up?Merge happened during the global economic crisis combined with bearish market. I don't even think if the hype will be last long. Only dumb people who are thinking if they will be seeing ethereum got hyped even more after merge. Merge gives no change to the protocol. that was only changing the fact that if merge was bad too. I meant take a look at how it was giving a huge impact to the price of ethereum. The hype is over and yes, the merge doesn’t give a good impact yet to ETH for some reason, but maybe in the long run it’s for the benefit of everybody. I see this merge as a good one, it’s just that the timing is no that good and that’s why the price is still down. The price can only recover once the market enters into a new bull run, for now you can buy more while the price of ETH is still cheap.",

The price can go down anytime. If the sentiment is still negative in the world economic and i will be expecting another huge dump will come as soon as possible. It's just matter of time.",
