  "content": "I would like to introduce you to Potfolio.Potfolio works similar to an ETF, but for cryptocurrencies. In their portfolio there are only the biggest assets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and so on). Everything can be seen transparently in the network.They've just launched and are already starting with an insane investment pot of $150,000.So you have the opportunity to invest directly diversified with leverage, instead of doing it yourself.The team is legitimate and has already done nothing questionable or the like in previous projects.Telegram: https://t.me/Potfolio_OfficialWebsite: https://potfol.io/",

Explain yourself now and provide evidence to support your claims. There is no team listed on the website. Are you part of the team?",
