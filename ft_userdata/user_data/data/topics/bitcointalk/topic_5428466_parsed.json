Some could say that medical history should not change, some could say that people change and the old data may no longer be relevant (although it could be, for example for detecting old/older malpraxis).Quote from: Cyber_Alien on December 14, 2022, 07:13:16 AMWhat if quantum computersI find a big silly all the \"what if quantum computers\" topics, sorry.

Ehy do you think even the government now are using the blockchain technology for their privacy and security, the blockchain network dont just work like that, if follows a strict concensus of protocols and this remains immutable ehich means till eternity they cannot be unlocked or altered by any means of a third party interference, you can also undergoe a layer 2 protocols for more privacy since it's an open distributed ledger, and same thing that shows on your computer appears thesame way on every others computer nodes connected all over the world, permit me to its indestructible or will you want to attempts such? regardless of new phantom devices as long as it does not work with the blockchain technology protocols it remains invalid to make an input on the network or alter it.Quote from: Cyber_Alien on December 14, 2022, 07:13:16 AMOn the blockchain, all of your users' private information will be accessible to everyone.

There are more to how you can have your transactions informations displayed, as for records of data information i may not know much but every transaction that is openly shown can also go private on layer two or whenbyou make use of the mixing services for more privacy.",

While your wallet seed is best to stay offline, medical data can easily get lost if kept on paper. Archives get burned down, archives get flooded, earthquakes can damage them too. Even more, medical data (see original post!) needs to be shared between various institutions. This makes it important to be kept in a digital format (easy to share, easy to search) in multiple copies. Of course, old school databases replicated in cloud and shared only between the relevant institutions would be the first option, but a blockchain can be OK too in some cases.Now, as a second thought, if I'd use blockchain (read up a few posts and see my point on malpraxis), I'd probably use a private blockchain for the job, to somewhat reduce the risks of unauthorized access, no matter how good the data is encrypted.And then even the QC issue OP was mentioning is not an issue.",

Keys and access rights would be provided for those who need them, and those that don't, wouldn't have access to the system. So, If I was attempting to check the medical data of a random person, I wouldn't be able to do that. But if a doctor needs to access their patient's history to check if they can treat that patient with a particular set of drugs, they would be able to check it.Medical data is very centralized. If you get injured while you are abroad and you are unconscious and unable to respond to the doctors treating you, the doctors have no way of knowing your medical history, and if there are some type of drugs you are allergic to. Instead of a cure, the treatment could prove to be deadly or cause even more harm. It would be great if such data was available to doctors worldwide and the blockchain is one way in which that could be achieved.",
