This are not cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether or stable coins like USDT or USDC, they are asset backed tokens. There are a lot of things that can now be tokenized.Blockchain technology can also be used in other areas that are not pertaining to cryptocurrencies. Like in medical field, personal identity security and social media.We need to just read the policy document for us to understand better.",

      "body": "@Spaceman1000$Maybe you can add this link: https://twitter.com/FMoCDENigeria/status/1653846759779475458?s=20Quote from: https://twitter.com/FMoCDENigeria/status/1653846759779475458?s=20The activities of the Policy shall be coordinated by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy. A multi-sectoral Steering Committee has also been approved to oversee the implementation of the Policy.The Federal Executive Council has further directed relevant regulatory bodies to develop regulatory instruments for the deployment of Blockchain Technology across various sectors of the economy.  These regulatory agencies include NITDA, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the National Universities Commission (NUC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), among others.All other Federal and State Government institutions, as well as the private sector are urged to leverage Blockchain Technologies in education, health, security, agriculture and finance, among many other sectors.  Deploying these applications will further support in the implementation of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy for a Digital Nigeria.We all know that CBN has already started this with the creation of eNaira, but there are other areas that CBN can still make use of blockchain technology. This is not related (or directly related) to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, but I think it is a good move to raise awareness for the regulatory bodies as well as federal and state institutes to make use of blockchain technology which is the way to the future.",

Just as Igebotz don talk and as the name carry am and as e evern translate literally, blockchain (block + chain) na technology way dey concerned with taking records in a systematic order way be say, dem just join body dey go. E dey take records in a way e go be say, to change am dey impossible or to manipulate am in some kind way no go fit happen.So, e no really dey focused on cryptocurrency shah except say, we as people, we dey more likely to associate some kind innovation based on the technology way bring them come. Like, when person hear cryptocurrency, one of the first thing way go enter en mind na bitcoin. Na so e still be with blockchain.Where e good say something dey na em be say, we nation don dey wake up to the arising for the world around us and with that, them go come to know plenty.",
