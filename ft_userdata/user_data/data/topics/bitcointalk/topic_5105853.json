But for casuals, I believed they are somewhat reluctant because they don't want to take the risk at this point. While for those who got burned last year, maybe they're just waiting for the right time - at least a indication that recovery is on the way before putting their hard earn money again.",

On the other hand some of my crypto friends are waiting until the price goes lower. One has $1000 to spend and wants to get the biggest \"bang for buck\"Personally I have been buying on and off for over a month now, smallamounts $25 here, $50 there, just topping up my holdings.",

Unlike bags, the price of Bitcoin is very volatile so we don't know when is the real bottom for this. Bags can easily create a great satisfaction with women and maybe this is not really the case with Bitcoin as it is something we can't see, touch, feel and bring it to parties to show other girls of what they got. Now, can we then say that designer bags can be more valuable than Bitcoin? I am hoping this is not the case but am sure many women don't care as all they know is they want that expensive bags otherwise they can be divorcing their husbands who can't provide what they need...",
