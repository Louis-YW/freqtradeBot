You should also know that setting up a Bitcoin wallet comes with a great risk you should protect your wallet from hackers or even from your friends you don't trust. After downloading a Bitcoin wallet never share the private key or seed phrase of your wallet with anyone, you can back up your wallet with a UBD key, paper, and CDs and keep it where only you can access it or you can tell someone you trust in your family the location in case something happens to you.",

But just a friendly advise start with an electrum wallet.You may be wondering why electrum wallet. Yeah, that's because it's easy and simple to use,  it's newbie friendly  and a sturd security. Electrum wallet is :1 It's open source2. Supports multiple currency3. It's compatible etc In the process of time as you endure in the forum  when you would have gotten more knowledgeable about other  bitcoin/cryptocurrency  wallets you can try those  advanced user wallet.",

The number of downloads on playstore counts for nothing towards the security of a wallet, a wallet can have millions of downloads and yet be unsafe or not recommended. When looking for a wallet to use, things you should look out for is if the source code is open or closed, if the wallet is custodial or non custodial, you should also take into consideration the community's view/review about the wallet. If you pay attention to the number of downloads on playstore, you might download a bad wallet. Having said that, both trust wallet and safepal wallet are closed source, thus they aren't good options.",

If it is only for storing bitcoin, you can use hot wallets like electrum wallets and blue wallets for small amount of bitcoin, for daily spending. If you want to store a huge amount of bitcoin for a long time, you can use electrum cold storage wallet, where you generate your seed on an air gap device (offline). Or you can use a hardware wallet like trezor.On the other hand if you need a wallet to store more than one cryptocurrency, you can use coinomi wallet or unstoppable wallets.

But I have a single thread which consists of all other informative threads and that single thread is like a encyclopedia of bitcoin talk. And that's made by Ratimov, You should check the wallets section for further details. [AUGUST UPD.] Beginners & Help EncyclopediaRatimov's Forum Guides, Tutorials & ListsIn the first link, you will find hell lot of links, to find wallet related topics, you can use ctrl+F key and then write wallet keyword in the search bar and then all the topics containing that keyword will be highlighted. I know you must know that, but just in case I have to tell you that too. Besides these topics, many other members have mentioned some good thread like the Electrum's threads, Most people have mentioned that wallets, because that's open source but keep in mind that Electrum is only for BTC, you can not send or receive any other coin or token on that wallet. I hope you will enjoy your time here and learn new things. For a newbie, in start, it is hard to set up a wallet, but if you come to decide which wallet you are going to use then you should watch a video on YT before experimenting something.",

Reviews and the number of downloads displayed on Playstore and Appstore are not a sign that Trust Wallet is a good wallet for storing coins and tokens. The category of a wallet that is good to use is based on how safe the wallet is when used. The address for receiving and sending coins or tokens obtained in a wallet has a phrase or key. The password or key is very private — no one else should know. That privacy is only available in open source wallets.Open source and closed source wallets have many differences including the issue of possible access to the seed transaction or keys held by the owner of the coins and tokens.I always avoid using closed source wallets like Trust wallet and always pay attention to open source wallets for storing assets.To store coins of more than one type, I use an unstoppable wallet.",
