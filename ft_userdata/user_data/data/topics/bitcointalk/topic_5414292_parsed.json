Enough of all these, when are you going to wise up to wake up from your slumber, thousands of people have been calling themselves faketoshi and if you're coming here to tell us about some concuction stories for the gods here regarding wjat you don't know about bitcoin than listening to every piece of trash calling themselves Satoshi, then i think you Rishi Sunak should take position behind thousands of people that have said so in the past, enough of faketoshi theorem.",

Â There is nothing to do between Rishi and Satoshi, there is no proof that Rishi was doing something the same as Satoshi did. Having family members who are experts on computers, doesn't mean probably having the same thoughts as Satoshi. It's not just about expertise in computers or coding, but how someone has a big vision of the world's financial system. As long as you cannot prove to us that Rishi ever stated an idea about digital money for the future era, claiming Rishi as a Satoshi is a too wild idea.",

Op i will like to get you clear did satoshi ever mentioned to anyone he studied in California before he went anonymous? Or is there a documentary about Satoshi Moving to UK and becoming a chancellor the world never knew?. It's high time we bring an end to this search for who Satoshi really is and focus more on contributing our quota to seeing the p2p idea gets more adoptionFeeding the public with some bunch of irrelevant information about the true identity of a selfless fellow who chose to remain forever anonymous will only cause some FUD in the minds of new bitcoin converts. Any one can code in C++ and anyone can have a family of programmers. Satoshi Nakamoto only exists in the Bitcoin we hodl spend and trade nothing more",
