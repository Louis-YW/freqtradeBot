You don't buy the things you want to or don't go after experiences you want because you'd rather save/invest for future instead.  In as much as saving is good it doesn't warrant you not having/living a good live. I mean you have to live for the present before the future if you're not alive today how can you then live in the future your investing/or saving for, one can not always invest in every circumstances or event you have to always get the essential needs. That you have to spend on yourself or take care of yourself does not mean spending unnecessarily or living a luxurious/or extravagant life. Additionally, what is the future? Your future is your next minute not even exactly what we in our subjective reality see it to be, every minute of our live that we do not know or can not predict is a future because years or months before today you called today a future so live your live now because you don't know tomorrow. This is a popular saying that \"Nobody knows tomorrow\" so why suffer so much when you have it already just for the fact that you wanna save for aÂ  future! Nah!. Invest but don't die while investing. In my country there is what is popularly known as \"next of kin\" this does not just mean the normal next of kin but there is an extraordinary meaning attached to it, if you don't spend or take of yourself today (present life) one next of kin who do not know how you suffered to make this money or investments will spend it all when you're no more. So be wise and not be over conscious of the future.",

      "body": "over a decade ago. (pre bitcoin) i was frugal but my mindset was that my \"wants\" were NEEDS. like i needed certain entertainment TV packages for movies and tv series. i needed to enjoy fast food as its more convenient then self cooking, i needed to go to the gym, sports clubs and night time activities, i needed X time off for vacations.. nothing was a want, everything felt as a needthen i got into bitcoin, and decade later im set, retired early and have no money worriesthat said, im still frugal. where i dont see \"needs\" i just see wants. and now i question those wants and realise i dont need. it can feel good to walk into a restaurant and know you can afford anything on the menu but buy the basic meal.. it can feel good to walk into thrift/charity store knowing you could afford the whole stores produce at their original unused retail rate, but you are buying the same thing second hand (i also do new retail price.. but i do enjoy frugalness too)it can feel good to walk into a car dealership knowing you can buy their newest model full price, but then asking about their ex-display/ex-owned/trade-insjust knowing i can doesnt mean i shouldi still travel and enjoy experiences but i just dont have the \"need\" weight on my shoulder. and i realise how wasteful my \"wants\" weresome times the knowing i can but not needing too is a positive experience more so then going ahead and buying the luxury to fill a emotional hole some people havei still spend, dont get me wrong. but my habits remain frugal and i still invest, and i do question my purchases even if i dont have tobest advice is. look for things in life that make you happy. then do them. knowing your investments are also happening side by side so you get to look after yourself now and in the futurethere is nothing wrong with being frugal about wasteful spending,, if you then spend on the things you really enjoy too",

I suppose that sometimes I feel that way, however when looking at the things I wanted to buy at the time I get to see that my decision to not buy those products was in fact the right decision most of the time.Every single day we are bombarded with ads trying to make us spend more money than what we can afford, and while it is necessary to spend some money now in order to fulfill our needs and wants, being able to think about the future and suppress those feelings has helped me tremendously, as when I compare myself with my friends and other people my age I am in a great position, and this will only improve even more once the price of bitcoin goes up even further.",

The worst thing that sometimes happen to people is when they \"live to make money instead of making money to live\".Quote from: libert19 on November 18, 2023, 03:41:54 AMYou don't buy the things you want to or don't go after experiences you want because you'd rather save/invest for future instead. It is not a bad thing to want to save or invest your money for the future as long as you have a clear plan not just saving money forever. For example you could be planning on working hard and saving money for 5 years to reach your big goals then from that point you loosen up and start spending more. But if you save money for 5 years then continue not spending anything and invest more and save more, you'd be wasting your life.Besides, Franky had some good points on this. In a lot of cases people are too lost in consumerism that they think they need something but they really don't.",

You don't buy the things you want to or don't go after experiences you want because you'd rather save/invest for future instead. Stability is needed so that we don't get too carried away by future ambitions, forgetting that the days passed must also be taken into account properly. Meeting all your needs from time to time is not easy. People who are successful in saving and enjoying the sweetness of investment can always limit which ones need to be prioritized and which ones can be paused for long-term savings. I myself still feel that this method is very difficult to face all possibilities when I don't have anything and am looking at savings. It comes to the point where bitter decisions have to be taken and the dreams of future investment are erased.",

You don't buy the things you want to or don't go after experiences you want because you'd rather save/invest for future instead. The future is now and you can only think of future when you survive the present. The future belongs to those who survive the present by taking good care of their parents and make themselves happy with things they want. At young age, we say that we are saving for the future, at our youth age, we still save for future and even in our old age, we are still saving for the future. Can we now see that the future is not ending and the reality is that we are saving for next generation or next of kin. I believe in saving of course but the truth is, there is no any future better than now and you should enjoy it to the fullest.Quote from: Helena Yu on November 18, 2023, 06:11:19 AMInclude me to be one of them, but I'm not someone who always save every penny I earn.Mostly I cook by myself because it's cheaper, than buy a cooked food.

There's no much difference if you should consider the time and effort you applied in the kitchen. I do also cook by myself and not because I want to save but because I want to have a test I prefer. I can not suffer myself with stress and low life style just because I want to save for unending future. I will enjoy every bit of the moment while I also save the savable and life goes on.",

If not separated, I believe there will be a distinction between timelines, but it has clearly been programmed since we were born. But the preparation that we envision for a future scenario and maybe a more economical spending plan has been discussed, and we have accepted it to achieve the goal of the plan. But imo, most of us are confused about the present and then confused about future life, so there are many things that are not started or missed.",

Yes, investing is important as it can be the best way to secure each individual's well-being and can make your life up for long-term stability. Disregarding the things you want to buy for a few years long focusing on investing is just a small sacrifice to achieve this goal. A kind of life without thinking of where you can get the money for your expenses, be financially secure, and enjoy a life that's free of debt. I guess, that's what everyone wants to happen.",

I see a lot of people falling into this situation, especially bitcoin investors. They even cut back on daily spending, torturing themselves just to have more money to accumulate more bitcoins. For me, I don't like that plan or that lifestyle, I prefer to balance my life rather than focusing too much on the future and forgetting the present. Because the present is also the future of the past, and if we keep thinking about the future and ignore the present, we will live frugally until we die without enjoying any of the results we have created.",
