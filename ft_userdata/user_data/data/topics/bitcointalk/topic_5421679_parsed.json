Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX are very good examples on how trust can fall to zero in a short time.Quote from: GreatArkansas on November 17, 2022, 03:37:09 AMIt's really difficult to gain trust after what happened with FTX Exchange now.

In paper, go bankruptcy with Chapter 11 is not the end of FTX and customers likely won't lose all their capitals. But how much will they be compensated is still unknown and how FTX can come back is very vague.",

Look at which companies he invested in before the advent of cryptocurrencies.They won't give money to a junkie in shorts with hairy legs",

Once you've lost customer/community trust, i am afraid there is no way to regain it, and Sam Bankman-Fried already lost every atom of faith and trust people in the crypto network have for him, remember that they didn't only go insolvent, but they were also hacked, no responsible business is going to put their money in a bid to rescue the dead exchange. SBF may try all he likes, but it is definitely going to be fruitless, and i can see him facing legal charges sooner rather than later, just like Do Kwon.",

I meant he bet for investors to help him but he doesn't even care about the money got hacked a few days ago from FTX global. that being said that if this scenario already prepared by him. He may securing remaining amounts of money and called that as a hacking incident. He was writing all of scenario for sure. SBF must be jailed as he was the true evil in the crypto. I do believe if there will be a relationship with the hacked case that happened a few days ago. If investors gave him that big amounts of money to help FTX and im sure that he will be sending it again to the caroline. Called FTX and alameda was separated but both were having very close connection. Any token invested by alamda listed on FTX instantly. What a joke from SBF. That guy was a clown.",

Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX are very good examples on how trust can fall to zero in a short time.It takes some time for the client to know the truth behind the activity of SBF.  CZ was ready to take over the FTX since he trust that there are no irregularities that are happening in the exchange but when they look in depth of the exchange, they discovered all the mismanagement that made the exchange bankrupt, the reason why they back off at the last minute.",

Alameda just approve the loan of SBF worth $1B, if that company still trust SBF or this is just a return of favor, we’ll find out.
