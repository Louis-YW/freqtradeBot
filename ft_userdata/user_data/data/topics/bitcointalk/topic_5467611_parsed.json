Oyibo people dey hustle pass us? Abi na our money way no get value dey cuz us the unforward ness?Cuz I observe most of these oyibo(s) say them dey archive great thing's and living a comfortable life with lesser stresses unlike us for 9ja.Then I observe say no be really by how much got paid or hard harder working but the caused of responsibility costs.With the facts of observations and my research, once u start dey hustle as an oyibo, u hustle on ur own and u owe no one responsibilities of bills bcuz every 1 dey ok &  contented with themselves without living to hope say anyone go take charge of their bills for them where family and relatives takes their financial responsibilities upon themselves.I am sure this situation alone go allow person plan himself as him want.Com to Africa, our 9ja in question, we dey papa house marry, bear kids and grand Pa takes all responsibilities.How him want take establish or make increments in his income?Pikin or person go dey in position of earning attractive amount of money, na so u go see responsibilities spreaded from the East, West, North and the South for u.No just space for savings in order to establish and reach to a dream.By this, I find out say responsibilities dey play a major role in our societies when we considers about forward ness.Imagine this>>>Papa/mama in need, brothers/sisters in need, uncle's/aunty's in need, cousins in need, nephews/nieces in need,  relationship in need, friends in need other relatives and unknown are in need.With this situation, how him want take plan himself?The possibilities of the way forward to progression here would be extremely challenging unless you have to Play an ignorant across but is getting ignored a solution? Of course not but calling upon them when you learns about any means to empowerment, do get them empowered for stress eases else it lingers as long na 9ja we dey but otherwise u owe no  one nothing.We can also minimize responsibilities by :*Having a child's plan before putting to birth such as your readiness to have a child (s) and number of childs better fits for you to take care of.*Elimination of unnecessary friends and relationships *Delegate action(s) to others *Avoidance of of unredeemable promises and *Conciousness of liabilities*Ability to withstand pleasures.",

The things wey no dey work out so na because of the way the country dey structured and Africa at large. Nigeria get a dependent family system and na that one be the thing. For oyibo land, the government plan certain support system for young and old and infact most people dey get different types of sustainable benefit from government, I know no how many of us here dey get something from government. Na every family by its own.Solution na make the person wey don rise for the family try to establish others so that them no go continue climbing on his shoulder because if that shoulder go dislocate, the family don go back to square one and that one no good, make person dey chop on top table and later shift enter for floor no good. So apart from say government no dey try, we self go try support people in the family to grow no be to dey give them fish but to teach them how to fish.",

Sir eehh.... U know say some of us dey get opportunities to success but we dey lost dem by unseriousness or by lack of planing strategies? Na equivalent to my point here where someone go dey overloaded with necessary & unnecessary responsibilities.Even if da oyibo man for the documentary u talk about, him responsibilities as a big earner even dey few.Imagine me way no get shishi like this, papa, mama, families, relatives and friends dey look up on me for financial resolutions so... If a dime comes to me, instead of a minimum responsibility way supposed give me breathing planning, I go just returning back to my extravagant responsibilities.I go rest my case by saying.... Responding to an extravagant responsibilities in 9ja don bcom a necessity inheritance. E just be like u carry overload for back struggling to Waka while oyibo people responsibilities dey minimal but all the same, I stil point at the \"economy\" & \"government\" way no send for the masses bcos if e beta 4 all, no 1 go look upon others for assistance on what u fit do for urself.",

Imagine were you're the only big man in your family and maybe you have brothers and sisters, relatives and well wishers who are looking to you instead of you to \"teach them how to fish you will prefer to give them the fish\".It is very sad how majority of us that are successful don't want to carry others along with the mentality that if you do that they might be better than you tomorrow. The reason why the westerners are more successful than us is because they don't hide their knowledge they make sure that what they know the next person also knows it. Imagine were everyone is doing what you do and you all are successful, who is gonna worry who? No body but instead of impacting what we know to the next person we will prefer to be like Oba (king) to them. We want everyone to always come to us for financial help. And as you keep helping people financially that is how your financial power is reducing but if people know what you know the financial burden will reduce and everyone will take care of themselves thereby giving to liberty to invest on more important things that will aid your growth.",

Secondly, na we be the problem to ourselves, because if you know say your family background dey poor and everyone dey rely on you, you go know the kind of life to live with the economy situation. Wetin I mean be say know the kind friends wey you dey keep, make e no be the friends wey dey like flex all the time, if not them go make you dey spend too much. Then when it comes to your family, attend to the important problem and leave the rest because, even though you be billionaire, you no go fit solve all your family problem finish as more problems to dey come.",

Due to how the country economy dey. Why family man go work from morning till night and no quality pay, na why anybody wey dey depend on only monthly salary dey find am very difficult to survive for this hard time. When salary come only feeding don finish salary, check the price of bag of rice for market now na 50,000, one liter of fuel na #600 something wey people be dey buy #80 before. But things no cost for that side like naija One thing I observe for naija anyhow you earn big monthly if you no get wetin to support your salary your money go still finish. Just like wetin you talk papa/mama in need, brothers/sisters in need, I no blame them ohh. And I don see situation wey papa, mama, brother, sister no disturb but money still finish because of the poor economy. Na why empowerment good for society ooh. If at least some few people fit get empowerment or acquire different skills that one go better.

For oyibo land, when I child graduate from school, their parents either open business or company for them to manage and fetch money for themselves but here in our country, most especially all these our big men will not allow their children to do anything at all they will provide everything their children require without teaching them how to make money as well that's why when most of this big men dies, their business crumble because their children has no idea of how to manage their businesses, some of the children might even sell of their parents properties because they don't know the worth and value before you know it they start suffering during the long run.Another factor is hoarding knowledge, this one our people are very good at hiding their knowledge from others instead spreading their knowledge across they hide it and when they die, they die with their knowledge without transferring it to another person.",

      "body": "OP, you try well well for this your topic, one person no dey know everything and thats why topics dey up for discussion and contribution in this prestigious forum.firstly, I support the notion say lack of structure don totally harm our country no be small and this na the thing wey dey make billing increase for people wey dey see small lavida for their hustle as compared to some more structured country. things like retirement plan for the aged wey dey take billling of old people off the shoulders off their children, and even elderly care homes that are sponsored by the government in advanced countries like US.https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/04/02/caregiving-elderly-white-house-infrastructure/.some public schools in structured countries provide totally free education for under-privileged children whom cannot afford to pay tuition fees and they are still standard and supervised. Unlike down here where free education will be proclaimed, and the students are left to pay exam fees and toiletries because the government does not provide these to the schools, and they are as good as abandoned to the mercy of some lazy teachers. These students are extorted until almost the same cost of fees are taken from their parents with sometimes little or no value added. when it comes to hustle, the government wey dey structured countries dey create favorable policies to encourage startups and entrepreneurs to help boost the economy and encourage people with great ideas with the required boost in their endeavors. the UK government just increased their budget for that and targets more projects to benefit.   https://www.gov.uk/government/news/40m-boost-for-cutting-edge-start-ups.for our own country, na just to dey campaign loans up and down and still people no get access to it. the grants that are available na private individuals like Tony Elumelu dey give am and the thing no go fit reach person wey no go school hand cos na so many stages dey involved and the competition high. most of those loans na still them staffs dey collect am cos them know say them no go pay for am. If you start a business, na soso tax you go pay fear life with little or no support from the government.As for the hustle part, them Oyinbo them no dey hustle pass us, them just get favorable environment for the hustle pass us. like their own hustle dey fall on loamy soil, while our own dey fall for rocky ground. you go see for yourself as the government don make their matter stew small come comot most billing for their head, them go dey more focused to dey hustle dey bring better Ideas to dey make more money with free mind. No be like us wey you go want concentrate do better thing, na then calls go come from home say one problem or the other dey, you go come leave wetin you dey focus on come begin solve family own first before falling back to yours.",

It is no longer news that Nigeria is now the poverty headquarters of the world owing to failure in leadership. So, the reason why our there are no much progress both in the country and the lives of the citizens is failure of leadership in part and poor orientation of the citizens in the other vein. Of a truth, Nigerians are trying but most of our effort only amount to self sustenance struggles... we hardly think about making it big from the onset. Check farmers, traders and what have you; just to eat and stay alive is the main focusThis is a major problem that is partly responsible for the average life that is prevalent in Nigeria.",
