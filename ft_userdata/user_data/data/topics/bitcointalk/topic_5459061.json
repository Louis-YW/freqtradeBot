I will have to choose investing in Bitcoin over luxury. This is because I understand the Bitcoin market better and know how the profit can be calculated. But that of the luxury watch, for which I believe the price tag might depreciate or reduce and whose value is highly dependent on either the price of material used for the making or the power that the brand holds in society and the hype it gets from the market, for the main time the luxury watch will be considered very expensive because of the hype that's it's gotten in the market, but we also have to consider what will happen next if their competitors have to take over the market with a more trending product, the outcome will be a decrease in price, and the case won't be any different from what was experienced in the time of NFT hype.",

If all my money is in bitcoins, if I need money when the market is bad then I might end up losing.I will divide my asset ownership in 3 sectors. The first is a sector that has high stability but is resistant to inflation, for this category I choose gold. Both of these sectors have low risk, maybe I will choose blue chip stocks. The three high-risk sectors are definitely bitcoin.If my finances are good, I will buy more bitcoins so that in the future I can make big profits. But if my finances are less stable then I will keep a relatively small amount of bitcoins. As for watches, I don't really like them, let alone call them assets",

It’s simple I would prefer to invest in something I have substantial knowledge and experience on. The issue with investment most at times is people tend to invest in what they do not have knowledge about even if that business is lucrative, without proper knowledge it will not yield the desired profits. Bitcoin which is my pick is easier is to understand and doesn’t need middle man in terms of purchase and selling. It is also a future asset that has the ability to grow in future",

I have never owned a luxury watch and have never heard of an investment in a watch that would yield a higher return than an investment in stocks, gold, or real estate. In my opinion, watches are just man-made products, we can create as many as we want, how can it be considered a better investment than gold or real estate? Since I don't know about it, I wouldn't choose it instead, bitcoin is the choice because its profit potential outweighs all, despite the greater risk involved.",

It all depends on what the watch is made up of, if it's a gold watch then it may be a little bit considered as long as it have a second hand value, but i want to prefer bitcoin investment over a luxury watch because bitcoin investment has a way of holding it in a more secured way and can give more of privacy than watch, if you're the type that has passion for fashion, using a watch may be good enough but once people detect that it's an expensive type that could worth a million.People may try to physically attack you and take that away from you, also it yield on profitabilities cannot be compared to bitcoin, watch or any golden material may only retain a value with little addition of profits unlike bitcoin that can make huge amount of profits over it's investment.",

I mean, someone who has a couple dozen bitcoins accumulated and buys a couple of watches to diversify, but if you are in Bitcoin accumulation phase I don't see the point of wanting to buy expensive watches. Yes, it's a bit of a strange question considering where we are, but if you look at this board or Bitcoin discussion you will surely notice such questions, whether it is a comparison to gold, real estate or stocks. The problem (if we're going to call it that) is that most people see Bitcoin only as a means to achieve the goal (as much profit as possible), and very rarely as a currency that allows them to make transactions without intermediation anytime and anywhere every day.Even when we talk about luxury watches in the form of investment, I think that such watches are generally no match for investing in Bitcoin in terms of profit even if we just go back less than 1 year in the past. It is true that luxury watches are similar to gold and we will not lose 10% or more of their value overnight, but we will also not be able to count on earning 100% or significantly more in a very short period of time.Another important thing (at least for me) is that such watches are something that requires special storage in protection against possible theft, and we can be sure that every thief is looking for just such values, and that they will steal such a watch rather than a piece of paper on which someone wrote their seed.",

If you use $100k to invest in bitcoin and hold on your investment for 8 years,and but luxury watches with the same amount of money and keep it for 8 years,mate you will make 10x profit in bitcoin compare to what the luxury watch will earn you. Bitcoin is a store of value and bitcoin halving makes it more superb but that luxury watch isn't. The watches must be made of gold and diamond or else forget it because it will depreciate in value",

I do not know watches so I won't go for it for now.Investing in Bitcoin has been my choice for a long time because we can control how much money we can afford to invest. And even though the price of Bitcoin will still fluctuate, I think it's okay because the price of Bitcoin has the opportunity to increase greatly in the future. And that is why many people also choose to invest in Bitcoin because the return on investment can increase many times.And I'm also not very interested in luxury goods because that could invite bad people to rob it.
