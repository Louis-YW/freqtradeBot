  "content": "What happened:: I registered on their site 18.06, I've made deposit of 10mBTC and placed it on various pre-match events. I made second deposit of 12mBTC same day, I was live betting for rest of the day. So by betting on 5 events CS:GO and football (all live singles) I managed to end the day with a balance of 50.69mBTCI decided to withdraw 30.69mBTC, and leave 20mBTC for futher playing there. I woke up next day and I saw that withdrawal did not come nor I could not log into my account. I contacted live support then, what is up with my account, they told me to write mail to their \"security team\".Within a few hours, I received an email with information that terrified me. Their team decided to end their relationship with me and close my account without giving me any reason or possibility to withdraw my funds. UPDATE while writing this: It seems that I can log into my account again, they refunded all my bets and I have only deposit amount of my account.So basically they stole 28.69mBTC, everything I made over this day they decided to not pay me out, I bet on 7 events at all and every bet got refunded, I did not use any software or I did not abuse any bug with odds, most of bets were live-bets based on what I saw watching cs:go matches.Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2835882Reference Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5267172.0Amount Scammed: 50.69mBTC 28.69mBTCPayment Method: BTCProof of Payment: https://i.imgur.com/oDaBhp7.pngPM/Chat Logs: https://i.imgur.com/PYy49fN.pngAdditional Notes: https://i.imgur.com/8DH2A0q.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/nVjoAld.png",

If you knew all this why did you play at that scam site? Any particular reason?There are so many other good gambling sites to deposit and play but you choose the scammed one",

This scam casino platform has had a bad reputation for years, and it has a red flag, I don't know why it hasn't stopped until today. And why is it attractive to players despite the spread of so many accusations of scam around it? There are many famous and reputable casino platforms here, so before depositing your funds on any casino platform, you should do your research and watch the ratings and reviews of the players about it, so as not to lose your money and waste your time in vain.",

If you're not sure of your research you can simply create a thread in gambling board and askk your question there about any casino and those with experience will give you the appropriate answer, don't just go around clicking on any casino jsut because of the welcome bonuses you get.Now that you've gotten your initial deposit the best thing to do is to withdraw( if you haven't already) and delete your account permanently (if it's allowed) and look for a more reputable casino to continue your gambing activity. We have so many that you can choose from in this forum with active representatives.",

Even though, they are now proven to be a scam, they're still getting new gamblers on their site and then freezing their accounts. The is no point in accusing a scam site that everyone knows is a scam, and those casino people doesn't even care if someone calls them frauds. There are still people who are promoting the casino only to earn some revenue from their signature campaign. I recommend you to stay away from that site and never put your money on their platform because they can freeze withdrawals anytime.",
