It was same for me however I had to learn it the hard way. Explore the topic The BCT PGP/GPG Public Key Database: Stake Your PGP Key Here to understand why you need to know it. If you are an Electrum wallet user then I am pretty sure you have seen a signature link next to the installation file. You also seen a warning notification on the top which talks about a fake copy of Electrum.Long story short, PGP gives you extensive privacy and you can easily validate the authentic source of your received file/text. In this tutorial we will learn...# How to create PGP Signed message and signature# How to verify a PGP Signed message and signature# How to encrypt a message# How to decrypt a messageOnce you get a good grip of these 4 basics, I believe you will be able to grab the rest without having any further assistance. A Better UnderstandingGo to topBefore we start, it's gonna help you if I give you a brief. PGP consist of two Keys...1. Private key &lt;=== You need it to decrypt a content1. a) You also need a passphrase, in other words a strong password.2. Public key &lt;=== You need it to encrypt a contentThink about a very sensitive message you want to email to your friend. You don't want any gov agency or any spy read the message. These people can easily access your email server. To avoid it, ask you friend to give his PGP public key. Once you have it then encrypt the message and email the encrypted message to your friend. Now only your friend can decrypt it because he knows the private key.Warning: Do not share your private key and passphrase with anyone. Getting StartedGo to topDownload and Installation Go to top You will need Kleopatra desktop application. Click here and download gpg4win-3.1.1.exe (this is the current version, you might find the same or a different version but don't mind, whatever the version they will have on their server, it will be downloaded). Once download done, go ahead and install the application (I assume, you know basics of installing an application). Once installation done, you will be seeing Kleopatra icon on your desktop.Create Your First Private and Public Keys Go to top1.

I am happy that I was good enough to understand the translation in English. TryNinja: Provided some URLs which cleared my head to understand better. hugeblack: Suggested the idea of adding some example PGP Public Keys. All the members who were leaving their PGP PUBLIC KEYs all around the forum. Seeing these encrypted codes were interesting for me and finally I decided to investigate what was it all about.

I don't think I could organize the thread the way the previous thread creator did the job. Since the tutorial is already available and the UI did not change much, I just fixed the images here. But as you and others suggested, I was trying to switch to another OS just for this PGP Tutorial purpose, and I destroyed my Windows OS by mistake. I am currently setting my Debian 12 OS and I am already having some difficulties. I will develop a short, basic tutorial on PGP encryption/decryption for Linux users. But I am unsure if I should create a new thread or post it here as a reply. If I post as a reply, I think it won't get many views.",

I hope everything will be fine, and I guess it's my end with Windows! I am already having some difficulties with Linux as I am a new user. I once experienced something like what you experienced when I was just learning computers (I remember using Windows 98). Because the hard disk capacity was starting to fill up, I deleted several Windows OS files, which turned out to be system files from the OS, and the result was that the OS became corrupt. However, I can learn from this experience.Instead of using dual boot by dividing partitions, why don't you first try using a virtual machine such as a virtual box or others to test specific operating systems, including PGP Signature on different OS?I use MacOS as the primary OS. I run other OS using a virtual machine for testing PGP Signature or another application.",

I run other OS using a virtual machine for testing PGP Signature or another application.Well, I didn't realize I am this much bad at setting up OS. I thought it wouldn't be that hard to set up OS in dual boot as I already shrank enough space for the Debian 12. I always get a suggestion from time to time to switch to Linux. So, I wanted to migrate there but I wanted to keep the Windows OS as well. A virtual machine could have been a good option, but I don't know why I didn't try a virtual machine first. I had some weird experience setting up the OS. I have two SSDs installed and I installed the Debian 12 on my 240 GB storage. For some reason, if I unplug my other SSD which is 500 GB, the OS does not boot. This is weird. So, I removed that SSD again and installed Windows again. Now I am setting up the Debian 12 again. I hope everything will be fine after this attempt.",
