You don't need to wear the copper membership, just own it. You can also be whitelisted for free by any staff member and a few non-staff, but we're going to need some reason to think that you actually deserve it. Do not ask me for free whitelisting.Whitelisting is a not a license to spam. You will be immediately banned if you're found spamming, even if you bought a copper membership (and you will not be refunded).",

I think the whole pm message limit is fixed to every rank as I believe lower rank members won't be able to send more than the number you have already sent and I believe if your rank was higher then the case would  have different.",

From what I can see above theymos only used “activity” and if what I’m thinking is correct then it means that even if you’re a member and you have up to 500 activities then you should be able to send up to 30 recipients at once.And the Op falls under the 250 activities and that’s why they could not send to more than 15 people at once.",

If they agree to do so - then you will get 2x more quota as mentioned in the table without requiring you to buy a copper member.But it all depends on your needs - but I don't know what reason you have to send PMs to more than 15 users if you're not a campaign manager or something. Remember well - sending unsolicited PMs to certain users may result in you being temporarily banned, so don't do anything random.",

I never knew there were some special other offers that came with it; no wonder some people on the legendary rank also have copper membership enabled on them. I have never tried sending more than 2 members before in this forum; that's why I have not noticed the limit on them. I was always taught the limit was just on the newbies not being able to send PMs to higher ranks unless they enabled it.",

I am not sure there is any special or direct line to be whitelisted a second time or third time.",
