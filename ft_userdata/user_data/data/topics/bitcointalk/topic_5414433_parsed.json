  "content": "So today I order a s19 at 2:32 pm pay at 2:46 pmand it takes till 3:38 pm to clear.So bitmain has my $2080 and has order marked expired.Annoying they expire the order in 1 hour I know they usually fix this over night and sometimes I have to refer them to a thread to get it fixed.order done at 2:32PM clear time is posted as 3:46pmcoin set at 2:46 pmIt is particularly annoying for the 1 hour cancel time since we all know clearing a pay may take a bit of time.I will post a complaint to them and link them to this thread.hoping to see it fixed soon BTW this is a decent price on the gear.They just fixed it. locking thread",

That's a pretty bad habit for sellers to reject the transaction when the price drops a bit. Why not, contact them directly on their support or through email support-cs@bitmain.comBitmain only has 30 minutes Payment time limit it must be clear within 30 minutes.Recently mempool is pretty congested why didn't you increase the fee to speed up the transaction?",

I sent it 14 minutes after they billed me.I expect them to fix it over night as it is about 740 am in china and they likely are all automated right now.I have clear evidence I sent them the coin before time expired. It is annoying that this happens as the time they give is too short and they should see that it was pending on the blockchain.also i pay with coinbaseas i run a business account and report everything coinbase just sends it.looks like it took 3 blocks or maybe four to clear.I ordered at 2:32I paid at 2:46755125Mined on 9/21/2022, 15:01:12View all Blocks755126Mined on 9/21/2022, 15:26:16View all Blocks755127Mined on 9/21/2022, 15:37:18View all Blocks755128mined on 9/21/2022, 15:37:51View all Blocks755129Mined on 9/21/2022, 15:38:44View all BlockI think the bolded one is when it clearedall numbers are from https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/755124to block it cleared.I will wait to see if they fix it.
