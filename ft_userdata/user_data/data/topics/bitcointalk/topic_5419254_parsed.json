You can change your vote, of course only up until the contest ends.  IMPORTANT NOTES:Once the 7 days is up, the voting will end, but the final results will possibly not be the actual tallies/winners until Theymos comes in and implements a few things to make the voting more fair.  Those things are, as stated by Theymos..“ 1) only Member+ votes will count, where copper membership does not on its own count as Member; and 2) users who haven't made a post in the year between the time of this post and 1 year ago will not be counted\". In the unlikely case of a tie, we'll run another poll which will be set to run for 3 days. No manipulation of any kind allowed. If I see you trying to manipulate the votes in any way, I reserve the right to disqualify you. Please no alt-accounts, no begging for votes etc.   Lastly, and most importantly..guys, lets have fun with this. It's not perfect, and never will be. First year doing this, I'll learn from the mistakes I made for next year, if we decide to do it again.  Contest Two https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5419367.0",

Edit: I'm chatting with Theymos about this real quick before I move forward. I'm going to find out if there's a way to add a second poll in this thread, if not, I'll be opening a new thread.  So for contest number 2 be patient please, I'll either be posting it in here, or in a new thread before long.(A big thanks to Theymos/Cyrus and everyone else who helped out along the way!!!!)",

I will remove sorryfor 's photo as soon as I learn how without messing up the code as I just did a moment ago (and ask no one vote for them), but them being in there isn't going to make a difference.  I can't remove them from the poll as it can't be edited, but again, it's not going to make a difference in the end even though as whomever actually did create it did a good job, it's not going to be in the running with so many other more detailed ones that have been created by members here, lets be honest).  Secondly, the rules are the rules and were stated before I even opened this poll up.  Unfortunately some wont be able to vote on theirs and others more senior members will.  This single vote is not going to make a difference in the end I'm confident of that.  Also If I disallow candidates from voting then that means more work for Theymos as well as a published list of who voted for which pumpkin, and I think most of us would prefer this remain anonymous.  Next year I'll keep this in mind but I'm not going to change the rules at this point.  Again, I'm doing this for fun, everything has been donated, this is free for contestants, and as I said before being my first time, it's not going to be perfect.",

I think they should be excluded because not all of them meet the voting requirements, It don't matter if the candidate chooses him, it's the same as the election for president and other regional heads. They have the right to vote as long as they meet the requirements, all who have participated in the Pumpkin Carving Contest have the right to make choices for their efforts.Quote from: _morghulis on November 03, 2022, 05:20:45 AMsome candidates are still newbies and Jr member and according to the rule only member+ can vote. Which rule do you mean, I can't find any rule in Thread 🎃 [ANN] Bitcointalk Bitcoin Pumpkin Carving Contest 🎃 about who is eligible to vote and who is excluded, there I only found this.QuoteHow will the winner be picked?: There will be a poll ran from Oct 31st to Nov 3rd.  I'm not 100% sure how I will run it, but will try and get some feedback from the community on how to most fairly do so.  Please chime in if you have any ideas! Op is very open to running the vote, if you have any ideas on the fairest way to do it can leave feedback here.",
