  "content": "Qatar spent over $200 billion preparing to host the FIFA 2022 world cup. They spent that money on constructing roads, airports, public spaces, stadiums, gas stations, and more. They constructed seven new stadiums and renovated one to make it eight stadiums for the world cup. The cost of building these stadiums has been estimated to be $6.5 billion. They spent $36 billion to construct the Doha metro, and for the Pearl accommodation complex, they spent $15 billion.While FIFA takes home most of the profit generated from TV rights, ticket sales, and sponsorship deals, it is estimated that FIFA will make $17 billion from the tournament. There will most likely be an oversupply of some of the infrastructure, especially in real estate. It won't be the first time though. The Maracanã stadium in Brazil was abandoned after the 2014 world cup. 1.5 million people were in Qatar for the tournament but as stated earlier, 100% of the ticket sales go straight to FIFA’s coffer. About $4.6 billion was made from broadcasting and marketing rights and all of that goes to FIFA. During the tournament, FIFA covers most of the cost of running the world Cup but they pay about $1.7 billion to Qatar, the prize for teams that participated in the tournament is included in this money which is $440 million. Since there were 1.5 million visitors in the Gulf country for the tournament, there will be a positive cash flow in tourism sales for hotels and restaurants and an increase in the sales of souvenirs and other consumption in general. The increase in investment and consumption should increase the taxes in the Qatar state budget but with the enormous tax breaks agreed with FIFA and its sponsors Qatar will not make much from that either. The exact loss on tax revenue is impossible to ascertain. From November 1 till the end of the world cup, people without a match ticket were not allowed into Qatar, which means non-world cup tourists did not contribute to the GDP of Qatar through consumption. Other decisions were made that did not contribute to the cash flow. For example, from November 10th to December 23 the bus and metro access was free of charge for people with a Hayya card. This is a fan ID that allows ticket holders entry into Qatar and the stadiums. Putting these into perspective, we can say that the FIFA 2022 world cup is not profitable to Qatar. In the short term, where most of the cash flow goes to FIFA, it does not make financial sense for Qatar to host the world cup.On the other hand, for a country like Qatar, getting money from the world cup was never a goal for hosting the world cup, for obvious reasons. They're a small country with an abundance of money. They did all these based on the national vision 2030 plan. The plan includes improving the country's standard of living and its international relationsNot only does the vision 2030 plan include hosting the world cup and improving the standard of living while also improving international relations, but Qatar also plans to attract future sporting and cultural events. This is evident in the fact that Doha has been chosen as the host city of the 2030 Asian games. With the infrastructure they now have, they are in a pole position to bid to host other sporting competitions.Five out of the eight stadiums constructed for the world cup will either be dismantled or converted for alternative purposes.While for FIFA, short-term profit is a goal, the same cannot be said for about a country like Qatar. They can afford to shoulder the losses incurred from hosting a world cup.The fact that Qatar is not making financial profit from hosting the world cup, doesn't mean they have nothing to gain from itQatar's public debt will decline by 6.8% over the next four years. The infrastructural project will lead to positive cash flow in tourism, investment, consumption, employment, etc. The aim of all these is to reduce the over-dependency of Qatar on oil and gas. This will create new opportunities in other industries.According to experts, Qatar's GDP will rise by 4.1% by the end of 2022. And will increase by 3.2% from 2022 to 2030.Qatar's stock exchange (QSE) also increased up to 24% from the beginning of the year til mid-2022. Aside from the fact that Qatar spent an absurd $229 billion in preparation for the world cup, none of these is a big surprise. For a host country, a world cup is not solely about making money and profit but about pride, honor, and publicity, and Qatar has achieved that, especially publicity because they just hosted what is arguably the best world cup ever.",

Predictions in the run up to Qatar 2022 claimed that hosting the FIFA World Cup would bring in $17bn to the local economy.

      "body": "One of the positive impacts of hosting the world cup is that it promotes infrastructural development and tourism. Host nations usually ensure that there are adequate basic amenities that would be beneficial after the world cup. Another good part of hosting the world cup is that it promotes tourism which would attract foreign revenue and increase employment opportunities. It also introduces the host country to the world and can attract foreign investment.But hosting the world cup also has its negative effect. Sometimes in a bid to host the world cup, some nations borrow or take loans, like in the case of Brazil in 2014. These nations would have to service this debt with their meager resources. Some of these infrastructures that were built become a waste of resources after the world cup because they were not well-planned or situated. In the case of the $900m Estádio Nacional de Brasília Mané Garrincha in Brazil that now serves as a bus parking lot. It is also important to note that there is no significant relationship between hosting the world cup and economic growth. Hence, there is no guarantee that a host would economically benefit from the hosting of these games. Analysts unveiled that hosting the world cup had no long-term positive impact on the economy of both South Africa and Russia. Qatar might be different but it takes a lot of hard work to convert this short economic prosperity to a lasting one.",

But if we look at the wider economy, especially for Qatar itself, it is the promotion of the state of Qatar which is already very advanced to the outside world and according to a news source that I have read,that It really advances many medium term development projects that the country has and in many cases, many projects that would have been completed over a decade are already completed to showcase Qatar progressing during the World Cup, The World Cup advantage in QSE is expected to continue into next year as well, mainly from construction, real estate, tourism, and retail spending flowing to listed companies and the wider economy as a whole.\"Specifically, Qatar's goal is to use this event as a springboard to showcase its offerings, and hopefully increase international tourist arrivals from 2.1 million in 2019 to 6 million annually by 2030,\" said Saugata Sarkar, head of research at QNB Financial Services.

For example out of the total 3 million people in Qatar, about a million are from India and Bangladesh (that's 1/3 of the population).

However they have so much oil money it was simply a drop in the bucket, these huge stadiums will now no doubt go to waste or at least be heavily under utilized in future. Instead of putting this huge sum of money into something more productive like a sovereign wealth fund, they decided to fritter it away on a trophy project instead.",
