  "content": "The 8,888 NFTs that compose EightBit are produced by a variety of 8-bit-themed features. A PFP and a complete Digital EightBit Character are both contained in each NFT and are kept on IPFS. Each character has a website of their own, which will eventually feature more interactive features. This article explains the Eight Bit Index's rationale and how to buy it on the MEXC Exchange.EightBit.Me is an evolution of the original launch in 2010, when Addison Kowalski, one of the creators, created a few 8-bit profile images of his Digg coworkers. Amadeus Demarzi, the team's current coder, was asked to assist in the creation of a web-based generator that enables anyone to design their own 8-bit avatars. This suggestion was made by Courtney Guertin, the team member currently in charge of the Code. In the NFT sector, the team is now relaunching the project. Bit owners can also buy ancillary features like houses, Perks (free IRL bonuses decoded periodically), external Merch, and Loot to get extra Merch. How the EightBit NFT Index was madeEightBit is an assortment of 8,888 NFTs produced by a variety of 8-bit-themed qualities. There are uncommon clothing, things, and more surprises in the collection. 19 EightBit NFT is divided by MEXC into 19,000,000 NEIGHTBIT index tokens (1,000,000 NEIGHTBIT per NFT). The NEIGHTBIT index gives customers the chance to trade premium blue-chip NFTs at a reasonable price. A user may convert their index holdings into one of the 19 NEIGHTBIT NFTs if they control a significant enough portion of the index. MEXC will occasionally increase the collection in response to market demand, but MEXC's overall position will not be greater than 10%.How to Buy NEIGHTBIT NFT Index?The process of buying NFT Index is easy as trading crypto on in spot markets.
