Cypherock SSS implementation is actually BIP39 compatible. We thought of integrating SLIP39 but since it is not compatible with BIP39 wordlist, we decided against implementing it at this point. More details from Satoshi Labs here - https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md#user-content-bip39compatibilityThat being said, if ever Cypherock goes out of business, you can still export out your seed phrases from the X1 cards since these are industry standard EAL 5+ certified smartcards, with the NPC communication protocol compatible with all of the NFC enabled Android & IOS smartphones.QuoteI saw on your website that wallet is Open Source and code can be found on github, but is wallet firmware and everything else also open source?If you can confirm this I will add Cypherock X1 to my list of Open Source hardware wallets:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5288971.0Yes, Our Wallet Firmware & cySync desktop app are open sourced.

Not sure, about the fake miner software thing, since Cypherock was never in the business. We had definitely posted about it before but the product went through multiple iterations and changes before we finally launched it this year. Yes, we had a pre sale before but because of COVID19, the supply chains got disrupted and things slowed down on our end.Quote from: n0nce on November 23, 2022, 01:20:35 AMWalletScrutiny hasn't checked it out yet, but I hope with funding secured now, they will try it out.

As mentioned above, we are in touch with the wallet scrutiny team. It would be great if you can nudge them as well. Nonetheless, we are security audited by Keylabs, one of the security firms that hacked the Ledger wallet before. You can read more about it here - https://www.cypherock.com/keylabsAdditionally, The X1 Wallet's firmware OTA updates are done through the CySync app which stores the firmware package locally, the firmware part of these packages can be verified and compared with the release builds on the X1 Wallet repo: https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware/releases to check if it's authentic.The packet structure of the firmware package and communication method is also shared here: https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware/blob/main/docs/bootloader.mdThe user can also update the firmware manually using the process mentioned in the document, given the package contains valid header and signatures.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

The device is available at a discounted price of $100 for Black Friday sale. Updated the website and Code to remove any confusion. New Code: NOSEED75$100 makes it more competitive, for sure!My main complaint / critique with your concept of splitting the seed and having people store the cards in different location is, that it makes the everyday usage less convenient. This looks like a reasonably solid cold-storage setup for non-technical people, who could find it difficult to create and deploy a paper-based multisig setup.But for me, a hardware wallet is a convenient, yet secure (from software & hardware attacks) way to spend Bitcoin any day, anywhere. Of course, a 'hardware wallet' setup which stores the seed in multiple distributed locations, will be more secure, but it will be much less convenient when trying to spend. I'd personally probably just use it in single-sig mode (if possible) or store all the cards together to be able to use it quickly; although that would kill its main selling point.What I do not like at all is your shitcoin and centralized KYC exchange integration. Quote from: https://www.cypherock.com/featuresCySync app already supports 20 different payment methods through our partners onramper for you to directly buy Crypto in 15 different currencies directly on the app in case you already do not have Crypto.Quote from: https://knowledge.onramper.com/identificationOnramper does not save any KYC information. All user information is sent directly to the relevant partner that facilitates the transaction. As such, we cannot currently ensure that the same information and documentation can be re-used across various fiat onramps. We do have KYC re-use on our roadmap, but for later this year (Q3/Q4 2022).KYC data is not even saved by you or your provider, but actually by another service behind 'onramper', so I don't even know if users get to know where their data ended up and who to contact if they want it deleted.Quote from: https://www.cypherock.com/featuresYour X1 cards which stores your Crypto is never Upgradable and remains Cold at all times.Downside: someone discovers a hardware / firmware bug in the JavaCard and those cards will need to be replaced with new, secure cards, as there is no update mechanism to fix the issue (unlike Trezor and Ledger who fixed hardware attacks through firmware upgrades).Quote from: https://www.cypherock.com/featuresCypherock decentralizes your private keys to give you 10x more security.This is a little bit disingenuous..  Did you somehow multiply 2x5 (because of the 5 keys) to get to the conclusion that it's 10x safer? Safer than what? What's the benchmark? Throwing out a number like that to impress newbies is not very cool. You and I know that it's hard to quantify how much safer this setup will be, since you don't know how (well) people will deploy / store their 5 keys.",

You just need the X1 wallet and any 1 of the 4 X1 cards. If you are optimising for convenience, you can store an X1 wallet and X1 card together. If you want to optimize for security, just keep the X1 cards as geographically distributed as possible. Completely depends on the user. The UX difference with other hardware wallets is just that you additionally need to tap an X1 card to authorize a transaction.QuoteKYC data is not even saved by you or your provider, but actually by another service behind 'onramper', so I don't even know if users get to know where their data ended up and who to contact if they want it deleted.Onramp is optional for the users to use.

Currently, it has been battle-tested over a period of 1 year of internal beta testing as well. Yes, if it ever comes to that, the cards will need to be replaced. But the same thing could be argued for a bug in the bootloader and secure element of some of the most popular hardware wallets since even they are not upgradeable. With Cypherock, at least your funds are not at risk since the private keys as a whole are never stored completely in the Javacards.QuoteThis is a little bit disingenuous..

The fact that your seed/private keys do not have a single point of failure at rest where most of the attack vectors exist for current hardware wallets. Given decent geographical distribution of the cards, we may even argue that the security delta might be even higher. We considered an average here. I would say the security delta is even greater for Bitcoin multisig.",
