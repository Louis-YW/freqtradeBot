  "content": "Hey guys,What do you buy/want to buy with crypto? I myself buy services sometimes, and crypto miners.I've put a few options on the poll that I'm exploring, feel free to vote, but would love to hear your thoughts too.This post is actually inspired by one of my other posts on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinAUS/comments/wtqur1/what_do_you_buywant_to_buy_with_crypto/It's currently at 176 votes and 9.4k views. For more context, we've made a platform where people can buy and sell physical goods with crypto. We're currently trialling it as a private BETA in Melbourne, Australia, and now, we're looking to open our service up a bit more to the public. We'd love to hear from the community so we know what cool new products to add next!If you'd like to learn more, here's a link to our website: www.marketspaace.com (By the way, our site & socials will have a lot of updates in the coming weeks)",

Do stock assets.Hey man! Yes compliance & regulatory requirements is definitely a challenge, we actually partnered with a company who handles our payments (crypto and fiat) & legal obligations for us, since they already have licenses in several parts of the world. As for overseas shipments, not at the moment, but primarily because of logistical reasons. We want timely deliveries, so we only accept deliveries within Australia for now (it makes it easier to manage for the time being). What country are you from by the way? Oh yes agreed with the mining, we decided to take that off too, just need to update our site. The idea behind it was to promote the concept of \"spend from what you earn\", as in we wanted to introduce crypto mining onto our platform as one of the ways we help users earn, to then either cashout or use on our platform. We decided this was too complicated, so instead we'll be using other investment opportunities to help our users earn. At the moment, just giving interest on deposited assets.Thanks for voting by the way!",

      "body": "I currently have no problem with not being able to spend crypto on almost anything I can think of when it comes to my country or within the EU where there are no customs duties and delivery is relatively fast. Therefore, I don't see much sense in ordering anything from outside the EU, because it significantly increases the price of the product due to customs and delivery, and also means a longer waiting time for the product to arrive.Somehow it seems to me that such business ventures should be focused on the national market, although this does not prevent anyone from trying to expand internationally, but first it would be good to succeed on the domestic market.",

Offering discounts for other stuff could encourage people to opt for crypto payments as well.",

Almost every person in the world has a smartphone that allows to receive or send payment in the form of crypto, that is, technically, there are no obstacles to making per-to-per transfers, not to mention stores or retail chains. Of course, with a caveat, without conversion to intermediate currencies, like fiat. Immediately and directly in cryptocurrencies. To literally answer your question, I would like to buy everything using crypto. In a sense, to be able to buy whatever you want, just like with ordinary money.

And how can you say that his options are small for you when he already have luxury items and miners on the poll list? Do you think they are small/cheap? Well, think again.If you're in a place where cryptos are not a legal tender and there is only less to no merchants that accepts crypto, well yes you need to convert your cryptos first to fiat before you can be able to use them however there's also crypto cards which supports visa, mastercard and others. You can also swipe your card to pay directly on supported merchants.",

But that's good, holding your Bitcoin while there's a bear market is a wise decision. Good thing there's an online store that directly accepts Bitcoin in your place, in my place, I didn't try this.",
