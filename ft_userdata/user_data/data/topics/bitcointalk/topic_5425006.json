What do you guys think?Yes if you have the enough resources and cheap electricity cost. Mining is the best way to make profit on Bitcoin during bear or bull market if you can get all your mining rig in discounted price with cheap electricity cost.Quote from: philipma1957 on December 01, 2022, 02:05:10 PMwhat is your power cost? at 6 cents a kwatt or less I would consider it.I have a question to you since you are very knowledgeable on this field. I know miners is getting profit on processing transactions. Does the volume of transaction increase the profitability of the miners or miners just rely on the price fluctuations of Bitcoin to increase the profit for the income coming from mining rigs?",

      "body": "Miner prices have dropped dramatically, as you mentioned in your question. Cryptocurrencies are volatile in nature, but a bitcoin mining investment could be very profitable. Bitcoin mining has historically been known as a profitable investment for long-term investors, particularly those who invested during a bear market. It is also worth noting that investing during a bear market may result in a shorter payback period if a bull market follows. Finally, it is up to you as an investor to assess your risk tolerance and make a decision. To help you understand the space better, here is an article about the future of crypto mining that explains where it is headed: https://www.zionodes.com/blog/the-future-of-crypto-mining-is-crypto-mining-still-profitable",

What do you guys think?In current market mining is just zero level profit cause Markets are too low and is non profitable. And I think with low budget miners, profit is negligible. And if you are a company than keep doing it cause when btc market will up than you will be in hot profits that is just non imaginable.In 2017 we could mine 0.5 Btc Per month and if someone should hold these btc for a whole year than he could be in more profit than selling regularly in the market.",

So any time you mine, the amount of BTC stays the same but the price of that BTC changes with market movement. But if the Rig costs less now, then it is just clever to buy them now.

Because of the high cost of the equipment required for mining and the rise in electricity costs will certainly not be profitable. According to 2019 report by the Congressional Research Service, the power we get for one ASIC can use the same amount of power as half a million PlayStation 3 devices. As a result, the cost will naturally increase manifold. As the difficulty and complexity of Bitcoin mining increases at the same time need more computing power. When Bitcoin is bullish, it becomes very difficult to take profits from it. In that case, the current price of Bitcoin is about 75 percent lower than the peak value, so how is it possible to continue mining operations in a bearish market?

Business is all about risk and calculated risk is all there is to making profit. Looking at the cost of providing and maintaining the equipments needed to mining BTC right now such as power cost, etc, and relative to the value of the bitcoin  perhaps with your location you might not make a good profitable sum except you're mining with a future mindset (long-term  profit) on bitcoin price as it would surely rise with time,",
