Most standard mining rigs right that are efficient enough would range from $2000 to $20000, and that's for ASIC miners too. If you want to get mining rigs for cheap I suggest you look into craigslist or OLX to find secondhand mining rigs, or maybe look for manufacturers that sell their secondhand rigs like zeusBTC to get relatively cheaper prices for bitcoin mining rigs. You also have to consider having to pay for your electricity bill btw, so keep that in mind. if you can't afford to buy a mining rig that's powerful enough, then perhaps you wouldn't be able to pay ridiculous electricity fees too, but that's speaking from experience.",

But with the difficulty at an all time high finding a block with smaller ASIC hardware(s) would be much like getting struck by lightning during a sunny day. It's possible but highly improbable. As others have mentioned if $300 is the limit you would be better off buying BTC and holding it hoping for an increase in value.",

I think that is a good idea, as long as you have the patience to hold and keep buying even if the market is full of bear sentiment. If you don't like the waiting part and want to grow your capital quickly, even if you find cheap electricity I don't think you'll be able to stick to your mining plan. Whether you mine or not, you'll need to wait for some time before it bears fruit.If $300 is your only budget, I'd suggest you stick with your DCA plan. Especially since you mentioned you have some responsibilities to your family and can't allocate too much money to high-risk investments. CMIIW.",

Are you sure GameBoy? Not worth trying it only hash 0.8H/s meaning in solo mining it takes decades before you can able to solve a block or even if you mine on the pool you can't even make a single Sat it would be better to buy 2nd hand ASIC units than wasting your money buying gameboy to mine BTC.The Offordscott telegram link above has some s9/t9 units listed for around $135 or even cheaper.",

It's better to save up a bit more money until you can afford a used ASIC Antminer, which can produce a better return on investment. I have tried mining before using my GPUs, and it worked well until the difficulty increased and the value of Bitcoin decreased significantly, which made it unprofitable.",

If you are paying more than 6 cents, then you don't need to be mining right now. To gain experience, you can buy a small mining farm on 4x Rx470 video cards, but this is only for training.And you need to have at least a little experience with components.",

Maybe if it's 2014 it's possible but not this time as the previous commenters said.     Then mining is not just that you just thought it was okay, it's not like that of course. There are some things you should consider in that matter, first your electricity consumption should be low because your mining rigs are open 24/7. Secondly, your electricity consumption should also not increase to 0.04$ KWH as far as I know, because I also planned to mine, so the only problem I had was that my electricity consumption was high here, so the things I planned before mining would not work either. of bitcoins.",

To get ASIC device will cost you more than that amount you have said. This simply means that $300 is not enough to start mining because @OP still needs money for the mining machine setup, and the capital amount to start isn't considered under the secondary plan, it should be the main focus because any plan you made without enough funding will never realize.@OP, if your budget is just like that amount, it is not enough to buy a decent mining rig, so I guess you can just use it to buy Bitcoin at least your goal of having Bitcoin is still met even though it isn't from mining activity.",
