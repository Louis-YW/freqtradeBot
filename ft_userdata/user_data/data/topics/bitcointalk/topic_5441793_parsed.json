The chances of having backdoors, hacks or even unintentionally poorly written code is far too high for anyone willing to invest. What guarantees can you provide about the code integrity? How can you certify this to be true?",

He should also call for his past clients to vouch for him or her here so that any potential buyer would know and have that confidence in what they are buying as these days it is just a copy cat and prototype of what others have down some people would rewrite and put up for sale for an inexperienced buyer to buy and start suffering from hacks. I am not too comfortable with the telegram conversation op opted for, I would prefer every conversation about this deal be here for transparency and credibility so other members could also contribute to the conversation for any potential buyer. The conversation started here and should end here and lastly like I have said earlier before now, there should be an escrow for this deal so that both parties involved will haveo differences as to reaching and honouring agreement.",

I don't think that's the script we're talking about. In this context, a script refers to software - code written in scripting languages like PHP or JavaScript - that you install on your web server to operate an online casino. The software itself has little impact on how you want to run your casino or your business plan. Although, when it comes to setting up an online casino, the script you choose to use is an important consideration, but it's only one piece of the puzzle.",

In fact one user above already found 3 issues as he said. That's a good catch, maybe that user do also has an experience on the same field.I totally agree with you on this. It's hard to tell if the price for the script is too high or not, but requesting follow-up maintenance seems like a smart idea. It's always possible that issues might arise later on, and having someone available to address them would definitely give us peace of mind. While it's tempting to consider purchasing a casino script from an individual seller, there are definitely some risks involved, especially when it comes to quality control and ongoing support. In my opinion, it's worth investing in a script from a reputable company that has a proven track record of providing excellent customer support and serving a satisfied user base. This way, you can rest assured that the script you're getting is high-quality and has been thoroughly vetted by experts in the field.No offense to the OP or any individual sellers out there - I'm sure there are some great scripts available from individuals as well. But for something as important as a casino script, I personally would feel more comfortable going with a company that has established itself as a trusted provider in the industry. What do you guys think? Have any of you had experience purchasing casino scripts from individual sellers?",
