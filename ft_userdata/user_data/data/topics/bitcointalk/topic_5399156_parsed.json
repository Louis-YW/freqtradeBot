  "content": "Finding someone to just lend you money haven't been than easy these days, and this Amy not be unconnected to the reality that lending in most cases has now become a problem to the lender instead of gratitude that should have been the result from the borrower.Some may ask, what do I mean by the statement above  In brief I'll try to be specific in explaining that with a real life story.A friend of mine lend $300 to someone he has known for a very long time without any collateral or interest, and the person with a honey-tongue promised to pay back in three weeks time. Three weeks went by even to the fourth week and my friend didn't get any payment back or even a word from the person.Three 3weeks turned to 3months the money was not yet paid to him, with persistent request of the money by this friend of mine from the borrower he lend his money to whom have refused to pay back with frivolous excuses, to the extend he (borrower) started threatening my friend to desist from disturbing him about the $300.To cut the whole story short the matter later ended up in police custody then to court. Now looking at this scenario would you blame anyone wether close or distant friend or relative who refused from given you a loan after witnessing such incidence or would you say it's just a means to an excuse??Let discuss about it.",
