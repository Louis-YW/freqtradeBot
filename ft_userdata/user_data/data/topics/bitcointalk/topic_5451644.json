      "body": "I saw this on a video where they've been asking people what to choose from, a penny or a million then obviously people will choose the million. While in this case, I'll choose that 1 sat and be doubled everyday at the end of the month.My calculation result is different from the others since I've chosen to rely on the image which is 1 sat but it's almost the same numbers but with just another number which came out to be 1,073,741,824. While 1 bitcoin = 100M sats then that shows how massive this condition is at the end of the month. So, my calculation goes like this and let's say 1 month = 30 days:Day 1: 1 x 2 = 2 satsDay 2: 2 sats x 2 = 4 satsDay 3: 4 sats x 2 = 8 satsDay 4: 8 sats x 2 = 16 satsDay 5: 16 sats x 2 = 32 satsDay 6: 32 sats x 2 = 64 satsDay 7: 64 sats x 2 = 128 satsDay 8: 128 sats x 2 = 256 satsDay 9: 256 sats x 2 = 512 satsDay 10: 512 sats x 2 = 1024 satsDay 11: 1024 sats x 2 = 2048 satsDay 12: 2048 sats x 2 = 4096 satsDay 13: 4096 sats x 2 = 8192 satsDay 14: 8192 sats x 2 = 16384 satsDay 15: 16384 sats x 2 = 32768 satsDay 16: 32768 sats x 2 = 65536 satsDay 17: 65536 sats x 2 = 131072 satsDay 18: 131072 sats x 2 = 262144 satsDay 19: 262144 sats x 2 = 524288 satsDay 20: 524288 sats x 2 = 1048576 satsDay 21: 1048576 sats x 2 = 2097152 satsDay 22: 2097152 sats x 2 = 4194304 satsDay 23: 4194304 sats x 2 = 8388608 satsDay 24: 8388608 sats x 2 = 1677716 satsDay 25: 1677716 sats x 2 = 33554432 satsDay 26: 33554432 sats x 2 = 67108864 satsDay 27: 67108864 sats x 2 = 134217728 satsDay 28: 134217728 sats x 2 = 268435456 satsDay 29: 268435456 sats x 2 = 536870912 satsDay 30: 536870912 sats x 2 = 1,073,741,824 sats = 10.74 BTCBonus if the month is 31 days.Day 31: 1,073,741,824 sats x 2 = 2,147,483,648 = 21.47 BTC",

If it is the impatient ones or ignorant to calculate will settle down for 1btcI will go for 1 sat double per day and I will be patient for it to accumulate till the end of the month,so that I can have 5btc. This question is teaching us to understand that for you to grow in your bitcoin journey, you need patience and always know the market analysis. That is why if you don't calculate the number of sats per day you will think 1btc is bigger because it is in bulk. It is just as investors will see little pump in price and they will rush to sell but if they do not panic to sell,they might end up selling higher than the previous price that they intended to.",

The OP said 100 sat that would be doubled everyday for a month, going by the fact it’s 30 days a month approximately then you would be getting double of your sat everyday day.Approximately you would be getting more that 10 bitcoin at the end of a 30 days month period that’s definitely above going for 1 btc a month.When ever I see a question like this that has a first look easy answer I definitely know not to go with the easy answer and have a better thought about the question.",
