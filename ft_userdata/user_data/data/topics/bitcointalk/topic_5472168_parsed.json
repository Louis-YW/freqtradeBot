I'm not familiar with Celestia though, are they a big deal right now in the crypto space that people are flocking over or am I missing something? They popped up in my X notifications so it must be a big thing.Reported the website and continue what you're doing.",

Official site doesn't contain underscore, hyphen of any other special character but for new user it is difficult because they just look website template and then connect wallet. Calestia gives a very decent airdrop to many eligible users. Scammers are trying to decieve airdrop hunters but hopefully no big fund will be stolen.

Seven hours ago, the official CelestiaOrg account retweeted one of the Keplr wallet’s tweets, stating that the claim period had already ended and that TIA coins would appear in the participants’ wallet as soon as possible Celestia mainnet launches. They also caution their communities against the phishing sites launched during this period. Therefore, whoever receives these updates first in real-time through the tweets of the project’s official account will be aware and sure that what he sees of any new schemes are nothing but lies, fraud, and deception and will refrain from connecting his wallet or opening any phishing site he comes across.Source: https://twitter.com/keplrwallet/status/1719004836627407074",

I am sure that these twitters are also hacked. Scammers promote their tweet from different accounts and maybe they buy twitter promotion and you will see these scam sites on the top of the opening page.  Below is just one example, how they promoting in twitter and trying to decieve airdrop hunters.",
