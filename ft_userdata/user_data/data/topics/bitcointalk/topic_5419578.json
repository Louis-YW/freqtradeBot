And everyone is very happy, others have been experiencing financial freedom. Although the price of bitcoin is somewhat on the $20ki'ish, it's because we are in a bear market. We have seen how it goes from bear to bull, so we will have just to wait for the next bull run to occur 2024-2025. So yeah, it's not too late, people can still invest right now.",

      "body": "Maybe you are talking about Bitcoin? This was the first cryptocurrency ever created. This is a payment platform, which allows users to buy, sell and trade goods and services without using traditional payment methods like bank transfers or credit cards. In this way it is similar to PayPal or any other online payment platform, but with one big advantage: Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, so it can't be debased as PayPal's dollar reserves can be. And also, it is decentralised (nobody controls it), hence anonymity if you don't need physical addresses associated with your transactions.",

Maybe we could conclude its one of the worlds important innovation already. The inception of blockchain technology and bitcoin dominion serves as one step on technology. I can say that most of the industry recognize it already as a great alternative to fiat and store of value.",

      "body": "Since bitcoin has become the number 1 crypto and then i think you didn't even need to told them all manually. Anyone who have been investing or involving in the crypto is always very familiar with bitcoin as the best coin that has ever exist and triggering the new era for digitalization for our economic combined with decentralization. Bitcoin is still become the main pioneer in the crypto development. One of thing that was ruling the crypto market forever. It will aways exist no matter what happened with the global economic condition. The only problem is this actually peg with the nodes that must be fully on time. I think that none of crypto users didn't know about what bitcoin is",

I don't know what your point is in all of this, but I am hoping that you, as the author, also believe in it. So far, Bitcoin has a bright future ever since the multiple ATH that it got. But five years ago, only a few people knew it, but now we are really expecting that Bitcoin will go big, but we don't know when. Aside from the fact that we are earning from it, we are also expecting it to be the first widely used digital currency.",
