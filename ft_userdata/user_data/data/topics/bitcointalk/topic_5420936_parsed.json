This will only difficult if you are not willing to stop this. If you are living on unrealistic world where you believe that you can earn a lot of money on gambling and keep pushing to reach those goal then maybe you will fall in addiction which could make you hard to resist playing and control yourself to quit playing while you are winning.So better learn to have self control first since for sure quitting will not be a problem to you.",

There are also people who have quit for real like me.I was an avid gambler before being completely addicted to slot machines.One time I hit such a hard loss that it took at least two days for me to recover to get up from bed and do something else.I promised myself that I will only play a small bankroll for fun in the slots once a week and if I get something I would be happy and quit and also if I lose this balance completely I would still be happy and quit because this is a very small balance compared to what I used to spend on gambling.",

The day I decided to quit, I did not look back, I quit until I have control over it. I remember when I quit for a year, I started to gambling again and I noticed I lost and I quit again. Then I knew that I have control over it, but started to use small amount.  I had a friend, he was the first that lost huge amount of money to gambling, the money belongs to his mother living abroad. It was a disappointment when his mother needed the money but later found out the truth. He quit gambling till this day. It depends in my opinion, especially those that gambling has thought a lesson will not want to gamble again. But supposing gambling as been taken as fun, quitting will never even come mind.",

In gambling, addiction only confused gambling addicts to think they can make money from gambling, they will lose, lose and lose again. They will get tired and later still think that making money is possible until they realised their mistake after losing much more. But gambling addiction can take months to years before they will know that they have to stop gambling.",

It's very different environment than casinos that accept credit card/bank wire deposits because credit cards are not issued to minors, and bank wires ask for the sender's/reciever's information.Perhaps casinos should start building \"Responsible Gambling\" features, no? Features that can limit how much money you can bet per 24 hours/week, or how much to deposit per 24 hours/week.",

It is not possible for every gambling addict to recover within a short span, it takes time, relapse is possible but quitting is possible. Family support goes a long way to cope with the problem.",

I agree with your point. Saying to yourself, \"I quit gambling forever\", is not something I would recommend to do to anyone who's having problems with gambling(We don't talk here about people not inclined to gambling addiction, right? I mean, why should they quit doing what brings them joy and not harmful to them?) because you can briefly forget about your promise to yourself, make a bet or two, then you'll have this depressing thought, \"I can never quit\", and snap into another gambling binge. This is not what we want, right? Instead of saying to yourself \"I'm quitting gambling forever\", say something like \"I promise to myself to not be a victim of gambling. I promise to be a person who can stop at any moment, a person that can control himself\". And then if you occasionally start gambling, you can remember that promise and stop, and not feel guilty about breaking your promise, but be happy about keeping it. But you have to have the strength to stop right away, of course.",

For gamblers to have concluded not to gamble again shows that they are losing money often through it, and this is unethical, but it is now a problem if they could not back the decision with strict actions. Mind you, only two sets of gamblers would ever want to stay, those that win (it does not matter if it's regular) and those that do it for fun. If you are not in those categories and want to stop but having issues with that, then I advise you to seek external help, it's more effective.",

People honestly have no idea what to do to replace gambling because they don't have anything to do, or rather forgot about what they usually do. Even simple socialization can be a suitable replacement for gambling, it's all dependent on how you yourself set it. Maybe ask a friend for that small push as the start if you can't do it alone.",

It is similar to the vices (alcohol and cigarettes) that people have difficulty quitting; when they do, it is usually because they are ill and were advised to quit by their doctor. It is difficult to stop without help from others, as I mostly saw, so it's better to seek help from professionals like psychologists or therapists to stop this habit only if it is already affecting you, your family, and the people around you.
