ThxIf you want to sell the Bitcoin without problems with exchanges, use a P2P decentralized exchange such as https://bisq.network/.I don't think it is stolen since online criminals would just cash out the Bitcoin they stole and not run around with a paper seed of the coins. But since there's no way to know who they belong to, keep them for yourself and / or sell them. Just be aware that centralized exchanges can easily freeze your account and you will have no way of proving origin of funds. However if you sell it little by little on Bisq, you will be golden.[Since you are new here: I am not affiliated with Bisq. I could actually rent my avatar, but at the moment I choose to rather just promote services that I use and like, such as Bisq and WalletScrutiny - especially since they're not for-profit companies and as far as I know both are also looking for some donations or contributions from the community. So I'm giving them some exposure here.]",

The OP can't possibly know that so they shouldn't touch the coins.Also this could fall under some unauthorized access/hacking law. The OP found a code to access someone's money, but they know they're not authorized to access it. It's like finding a key to someone's house. I don't think that gives the finder the right to take whatever is in the house.",

Anyone who knows the Private Key can move the coins of the paper wallet.The legitimate owner should be able to prove ownership by signing a Bitcoin message with the appropriate Private Key as long as (s)he has a copy of it. Otherwise you can't easily prove legit ownership. Some dudes might chime in and pretend it's theirs to claim the coins for themselves.A paper wallet usually has a Private Key and a Public Address. To search for the owner you can try to find out via the transaction history of the paper wallet's Public Address. This requires some Blockchain analysis knowledge. But at places where there's KYC involved you won't get the owner's private details as usually this is disclosed only when official entities like police or jurisdiction is asking for it.The least you can do as effort to find the owner in my opinion is to publish the Public Address only. The Private Key must stay offline, don't even take digital pictures of it with your smartphone or camera. Pay attention to use only safe QR code apps should there be QR code encoded data on this paper wallet.If you're not familiar with Bitcoin what makes you think it's a Bitcoin paper wallet?Bitcoin Private Key (all case-sensitive): starts with 5... for uncompressed key or K... or L... for compressed key, followed by a bunch of upper and lower case characters and numbersBitcoin Public Address: starts with 1..., 3...

Be prepared to get messages from people claiming to be the owner, so they'd need to provide evidence. And that's the tricky part: even a signed message from the address that funded the wallet doesn't necessarily mean it's the owner (it could be the guy who sold the Bitcoins to the current owner).Another way to get the owners attention could be by leaving small hints by sending dust to the address and in the same transaction sending dust to for instance those 2 addresses:1PaperWaLLetFound1xxxxxxxxy1KHknm1Topic54o8263onBitcointaLkxyvdAVg (Note: I used Proof of Burn to create those addresses.

I think that the flood hit some houses and thus took some things with it into the river that flows into the sea, which then threw that wallet onto the beach.It's just a theory, of course, but somehow it seems more realistic to me than someone walking on the beach with a paper wallet containing 0.6 BTC, losing it and not trying to find it.",
