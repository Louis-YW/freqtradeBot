I don't think that anyone is naive enough to send you any funds because it's the riskiest thing that any investors would do. I'm a trader myself and sometimes I think that if I can access $1M then I can make a lot of profits with that money but dude the harsh truth is that no-one is going to send you $10 because they don't really want to lose that money in the hands of someone whom they don't know.You should better do trading yourself and begin with a low capital and increase that first and once you can turn that into something like $10k to $100k then you won't be needing any investors for your trading activities. The crypto-market is very volatile and I can assure you that no-one will trust a trader even if that trader shows proofs. So it's 100x better to begin with a low capital and increase that with your own trades rather than asking others to send you funds. I hope you got the point and if you're smart enough then you won't waste your time by asking others to send you funds for something that will benefit you first not them.",

This is being done at all levels, in trading whatsapp groups, telegram groups, facebook groups etc. You get free money from the investors, and you trade on behalf of them. As long as you are profitable, you will get certain percentage from the profit and you will distribute the profit to the investors too according to their investments. There will be a time when your trades may go wrong, at that time you will just say sorry to your investors as the trading capital liquidated and you always have the excuse that winning and losing is a part of trading. You see, as long as trades are profitable, you are sharing the profits among youself and investors. As you lost the trades, only the investors suffer, you don't share the loses.",

Trading doesn't work that way buddy at least crypto trading. In trading you'll have to use technical indicators and master various settings of those indicators and once you have that in your tool set then you'll have to make a proper trading strategy. It takes time and consistency to make a proper trading strategy and make its winning rate higher. A trader have to face some losses during making of the strategy but those losses are lessons that a trader learns from his/her own mistakes. You're quite new in the world of trading and I can feel that your curiosity levels are pretty high. I recommend you to learn trading first and then start with small amounts to begin your trading journey. You'll be a good trader once you give proper time to trading and surely you'll have better trading plans once you master a proper trading strategy. Trading isn't a child's play my friend and everyone can't be a profitable trader. I'm not discouraging you but in real you'll have to practice crypto trading for some months before investing any money into it.",

By the way, you came to the forum 4 days ago.I have a suggestion for you. Place orders (with your own money, of course) and show all the evidence here. At the same time, explain the following steps. Later, again with documentation, you will explain the closing of the order, present the profit and everything that happened.You need to do this daily or set the time frames yourself, in the next 8-12 months. After that, the other members of the forum will be convinced of your knowledge and skills and If everything is good as you say now, you won't have a problem finding investors.",
