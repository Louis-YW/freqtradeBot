POS operators find am hard to meet up with their customers demand,because if you go bank on top the small money wey bank go give you,bank go take their own interest. CBN say na cashless policy we don dey practice but me I feel say na only poor people all this their law and policy dey affect.Make Una see Bandits wey dey inside bush get excess of cash in sacks of the new Naira note and them dey even use am brag say them still use the new Naria note buy ammunitions. My concern be say who give these bandits them all this cash and how come we the ones without gun no fit get access to this redesign note. I see say all this new things na because of election. See the kind leaders wet we get na only themselves and their family dem dey after.",
