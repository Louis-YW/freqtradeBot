All of them are driven by greed, so they all end up in oblivion. I strongly disagree with you that 99.99 per cent of Altcoin are trash, but I have no doubt that they're all element of centralization, We have Alt Coin that are really doing well for themselves, and things has really been upward for them. My only concerning is creating a token without any plans for such project, I think the earlier we stop comparing BTC standard to every other will be far greater and better for us all. BTC open a new of possibilities, so it should always been respected for that. In conclusion some Alt Coin are superbly good, and some are useless, but not 99.99%. Also I will advice to stay away from project without real utility and useÂ  case. Be warned",

Unfortunately, these platforms rely a lot on newcomers to the crypto field to spread offers delusional about quick profit and security. Newcomers will follow these offers out of ignorance of what they are and with confidence in those platforms that publish the offers.There are scam gambling platforms that post their ads on many well-known websites. I would like you to review the updates regarding both the 1xbit platform and the 1xbet platform. These two platforms have proven to be fraudulent platforms, but you can see advertisements for them even in world football stadiums.",

Actually you are right. These features are quite simple to be considered as use case. Most shitcoins are like that, so we can notice that its structure is only created for that. But if these features are related and connected to a bigger use case then we can change the belief on that projects. Example bnb, its a coin with multiple feature that all you mentioned. But also they have some products that you can use the tokens which it make it healthy. What I dont like about them is the centralized system which is quite a negative trait for such decentralized world.",
