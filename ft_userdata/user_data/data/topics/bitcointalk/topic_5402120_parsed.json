      "body": "It depends on how we look at it OG, at the time it looked like a good idea, you know the outbreak was severe at the beginning with millions of cases in a short time, so why i said it looked like a good idea at the time is that governments needed time to decide on the action to take, and to stop the spread while they dialogue on what to do, they had to impose lockdowns.The government knew the action will lead to inflation, but lockdown was something they had to impose then, and worry about what will come later. Are we better off now as a result of those policies? I do not think so, in hindsight the negative effects of lockdowns seem extremely worse than what was being avoided. If i think we should handle virus outbreaks in the future similarly, i would say no to that, the government ought to be more proactive next time, policies that will turn out to be more of a \"hinderance than a help\" should not be made.",

Even if they weren't infected -- risk remained low for the vast majority of people. Doesn't warrant the government forcing you to stay within your home. Quote from: OgNasty on June 10, 2022, 08:08:54 PMDo you think this is how we should handle virus outbreaks in the future?Like monkeypox? CDC are already recommending masking for a disease that primarily effects homosexual men having close sexual contact. Wearing a mask during sex might be their next recommendation.Quote from: OgNasty on June 10, 2022, 08:08:54 PMDo you think we are better off as a species now as a result of these actions?Nope. The amount of deaths related to reduced economic activity (depression driven suicides, famines, etc.) outpace the deaths related to COVID.Quote from: OgNasty on June 10, 2022, 08:08:54 PMDo you think the government's inability to get everyone vaccinated is part of the reason behind this push to destroy the second amendment?Probably not, but possibly. The gun grabbing is a simple issue. Use dead children, drag their lifeless and still warm bodies across the stage and fully display them for the world to see. Then, use emotional appeal to call any gun supporters heartless bigots who enjoy seeing children get slaughtered. And this has world-wide appeal, in fact. Canada has announced gun restrictions for a shooting that happened in the U.S., not even within their borders. It's not part of a larger conspiracy theory, just people that don't understand gun-death related statistics and find guns to be scary.",

Everything I've found suggests it is hugely effective.As for whether governments could have handled this better, certainly. In my own country (the UK), it was perfectly evident as soon as outbreaks started in Italy and Spain that it would make its way over here. The biggest mistake the government made was to keep the borders open too long... if you wait until something is a problem, then it's too late to achieve the best outcome. You need to close borders beforehand. That way the internal economy at least can continue.https://xkcd.com/2278/",

Here is what they are finding in the blood clots of the people who have died from taking the vaxx.Note that I have suggested long ago that if we could get nano-machines into the body, tiny machines that could flow together and become RF devices, we might be able to take over the bodies of people that had these devices in them.Loads of microscope magnified pictures in the article.EXCLUSIVE: Shocking microscopy photos of blood clots extracted from those who “suddenly died” – crystalline structures, nanowires, chalky particles and fibrous structuresQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-06-12-blood-clots-microscopy-suddenly-died.html#EXCLUSIVE: Today we are publishing a series of lab microscopy photos of bizarre clots which are now being routinely found in adults who “suddenly died,” usually in a number of months following covid vaccinations.These clots are often referred to as “blood clots” but they are nothing at all like normal clots, and they consist of far more than mere blood cells. Unlike normal clots which are gelatinous, almost jelly-like, these so-called “clots” contain extremely large, complex, repeating structural elements (all shown below) that are clearly being constructed in the blood of the victims who died from these clots.All of these clots were extracted from patients within a few hours of their death. These are not the result of post-mortem blood stasis. These are structures found in blood vessels and arteries. They are not congealed blood.We wish to publicly thank Dr. Jane Ruby for connecting us to the embalmer (Richard Hirschman) who provided these clots. (Telegram channel T.ME/DRJANERUBY) Without the persistence of Dr. Ruby, you would not be seeing this report. Dr. Ruby is frequently featured on the Stew Peters Show (StewPeters.TV) and will also be my featured guest Monday on the Infowars.com broadcast.Here’s a vial of these raw clots, washed of blood and preserved, before staining:These structures exhibit the following shocking properties:    They are tough, fibrous and resilient, showing material properties similar to small rubber bands.    They consist of many strands of small, fibrous strands.    These fibrous strands (see the very last photo set below) show repeating patterns of scale-like engineering, as if the body has been programmed to build another life form inside the blood vessels.    There are strange crystalline-like structures found on these clots, exhibiting transparency and resistance to normal gram staining techniques.    Below, you will find one example of a structure that appears to resemble a silicon-like biocircuitry or microchip-like structure. We don’t yet know what it is.    One of the photo sets below reveals what appears to be a biocircuitry wire which clearly shows repeating patterns and nano-scale interface structures that are assembled in a specific geometry for an unknown purpose.Context for the photos you are about to see:...",

But if the world economy should shut down just for the fight of this highly deadly virus it should please shut down, because of what benefit will be it if human being shut down instead of the economy. who will the economy be for then. because  i still haven't forgotten what i passed through in 2020 during the lockdown period here. it was a total mess and i hope not to see that again. So if am to choose between economy and the human race, i rather go for human race. But i pray such never happens in my generation.",

It's because the people still believe and trust the doctors! The people haven't waked up.

You need to understand what a comorbidity is. Look it up. It's not surprising that people with a pre-existing condition are more susceptible to death from Covid, and no-one would challenge that. But look at excess death figures (from any reason).

And I'd add that no-one has suggested that the vaccine becomes fully effective within a week, anyway. Data on vaccine efficacy can be found from many reputable sources, here's one example: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccine-effectivenessThe vaccines are safe and effective.

But the point of the vaccines is that you get the immunity without having to catch the virus. Given that contracting the virus comes with a decent percentage chance of serious illness, long-term health effects, or even death... I'd argue that taking the vaccine is the more prudent approach.Even if you're young and healthy, and in a very low-risk group, it's still better to take the vaccine rather than contracting the virus and potentially passing it on to more vulnerable people. This is why vaccination against a contagious disease is more a social responsibility issue than an individual liberty issue.",
