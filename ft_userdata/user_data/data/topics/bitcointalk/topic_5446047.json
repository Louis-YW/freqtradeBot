  "content": "On March 20, 2023, I woke up to a nightmare on OKX exchange. They disabled my withdrawals/deposit without notice, claiming there was a change in their terms of service (TOS). To make matters worse, they hold my funds hostage and refused to provide me with the updated TOS, which they claimed was the reason for the withdrawal freeze.I reached out to their customer service, but they offered no solution except to perform identity verification, which was not the issue at hand. I reminded them that their actions were illegal and requested them to release my funds or provide me with the updated TOS. However, they kept giving me the runaround, and to this day, I am yet to receive any satisfactory response.Quote\" Due to the adherence of compliance policies, we hereby regretfully inform that unverified users are unable to perform any withdrawals for the time being, and we are no longer supporting one-off / temporary withdrawal requests.  \"Previously, OKX always allowed unverified accounts to trade and even had a specific KYC0 level account type with a 10BTC daily withdrawal limit.Beware of OKX exchange's unethical practices. They can hold your funds hostage, disable withdrawals without notice, and even change their TOS without notifying you.I urge other users to be cautious when using OKX, as they have shown a disregard for their users' rights and wellbeing.Another friend of mine is in the same situation, so I assume this affects all unverified accounts.It is astonishing how exchanges of this size are treating their clients in such a manner.edit: they removed me from their telegram and delete my messages for bringing this up without saying anything, effectively acting like scammers.",

I hope to know what other people that have coins on OKX would talk about this. Probably I may be moving fully to Kucoin, I just do not know. From Binance to OKX, now from OKX to Kucoin, the more the KYC regulation.",

Although I care a little whenever an exchange implements compulsory KYC, I kind of understand this direction because they're actually left with no choice. But to implement it without informing users in advance, and, worse, locking funds all of a sudden in line with the new rules, it's not just unfair; it's almost just a subtle way to steal money from customers.",

We want to assure you that this is not a sudden request, as our Terms of Service (ToS) clause 7.1 requires users to provide accurate information when signing up. As a cryptocurrency exchange, we recognize the challenges of navigating regulations in the industry. Therefore, we have been working to establish a balance between promoting the crypto ecosystem while staying compliant with jurisdictions. In November 2022, we implemented a policy where new users are no longer allowed to access our service without KYC, and now we have made KYC mandatory for all our users.\"Quote7.1 Account Registration and Identity Verification: in order to use any of the Services, you are required to provide accurate information for all fields on the registration page to verify your identity, along with affirming these Terms. By registering an account with OKX, You agree and represent that You will use the Account only for yourself, and not on behalf of any third party, unless approved by OKX. You agree to provide us with authentic information at registration and on an ongoing basis for the purposes of identity verification and the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime, including without limitation a copy of your government issued photo ID and evidence of residency such as a utility bill or bank statement. If any such information changes, it is your obligation to update such information as soon as possible.This section referring to new registration and is missing any mention to current unverified clients.They continue with threats to mark my account as suspicious:Quote\"Please be aware that this is a platform-wide transition and we advise compliance with at least KYC level 1 to access basic features. Continued resistance may raise suspicions and potentially trigger a risk flag, prompting an investigation and a thorough review of your account.\"edit:They acknowledge it is infact missing from their TOS  QuoteRegarding the KYC requirement, we would like to clarify that it is a new adoption that we have just implemented as part of our efforts to comply with legal and regulatory obligations. We are sorry if this requirement has caused you any inconvenience or if you find it offensive to be asked to comply with ID verification. We would like to direct your attention to our Terms of Service (ToS), which explains why we are implementing this requirement and how we reserve our rights to do so. We acknowledge that the ToS may not outline all the site function limitations in one post, and we are open to revising the terms if you believe that the criteria is necessary to be present. We understand that our previous response may have come across as defensive, and we would like to clarify that we take full responsibility for the implementation of this requirement.
