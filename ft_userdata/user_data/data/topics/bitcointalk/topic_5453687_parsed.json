  "content": "First of all, Happy 13th Bitcoin Pizza Day everyone I think most of us who know Laszlo Hanyecz probably only know him from buying pizza in exchange of Bitcoin on this day. To be honest, I didn't even know about his other contributions to the Bitcoin network until now. After reading the article on Coinalap(my local language) and Crypto Potato, I got to know about some more of his contributions. And I think that there are many new people here or many people are still not informed about this, so I opened this topic to share with you other contributions of this genius person on the bitcoin network.Hanyecz’s Contributions to the Bitcoin Network:He is a computer programmer and Beyond his infamous pizza purchase, Laszlo Hanyecz was a significant contributor to the early development of Bitcoin. He played a crucial role in fixing many vulnerabilities in the network during its early stages, helping to make the protocol more secure and stableAnother big identity of his is that he is the originator of GPU mining, Laszello   is the first person who wrote the program for GPU mining. When everyone was doing CPU mining, by sharing this GPU mining program bitcoin mining got more progress.Hanyecz’s pioneering work also extended to software development. He was the first person to release the Bitcoin code for Mac OS, which helped pave the way for the wide adoption of Bitcoin as a digital currency. Additionally, he played a vital role in transforming the Bitcoin mining landscape, laying the groundwork for today’s industry’s growth.Information collect from বিটকয়েন পিজা দিবস | সবচেয়ে দামী পিজা?Bitcoin’s 13th Pizza Day: Reflecting on the Transaction that Changed Crypto History",

      "body": "Laszlo popped in on bitcointalk briefly in 2014 and share a little bit about himself. Sadly, he spent everything he mined. Someone in that thread tipped him 1 btc though, so he may still \"make it\" if he holds on to it.Quote from: laszlo on February 14, 2014, 09:52:18 PMThanks for the kind words guys.The pizza thing was a lot more popular than I thought so I made good on as many trades as I could.  Other than a little bit of single digit change, I spent everything I mined.  As you all know, the difficulty rises to adjust to hashing power, so eventually the mining wasn't worth it for me.Quote from: mc_lovin on February 14, 2014, 08:56:11 PMGPU mining BTC in 2010!??As far as I know I was the first to release a GPU miner.  I contributed the hash meter back then too, that's what the screen shot was all about.  I used to maintain the Mac OS builds but others have taken that up now.  It was a fun project and I learned all about OpenCL.  I can't find the thread on the forum anymore but you can find it in my web dir ( http://eclipse.heliacal.net/~solar/bitcoin/sha256.cl ).  That was back in May 2010.  Maybe there were other people who were doing it in private too, though.  For a long time I had been looking for a reason to learn how to write a shader, and this was a great project for it.  The way I looked at it, I was helping out with an open source project, and I was making pizza with my code.You guys will laugh now but I mined everything with an nvidia 9800 GTX+ on Mac OS (hackintosh, another scene I used to help out in).  I ended up getting 2 AMD Radeon 5970s with the bitcoins I was mining, but at the time, the OpenCL libraries from AMD and nvidia both were really buggy and I never got it to work right on more than one GPU.  The same code that would work on the nvidia on linux wouldn't work on windows and vice versa.  I was trying to make a generic OpenCL miner that everyone could run on all 3 platforms, and I spent months tweaking different kernels for each GPU, but I was also working two jobs at the time and so I never finished it.  I ended up just leaving bitcoin on the back burner for a few years, then it exploded and people started asking me about the pizza trades.  Every time the value goes up on exchanges, people email me asking me to comment on it, but really there isn't much more to tell than what I explained here. This is the old GPU mining release I made for Mac OS, probably won't work anymore though: http://eclipse.heliacal.net/~solar/bitcoin/Bitcoin-MacOSX-Intel-svn-75-opencl-2010-05-10.dmg",

He argues that he made a more significant contribution to bitcoin than just being the first spender. His contribution to GPU mining code that made him mine at a higher hashrate might be more impactful than just ordering a pizza with 10,000 BTC. But becoming the first person to use Bitcoin as a currency is symbolic. I have also observed that you don't choose how you will be remembered, history decides the aspect of your life to keep. He is even fortunate to be remembered yearly by the community because many contributors to the Bitcoin network are anonymous or less celebrated.",

Bitcoin was a rather niche project and no one could predict it'll grow that big. There are many developers or prominent figures not hiding their identities, but I guess it make sense to keep a low profile when you hold a significant amounts of bitcoins.\"Luckily\" for Laszlo, he spent almost all of his holdings on those pizzas, or maybe that's just a story that he made public not to drive attention of any bad guys who could pose a threat to himself and his family.",

It is interesting that he shared his family and himself publicly while every one of us around bitcoin community love to hide under our fake identity. It's because it's most likely that there's nothing to hide anymore as he's spent most of his bitcoins already from that pizza purchase. So, if there are robbers that would like to go and catch him, he'll just have to admit that he has spent it all and nothing left(?).Quote from: Mahirap on May 24, 2023, 10:30:08 PMNever heard that he is the guy behind GPU mining, if so then he probably has more bitcoins now if he keeps them.

No need to feel bad for him and forget about being regretful of these what ifs about him holding those bitcoins by now, his contributions will be forever engraved on Bitcoin's history and if it's not because of him who else is going to make that historical purchase when Bitcoin was worthless more than a decade ago and was just a project that's no one has an idea where it's going.",

Kiddings aside I knew from the get-go that the guy is something to really respect. It's one thing to purchase something using bitcoin, but back then, this is basically what jumpstarted the bitcoin economy and the believers if you will. So if not for his purchase, no one will probably know what bitcoin is in 2010 and will probably never even going to break as much records and change as much lives as it does now. So apart from being one of the pioneers of this network and the one who basically started it all, he's also someone who deserves so much respect. That pizza right there is symbolic of the future that bitcoin will come to be 10 years from then. So shouts to him (not sure if he's still active in this forum but whatever).",
