(for payment)How to i create payment address with php -no javascript-Bitcoin wallets are just pairs of private/public keys. Your \"password\" is your private key, and your \"address\" for receiving currency is your public key. So to protect my privacy and security, i will use distinct addresses for each transaction. Nonetheless, the number of keys we have to carry around would keep increasing to the point that it just wouldnâ€™t be practical. Again, that's reason why the HD wallets were introduced.Try something like this codes below, it will be your best of friend on this one.https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gunar/86c05f67e2a862f148bda1fc4f0a82f3/raw/8456458b11f72289519ef581560f06c3caf7b798/p2pkhFromXpub.js",

      "body": "I think this is sort of the problem with Bitcoin (and crypto at large) libraries today, you have well-written implementations only in one or two languages, and the rest of the implementations in other languages are mediocre and/or do not work or are a security hazard. So you'd either have to settle with the mediocre implementation or try to port it yourself, which can also be hazardous.But assuming you have those multi-language skills, the porting part shouldn't be too difficult. You only need native dependencies for secp256k1, SHA256 and HMAC-SHA512 (native is important, in order to avoid various timing and side-channel attacks).",
