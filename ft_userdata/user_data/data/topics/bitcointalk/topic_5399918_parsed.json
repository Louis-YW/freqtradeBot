  "content": "Currently looking for a programmer who can help me to whip up some software i can preinstall on these custom hardline gaming PC. It will be using Paypal API to do payouts. Also this software will only run when the user is IDLE since they're primarily going to be on it gaming I wouldn't want it to ruin the games. Will be preinstalling this on each PC I build along with a fullnode for one of several popular chains. You'll be working primarily with just NVIDIA GPU. Will pay fair value in whatever crypto you like. Send me a DM if you want to know any details please post prior your current stack and what your quote is to the DM.",
