Above that, you can expect to find advanced writers.5 cents is even too much for entry level. I observed here someone offering a writing service 25$ for 500 words with revisions. So if you will calculate 25/500 that would be not too much. Quality is okay or average or even better. Fiverr is recommended too just make sure to choose a gig with lots of good reviews.",

This will aslo depend in your agreement as well. Just like me I am also a vlogger, though I stopped for almost 1 year, but my channel was already monetized and got a total subscriber of 1280 so far. And if you think I am suitable for you to become one of your vloggers, I am very open for you to share my talent, Have a good day.",

I am responding usually within few minutes, unless i am sleepingÂ  2) I will do a quality testing, please do not waste our both time if you are a beginner and you have a vision of easy cash.3) As i said, the service is not public yet, this is an alpha phase and i am doing some HR work. Also the developers will need to fully finish the dashboard, but now it's ready to use with limited functionality. Do not waste your precious and valuable time if you won't agree with the following: This service will be a revenue-share based, so you won't be paid immediately. But the good new is, that it will bring you more money during the time, than being paid once for the blog postI am looking primarily for tech/coding oriented bloggers, or if you have some nice idea, at least marginally connected with technologiesI can reject you if the blog post quality will be low.It's a gentleman agreement, so you must trust me as much as i will trust to you!have a nice day!",
