  "content": "(Alt Project Dev) Any DigiByte (DGB) fans interested in having a Digi-ID login created for MyBB forum?DigiByte (DGB) is an open-source project with a strong community of volunteers launched way back in Jan 2014.MyBB forum is an open-source project with a strong community of volunteers started in 2002, long before Bitcoin was born.Digi-ID is a security protocol built on DigiByte blockchain technology that empowers users to effortlessly sign-in to websites, applications, and even into the internet of things. IMO, One of the best ways for Bitcoin/Crypto to go more mainstream ASAP is to actually use it in everyday life. \"We the people\" need a MyBB plugin created which seamlessly adds the Digi-ID option to existing registration and login. Is anyone interested in helping code this as an open-source offering and/or a proprietary profit-making venture? I will eventually pay for it, but would rather start the other way. This topic is open to discussion* whether it is productive, or simply to say (for example) \"Go DGB! The next bull market will be amazing.\"ps. MyBB development is very intuitive and fun.*pps. Coders can submit a bid on this project anytime, at the start my primary aim is to check interest and enjoy a discussion relating to making Crypto more mainstream, thank you.",
