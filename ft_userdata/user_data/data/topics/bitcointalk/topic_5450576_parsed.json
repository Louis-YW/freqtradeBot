      "body": "Hi Community, 👋If you're reading this, it's probably because you share our interest in the potential of web3 projects, particularly in web3 sports betting. We think they could change the way we interact with the house!             Let's be real, are you a sharp bettor? Have you ever been banned from a sportsbook because you're just too darn good at picking winners? Or maybe you've won big but can't seem to withdraw your funds. It's frustrating, and unfortunately, it still happens all too often, especially with offshore sportsbooks. Here are some examples:“To be honest, I’ve experienced this frustration of getting banned from sportsbooks because I am too good!”We asked our sports betting tournament participants to rank their top features in a sportsbook:OddsDeposit and WithdrawTransparencyBonusesAnd you know what surprised us? Transparency (= trustworthiness) frequently ranked second and third, while bonuses came in last. It turns out that people value transparency and trustworthiness in a sports betting platform more than freebies and bonuses, which can be hard to meet the conditions for.So, if you're looking for a sportsbook that values transparency and puts your trust first, you've come to the right place. Stay tuned for more updates on our exciting Web3 sports betting project!How can we design a DEX for sports betting?Let's talk about how we're designing a DEX for sports betting that's going to blow your socks off! 🧦😂 First things first, you bet directly from your wallet in USDC at UBET. And because our platform is non-custodial and decentralized, you don't have to worry about all the aforementioned issues that come with traditional sportsbooks. UBET supports multiple wallet connections on the Polygon blockchain. That includes popular wallets like Metamask, Trust Wallet, and Magic Link.You've probably heard of automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap, right? Well, UBET has its own version of the AMM that determines the odds based on liquidity, wager size, and external market odds. Our AMM is pretty special because it's designed for generic purposes and can be applied to any data. We just happen to be using it for sports betting data! Here's the best part - all of the betting transaction data is available on the blockchain for everyone to see. That means total transparency on what's happening with betting transactions, odds determination, and settlements. No more shady business and hidden agendas.
