The Pharmacist, TSC will now know that it might take time but not that theymos actually disregarded his call for merit increase. If theymos could honor his demand for a name change today after several reminders, he can still honor his demand for more merit as a merit source. I just feel like letting him know this.",

If you think they abuse conflicts of interest, then allowing them to participate in sig campaigns is irrelevant. If they do abuse as you say, they shouldn't be mods in the first place. By the way, everybody's free to do as they please. If some authority is likely to abuse power, it's not the absence of the signature that's going to stop them. A simple bribe can cover it.",

What isn't rational is for people who've nothing to do with Chipmixer to feel ethically superior and attack it once in a while with embarrassing arguments like money laundering, taint, \"you've nothing to hide\" etc. Quote from: Lucius on December 11, 2022, 02:07:43 PMYour implication that I defend CM for financial reasons is more than ridiculous - especially since I might be the only one who hasn't spent a single satoshi since I joined that campaign.The way you choose to spend your money doesn't alter the fact that you're making money.I don't find it ridiculous to admit defense for financial reasons. I admit that part of my defense for ChipMixer is to have it continue operating, which first of all ensures the operation of an excellent service, and second, secures me income.",
