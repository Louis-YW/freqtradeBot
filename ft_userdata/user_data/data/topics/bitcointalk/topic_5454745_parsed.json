  "content": "So from my understanding, this is the current situation:- Multichain's (a bridge that helps you transfer funds from one network to another) CEO went missing/got detained[1].- Some users have noticed an inflow of large amounts of FTM and MULTI (the bridge's token) from Multichain's team wallets to Gate.io.- There are also rumors that Gate.io is being investigated by the police[2]Since all of this came to light, the exchange had a 150M $ outflow in a matter of a few hours and I wouldn't be surprised if more people start to panic and withdraw their funds.If you have any funds there, you should probably withdraw them now, just in case.[1] https://decrypt.co/142997/multichain-cant-find-its-ceo-as-company-loses-access-to-its-servers/[2] https://coingape.com/breaking-gate-io-sees-150-million-net-outflow-amid-police-investigation-rumors/",

I assume to dump.The part that I do not understand is there is another rumor that implies Gate.io might be insolvent because Multichain's treasury is being backed by 30% by Gate.io?JUST IN:Due to the CEO Zhaojun arrest and the Multichain treasury being backed by 30%.

It's sad to hear about this issue, I actively used gateio for few months when they ranked 3rd on coinmarketcap. Seeing that their rank dropped back to number 10 shows that they were also affected by the fall of FTX. Most of these exchanges are dependent on other exchanges, now gateio is affected again by the disappearance of the multichain CEO. I think my assets there is not enough to make me bothered and I don't want to stress myself with their login requirements.",

Back in August 2022, it was found that Crypto.com accidentally sent AUD $10.5 million (worth over $7 million) to Melbourne-based investors, which was supposed to be an AUD $100 ($67) refund.

Crypto.com is lying about the transfer. I did not have access to our wallet though I know how exchanges do big transfers. Those wallets are supposed to be a multi-signature wallets. The main person in charge of the wallet is supposed to check the address a couple of times and cross-check where are they sending the funds before they broadcast the transaction. This is not possible to send crypto to the wrong address unless every co-signer is the same person. I did not follow the recent case of Gate.io though",
