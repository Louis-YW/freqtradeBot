  "content": "Bitcoin's recent performance has raised concerns, with various factors impacting its trajectory. However, it's important to approach its future outlook rationally.Technically, Bitcoin faces challenges with a critical support level at around $25,500. A break below this could lead to further declines, potentially testing $20,000.In the short term, a price above $2.58 might signal a trend reversal, while surpassing $2.65 could indicate a rebound. But until Bitcoin shows significant strength, rebounds may be brief.Ethereum has its challenges, with low trading volumes and the recent hacking of founder Vitalik Buterin's Twitter account affecting its reputation. Short-term market stagnation is possible.In terms of news, the FTX token sale case may appeal in September. However, the market's ability to absorb a $200 million sell-off remains uncertain. Key events, including the FTX case and economic data, are being closely watched.Some analysts believe this drop may be manipulated to liquidate long positions. The market is contracting, with funds flowing to a few, causing a drop in Bitcoin's trading volume.For future trends, caution is advised. Bitcoin may rebound in October, but September is uncertain. The purchasing power of $1 has changed since 2021, making funds cautious. Altcoins' response to Bitcoin's rebound and their gains should be approached carefully. In the short term, risk awareness is vital.In summary, a rational, calm approach is essential in the cryptocurrency market. Make investment decisions based on your circumstances and risk tolerance, avoiding being swayed by sentiment.",

Before that most people were in doubt about whether Bitcoin price would rise because they saw that it has never-ending ups and down and it's been facing a decline that time just before the unstoppable spike of the price happened until it creates another ATH. Now, people are back to their old ways again, they never learn and speculate negatively back and might also lose the opportunity to invest early again.",

The trend is still bullish, and there's no sign of reversal yet. If Bitcoin price closes below $24,500 that would be alarming since it indicates that the sellers are in control and also there is a liquidation plan on FTX which might be a bad news for crypto if they get approved. What I saw in the market right now is not clear that the price will continue to go up since the weekly candle didn't close yet. If the price will stay above $26,000 this week, there's a high chance that the price will continue to go up.",

The price of Bitcoin could reach $23k or lower this month, especially if negative news is released. This will clearly create fear for investors, especially new investors who do not yet have a strong foundation in holding Bitcoin.But in the long term, Bitcoin will still have another bull run. And even if it happens in the next year or 2 years, that's okay too. We just need to be patient, wait, and remain calm to see the opportunities that exist.And if the price of Bitcoin is pushed down due to a lot of negative news, that means our opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a low price is increasingly wide open. That means we are still given the opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin at low prices.",

In contrast to stable coins which are always boring because they continue to run flat The current rapid movement in the price of bitcoin seems to liquidate people playing in the futures market. Because today I saw many positions being liquidated on the market. Because the movement of bitcoin suddenly goes down quickly and suddenly goes up quickly. People are even convinced by their technical analysis which shows signs of a decline. So many people put Short. But then today the market recovered quickly. And liquidated many positions. But that's short term. Meanwhile, in the long term, I believe Bitcoin will have a quite profitable future for its holders.",

To make Bitcoin stronger and more trustworthy, there must be a touch of counter and balance. When FTX liquidates large amounts of its assets, it means a lot of Bitcoin is released into the market. Who will buy it? you or the whales? make a choice because this situation is quite sad but like it or not it will happen. We as small holders will definitely be affected. The right question now is, would you also sell it along with FTX? Or do you actually buy on sale? Are you strong with this negative news? If not, let go of the handle and let us take it for cheap.BTW, maybe this is Blackrock's chance to step in to buy more, worried? please enjoy the bear market, then after that we leave by fast train.Altcoins?

Looking at the price movement this year, it seems to me that Bitocoin is climbing up, but with big setbacks along the way. For example, the price was generally around $22k from mid-January till mid-March, around $27k till June, then over $29k since the end of June and till the middle of August, but now it's been around $26k for a few weeks. I hope it's a minor setback that won't spoil the general trend. And in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter if it goes up or down in the near future, as Bitcoin's life is likely to be full of bullish and bearing markets in the future with, hopefully, a continuation of the overall long-term upward trend.",

Furthermore we have experienced a bearish market in the past two years.In those two years some persons lost some money to the bearish market. Hence there have been a high anticipation of a bullish market considering we are about to experience a halving of Bitcoin in few months to come. From my point of view the future of Bitcoin in few months from now will be bearish, hence I have stacked up a few unit of Bitcoin awaiting it's bullish period so I can make some profit from this bullish future. If you want to invest in Bitcoin at this time I think it's a good idea but invest according to your available money.",
