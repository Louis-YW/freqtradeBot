We can't follow the exact sats for sure! And we don't have such solution. What I meant was we can connect addresses through UTXOs shown in transactions, for example address A is connected to address B through one[tx1,tx2,tx3,txn] or many pathsin other words, address A was found in tx1, and later down the road the address B was found in txn. I hope this explains what exactly what we have in mind.",

Basically, any blockchain explorer has the capability to display specific connections between addresses, and there have been several tools mentioned that can do this task exactly as described by the OP.So how about you at least fucking read the thread before replying with your generic nonsense?",
