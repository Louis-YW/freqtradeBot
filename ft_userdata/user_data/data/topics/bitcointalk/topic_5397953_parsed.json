  "content": "So with the nano ledger s, everytime i want to send or receive btc, i would connect my nano ledger s and go to that app and get a new send or receive address.  Then go and send or withdraw btc with that address.As long as you are generating a new address each time whether you are sending or receiving crypto to a site or someone else, then there would be no transaction history where they could check your wallet history correct?  i remember back when i used electrum, i used the same receiving address many times but then people said you should not do that.  So anyone that uses the same receiving address over again many times would mean the sites or people they send crypto to ... would not only know their wallet history but could figure out how much crypto that person has?Now let say you want to install a new app on nano ledger and say its litecoin.  Now when you install it and get a receiving address the first time and receive litecoin the first time to it, when you send some of that litecoin to someone else, there obviously is no history at all right except they could see you received x amount of litecoin the first time?  But each time you receive litecoin later on, you generate a new address because that way... the site or person who wants to see your wallet history, they could only see the movement of those litecoin to only that address? So say they sent you 6 litecoin.  Whether you keep it in your wallet or then send some to someone else, it will never show you will ever have more than 6 litecoin ever right if they wanted to see your history right?  So say next time you want lot of litecoin, let say 50 of them.  if a site or someone send you that much, you generate a new litecoin receiving address so the 50 litecoin would show there?  So you would have say 56 litecoin between two different addresses?But now say you want to send say 0.5 ltc to a site.  Will that 0.5 ltc be subtracted from the 50 litecoin you received address or the 6 litecoin you received address earlier?  Have to assume its from the last 50 right?  But what if you send say 53 ltc to someone.  Would that mean 50 would be deducted from the last 50 ltc you received and 3 would be deducted from the 6 you first received so the remaining 3 ltc you have minus the sending fees is in that first ltc receiving address?But say you receive ltc 6 times.  Each time you use different receiving address.  is there a way you could choose which ltc address you want to use to deduct the next time you send ltc to someone or this isn't possible?  i remember you could do something like this with electrum back then with change addresses with btc?  But if you do this, there would be more fees?   is there more anonymity to it?",

      "body": "Many won't be able to know how much btc you have since you use different receiving address for each transaction. If I am going to aee how much btc you have and I only know 1 transaction you made. Let's say, you have 2 btc received using receiving address #1 so, all I know is you have 2 btc in total even though you have 5 btc. About which btc address that you use to receive btc will be deducted first when you send a btc to your friend is I am not sure about which one will be deducted first but my guess is it depends on the wallet provider you use. What I have in mind is let's say that I have 3 btc in my address #1 and 2 btc in address #2 and I will send a 1.5 btc to my friend and the btc that will be deducted is address #2 which will be deducted by 1.5 btc plus transaction fee. That's what I think because each address have it's own private key.",

Whenever I spend any amount of bitcoin from Address A, the recipient of that transaction will be able to see I own 55 BTC.Let's say I receive 50 BTC to Address A. I then receive 5 BTC to a different Address B. If I spend the 5 BTC from Address B, the recipient will not know about Address A. That is, unless, I have linked Address A and Address B in a previous transaction. But if I don't specify which address to use, then my wallet might choose use Address A, and reveal the 50 BTC there to the recipient.Let's say I receive 50 BTC to Address A. I then receive 5 BTC to a different Address B. If I spend 6 BTC, then that 6 BTC will likely come from Address A, and so the recipient will now I have 50 BTC at Address A, but will not know about the 5 BTC at Address B. Unless my wallet decides to use Addresses A and B together to consolidate the coins, in which case the recipient will know about the 55 BTC across both addresses.And then you have to consider other transactions using the same addresses, or consolidating the change from such transactions.If you want to avoid linking outputs at different addresses together, then you need to practice meticulous coin control. Or even better, use different wallets for different purposes so there is no way you slip up and accidentally include two outputs at different addresses you wanted to keep separate in the same transaction.",

But I guess I understand what you're talking about. If you know beforehand that in the future, you need to pay a certain amount of money (for example, for subscription renewal), it probably makes sense to prepare some special UTXOs for that. Those UTXOs need to be completely isolated from each other and also from your other bitcoin addresses so that no one can have an idea of how much money you really have. However, you can't isolate your UTXOs just by casually transacting back and forth. You will have to utilize specific privacy techniques and different means for anonymization of bitcoin transactions in order to break the link between your \"real\" balance and your temporary payment addresses.",

But you can't connect the addresses in the future either because that's proof you have the keys for both. However if you connect your wallet with a light client such as Electrum, the server you connect to will know all your addresses and the IP that established the connection. No reason to think that Ledger Live servers function differently. @jerry0Ledger Live allows you to create multiple accounts. Take full advantage of that.

It's easier to use with Electrum because it's a cleaner interface. But I had no problem doing it from Ledger Live either.   Quote from: jerry0 on May 12, 2022, 03:55:49 AMNot sure if i ever tried this back with electrum but i recall wanting to either send or receive btc to a certain electrum address so i must have tried this a while back? Am I seeing this right? Are you asking the Bitcointalk community if you used the coin control feature on Electrum? I guess we need to start keeping track of that. I am sorry, we will do better next time. Judging by how paranoid you are, I am pretty sure you never tried coin control on Electrum.

So don't use the same receiving address in the future when you decide to buy \"a lot of LTC\". Generate a new address and deposit your purchased coins to it and keep it separate from the one you use to pay that person with. Quote from: jerry0 on May 12, 2022, 03:55:49 AM2. Download electrum LTC 3. Download trustwallet You already have a Nano S that you can use with Litecoin. Why would you consider using something that is less safe like 3rd-party software wallets? Stick with the Nano S and use different addresses and accounts for different needs.Pretty certain i used the coin control feature or something like that on electrum.  i remember btc showing in so many of my addreses in my old electrum where you get so many tiny amounts of btc.  Asked how do i get btc sent from a certain address in electrum and recall they mention how to do it.  Recalled very well when i did this, i had to pay more fees than usual because i was combining inputs?  That is term for this?  Recall i did this few times in electrum.  So coin control would cost you more or same when sending?Well the reason why i was considering using electrum ltc or trustwallet is because it will have max 50 dollars on it.  Probably would have no more than 20 dollars total only.  So i want that ltc wallet to be strictly for these small 5 dollar payments that i have to do.  So because of that, kind of don't want to install ltc app on nano ledger because lf i say i have say only 5 dollars worth of ltc in my nano ledger, now let say i want to buy say 50 ltc from coinbase or whatnot in the future.  Then when i send that amount of ltc to nano ledger... it would be sent to a different ltc address on my nano ledger.  So would have say ltc address a with 5 dollars worth.  And ltc address b would have say 5000 dollars worth.  How do i make sure that ltc address a never ever get mixed with address b?  So say now i want to send 60 dollars worth of ltc to that same person but don't have enough in address a.  How would i use coin control here?  Certainly i can't do this right?  Because i only have max 5 dollars worth of ltc in address a and 5k worth of ltc in address b?  i obviously can't send like 55 dollars worth of ltc from address b to a... before sending it to that same person since they would see the connection?  So only way would be withdraw like 55-60 dollars from a gambling site and either request them to send to address a.... or send to new address... then send the 60 dollars worth of ltc to the same guy?  Makes the most sense to reuse address A then right here since the 5 dollars worth of ltc would then be between 60-65 dollars so i could make payment to the same person?But what happens when you have some change in your everyday wallet and you don't think you would ever use it anymore.  Let say it could be 50 dollars worth or up to 500 dollars worth.  Say you don't want to leave it in that nano ledger address a anymore and want it combined so to speak.  Only way i could see no issue is if you send all the ltc from address a to an exchange like coinbase to keep there or cash out for something else because obviously security and privacy issues or not much of a concern since they have tons of customers with tons of money.",

We already covered this. Can you please pay attention to what is being written? Create a new Litecoin account on your Nano S. Call it \"Monthly $5 payments to Mister X\" or whatever you want to call it. Generate a new receiving address in that account and top it up with the LTC you intend to send to that mystery person you keep mentioning. That's it. Don't use that account and all of the other addresses in it for any other purposes! It only serves to send that monthly $5 payment and nothing else. If you decide to purchase 5000 LTC in the future, and you don't want there to be a connection between those coins and the ones in your \"Monthly $5 payments to Mister X\" account, create a brand-new (second) Litecoin account on your Nano S. Call it \"My long-term LTC bag\". Deposit your 5000 LTC in one of its addresses and you are done. Whatever you do in the future with either of the two accounts, they won't be connected unless you deposit or request a deposit to be made in the wrong one.",

Yes, just generate a new receiving address in the account you created for those small LTC deposits.

If you have only funded that account with one $50 LTC deposit, it's obvious that's all you have. You can't select a second input if it's not there. If you want to send something, the funds for the new transaction have to come from that previous $50 deposit. Coin control helps you when you have multiple inputs of $5, $10, $15, $25, $50 worth of LTC, for example. With coin control, you decide which of those inputs you want to spend.",
