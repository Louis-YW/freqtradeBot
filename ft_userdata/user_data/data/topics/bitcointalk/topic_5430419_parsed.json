      "body": "1. There's no USDT token that run in Binance network (BEP-2), but there's USDT token that run in Binance smart chain network (BEP-20) since you're mention Pancakeswap, you're mistaken to write BEP-2 instead of BEP-20 since this swap platform only accept BEP-20. Yes you can, but you need to import the Bitgert coin first from Coinmarketcap, make sure you're check the contract first.Quote from: https://pancakeswap.finance/Anyone can create a BEP20 token on Binance Smart Chain with any name, including creating fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that claim to represent projects that do not have a token.If you purchase an arbitrary token, you may be unable to sell it back.2. Just use blockchair or any other blockchain trackers.",

      "body": "1. You can't swap anything on pancakeswap using an exchange address mate, you have no control of the Bigert address so how will you connect your Bitgert address to pancakeswap for swapping? Use your trust wallet or other to connect and buy USDT on Pancakeswap then send to Bitgert.2. You can track all tokens holder using the token smart contract address on Bscscan or Etherscan.",

BEP-2 address will start with \"bnbxxx\" while BEP-20 will start with \"0xyyy\" or same like ERC-20 address.",
