But you are correct; as we have always explained, never trust any centralized exchange with your funds. We have no choice but to use for trading. However, for holding purposes, assets should be moved to a secure wallet. Because an incident with the exchange could occur at any time, or they would go bankrupt as well.On the other hand, after the crashes of Luna and FTX native coin, it's become challenging to believe any altcoin. It doesn't matter if it was planned, but we're losing at the end of the day. As a result, even if we choose an altcoin or stick with Bitcoin, we must be very selective.",

Especially, when you're trying to get more people to adopt Bitcoin. Since, without having the ease of use that these centralised figures provide, people wouldn't adopt. Almost every single new investor that doesn't know much about Bitcoin will be going through a centralised exchange, since the process is streamlined. A peer to peer exchange wouldn't be of benefit to them as there's too many additional steps. Centralisation, and third parties will always be a benefit, however over reliance on them isn't. People just need to know the risks of these third parties, and the best practices when dealing with them. For example, purchasing your Bitcoin in small increments via an exchange isn't a problem, it's the storing of those coins on a centralised wallet that's the problem.",

For most who are not yet here, they thought crypto is a scam. But they only need right information to understand what the OP stated. Those simple lessons will give them good approach towards crypto and find ways how to secure their assets away from fraudulent sites and projects.",

However, people are now wary of exchanges because of their numerous annoying features, such as the ability to suspend withdrawals and the proverbial \"not your keys, not your coins.\" There is nothing more intriguing than having complete control over your coin rather than having your assets in the hands of another person. Investing in bitcoin is preferable, but given the current state of affairs, some people will still choose alternative coins that will increase 100 times their value. Not all alternative coins will survive this period.",

Your money will be safe since hacking is highly not possible. And if you go for potential coins to invest, it’s always bitcoin that gives high dominance compared to random altcoins.

Do you also never trust this type of exchange?By the way, since you never trust an exchange, does it mean you never use the exchanges to trade your coins? Or do you only never trust to keep your coins there? I think you need to explain this matter in more detail. Newbies/beginners probably don't get your point.Quote from: Ojima-ojo on November 22, 2022, 07:18:22 PM2: never n trust any other coin aside from Bitcoin for long-term goals, most especially the highly centralized altcoin as there are open to external influence just like centralized exchanges are also exposed to external influence.If the reason is the possibility of price huge declines such as Luna and FTX, it can happen at any time.  Even if you hold the coins for a short-term goal, it doesn't mean you can avoid the risk of freefall price possibility.IMO, once you distrust other coins, simply don't hold them both for the long-term and the short-term goals.",

As humans are not 100%decent likewise the centralized exchanges in which so many people entrust their funds probably because they have been in existence for a long time but at the end they bring up issues regarding the missing funds or scams. Lesson 2)  is well understood because Bitcoin is not on the same level as the other shit coins because most of the shit coins have no lifespan they can appear within a space of few days they won't be fund again but the case of bitcoin is different because bitcoin has been the oldest and the most recognized cryptocurrency in the world so investing in cryptocurrency whether short or long team the only option is Bitcoin and nothing else.",

So this is not just about centralized exchanges. This is about any platform that keeps your money. So this covers the likes of FTX, 3AC, Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, and others. They all went awry. Again, what we need to avoid are not just exchanges but also hedge fund sites, investment platforms offering unsustainably high yields, fake DeFi apps, crypto lending companies, and the rest. However, your conclusion is not precisely correct. Quote from: Ojima-ojo on November 22, 2022, 07:18:22 PMSo I am led to the conclusion that, cryptocurrency is not the problem...To a certain extent, they are also the problem. Terra (LUNA) is a cryptocurrency. Solana (SOL) is a cryptocurrency. They are a problem. So while there is always a human factor that causes problems-- the tendency to buy their coins, for example, hoping that they will grow in price-- there is also the fact that cryptocurrencies nowadays are mostly faulty or outright scams. This is probably the reason why Bitcoin, not crypto somewhat became a battle cry for some Bitcoin supporters.",
