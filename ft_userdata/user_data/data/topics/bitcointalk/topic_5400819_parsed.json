This number can be anything, even higher than 100%, for example 1726%, or 6%.What does this metric mean?Iirc from the days I've been mining it's a wildly rough estimation based on the time needed by that pool to find the previous block or blocks.A simplistic math would say that if that pool got previous block in 2h and now they're mining for 1h, then it's 50% of their estimated effort. If 3h have passed and still no block found, then it's 150%.",

So effort means endeavor/exertion.Quote from: https://hashvault.pro/help/en/mining-terminology/effort/Effort is measure how many hashes our pool made to find a block. If a block was found exactly when predicted (based on global hashrate, pool hashrate and block time/difficulty)",
