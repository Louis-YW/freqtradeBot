Some words seem to indicate a topic type ([ASK]), others seem more like cathegories ([TELEGRAM]).Is there a description of why, how and when to use this?",

Most users use a note in the thread description to directly let the reader know what the thread is about. The most frequently used references are probably the following:[DIS] for a discussion thread.[INFO] for an info thread on a specific topic.[UPDATED] for a thread that recently got updated.[ANN] for an announcement thread of a specific project - most commonly used in the altcoin and services section.[BOUNTY] for a bounty thread.[Service/Open/CNFP etc.] for certain service or campaign threads.However, there are no general rules. Just use these as you like, or don't.",
