  "content": "World Cup Group AWe expect the Netherlands to top this group without too much difficulty, although their trickiest game will be their opening one against Senegal whose squad includes international superstars such as Sadio Mane and Kalidou Koulibaly. Senegal will be favourites to qualify for the last 16 behind the Netherlands, but don’t rule out Qatar putting up a fight to grab the coveted second group place. Whilst Ecuador finished a respectable 4th in World Cup qualifying, we think that Qatar will sneak a victory in the opening game of the tournament which puts them ahead in the final standings.  We saw what Russia did in 2018 as the home team making it to the quarter-finals and home field will help Qatar. First match Qatar vs. Ecuador the best bet is Qatar + 0.50. Predictions and Reviews of all matches",

I'm not talking about top teams against lesser teams, but against teams that are about equal. Then you could place a bet that the match is still a draw after 15 minutes. No guarantee of success, but there is some value in it. Difficult to say for the opening game of Qatar - Ecuador, but Qatar will go full steam ahead and it will probably storm, but the bookmakers still think Ecuador is better.",
