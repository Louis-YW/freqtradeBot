  "content": "Hi everyone!It’s been a long while since I last visited and posted here. We’ve been busy with our business at Ballet, and now we have something fun to share with this amazing community here:We are happy to announce here that Ballet will soon be launching the sale of physical bitcoins, similar to the loaded Casascius coins of the early days, but this time in a metal, credit card form factor (just like the Ballet cold storage wallets). This new product is called the Loaded PURE Bitcoin, and buyers will receive actual “physical” bitcoin in the mail, held and stored safely in these loaded cards. What Mike Caldwell had to stop with Casascius coins ten years ago, we are now restarting at Ballet!There are four denominations available, which are 0.1, 0.025, 0.01, and 0.005 BTC.This new way to buy bitcoin allows you to skip the hassle and risks of using an exchange. (And also there’s no need to request to withdraw the BTC from the exchange after the purchase!) No account creation is needed although there is still a need for KYC for higher value transactions. This Ballet product is a truly safe and convenient way to invest in and accumulate bitcoin, by directly holding it in physical cold storage. Your keys, your bitcoin.Due to regulatory restrictions, the product is initially only available for sale in 25 states in the United States. (These 25 states are: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. This list is subject to change, and we will continue to work on expanding the coverage area to additional states in the future.)If you reside in one of the states where this is available, we would greatly appreciate it if you could help us test the product and purchase process, by giving it a try and sharing your feedback on the experience.After the order is placed, we will send you the PURE Bitcoin card. Once you have received the package, please use the Ballet Crypto app to confirm that you have received the card, and then the bitcoin will be loaded onto the card. (For a few states, the cards will be shipped pre-loaded for compliance reasons, and those shipments will be insured accordingly.)We accept payment by credit card, debit card, and ACH bank transfer. Payment by wire transfer will also be added soon. We will also consider adding payment by BTC if there’s sufficient interest. Please note: the bitcoin price is locked in at the time of purchase. (Due to the volatile nature of bitcoin prices, refunds and returns are not accepted, but we will offer a buy-back policy for people to sell back their bitcoin purchase if they’re not satisfied with the product.)To place an order for “Loaded PURE Bitcoin”, please visit: https://bitcoin.ballet.comIf you have any questions, feel free to contact us at:support@ballet.comHope you like this new product, and that you can help us test it! Please share your comments and feedback here in this thread. Long live Bitcoin!thanks,Bobby",

It would be more interesting if this was pure mint BTC coming right from the miners rewards to be loaded on these cards just like the BTCC.  Also special sleeves for these would also make a big difference as well when being presented.   Other than that looking forward to your answers on this...cheers",

I hope in the future you attempt to recapture the essence of what made physical bitcoin so special to begin with. Rarity and scarcity are the heart of driving sales. Icluding things like dates, mintage, and unique characteristics is the reason why customers become return buyers. Its the reason why your BTCCs are atill so highly sought after. I understand that you're juggling mass production and mainstream adoption and i hope that you can find a way to implement the chaacteristics that make me want to keep my ballet wallet in a glass case. I look forward to your new products and seeing what you come up with.",

      "body": "Nice product Bobby. Thanks for sharing this with us here on the forum and I echo Miner Jones' congrats. I will buy quite a few. I see the very simple business case for these being generic and love that you are putting these out there for sale. However, this is a collectors forum so you know this crowd will clamor for scarcity (above the Bitcoin being scarce of course). I like Krog's suggestion of considering pure mined coin versions, which may already be the case, and CryptoGreatDane's and Cygan's suggestion for a numbered collector series or special characteristics to make them collectibles. I'm buying all these regardless but those features would be nice additions. Steeley",
