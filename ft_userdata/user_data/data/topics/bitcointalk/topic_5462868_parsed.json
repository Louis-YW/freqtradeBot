Some potential implications:- Millions of existing PayPal users will have exposure to cryptocurrency benefits  - It could expand access to faster and cheaper payments, especially for remittances- PayPal would be well-positioned to provide crypto lending services to users- It could accelerate the use of stablecoins for e-commerce and other digital transactions- But regulatory uncertainty remains around stablecoinsDo you think this will be a landmark development for crypto going mainstream?

I think it's just a representation of the PP service with all terms of use.Quote- It could expand access to faster and cheaper payments, especially for remittancesPP doesn't even have to use the term \"fast and cheap\" as the USP of their product, if used outside the ecosystem of the platform it will depend on the Ethereum network and the user's transaction self-settings.",

Share your thoughts and predictions!Not really a landmark development case, Paypal must change its approach and be more innovative by adapting to the changing times and this will eventually happen, Paypal has lost the competition as the sole and leading payment processor because of the emergence of Cryptocurrency.Paypal still wants to capture or recapture its market by adapting Cryptocurrency and at the same time taking full control and being centralized and launching its stable coin is the key to this.Now that they've launched their stablecoin they will have a stronghold in the market, now that they are more in Cryptocurrency I see them launching more products and services related to Cryptocurrency but of course with centralized features.",

Of course, the company that mints USDT (Tether) cannot be trusted to keep it fully pegged, but do you honestly think that PayPal USD will get huge adoption?It has a huge disadvantage that it's a completely different token (I don't think even ERC-20, otherwise that would mean Paypal depends on decentralized Ethereum) and hence not accepted as payment by pretty much the entire internet. It would also compete with whatever CDBC the governments are trying to come up with.Even with none of the advantages, it still carries the negative stigma of being associated with \"crypto\" so the only realistic outcome I see for this product is a fast and swift demise.",

Just basic info and linking cards and bank accounts.Pretty much depends on whom you ask.Besides, by linking cards and providing one's address to Paypal, they have pretty much everything they need to search much of one's personal finances (assuming one's bank comply with their information requests).Who knows, perhaps Paypal is going into crypto now, they may be forced by authorities to enforce even tighter KYC policies, compared to those we have accustomed to see on exchanges. Those policies were implanted on exchanges, because the control over the money belong to the user once crypto leaves to a private non custodial wallet, if Paypal allows to withdraw in the same way, then it will happen what I say about KYC.",

      "body": "News update and Paypal is not only going to attack the stablecoin market.It was declared that NFTs are dead, however, why is Paypal filing patents for NFT trading and transfer? What I speculate is very clear for much of the people in the forum. What we have witnessed on 2017 with Cryptokitties and Cryptorocks were only the beginning. The bluechip NFTs might become native store of value assets for the cryptospace and DeFi with small marketcap NFTs fighting for their place to get the bluechip classification.Digital payments giant PayPal has filed a patent application for a system that would enable the transfer and trading of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) within its network. The company’s application would allow users to buy and sell NFTs using fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies directly on PayPal’s platform. This move comes as the popularity of NFTs continues to grow, with more and more artists and creators using them to sell digital assets such as artwork and music. PayPal’s entry into the NFT market could make it easier for both buyers and sellers to use the technology.Source https://coinpedia.org/crypto-live-news/paypal-seeks-patent-for-nft-trading-and-transfer/",
