  "content": "I'm sure majority here has experience this kind phenomena called \"Near Miss\".What is Near Miss?Quote“Near-miss” events, where unsuccessful outcomes are proximal to the jackpot, increase gambling propensity and may be associated with the addictiveness of gambling, but little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie their potency.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2658737/I personally experienced this last night when I did play on a landbased casinos and I thought that I'm going to win big. But the impact though, not just to me but for sure those who love to play slot games are huge. Psychologically, something is telling you to go and put more money, as maybe next time you will be lucky to win the major or grand jackpot. But logically speaking, we should consider this near misses as just other non-winning outcome. The thing though is that there could be gamblers who come across with it and think that they \"almost won\". And then the cycle starts and you fall and become a gambling addict.Image Source- How did you cope with this kind of phenomena?- Did you continue to play or just quit after experiencing it?- Are slot games random or it was design to give us this kind of outcome to make us feel like we almost win and so we might feel on the addiction side?This is more prevalent to slot games though, but it could be applicable to sports betting as well. Let's say you do a parlay and you got 3 out of 4 wins.",
