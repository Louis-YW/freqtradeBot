  "content": "Need some help with my Moonlander 2 setupI have the moonlanders connected to a Raspberry Pi, but sometimes when everything boots up, the miners are not detected by bfgminer.If i do + in bfgminer and scan all, it will detect them and start working... but my point is i want this completely automated and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.If i do bfgminer Settings and do restart miner it will also work and detect the moonlanders and start working,Is there any way of editing the startup script on the Pi or bfgminer to keep scanning or retrying/loop/delay until all moonlanders are found and then continue mining?I've tried bfgminer write to config file, but that doesn't seem to affect the hit and miss nature of them loading from cold start.I want zero touch, but at the moment it's 40% working due to not always connecting to the moonlanders on first boot.I can't keep the miners all 24/7, as it's a solar setup where batteries are charged during the winter months, hence the daily timer to start/stop the Raspi Pi and Moonlanders.Any help appreciated",
