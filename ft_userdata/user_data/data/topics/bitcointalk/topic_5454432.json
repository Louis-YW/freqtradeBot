This shit token isn’t new because this Pi Network was announced last 2018 and until now this bullshit mining still doesn't materialize on a mainnet or gives real value to the tokens.

Do you remember TBC? The coin that increases its value everyday without cutting the supply. It happened that Pi is doing the same that are convincing merchants to accept Pi as a payment method for their products. There are testimonies too just like TBC. There are many peoepl who are waiting and hoping to see their Pi coin to be sellable on the market but I don't think it will be possible that everyone can sell theirs. Majority of the Pi fans wants to sell and I'm sure that the liquidity will be swiped instantly if there's a miracle that it will be listed on a DEX. I'm pertaining to those Pi who are being mined and earned.",

But in reality its hard for this coin to get listed on exchange since even the dev seems don't have plan for any exchange listing where there community could benefit with. They are the one who's enjoying the site traffic and what worst is their miners need to submit their Kyc details and that is really dangerous since any harm could happen to them if Pi dev will gone crazy and do worst thing.",
