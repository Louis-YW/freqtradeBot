  "content": "What happened::  Yolo89 took a 220$ loan from me on 23rd january which he promised to repay within 24hrs. But he simply delayed the process by giving some reasons. And today he just deleted all our telegram chats and blocked me. I gave him a loan even while he was a newbie just based on the VIP diamond 3 stake account screenshots shown by him to me on tg. However, this was my first and last time dealing with such a newbie. Please tag him!

I didnt try to contact on this number coz of my own privacy. He very politely convinced me from the start though. I am ashamed of myself that I got fooled by his words.@shasan, I completely agree with you now and I wont be taking anymore risks with new accounts and untrusted ppl. @All, Unfortunately, I didn't take any tg screenshots of the chat, but I think now its not even necessary since the proof of loan is already there in the lending board. Anyway, type 3 flag created: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3100Please support!",

Why would he care that he destroyed the reputation of only one BTT account, when there are probably who knows how many more with which he will try to make a new scam? If things like this happen publicly, I wonder what is happening through private messages and through Telegram, where there are certainly a lot of victims who will not publicly admit that they were naive.In the end, the OP should be happy that his loan didn't include another 0, because a few hundred $ most people will somehow manage to survive and forget.",
