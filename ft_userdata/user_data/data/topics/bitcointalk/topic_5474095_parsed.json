      "body": "What are you reasons of selling the domain because you cannot just come to the forum and says you are selling this and that without a concrete reason. At least make some clear reasons so that those who interested to buy can contact you and discuss but for like this and the way I see the domain name and the way you described it, it looks like a cryptocurrency and if it is a cryptocurrency then I don't think anyone will be interested to acquire it.I will advise you that instead of selling it why can't you develop the project and use it because you can't just develop litecoin.xxx and place it on sale. It looks suspicious.",
