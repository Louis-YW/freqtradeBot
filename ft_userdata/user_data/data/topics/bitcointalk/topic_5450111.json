But I will explain further that if it is gambling using money for it on gambling sites, that investing in bitcoin is not the same as gambling on gambling sites, they are different.If the argument continues and I explain further and they did not accept, there are some arguments like that, that will not end.

Well first of all, bitcoin investment and gambling are totally different things but in the case of you investing in other altcoins that are not reliable then I think its fair that we can relate it to gambling because you never know what's gonna happen with coins as your investment can just go sideways and you will lose your money which is almost same thing with gambling but gambling is more complex because you cant actually study the odds where as in market you successful study the charts like you stated. Gambling is normally based on the factor of luck let's take for example sports gambling and soccer to be specific, you can stay up all night and carefully browse or check the stats of a team that's want to play but as soon you eventually place a bet on that team, you will then discover that the outcome of the result will be different from what you predicted and if luck doesn't shine on you, you will end up losing a lot of cash on gambling.",

They knows already but wanting to pull out your legs to see your innermost answer but believe me or not there is no way in a day you could compare bitcoin investment to gambling.Let say they gambles with $2k and expected to win $100k maybe after the day or the week, probably the game went against them and they lost a total sum of $2k is there any way to get it back from the casino? Obviously No because nothing to hold at that point in time, but what about bitcoin investment? You may use same value and invest into bitcoin, is either the price will increase or decrease and if the price decrease all you need to do is to be patient for like 2 months or at max 1 yearÂ  you will still get back same value worth in btc but increased in usd equivalent, that is to say you may have $3k increased but same fractions of bitcoin left still there in your wallet. Do not argue a blind argument next time!",

Everyone has the freedom to decide how to use their money - whether to invest it or gamble it. It can be difficult to argue with gamblers who believe that what you're doing is also gambling. They are entitled to their opinion, so it's important to respect it. Additionally, it's true that investing in Bitcoin can be considered a gamble or even gambling to some. There's no guarantee that you'll have a higher success rate investing in Bitcoin compared to gambling, as some gamblers make a lot of money using skill-based gambling, which is more similar to trading.",

So no point you wasting your time anymore explaining to them but I believe with time they would give you accolades for your bravery. Friends do act that way though because I have had that similar experience with my friends and at the entire end they told me they only acted up so they could not get embarrassed as they already know that their argument was not substantial to hold onto.",

Gambling is a gamble to make quick money, like instantly, and relies mostly (if not at all) on luck. Investing, on the other hand, may require a touch of luck, but most of it is relying on the asset you're trusting to grow other time, and with that, also results in your money \"growing\" over time. It's not an instant \"hey I'm rich\" one-time thing, it's a constant progress where your money makes more money. Imo there's no sense in comparing losses between the two, you lose in both of them either way, it's better to compare the methods you gain money from both of them. And I'd hardly blame them, I also consider investing as a form (of some sort) of a gamble really, but it isn't gambling like in casinos which rely on luck, simple as that.",
