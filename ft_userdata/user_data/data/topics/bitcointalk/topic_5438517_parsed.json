  "content": "QuoteMarx's RevengeIn what's perhaps an attempt to head off bad press — or, at very least, convince people he's not the bad guy — OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has given Forbes an interview in which he claims that his for-profit company is ultimately going to bring about capitalism's downfall.First, some context. Altman, who is also the president of the uber-influential Y Combinator startup incubator, is one of only OG OpenAI cofounders still standing. The company's decision to go from more of a research vehicle to a for-profit venture in 2019 was somewhat overshadowed by his fellow cofounder Elon Musk's decision to leave the firm — over some seemingly huge disagreements about its direction.The CEO behind the record-breaking ChatGPT has a bit of a strange background, the TL;DR of which being that he once admitted to being a doomsday prepper who believes that killer artificial intelligence or a lab-modified virus could bring about the end of days.Much of the OpenAI CEO's rhetoric in his recent Forbes exclusive hinges on the future — the future of the company, of course, but also on the future of AI in general, and how Altman believes it will dovetail with sentient AIs, otherwise known as artificial general intelligence (AGI).Anxious General IntelligenceWhile Altman doesn't think we're that close to AIs gaining consciousness — a belief that's not quite shared by fellow OG OpenAI-er Ilya Sutskever — he did tell Forbes that creating AGI is \"the thrust that drives all my actions\" and, it seems, his raison d'etre for the firm.In one exchange, Forbes' Alex Konrad noted the inherent tension regarding capitalism that's found between OpenAI's \"research-driven\" foundation and the buckets of money investors have put into it. Altman had a provocative response.\"I think capitalism is awesome. I love capitalism,\" he told Forbes. \"Of all of the bad systems the world has, it's the best one — or the least bad one we found so far. I hope we find a way better one.\"\"I think that if AGI really truly fully happens,\" he continued, \"I can imagine all these ways that it breaks capitalism.\"If you're confused by this response, you're not alone. But then again, OpenAI itself was founded to head off the worst outcomes of AGI and is now apparently gunning to make it a reality — so confusion is, it seems, the most rational response to that revelation.https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-ceo-agi-break-capitalism....AGI (artificial general intelligence) maximalists claim their technology carries a potential to eliminate many skilled labor jobs in tech industries.Given the massive leap in technology from home PCs 20 years ago with 64 megabytes of RAM and 300 megahertz CPUs leading to the present. Its difficult to imagine or predict how much technology can advance within a relatively short span of time.Past studies have claimed as much as 50% of skilled labor in tech industries might be vulnerable to automation:https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/04/24/a-study-finds-nearly-half-of-jobs-are-vulnerable-to-automationI feel like this topic might need tiktok reactions to truly do it justice and put it into perspective.",

It sounds too much, one thing is letting a machine to face costumers in a Macdonalds but it is very different letting a machine to do science by itself.",

They are just tools for solving narrow problems. And we don't even have a good idea how general intelligence works, how our brains work. So how can we recreate it even without understanding it?

If we look the past, we will see many jobs that existed before don't exist anymore, because they were automated. And that isn't a bad thing, since it has brought more confort to civilization, while those humans can still occupy another jobs' spots.Also, new categories of jobs more related to humanist area, where the direct contact between individuals is the focus, with emphasis on sensorial aspects tend to take place, as that is something AIs can't execute with excellency.",

For the moment there are still at least 2 pilots in the cabin, despite the autopilots.It's certain that artificial intelligence will help tech workers, and reduce the amount of work needed for some redundant tasks, but I think we still have a few decades before we can replace them completely. We can also say that in many countries (in Africa, South America, Eastern and Southern Europe, or Asia) human workers could cost much less than artificial intelligence licenses. I think Hispo is right, even if technology is progressing, we are far from seeing it do our work for us in a completely independent way. 50% of unemployed people in the tech industry seems big to me.",

I also love capitalism...However, I cannot but admit that capitalism does not solve the most important task of mankind - the task of preserving man as a species.  We are currently observing how the Earth's natural resources are being exploited.  But these riches belong not only to modern capitalists, but also to future (not yet born) generations of earthlings. I don't like socialism.  However, there are concepts of the communist structure of social society.  For example, such a concept was developed in detail by the Soviet science fiction writer Ivan Yefremov.  At the moment, this seems like a utopia, but given modern information processing technologies (exceeding Ivan Efremov's wildest hopes), we can conclude that the concept of a humanistic communist society can be realized.  Modern neural networks can ensure the management of such a complex social society, and people can concentrate on creativity, exploits, self-improvement and achieving happiness for themselves and their neighbors on the planet!",
