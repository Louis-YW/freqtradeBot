  "content": "I admit I'm always looking at the mempool and at the fees more than one should, a few $ there and there when multiplied by a dozen start to sting so I have the habit of checking it all the time, and a few days ago I saw that spike in fees, I never realized what the crash in volume afterwards was, it passed but it's still bugging me a lot  that I have to ask about. Assuming both mempools dropped a lot of tx as they've reached the max size at the same time why hasn't the mempool filed up back again with transactions lover than 2sat/b as I don't doubt there are nodes with far more space than 300MB that would have still held them in their own pool and broadcast them??*guess I'm still a newbie so images don't show unfortunately!*should this be in technical or simple discussion?",

Consolidation should be done with cheap transaction fee. If in future, they must move their bitcoin when mempools are more loaded with higher fee rate, they can accept higher fee rate but with less inputs, they will save transaction fee.Quote from: The Hidebehinder on August 03, 2023, 01:19:34 PMAssuming both mempools dropped a lot of tx as they've reached the max size at the same time why hasn't the mempool filed up back again with transactions lover than 2sat/b as I don't doubt there are nodes with far more space than 300MB that would have still held them in their own pool and broadcast them??There are many mempools and each mining pools will have their full nodes and own settings for their mempools and how long they will drop unconfirmed transactions in their mempools.Usually it is 14 days but mempools can be set to be shorter or longer.Code:mempoolexpiry=336They can set it to 336 hours (14 days) and change it to longer or shorter.",

They are just discarded and someone has to rebroadcast them. The memory usage of mempool functions slightly differently from your actual memory, and there are overheads. In fact, the minrelayfee right now is around 3sat/byte instead of 1.If purging were to be done, then it would be the lowest fee rates first. In this case, you can observe a substantial decrease in size of both 1sat/byte and 2sat/byte, which is unlikely to happen if the nodes were to only purge those transactions that only pays 1 sat/byte. As far as I know, mempool.space does have a larger mempool size than most. More likely than not, some of the transactions were RBFed and thus you can observe a corresponding spike in the high fee rate transactions.",

I would have probably done the same, just pay 5-10$ and get it off my mind.",

I was looking at mempool.space's far better visualization. I don't think Mempool.space actually purges the transaction in this manner, or else we wouldn't see any 1-3sat/byte transaction in their graph right now. Their site says anything below <3sat/byte is being purged but a good proportion of their mempool graph still comprises of that.There is a 7MB decrease in the composition of 2-3sat/byte transaction around the same period of time. The alternate possibility is a bunch of RBFs that shifted the transactions in the graph while maintaining similar total size.",
