  "content": "Hello everyone am a new member here. Haven't posted anything here since i registered because i was kinda  ghost Reading (if it's even a word). I experienced the issue of \"your IP address having evil points\" which i believe some other newbies experienced most especially from my country Nigeria while creating an account. Read on how to bypass this setback from various thread and found out that it can be solved through whitelisting, paying the charge and through a VPN. I found whitelisting stressful while paying the charge a loss since the exchange I use has a higher minimum transfer than my penalty, so had to pick VPN which worked but after downloading various vpns. the only one that worked for me was the Turbo VPN. I found out that those that recommended VPN ( that I read) didn't specify a VPN so if it's wrong of me to state their names please let me know. Have always took myself as someone that has done his homework on bitcoin before I came here, oh boy was i wrong certain post I came across like:Maestro75      : Do you struggle learning Bitcoin?BlackHatCoiner   : Thoughts on Bitcoin's sustainability on the long term1miau      :Bitcoin Halving only 1 year away (This reminded me that entering Bitcoin now is not too late)fillippone        : Debunking the \"Bitcoin is an environmental disaster\" argumentAnd some others i couldnt mention gave me nice insight and more reason to observe, learn before posting a thing on any forum. Posting now doesn't mean am done learning, my fingers were just excited to post something. there are other's that I found exciting but it wasn't easy to navigate through other posts so would be happy if I could be recommended some of this hidden gems to broaden my horizon. it can be based on the author personal opinion on bitcoin and a certain alt coin (opinions which I always find interesting), on economics and also on technical analysis( something simple and informative)P.S I met some roadblock on certain post so do recommend English or pidgin  please, and also non English one's that can be Google translatedThe way I linked the Post's I used looks cool right? I found it cool because it's the highest have come to programming.

You can even use TOR to access the forum if you’re big on privacy, your account will not be banned for this.",

If the newbie understands that, he can pay 1 satoshi not more than that, but if the newbie only has their own wallet, if an exchange, of course, they can't pay 1 satoshi, because exchange, as I know min 50,000 sat to withdraw.And surprise you received merit less than an hour which means your post is a bit more quality for other members.",

I've created my account like a week ago where my friends introduced me the forum but sadly I got some evil points, it's my first account in the forum so I don't know why I got evil points. Knowing that I'm innocent I tried to search how could I clean my name to the forum then I found Loyce's whitelisting thread. I emailed all of their emails convincing them that I'm innocent and promised that I'll also contribute to the forum as well. I already have background to the forum since my friends taught me how can I explore and how can I'll learn with loads of information that posted here plus even decades have passed some post are still in here which I found cool!",

There's also this simple, quick read FAQ that would save you from a lot of scam attemps, see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5363505You could also try to find threads on your own by appending \"site:bitcointalk.org\" in your web search engine e.g. google, duckduckgo, etc. We do have a built-in search function on the forum but I've always had better results with the mentioned method hence recommend it more.",

It will help you get used to the forum and contribute meaningfully to the forum. It will also assist you to know the rule of the forum so that you will abide by them. Some members violate the rule not intentionally but because they are not aware of the forum laws. My advice is that you keep learning by reading and contributing in areas you feel you can.

Look for online reviews of various VPNs and look for their speed and privacy. It's important for VPN providers not to hold your data so it can't be used later to track you.

I have checked out the forums rule and the Nigeria forum, but I can't really locate where I can introduce myself.I do not quite understand why you introduce yourself? You've come to the forum; you don't owe anything else. You must not give your name or any of your details, including your country or place of residence. The fact that you want to communicate in a certain local section does not mean that you need to declare yourself. People will see your presence; what matters is how you show yourself, whether you are really interested in the forum, or whether you appeared here by accident. In addition, I will add another link that can be useful to you for online privacy.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5434404.msg61717956#msg61717956Quote from: coupable on April 14, 2023, 10:48:32 PMI do not think that the use of VPN is allowed to be used either to register or to log in.  I don't think the forum forbids changing the IP. How do you think people who were previously banned appear here several times? In fact, this problem is very easily solved; using a proxy, such as Socks5, and a VPN will quickly solve the problem with the blacklist. If the forum banned the use of TOR and VPN, then, for some reason, it seems to me that the number of registered users would decrease by three times.",
