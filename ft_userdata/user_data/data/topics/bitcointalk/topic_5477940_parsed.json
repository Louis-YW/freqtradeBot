But if you have another mobile banking app make use of it to make things smooth and easy for you, by being stranded waiting till dea resolve their problem.",

This is usual with Kuda and it is always disappointing when I have not experienced anything like that on Opay. I will advice you to use Opay more often. You can also have both in case if one is not working, the other will be working. Palmpay is also good.",

      "body": "I make use of Kuda too, and I noticed the warning earlier today, but lucky for me, that's not the only active bank that I make use of. Although their card fiction is still working, I used the card to fund my Opay account since the money I have there was just below #100,000. I had to move the balance down to my Opay account, and from my Opay, I was able to slip all the funds down to my monipoint and other bank apps I have on my phone.Â If you have a card from Kuda Bank and it's still active, I will advise you to use the card to make an online deposit into your Opay account. Using the card fund option, a code will be sent to your line. When you register your Kuda account, you can use the code to authorise the transaction. At the moment, it's only the card payment that's going through, so if you need funds, you should take advantage of that until they are done with their upgrade.",

You can check now mine is opened after the maintenance. I just made a post sharing my kuda screenshot few minutes ago.",

      "body": "It's very embarrassing seeing all these comments that kuda is known for steady maintenance, I have never used them and did not even plan on using kuda nor have I opened any account in kuda. When it first came i never liked them, opay has been my choice since 2020 and I am doing just fine with them. Op I would like to advise you that you make you useÂ  of op since this maintenance issue is a continuous event that consume a lot of time. Beside I believe maintenance should be done at midnight and not in the day that they experience lots of traffic.",

Next time when something like this happens before you panic, go to the company official social media handle on X (formerly known as Twitter) or Facebook and see the reason why such a thing is happening. At all points companies always drop update on their social media handles.",
