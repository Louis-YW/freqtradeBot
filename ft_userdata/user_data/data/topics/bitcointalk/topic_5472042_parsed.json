  "content": "When you hear of a forum having a board about services, what springs to mind should be posts about hiring people and looking to get hired. The board for services in bitcointalk is literally flooded with posts about signature campaigns however. And as these posts get constantly bumped by new responses, they come on top all the time while any poor person trying to advertise their service can only post one bump a day... A possible solution would be to simply create a new board for signature campaign topics. Let's call it Forum Campaigns for example. Review and signature campaigns can be posted there. Another thing to maybe make the services board more lively would be to create a new section for those seeking to hire people to do tasks. This way it's easier to browse sections separately based on if you want to hire or get hired and it would also make posting more attractive due to increased visibility.",

      "body": "That's a nice idea and I think that would be more helpful for signature campaigns since people will easily find which campaign is accepting new participants and which one is closed for new participants. But, recently we have seen some contest related posts on that board as well then for those contests related posts we may need to have another child board.The signature campaigns and review campaigns are highly related to each other and can be posted into signature campaign board while other posts have no relation with each other and they can be posted in main services board I believe. It will be helpful for many members and it will also be helpful for campaign managers as most of their open campaigns will get easy exposure.I don't know about others but I mostly visit Services board to check signature campaigns, review campaigns, and sometimes contests. But, I believe that services board should be limited to service providers only and signature campaign threads, as well as review campaign threads should be in another sub-board that would be entire created for such posts.",

We know we can't control everyone's choice of where to post, but most of those posting campaigns have old and experienced managers, so keeping each post on the right board, I believe, won't be an issue. Another thing is that when there is a designated board for a particular kind of topic, reporting the post to moderators will also be easier to do, and the work won't be that much for them either, just as they handle other boards. It will take time, but if such a board actually comes into existence, then people will adopt.",

I can not remember who was the last mod but I can clearly see that so many of them are not active in moderation. The forum moderation is not incentivize much too, I get this idea from some other mods who actually think it's a volunteering job. It may sound exciting to be a forum mod but when you are not receiving much in return then basically you become slow. Feeling less responsible ultimately disappears the enthusiasm. We can create many sub-boards but getting used to with the new boards and moving topics to the new boards is going to be a lot of work.

I would like to add that if the campaigns will have their separate board, hopefully that in the Services board, there should be a pinned message that says what exactly you need to do like the proper formats for hiring a service and selling your service to someone so that way, there's some form of uniformity.",

Yes, I absolutely agree with you. Considering the fact that we have a board titled \"Bounties\" in the alt coins board, I was also wondering why we never had a specific sub-board for signature campaigns. I think it will be better if there's a separate board where only signature campaigns will be launched. Although the old pattern of launching signatures under the service board has been there for so long, and I don't think theymos have the intent of changing that anytime soon, if the matter is being delegated to see if people are interested in why the signature sub-board should be created, then he might consider adding it anytime he finds time to do any small modification on the forum.",

How different is that from someone looking for a content creator, a translator, or a developer to hire for a fee in Bitcoins?Someone help me understand this.I may have understood what OP tried to explain. Signature campaign are forum's own dedicated services/features to promote crypto projects. Aren't they? A lot of signature are active at this moment. I think OP wanted a separate child board for signature. I don't scroll service board a lot. But from my seeing I see there are a lot of job related threads apart from signature. By job I meant, where someone wanted to hire a programmer, or a video editor, or a content writer for their website, page etc? These aren't related to forum or crypto in any way but the forum is filled with people of this specific set of knowledge.If all the thread were to stack together, don't you think it'll create a mess? Signature related thread always gets a upper hand. People constantly reply and engage in these threads. But when someone makes a thread to hire people, how many sees that or how many able to respond to that? As OP mentioned one bump a day.I don't know if I'm correct about OP's intention. OP might be able to shed some light to it. And clear what he actually meant.",

More than half of them do not promote crypto projects and are gambling related.Of course the projects have to have some appeal to the audience here, so the casino houses are mostly those that accept cryptocurrency, other popular services are mixers for crypto and Bitcoin wallets, but their are not forum related in any way, just regular services being advertised.Anyone looking to hire or be hired should be able to read through 2-3 pages of threads, but maybe the services board should have a child board to advertise a service that one offers and the current one will be to hire people to work on a service, that can help declutter it a little bit.",

Pffft.Edit:  Guess I was wrong, you are getting support.  Maybe Theymos will swoop down from the heavens and heed your cries, young pleb.",
