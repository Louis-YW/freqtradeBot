No. Why? Because they all have centralized authorities. Just like ethereum and many others. Decentralized exchanges with those smart contracts have central authorities.Decentralized exchanges which are using smart contract have central authorities. Or am I wrong? The central authorities can change their decision at anytime in a way the meaning of decentralized would be changed overtime.",

The whole myth of the new Defi solutions that will revolutionize banking and give your freedom back was simply a lie, a hyped word that in reality had no meaning whatsoever, everyone should have understood that from the moment the first coins were frozen or blacklisted that this was just a way to cash on the hype and to trick gullible users that they've bought something special and it's actually theirs.But something that needs to be mentioned is that of course they are not doing this on purpose, but they are doing the same things banks do with just one thing in perspective, staying afloat and making money.

Quote from: PrimeNumber7 on August 14, 2022, 09:59:24 PMThis is something that will probably cause many exchanges to rethink how they handle customers who have received transactions from illicit sources, and may even lead to litigation surrounding \"taint\".Since this is the crypto world and since in the last period we've seen only moves towards centralization and even worse proposals, for example, the rollback proposed by CZ after the hack of Binance we're not going to see a change in the definitions but more likely some new features, some shitcoins have already come with a proposal of individual whitelisting and blacklisting of addresses to which you can send funds, so Pandora's box is wide open.Back to dydx:https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1558088426926313472Some people have really no shame, after blocking accounts how they are proclaiming they will fight against this till the last satoshi....",

Only the intelligent few are always able to figure it outOut of all the people who've posted in this thread thus far, I'm probably the least knowledgeable about the machinations of these things, i.e., what makes these so-called DEXes tick.  But goddamn, I've lived long enough to develop a keen sense of smell, and I can recognize the scent of bullshit from a mile away.  Sometimes I visit various altcoins' websites, and they all look very similar, with similar bewildering jargon (the second-layer, web 3.0, blahblahblahblah stuff), and without even knowing what the hell is being said I'm 99% sure it's designed to impress pants-shitting monkeys with little-to-no frontal cortex activity.Oh, and it took me a while to realize just how centralized PoS altcoins are.  Those \"community funds\" a lot of them have seem to be just a big piggy bank that the devs and whoever else can use as their personal ATM.  Un-fuckin'-real.Quote from: PrimeNumber7 on August 14, 2022, 09:59:24 PMThere are reports of some people sending transactions from Tornado Cash to many well-known ETH addresses, including those belonging to various exchanges, and to various celebrities.
