Even if somebody would take your numbers seriously you still have made less than a few BTC from them, why even bother when you're standing on a gold mine of \"leaks\"!",

Yes, you can only convince those who are newbie in trading and you can impress them by showing 100% , 200% returns screenshots and all those stuff in your discord group.Even if you claim, you will start a free service, it won't be free for much longer. As soon as you get a few signals hit, you will start demanding money from these innocent newbie traders. This is what happens in all the trading groups and this will happen in your trading leak group too.",

Many people earn and continue to earn, and they don't ask me but rather the members of the system.I’m sure that your ELON COIN doesn’t generate wealth for people who believe they can become rich with it. I never promise a financial return or wealth. We study ICT concepts and also collect fees to follow a highly skilled trader inside the crypto market. I never claim to transform someone from being poor to rich. So, please refrain from making negative comments about my posts if no one understands the purpose of this server.",

      "body": "Just a heads-up to those who might not be aware. The crypto signals advertised are inaccurate, if not the whole thing is a scam. The OP of this thread decided to abandon another thread because he is trying to hide away the truth.Here is some food for thought.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on August 19, 2023, 10:03:42 PMWhy don't you use the \"leaked signals\" to make your trading account bigger yourself if they are really accurate, instead of looking for $25 in forums?I mean, if the signals even have an 80% win rate, with good risk management strategy, you can turn $1000 into $300,000 in a few months without having to resell the signals for a mere $25.I can tell you why. The signals are simply fake.If the “accurate” signals can't work for him, then why is he selling them?",

      "body": "OP I am curious about your signal after reading replies and comments here. It is unfortunate that you would have these scores to settle before you think of going ahead because these accusations here I presume are somehow weighty which would warrant members to scrutinise you before thinking of patronising your services. Nevertheless, I am not sure if you truly are a trader to give out signal or you belong to a telegram community where signals are shared then you go to your community d ask them to pay for signals and you share them wrong signals for trading  or how do you do that?",

Similarly there are people who do not know the ABC of trading but they are making money by running a crypto signal group, providing useless signals to the masses and earning money from the subscription fee. By the way, making and giving signals is the easiest in the crypto world where you can randomly give 5-10 signals every day and OfCourse then you can create a noise that your signals getting hit as one or two will get hit out of so many.   Also copying free signals from telegram and twitter and posting them as your own in the crypto channels is another way how these scammers make money.",

The same guys that sell books on how to win the lottery, instead of making 10 millions a month by winning those they try to make $10 000 a year by selling a few books, wonder why? Probably because all those are pure bs and writing is easier than practice?  Take Kiyosaki for example, renown author, quoted every day but in real life he has gone bankruptcy after bankruptcy, lawsuit after lawsuit, he has never had a profitable business in his life but he's good at writing fantasy novels, cause those have nothing real in them.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on January 26, 2024, 04:53:20 PMIf the “accurate” signals can't work for him, then why is he selling them?Ask this the guy who just yesterday was selling a 101% formula to win millions in a casino for $200.",
