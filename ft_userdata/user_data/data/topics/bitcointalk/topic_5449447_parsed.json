As for the first card issue, we ask users to indicate their name and their location through simple form on the website to issue first card, yet we don't ask them to upload any documents at this point, so the statement of \"Issue your first card without any documents\" stays. For purchasing more than one card we ask users to complete KYC verification, that is divided into several steps depending on what level of access and number of features the users is willing to get. In case you have more questions about our service, we are always here to answer and have our support working every day from 8:00 to 17:00 GMT by Telegram, Skype and e-mail",

Our licence can be found on our website in the \"Legal\" section, for your convenience, let us attach the link here as well: https://www10.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca/msb-esm/public/detailed-information/msb-details/7b226d73624f72674e756d626572223a3136363430342c227072696d617279536561726368223a7b226f72674e616d65223a2254414e474552494e45222c2273656172636854797065223a317d7d/We strive to provide the best level of service for our users alongside with complying with the regulator requirements, thus we simplified the initial verification as much as possible to give our users the opportunity to get the first card and test our service without providing too much information about themselves. As we grow rapidly, the number of negative reviews grows as well as the number of our satisfied clients. Of course we are not happy with the fact that some of our users don't take their time to read full terms and conditions or talk to our customer support yet manage to write a review on trustpilot, though we are always ready to clarify any misunderstanding in the public space, should any arise. ¬†We are always eager to answer any questions about our service, so don't hesitate to contact us in case you have any more questions!",

      "body": "PST.NET is a SCAM!!!I fell victim to a scam by PST.NET. Regrettably, I made the mistake of sending $27,500 to my account on their website to purchase a virtual card for my business. However, after completing their KYC verification process, they falsely claimed that my wallet address was flagged, which I know is untrue.They provided various excuses and used AMLBOT.COM, a company of their own, to produce a fake AML report to justify their actions. As a result, they deactivated my account and denied me access to my funds, which is an apparent act of deception.I am disappointed to discover that PST.NET operates under fraudulent practices, with their purported office address in Canada being a virtual address hosted by REGUS.COM, and indications of their origins being in Russia.I possess evidence of our conversations and the verification process, which clearly demonstrates their deceitful activities. You can review the entire conversation history and the fake AML report at the following links: pstnetvirtualcardscam.net/pstchatconversation.html and pstnetvirtualcardscam.net/pstfakeamlbot.html.It is perplexing that despite complying with all their verification requirements and having a significant balance in my account, they chose to deactivate my account instead of initiating a refund if there were legitimate concerns about my transaction. This behavior further supports their dishonest practices.I kindly request that you terminate any association with PST.NET and refrain from offering them any card services. Additionally, I urge you to take appropriate action against whoever is responsible for running this fraudulent company. There are also other reviews on Trustpilot from individuals who have been scammed by them, as evidenced here: trustpilot.com/review/pst.net?stars=1.",

There are also other reviews on Trustpilot from individuals who have been scammed by them, as evidenced here: trustpilot.com/review/pst.net?stars=1.And they replied to you in Trust pilot asHi!That‚Äôs unfortunate you encountered all the constraints of fintech sphere whilst using our service.However, let us answer is detail to what you claim on the website. Let us explain shortly what happened as well. We received a transaction of $27500, and the client made a withdrawal request as soon as money arrived at the account. We even received a proposal to speed up the withdrawal process for an additional reward of $1000 (as you can see on the screenshots provided). The transaction was checked by AML bot which showed 100% high risk score. We had to ask the client to undergo KYC, for which he provided the documents, yet refused to confirm the information he stated during KYC and didn‚Äôt provide anything to confirm the connection between the holder of the wallet and himself (as there was none found). Let us clarify everything in more detailFirst, AMLBOT entity is a completely different company, which we have client-customer connections only. You can check full info about their company on their website https://amlbot.com/, and you have all their legal information available at the header of the AML report.Second, about the data you see in the report itself: if the transaction has a risk level from 51% to 100%, that means that the tokens are either stolen, used in the Dark Market or the assets are obtained by fraud and blackmail, Mixers, exchanges and services related to illegal activity (full list of 42 positions can be found in the report you posted). You were asked by our compliance officer to provide the procurement details for the wallet and transaction in question, which you said you have, however decided not to provide.Third, as we are a legal entity certified by FINTRAC of Canada, we‚Äôre obliged to conclude an investigation and report all the illegal assets to the FINTRAC. That is stated in our AML Policy in the LEGAL section of our website, here is the link to your reference: https://pst.net/legal/aml. What surprises us is that you and your lawyer decided to base you response on the FAQ section only, without studying our ToS fully.And last, we have no connection with Hancock Whitney Bank, all the information about our card providers can be found in the disclaimer at the footer of our website.We have reported this transaction to FINTRAC as well and, as stated in the e-mail thread, we will keep you posted about the ongoing investigation. We hope that meanwhile you‚Äôll refrain from spreading the word with incomplete information about the case and cooperate with the legal entities in providing all the necessary documents.Hope we can resolve this issue in an amicable way!For anyone interested in the case we must remind you that money laundering is a crime punishable by law and that we strongly advise not to do business with such high risk partners to ensure the financial safety of your own.https://www.trustpilot.com/review/pst.netBut do you have any reason to make a withdrawal quickly after the deposit?Unfortunately there is not much of review about this service over intertnet so all you do is just wait and proceed what they ask you to do.FYI, Bitcointalk doesn't moderate scams so no one will be banned or their thread will be taken down even if they are proven to be scam.",

However, after completing their KYC verification process, they falsely claimed that my wallet address was flagged, which I know is untrue.Sending almost 1 BTC to a website already having some \"beware\" flags - just read up - is an expensive lesson for what you should not do.You send such amounts only after a website/service gathers big amount of trust, good reviews, tons of happy users.

Get legal advise. If these guys stole from you, legal actions are needed. But you may have to find somebody to sue them .. possibly in Russia .. and you have to be very careful to not actually get scammed again.As already said, this forum is very permissive. It's you who has to watch your back. Plus, it's not the forum to go for legal action on behalf of you, you have to do that.",
