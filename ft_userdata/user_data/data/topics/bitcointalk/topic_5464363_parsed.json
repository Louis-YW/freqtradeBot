But I would say you didn't buy at the worst price and you did not buy the worst coin. It has a chance to recover the price in the next bull run. But, we don't know how long it may take. Probably after the next Bitcoin halving? It may take more than eight months or so. Or maybe it can take less than that. That's all our prediction. I am wondering why are you afraid. Didn't you buy it to hold it for a long time? If you want to buy crypto and hold it for the long term, I always suggest choosing Bitcoin. There is no alternative to Bitcoin for long-term investment.",

That means it's still two months since you bought it and it's not that long ago. Do you think there are people who buy more BNB than you? I wonder if anyone around you in June 2023 bought BTC at 30K, while the current price for BTC is trading at 26,480.00.Quote from: Shorkarjakir0000 on August 24, 2023, 05:26:32 AMafterall, how much it will take it to recover?Do not panic.

I am confident $300 is very reachable next year if not this year. Are you stressed or worried about your investment? I'd been in that situation before and I ended up selling all my holdings. Another option is to sell it and then buy a coin that you are more confident to hold. Bitcoin has been the most valuable coin in crypto ever since.",

I will advise you to keep holding your BNB even after the price you bought it has recovered.",

It's far from dead considering SEC isn't the perfect organization to how they exhibit their ruling in the crypto industry and that's enough on how XRP is likely winning the case. There's no one would really know how much it will take to recover unless charges are drop or there has been some agreement between the two.",

I would say you are still ok, 4 BNB at around $307 is still ok, although I understand it could be big money for someone. What I am saying is, be patient and one day the price will recover. No one knows when. Now, this is important!When you are new to the crypto and if you want to invest, BTC is the safest of the assets. (As safe as crypto can be) With BTC we know that it will not scam like other alt coins.",

Therefore, it would really be just wise that you should hold your position as it should be the wisest thing to bedone considering that selling on loss is never been that an ideal because we know that prices could really be that able to recover or would really be tending to shoot up afterwards but of course it would really be basing up on what market cycle we are still into.We are still now on a bear market but if the halving occurs on next year then expect that bull run would kick in and this would be particularly talking about Bitcoin and when this happens then expect that other altcoins in the market would really be doing the same. Seeing new ATH? Its better to hold your BNB and dont make yourself that impulsive on checking out the market pricesevery now and then because this is where people do usually find themselves getting affected just because they are really that actively seeing those numbers which i could say that its never been that recommendableon doing so.",

Its hard to make a choice of what to do in this very volatile Market condition.The market structure of Bitcoin in the weekly timeframe is creating HH and HL, so how did you say that we are still bearish. Being in the bullish market doesn't mean there's a massive volume as we saw way back 2021. As long as the price of Bitcoin won't close below $$20k, I will consider that what's happening in the market is just a retracement. Aside from that, BNB is in the strong support, and there's a lot of demand there as we see using RSI, it's creating divergence. If ever Bitcoin will make a massive drop, the support zone of Bnb will be tested again. So don't worry about Bnb chart that much instead worry with Bitcoin.",

Regardless of the price, it’s just prediction and speculation and there are no guarantees or promises about the time that it would recover.It may just be within hours, days or weeks. Doesn’t matter. You should not have too much expectations regarding the timeline of the BNB’s recover price that you are targeting. When you have bought BNB, you should have already acknowledged the fact that it is considered “dead money” on the amount that you have committed. If it goes up, then good for you. But if it’s just being down especially for a long time, just acknowledge it and not smart to sell at a loss.",

We should be considering the situation to be a lot more important to just predict the direction, if you can predict the direction that is more than enough, no need to try to predict the exact price.I think if you try to guess the exact price, there is a bigger chance that you will be wrong, but if you want to predict the direction that means you have 50% chance, it will either go up or down. I think in the next 3 months we will see higher prices, but don't know how much.",

All that it requires you to do is to be patient or if you are no longer comfortable holding BNB, you can make a change in decision to convert your portfolio into Bitcoin and have peace of mind with your investment.",
