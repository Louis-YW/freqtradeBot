  "content": "AlphaPlay is your long searched destination for crypto gaming[WEBSITE][FACEBOOK][DISCORD][YOUTUBE][WHITEPAPER][CMC]AlphaPlay is the ultimate chance to turn your enthusiasm for cryptocurrency, e-sports, and gaming into a measurable and lucrative business! In essence, AlphaPlay is the starting point for those brave enough to embark on an outstanding crypto gaming adventure! AlphaPlay is a gaming token that was established on the Binance Smart Chain with the intention of rewarding users for playing games they like, completing objectives, and attending events and contests. Our major objective is to build a gaming community in which individuals can come together to compete, receive rewards, and/or form careers while still feeling respected for what they do in their spare time. In contrast to most other blockchain-powered crypto gaming ventures, AlphaPlay focuses on current and forthcoming crypto and non-crypto games. Additionally, it provides users with the opportunity to earn cryptocurrency by betting on esports events. We are working on four main gaming platforms such as Steam , Epic Games, Battle.net, Ubisoft ,in addition to independent game companies and game consoles. AlphaPlay's ecosystem is unique since it rewards users for playing games they like rather than investing in hazardous and expensive cryptocurrency gaming projects, which often result in significant losses and a negative user experience. We do not need any investment to commence earning, however, there are methods to boost your profits by investing in our tokens or NFTs. Additionally, players may earn interest by staking their tokens.We'll be turning our focus onto the community. We want to work with our fans to ensure AlphaPlay is as engaging as possible.That's why we'll introduce V2 Contracts with some juicy features, such as Governance, Staking Power, & more.Governance will allow users to have their opinions heard & sway the direction of the project. And here's how it will work:If You Can Stake - You'll stake your tokens for one year to become a Governor (the more you stake, the more voting influence you'll gain)If You're Unable to Stake - You'll join a community pool group or create your own (get together, pool your tokens, & stake them together for community-driven voting power)Everyone will have their chance to voice their opinion regardless of their staking power. But the more you stake, the more influence you'll have on driving the direction of the project.The Play2Earn ecosystem represents the ideal framework to reward players for their efforts and time invested in our platform.Hence, players will be able to do the following:●   Utilize those tokens to purchase merchandise in-store.●   Place bets on their favorite teams.●   Organize tournaments.●   Sell tokens in the liquidity pool.●   Join community staking pools and participate in governance.Moreover, Alphaplay will generate revenue via eSports, betting, merchandise sales, and the marketing of game studios. The funds obtained will be used to acquire back tokens and reintroduce them into circulation, hence increasing the value of tokens. Total Supply 10,000,000Distribution●   Presale   5.00%●   Public Sale   23.30%●   Play2Earn   26.00%●   Staking   31.00%●   Marketing   5.00%●   NFT reserved   1.70%●   Developers   8.00%",
