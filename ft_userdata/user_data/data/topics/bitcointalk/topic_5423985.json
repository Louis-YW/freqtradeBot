Retirement funds are different than any other form of investment. It has to be safe yet must provide a market-linked return. So I would support this cause! Crypto assets are extremely volatile in nature. Young people who have time in hand, can surely invest in cryptos if they are able to get in and get out at a right time. That's the basis of crypto investment. Investors need to be extremely agile in nature. Retirement funds are usually not handled this way. So it's a very high-risk investment for retirement funds.  Recently, news came out of Canada related to 95 million dollars of loss from FTX collapse. Crypto market has already seen a lot of collapses considering it is a relatively new type of investment. So it's better to keep for those people whose risk appetite is high.

Pension fund administrators should be able to educate their clients about their investment platforms and give them the opportunity to choose the sectors they want their funds to be invested. If the pension managers are investing in cryptocurrencies then these pensioners should be able to understand the risk that is involved and they should be given the privilege to choose if they want their funds to be invested in cryptocurrencies or not.An outright ban is not the solution because the crypto space is very profitable sector. These retirees fund managers can genuinely make money from Bitcoin since pension is a long time investment. Considering the problems that some reputable exchanges are going through currently, there is need to supervise or regulate the activities of this pension managers. The government should enact sound policies to discourage them or bar from investing in some of these crypto Ponzi and get-rich-quick schemes. Some of these pension managers engage in reckless and risky crypto investment without considering the consequences.",

Traditionally as people enter retirement they should be in a position where their portfolio is almost entirely derisked - put into low paying but steady government bonds of the most reliable nature. Crypto however is the extreme opposition end of the \"investment\" spectrum and it makes sense to put some added protections in place to somewhat try and protect people from their own poor financial practices. It should not be banned entirely, but only very knowledgeble buyers should be in this space.",

If inflation is 8% annually, pension plans must grow 8% just to break even. Logically, it makes sense to invest in high growth sectors of the economy like crypto to achieve this. FTX is an extreme outlier case which shouldn't be considered to represent crypto as a whole. The entire timeline of FTX still makes zero sense and should never have happened if basic laws and regulations were followed. Its still a mystery as to how a long sequence of statistically improbable events aligned for FTX to occur the way it did. New york has always carried a fiercely anti crypto stance which has remained a stark contrast to the crypto friendly stance of states like texas and florida.",

Because they will have to wait till the market becomes favourable to start making profit on their investments.I can understand that he wants to protect people from making bad decisions, but an outright ban on crypto currencies as retirement investment is wrong in my opinion. Even though a large part of the population might be unfamiliar with cryptos, there are still people who understand them and would like to have them in their retirement investment. Why can't there be better regulation to protect consumers instead of banning it directly? A good approach would be to make sure that everybody who wants to invest his retirement funds in cryptos is aware of the risks involved. In my country most of the private retirement schemes pool the money and buy investment funds with it. These investment funds have fixed guidelines for the assets they can buy. In most cases this is 60-80% fixed income, 20-40% stocks with only a very small fraction of 5-10% in commodities. To me it seems totally fine if we invest in a fund that would also add 5-10% crypto investments. These investment funds for our retirement are very long term investments that are not being traded too actively. Holding some cryptos for the next 30-40 years seems fine and we shouldn't worry about short term price fluctuations.",
