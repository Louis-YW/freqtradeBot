Use From / To to search messages related to specific sender or receiver.",

I think your request is impossible to do.Imho, if a variable can add notes to the message that was posted, I think it's also possible adding a 1 line command creates a link to the sent message that was just posted. This command must be at the very end of the stack. cmiiw",

      "body": "The adjustment is good but for the request it might not be possible because if it is possible then the function of the outbox becomes useless. In any message box, there must be an inbox and outbox and other components or features. So clicking on the hyper link text to link you to the original sent message will make a feature redundant which is the outbox component. So let it be that you see the information that, you have responded to that message and if you want to see the message which you have sent, you should go the outbox to see what had been said.",

If such feature existed, there would be no hassle to find out the necessary message.Like hosseinimr93 said, the search function only looks through your inbox (which is kind of frustrating [1]), so the best way to speed up finding a specific reply would be to arrange your outbox alphabetically, by clicking the \"Subject\" header:For ascending order: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=pm;f=outbox;start=0;sort=subjectFor descending order: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=pm;f=outbox;start=0;sort=subject;descYou can also arrange it by recipient, by clicking the \"To\" header, which might end up being faster (especially if you've only sent that person a few PMs):For ascending order: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=pm;f=outbox;start=0;sort=nameFor descending order: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=pm;f=outbox;start=0;sort=name;desc[1] I took a quick look at what it would take to fix this limitation, and it's doable, but not trivial.

But still, this solution is good. It will help me to filter out all the other messages which I sent with different subjects. Less time required to cfind out specific message.Fun fact, I spent more than one hour deleting a few PMs only from 40+ pages of PM. I have decided to keep the inbox/outbox clean and started deleting unnecessary PMs. Was surprised by the number of total PMs here/. I spent quite a long time here already.",
