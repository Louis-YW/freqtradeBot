  "content": "In light of today's “tricks” with messengers and other social networks, and their use for “bad deeds”, a thought came to mind.What if the blockchain of bitcoin or other mass cryptocurrencies are used as a “signaling network” and to organize the interaction of not very good things, not very good people ? Could this affect cryptocurrencies in general ? And won't blockchain technology be on the verge of total control, if not extinction?Let me explain what this is about.Many people realize, especially today, that messengers and other channels of interaction are always under special control of all sorts of government and not so governmental services. The reason is banal - through such systems people interact with whom there is objective and subjective interest of both states and individual groups.And here came to me the thought - and whether blockchain is not used to transmit “signals” for, for example, coordination of actions of some people, organizations, ..... Inexpensive, undetectable, and really anonymous !For example, a wallet is created, which is monitored by a group of people. And they know - if the wallet appears for example 200924 satoshi - then on September 20, 24 that we do something previously planned. Or it's not noticeable at all - 117 satoshis arrived, so we do what we planned on September 20, 24. And if 319 satoshis - then “cancel and go away” until the next transaction, which will carry corrective/informational data. To monitor such transactions, and most importantly to analyze - JUST IMPOSSIBLE !Your opinion ? Interested not only in the possibility of realizing such a system (it is possible, especially on fast blockchains), but also in the implications for the crypto world as a whole ? And also thoughts on the potential probability of detection of such transactions ?",

For example, if you will use testnet4, then currently, I can see only five nodes, so whoever send it, the origin of the transaction would be just one of those five IPs.And if you use block explorers, then they often give you a field called \"Relayed By\" with some IP address.Quotethere is no one to ask who sent or who viewed the transactionAfter a long time, when you explore historical blocks, it is often the case. However, if you have an active full node, then it can tell you a lot of things, about the whole traffic. Because it is not encrypted.If you want to have a hidden communication channel, then just use Tor. In that case, if you have onion-vs-onion communication, it is much more hidden, than just a transaction relay in Bitcoin, where each message is sent in the plaintext, and you even have an IP address of the sender in the message headers: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#Network_address",

Blockchain does not have your fingerprints, which is why it is more “safe” for such transactions - there is no one to ask who sent or who viewed the transaction yes blockchains can be used to trigger events without fingerprinting... heck take it one stage furtherwe seen years ago how a vending machine monitored a bitcoin address and when funds appear, the vending machine released the snack.. now imagine a bomb linked to monitor the blockchain that goes off when funds are seen..other things like how segwit now allows any junk data to be appended to a transaction. you can literally write instructions into data that is encrypted which the secret reader can decodethe inverse though... the blockchain is immutable and data stays, so unlike some private social networks that organised criminals design themselves that dont retain the messages after viewing. everything on a blockchain is kept. so should a criminal get arrested and as a plea deal want to whistleblow on his crime bosses the criminal could reveal the process of decoding messages and reveal to authorities all the secrets and help build evidence to get the crime bosses caught. .. in short, using a system that keeps records is not a good system to use.. real criminals that are tech savvi would rather design their own social networks which they only distribute between their criminal partners and those systems dont keep logs..open ledgers that are immutable are also evidence gathering that can actually tie criminals up later when caught. though a blockchain does not ask for ID. if authorities later find a causal link between a criminal and a bitcoin address via other means.. then the evidence of the blockchain can then dig a deep hole for the criminal and lengthen their stay in prison",

But to achieve a high degree of privacy you need some patience/time and knowledge to create your wallets and a nice administration of your UTXO. Spending UTXOs from different addresses can just break your privacy completely.  Or even sending to the wrong address.",

Huh, its an interesting idea.  But gotta think - blockchain is public, anyone can see whats on there.  Sure you could try hiding stuff in the transactions somehow, mayyybe make it tricky to see if you dont know what youre looking for.  But I dunno feels like some hacker type would catch on, start digging into the patterns and  or what if theres a leak inside the operation? Whole thing gets blown wide open then.  Im no expert though.  Maybe it could work if you were realll crafty about it.  But public ledgers and secrecy dont seem like easy bedfellows, you know? Youd need some wild encryption or masking tricks.  Even then, may not keep the smartest sniffers off the trail for long.  Guess it depends on how determined you are to make it work versus how determined any adversaries are to cracking your code.",

The cryptography technology which is what every cryptocurrency is built on, works in a way that cryptographers can easily encrypt a plain text or words into a cipher text. These encrypted message or information can only be access, readable or decrypted by an authorized person alone. If all that is possible using cryptography, that means that the thought you are having in your heard, @OP, can be archived and I fear if it's not even happening already. It might not be rampant yet because everyone is not a cryptographer and it's only a rich person that can  be able to hire and pay a cryptographer to do such work for them but if such action becomes too rampant and turns to a threat for the government and the society at large, it's going to affect the cryptography technology and this technology is the center on which every cryptocurrencies is developed, which mean if it's attacked by the government in other to bring it down, it will affect cryptocurrencies.",
