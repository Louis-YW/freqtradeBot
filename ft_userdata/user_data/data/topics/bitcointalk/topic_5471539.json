Until now, Instagram has not given an official statement about this, but there are several users who have started to be affected. Why do you think it is? Is it because Libra and Diem that the project failed or was it ordered by SC or the revenge of the Winklevos brothers who are rich from Bitcoin. Instagram is clearly a platform that does not support freedom of speech and only displays content according to the algorithm they want. What do you think guys ?",

There are certain criteria and requirements that need to be met before anyone can run an advertisement about Bitcoin. Please go ahead and read this topic to get the right information, About Meta's advertising policy on cryptocurrency products and services. Unless there is an official statement from Meta, please do not blindly believe what influencers are saying. In 2018 they had placed a temporary ban on advertisements related to Bitcoin later they removed it. Do remember that content removal on Instagram does depend on community reporting, It is applicable to Facebook and YouTube too.",

On the one hand they have banned everything that refers to Bitcoin and \"crypto\", putting it in the same bag and we already know that everything that refers to crypto ends up being scams or pump and dump schemes. On the other hand, those of us who have Bitcoin don't want people to know about it either, and even less so on a site like Instagram.Although I suppose that over time when Bitcoin is even more standardized they will have to reverse the decision.",

All social media platforms are owned by individuals which means that they can be controlled based on the interest of the owners. Although Instagram is filled with many worthless projects it is also a good medium to promote bitcoin, however, Meta can not stop the spread of bitcoin.",

I don't face serious with Instagram banned bitcoin and cryptocurrency because there are not any drastically valuable of bitcoin or cryptocurrency. Regarding when China and some top country against with Bitcoin but there are not any important thing will make bitcoin drop why have serious respond with Instagram banned bitcoin? There are have several place for advertising of bitcoin and I don't think if Intsgram, Facebook or another platform of social media banned bitcoin will be huge problem in the future.",

Because social media can help Bitcoin adoption, and also social media is the best place or nest for fraudsters to carry out their actions and their targets are beginners.And actually I don't know much about Instagram because I've never been interested in creating an Instagram account. And what is clear is that the positives and negatives depend on the intelligence of each individual so that they don't get trapped easily and don't easily trust anyone before doing detailed research.Because fraud on social media will never disappear, it will always exist and will continue to exist forever.",

And then the banning of cryptocurrencies on Instagram started when ICOs' projects were trending. So we can't blame the Instagram platform either.They just removed the clutter that Instagram thinks is polluting their social media platform. The only thing that is not really good is that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that have been in this industry for a long time are being misused.",
