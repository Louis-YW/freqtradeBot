  "content": "A lady crypto holder is complaining that her Ledger wallet was hacked and she lost thousands of XRP. She's not that experienced with crypto, she says it herself. First, if you check her various videos, you will understand that Ledger wallet hacking is very common, but if you watch her other videos, you will understand that she purchased Ledger from a third party reseller. She doesn't share her secret phrase with anyone but even after she gets hacked, that leaves a big possibility that her ledger might have been tampered with by the reseller. But she is blaming ledger where the biggest mistake was made by her when she bought ledger wallet from third party. So crypto users should be more careful in purchasing Ledger wallet. How important it is to always buy from the official website, one should learn from what happened to this lady.Youtube : https://youtu.be/0kyHFdkjI7ohttps://youtu.be/YeUCbWt_U4oSource: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2023/08/xrp-hodler-alleges-that-thousands-of-xrp-were-stolen-from-her-ledger-wallet/",

Another point is I don't know how genuine some of this people are but some just want to trend and create a buzz for themselves with stories .",

If you watch some of her other videos regarding this case of XRP disappearing from her Ledger wallet, you will notice that she isn't overly a tech-savvy person. There is also a subtle hint of conspiracy theory present, like the detail that the coins were transferred precisely at 9:11 AM, and that is something she considers significant. Also, she holds the belief that she might be a targeted individual by the government.  I do not know, it just seems like a lot of these YouTubers and wannabe influencers make up stuff to get more famous and more views on their channels. Feels like this could be one of those situations.",

      "body": "Hacking a Ledger is highly unlikely unless the seed phrase is compromised. It's unreasonable to blame Ledger for the hack without investigating further. I haven't watched the video due to time constraints. Purchasing a Ledger from an untrusted source is always risky. If the seed was pre-generated, you'll need to reset the device or discard it. Attempting to use a pre-generated seed on an original device is unwise. Ledger Live verifies device authenticity, but it can't detect seed compromise. Crypto users must be vigilant to safeguard their assets, even when using a hardware wallet.",

It's very bad practice because if you want to save money, you can use free non-custodial open source wallets and don't have to spend any money to buy hardware wallets from resellers and get hacked.",

In fact, she claims that the difference between the old Nano S+ and the new one was only that on the new device she could see a transaction that she claims was the work of a hacker - who left 10 coins by the way, after stealing several thousand.This reminds me a little of that woman who recently caused a scandal on the plane and became viral, and nothing surprises me when it comes to 5 minutes of fame, people are ready for anything.",

It is really seems that this could be a conspiracy theory. If you noticed how she tell a story, its like she was reading a script or memorizing an act. No wonder people can do crazy stuff just to gain followers and more subscribers. Of course in this case, ledger would be at fault as she intended. But I support your theory with this one. A scenario like this causes like this turns thing viral. Does the incident been investigated already like if shes really act the time and date, location of the hackers. Any details could help to pinpoint to whats really the prpblem or there is none problem at all but made one for the sake of views.",

It is unlikely that she will be able to do it herself. Surely there should have been some traces of interference on the printed circuit board.Resellers should be careful with buying hardware wallets not only with the ledger, but also with any other manufacturer. The fewer intermediaries (ideally, the complete absence) between the seller and the buyer, the more reliable and safer.In fact, apart from the words of this woman and the video, there is no evidence of what happened. I'm used to believing only facts, so I need a little more than that to be sure Ledger wallet hacked by third party reseller.",

The third-party reseller might know what happened to the ledger since she is so sure not to share her seed phrase with anyone.

Going over this page, it seems that she’s from (or located in) Belgium, and searching around, I found the site she referenced and that we couldn’t make out before: bol.com.There, we can see that the reseller does sell Ledger devices (can’t set the page to English, so I settled for French):https://www.bol.com/be/fr/s/?searchtext=ledgerThe site is really a Netherlands e-commerce platform. The site does seems to have a large segment of business generated through external vendors, though we don’t know if the Ledger device was bought from the mother site or from an external vendor. In either case, the situation would likely be no different to Amazon, where the stock for a same product from different partners may be mixed-up, enhancing the risk further more.See: https://www.supplychainmovement.com/bol-com-versus-amazon/",
