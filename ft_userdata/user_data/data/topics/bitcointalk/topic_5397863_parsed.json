We are currently using hyper automation from Gartner in our small company. It prevents us from worrying about inventory levels and supply tracking. So I would like to know more about the capabilities of your software to interact with already pre-installed software. There are a lot of offers on the market right now for scripts in commerce. To take a worthy place in this row, you need to offer something extraordinary, able to interest a potential buyer. I hope you have something similar.As we are in the business from a long time we’ve done many integrations with other softwares and also many software companies have connected with their development work to previously created software from us.",
