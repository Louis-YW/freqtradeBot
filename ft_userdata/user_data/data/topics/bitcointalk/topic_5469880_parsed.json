  "content": "I want to share some forum features that have not been easily seen. Even users who have been here for a while may not know about them.1. Quick Edit Button: Recently, I was reading my reply after posting it and while reading I found the button seems like this , I was seeing that button first time, I clicked and then understood that this is for quickly edit our reply, then I shared it with a local board member which is a newbie here, Then a reply popped up of @libert19 which is here for years and said \"Lol, I have been here for years yet learned about it from your post  Cheesy\", That's where I got the idea of sharing it on global board so other users also can save time. 2. Hide Button: This feature I discovered on first day of my registration on this forum, but on a recent thread by @blue Snow,I have seen many people who have been here for many years also find out about it now. This button is available on the homepage to hide the boards that you do not want to view or read. It also hides the avatar that we see at the top of forum. However, it does not hide the avatar permanently after updating the avatar. reappears. Like this:          3. Forum Stats: You will see many interesting statistics about the forum at the bottom of the home page, it will become more interesting after clicking on the \"More Stats\" hyperlink.4. Hide Avatars and Signature: If you don’t know how to hide other members’ Avatars or Signatures, or if you’ve installed a third-party extension specifically for this purpose, you can do so in settings, There are a lot of different settings available, some of which may be new to you if you’re not reading the setting page carefully.5. Watchlist: If you don’t want to see a lot of Unwanted Threads in the \"Show new replies to your posts.\" section, Which are listed there when we respond to threads and other users write a reply on that thread so we can know what are more replies from other members. you can edit that watchlist for a clean view.             Do you learned something new?",

But for correcting minor things, it's certainly a great help!  Hide Button: I also find this button useful since there are some boards I'm really not interested in - especially for the local boards which I cannot understand.Forum stats: The statistics were actually new to me; I guess I never scrolled that far on the board's main page to come across these statistics Hide Avatars and Signature: Familiar, but I don’t use it. I like a bit of variety with different avatars.Watchlist: Very useful, especially in threads you visit regularly. \"Show new replies to your posts.\" gets really cluttered when you post frequently.I'm looking forward to other responses - especially of \"old\" members!",

I've been using this a lot especially to those threads whose last reply are from those interesting forum members(which is personal).",

Having a good understanding of how to navigate these features and use them well is also important so you do not set these customizable features, become uncomfortable with them and then do not know how to remove them. I shared a topic about being careful with messing around the default settings on the forum,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5466015.msg62809984#msg62809984 For some features, when adjusted they can make your forum experience uncomfortable if you are not used to them and then unable to remove it. It can also then discourage you from logging into your account in the forum. So, before you set anything, try to understand it first.",

Thanks to you for bringing this useful information in front of us. I guess, this forum does have many wonders and surprises for us of which we knew nothing. Because we do not wonder here and there and only use the features or things we knew about. That's so surprising to see that I am here for years and or I should say I am this year old to know about that quick edit button.Well, another thing is we can not preview our posts in quick edit button, as there are only 2 options of save and cancel but it works for those who only have to correct some mistakes like spelling mistakes. This thread of yours is really helpful and I will try to keep it in mind for future need for newbies.",

I have always been a very enthusiastic user of the forum, and I was always amazed by the details and features that I could find in it. When I was new in the forum, I used to surf the whole forum, every single section even those where I wasn't even allowed to post, just to see what people were posting and what was being discussed in each section, etc.I have always been eager to learn more about the forum so there is basically no button or option that I didn't click at least once . As they say, it's always important to know the surroundings where you live, and since we spend a lot of time on the forum, it's important for us to understand each and everything about it.",

      "body": "This information is helpful because I am not conversant with some of these features but I find one more helpful. Which is the quick edit function.  I have seen other features OP listed but didn't pay attention to them because I don't have any need for them. For me, there is no need to hide any board because you might learn something important from them. I see avatars and signatures are artistic works that add color to the forum so there is no need to hide them. I like seeing new avatar designs and they convey information about the product they are promoting. Currently, the forum stats make little meaning to me,  maybe they might become important to me in the future. Nevertheless, I think these options allow members to have a personalized experience in the forum. Edit: I just used the quick edit option and I think this is one of the best optins this forum has. The good thing about it is that you can easily view the responses of other members as you edit your work. But it's shortcoming is that you will not have access to more function like the normal edit that has a scroll bar with diverse commands. But I have really learned something new.",
