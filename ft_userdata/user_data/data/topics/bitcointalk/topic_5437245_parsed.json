So, if you have a safe place and safety to write down the seed then you just have to think how to keep the seed safe to restore it to HW if you need it. HW is just media or agent, you can easy to swept and reset it into the new or old seed in every time. You can create a new seed on the old HW, generate an address and send the fund then reset it. You can repeat it many times as how many you can split the holding.",

That way you can create two wallets from the same seed phrase. The one without the extra word could contain a tiny amount and the one with the extra word could contain the rest.In an attack you just give up the seed phrase which they see the funds in and steal like $10 without knowing there is an extension that holds the rest without having any way of extracting it either.QuoteI have no idea about encryption.

This way it's not showing you have cryptocurrency in plain sight/if it is found from its hiding place. Of course it still shows something valuable is being hidden but at least it isn't instantly known to be your wallet.I don't have a better suggestion for storage though I am sure there is a way with lower risk/more efficient way than keeping 50% in another location as current...though if you stick to this, then I think more thought into a viable emergency backup is necessary in the event that something as unlikely as a fire does actually happen. If you don't have to be exposed to potentially losing 50% of your holdings by having an emergency plan in place, then have an emergency plan in place. Even if it means encrypting portable storage with the entire seed phrase (or with a few words missing that you are sure not to forget) and putting it in a safety deposit box or storing/hiding it with a trusted family member. That way if something occurs, you can race there to recover what you otherwise would have lost. If it's encrypted well it would be unlikely that it would be a point of failure having this in place too.",

There is no point owning a hardware wallet to protect $10 worth of bitcoin. An attacker knows this. If you reveal a seed phrase under duress which contains only $10 worth of bitcoin, they are going to keep hitting you until you reveal more. The amount you give away has to be large enough to plausibly be your holdings, and certainly be large enough to be worth buying a hardware wallet for.Even better if you can use multiple different passphrases. 0.1 BTC on the seed phrase which you can give up under duress. If they keep hitting you, 0.5 BTC under an additional passphrase which you can give up as well. Meanwhile 5 BTC under a much stronger different passphrase which you keep hidden.And obviously you need to use mixing or coinjoins to break the blockchain links between all these wallets. If you give up your seed phrase and attacker sees a transaction moving 5 BTC somewhere else, they are going to keep hitting you.",

I personally have my main cold-storage seeds in encrypted USBs, hidden in different secret locations. One secret location is in my house, another one in my car, another at work, and the last one in my old room in my parents' house. They all look cheap, ordinary USBs, with directories named \"My Files\" with old useless/random files from work scattered with the encrypted folder nested in another folder with more random files that contains the seeds. The USBs can only be opened in Linux",

If necessary, you can always restore from the seed-phrase.- If the $5 wrench attack method is applied to you, then by giving 1st device, you will have time to restore access to the 2nd device from the 1st seed-phrase and quickly move it to another wallet. And then - run away until the attackers come back to you again. In general, having 2 devices is a good idea and preferably from different manufacturers.",

Using a hardware wallet in public could certainly be seen as a potential advert to criminals that you hold a not insubstantial amount of bitcoin. So you only use your hardware wallet in private. However, when you bought that hardware wallet, you probably handed over your real name and address to the manufacturer. That information could very well have been sold, shared, or leaked, and so now your real name and address are linked to ownership of a hardware wallet. So maybe instead you bought the hardware wallet using a pseudonym, paying with anonymized bitcoin, and shipped to a PO box or other pick up location not directly linked to your real address. So far so good. But then all the bitcoin you have bought and sent to the hardware wallet were bought using fully KYCed accounts on centralized exchanges who we know sell your data to a huge number of third parties, not to mention being hacked for this data as well.Not flashing your hardware wallet in public is probably a smart move, but you will never be able to completely mitigate against $5 wrench attacks unless all your use of bitcoin is completely anonymous, and almost nobody does this. It is wise, therefore, to have a system of plausible deniability set up just in case, such as the one I outlined above - additional passphrases which can be revealed to an attacker while your main stash remains safe behind different passphrases.",

Even worse, unlike banknotes or credit cards, a hardware wallet as such is almost useless and impossible to spend from because it is unlikely that a victim will provide a PIN code voluntarily.",
