Well,I haven't had any direct contract with you but, I think I can trust you.Yes Coiner, you need some significant effort to convince your client. I know you haven't managed any campaign before so you can't make references to any but atleast you could make your service more colourful and profound; Atleast showing up your compatibility maybe in words or something...you're a good writer.Anyone out there could give him a hand, i think he'd do better.¬†Sandra üë©‚Äçü¶±",

The campaign owner or the campaign manager can hire easily a designer for this, it's not something difficult.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on September 19, 2022, 04:15:53 PMNo images, no colorized writeups, no significant effort to convince you I'm trustworthy.

I think it shouldn't. It should only be my past work. But, I don't have any. That's why I'm looking forward to cooperate with one client; to prove you that I'm capable.",

Yeah, I have been seen you in the forum actively since I joined the forum April this year. Your approaches to threads/posts are nice. You have conducted yourself as a real good manager. You will be one of the active managers in the forum. Wish you all the best to see good reputable campaign to manage. I like simple character.",

If you have signatures enabled (which is the default option once you register), you can see that I have a signature under this post, which points to \"ChipMixer\". It indicates that I'm part of that signature campaign. Quote from: Jon_Hodl on December 06, 2022, 11:47:23 AMand what does a manager do? The manager takes care of the campaign. He ought to cautiously select the members of the campaign (according to their quality content, post count, merit count etc), check their posts weekly, update the spreadsheet accordingly-- generally, he's in charge of the service's in-forum advertising. Here's a list of signature campaigns that are run currently: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=615953.0",
