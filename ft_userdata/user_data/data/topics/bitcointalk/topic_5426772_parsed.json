Where are they?Also it seems i get kicked from the web page when visiting the exchange while i get this message And now when i logged back in i need to fill kyc before checking out anything, i try to look at trading pairs, buy and sell walls or anything, it throws me to fill my KYC. There's no way in earth that i would fill kyc before checking out liquidity, fake volume and pairs. Your nft side opens 2 windows and both gets stuck on loading phase.You should maybe consider fixing these issues. As an user experience this was too time consuming and i won't be checking back, as this wouldn't invoke trust nor i am that interested of another exchange that didn't work in the first time.",
