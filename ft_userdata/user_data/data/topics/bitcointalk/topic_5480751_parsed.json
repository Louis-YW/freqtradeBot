  "content": "January 3, 2009, witnessed the birth of Bitcoin's Genesis Block in Helsinki, Finland. 15 years later, Bitcoin marks its fifteenth anniversary—a journey from obscurity to prominence. We've grown richer, thanks to Bitcoin. However, let's not rest on wealth; wealth alone can breed dragons of greed.But has Bitcoin fulfilled its ideals? What surprises and letdowns await? As Bitcoin navigates adolescence, challenges loom.Bitcoin's Core Dilemma: Stock and Flow90% of Bitcoin is mined; about 2.25 million coins remain. After each halving, diminishing returns challenge miners, risking centralization. Autonomous mining fades; market purchases dominate.You might think I support Ordinals growth for Bitcoin's user base. No, Ordinals reliance is poison. Imagine fees soaring tenfold; Bitcoin becomes a dormant asset.This sidesteps Layer 2 discussions. Lightning Network lacks users.However, I'm optimistic as Bitcoin nears milestones—wealth redistribution and a new world order:Dollar's Collapse, an Economic EarthquakeForget SEC, ETFs, and the dollar. Bitcoin emerged from the 2008 crisis; its coming-of-age coincides with a global shift.What if the dollar collapses?How will Bitcoin thrive amidst crises?Can Bitcoin liberate itself, embracing a humanity free from financial tyranny?I have a plan, probably nothing; let's continue the discussion.",

      "body": "In my opinion BTC ETF will Pass in 2024 Jan  Supporters of BTC ETFs argue that obtaining regulatory approval would bring more legitimacy to the Bitcoin market. This legitimacy would attract traditional investors and encourage more institutional participation, helping Bitcoin better integrate into the traditional financial system. The introduction of ETFs can improve the liquidity of Bitcoin, making it more accessible for buying and selling. This contributes to a more efficient market operation while reducing the risks for investors due to insufficient market depth.And about Risk, Advocates for BTC ETFs believe that this instrument helps mitigate the risks associated with Bitcoin investments. As ETFs operate through diversified portfolios, investors do not need to directly hold Bitcoin, thereby reducing the risks associated with Bitcoin price volatility.When Bitcoin becomes more easily available through traditional financial institutions, more people around the world will accept Bitcoin.",

It's complicated, though, because while Bitcoin's a safe bet, getting everyone on board globally involves dealing with a bunch of issues, like regulations, tech hurdles, and society accepting it.",

Bitcoin doesn't have to go through all these, the network protocols are set for it to thrive all situations it may pass through, the reason why it's decentralized, we are the ones to rather thrive more towards it's adoption by not having government restrictions on us from adopting Bitcoin.Quote from: 0xark on January 07, 2024, 09:30:51 PMCan Bitcoin liberate itself, embracing a humanity free from financial tyranny?Why do you think many were after Bitcoin adoption all over the world, it's because they have identified the liberation with bitcoin and would also want to be liberated along when they adopt it.",

If it can step up as a safe-haven during crises, could that speed up its global adoption? hell yeah, I'm totally with you on the Layer 2 solutions – if they can fix the network issues and high fees, it could set the stage for a brighter future for Bitcoin, 1000000%.

I didn't see the 15th anniversary thread of Bitcoin this year or did I missed it out?  That is by the way, congratulations to Bitcoin for it 15th uninterrupted anniversary in the ecosystem. I even heard that someone sent a huge amount of USD as Bitcoin to the Genesis Block. Yes wealth can cause greed and the desire of wealth of man make him to search for wealth in all corners and that is become the root of all evils.I don't think anyone here supported the evil fee caused by the ordinals. It was a terrible period in the history of Bitcoin, the hike of fee caused commotion in the industry. On my own understanding why people didn't use the lighting network was probably because the network is not simple as others. The transition moment is some how difficult. Well Bitcoin is gaining more strength in the world. I think recently my country also accept Bitcoin though it is not yet legal tender. The collapsed of dollar will make the fiat to rise up. And that will help many countries to do well. And Bitcoin will be the number one currency in the world. In the middle of all the crisis Bitcoin will come more stronger.",

But you also mentioned potential hurdles – what do you see as the main obstacles for Bitcoin in gaining broader social acceptance, especially considering its volatility and the complex tech behind it?",

The countries may face some trade related issues for short term but that will get solved sooner than expected. The countries who have taken huge loans from IMF will be happy to see the dollar collapse as most of their loans will get lower because of the collapse. That's an unlikely thing to happen so I would suggest you to not worry much about it. It can face some value decrease overtime but it's not going to collapse anyways. Another thing we should know is that some countries are trying to join BRICS and those countries will be happy to see dollar's collapse.Quote from: 0xark on January 07, 2024, 09:30:51 PMHow will Bitcoin thrive amidst crises?Let's say that if somehow dollar collapses then surely Bitcoin and the whole crypto-market will face another bear market that might decrease Bitcoin's value to some extent but again the Bitcoin won't be impacted a lot other than the FUD and it will grow its value once again. Bitcoin will definitely thrive without any question but yeah it will get affected for sometime if a collapse takes place.",

What do you guys think about the potential hurdles in achieving broader social acceptance? Education is key, for sure. Simplifying the narrative and making it more relatable is a good strategy. Maybe more user-friendly interfaces and educational campaigns could help. On the volatility front, it's tough – but it's also what attracts some people. Striking a balance between stability and the potential for gains might be the way forward.",
