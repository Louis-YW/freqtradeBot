  "content": "I'm a high school teacher. I was given the opportunity to assess my students understanding of bitcoin today after class. I was shocked to find that most of them knew very little or nothing about it. Since the majority looked interested and willing to learn more, I made the decision to explain the concept as well as practical examples.When the lecture was over, I was thrilled that I had introduced the subject because many of them were enthusiastic and had asked wonderful questions. In the next two to three years, some of them will grow to be adult, and it's good to let them know about some financial decisions and actions they will take as they are growing into adulthood.I also made sure to tell them not to engage into it for now not until they have have grown to have a much more wider  understanding of he system. Cause there are cons as much as pros in it..[17/02, 03:18] Osep Nysc: [17/02, 03:24] Osep Nysc: [17/02, 03:26] Osep Nysc: [17/02, 03:29] Osep Nysc:",

      "body": "Yea that's a smart move, telling them about Bitcoin.I think it will be a great idea, if Bitcoin and other crypto trading is taught as an extra curriculum activities in school. It would make lots of sense for those student who would be going into trading in the nearest future. Informing them at a young age will help them broaden their idea on the cryptocurrency market, and at an older age trading won't be a problem for them cause they already learnt the foundation parts back in school.They should also not engage in it for now because they wont be able to bear the risk all by them selfs. it will distract them from their studies and they may end up having low grades",

Guiding young minds is always good so that they will prepared on what’s coming especially if they discover it for themselves but this time they knew already what they need to avoid due to your guidance unlike that try all those shit scam scheme before I learned.You should include the outline of your lesson here so that we can help you on improving it. I just that you have a good introduction before start discussing it because some of them might get the wrong the idea about Bitcoin and become greedy on investing ponzi scheme.",

Discussions about Bitcoin will create a curiosity in their mind to know about Bitcoin which will help them to get a better understanding about Bitcoin before long.  When they later become adults and get into cryptocurrency, this idea will come in handy in their future.",

I just want to ask you OP, you said that you are a teacher, what is it that you gave them that is bitcoin as a subject to your students? or did you just insert it into your teaching as a teacher?Your intentions for them are good, but it's still different because the initiative to find out what bitcoin is will come from someone who wants to learn it, compared to us wanting to teach them. But anyway, congratulations on that.",

As for looking at the image, it seems that most of them are still young ones.Anyway, that's a good initiative on your end being a teacher of their class. You have just given them the idea about bitcoin's existence and that's already more than enough for them. They'll surely remember it and others might tell it to their parents and relatives of what they've learned from your class. If it's already clear to them on what bitcoin is, that will break the stereotype from the others if ever they will relay to what you've taught them.",

It’s normal their primary interest at this age is not about making money or investments. The image you provided is unclear, I have to strain my eyes to see your outline on the blackboard, your focus was 1. Introduction to Bitcoin 2. Economic role of bitcoin I would suggest you look up other members who have done similar projects and see how you can improve yours from there. Agbe has a nice template you can follow. Good initiative, it always beautiful to see bitcoin awareness spreading to the rural areas.",

Anyway, having somebody that will guide to them is always a good. Just don't let them invest at least for now and at the same time, let them watch documentaries with regards to Bitcoin as well. That help me know more about Bitcoin when I was still new to it so I believe it will be a big help for your students as well.Last thing, teach them how to know if it's a scam or not in the future.",

I'm not sure where you came from, but I think the accessibility of technologies is difficult, which is why there is little to no knowledge on it and they are just browsing the internet for fun. It is a good start to teach them about bitcoin, and for sure they will get interested in it. Also, it is best if you show them the charts and the actual sending and receiving of bitcoin from your laptop or phone so that they can imagine it well.",

I think OP is a youth corper and judging from the facilities provided, it’s most likely a public school. AFAIK Bitcoin is legal in Nigeria, so there won’t be any persecuting here on that basis. Also OP first statement implies he had the permission of the school authorities to teach bitcoin after school hours.

My main concern is how the results are analysed, like what metrics are chosen as the basis of a formula that tells the program is working and doing effectively. The student looking interested or having curiosity won't indicate how well this program performs or the pedagogy processes.Personally, Most of the education systems in the world, especially in the third-world countries, in the basic sense are ineffective. Thus it is more encouraged to teach basic things deeper and has a better process of pedagogy.",
