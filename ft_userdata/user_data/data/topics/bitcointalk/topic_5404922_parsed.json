Flow is considered a potential token, but it has a low cap, which means investors need to be careful when investing at this point in time.It went indeed down a lot with the whole market.I check Near protocol but have no clue so far what their goal is. Seems like a multichain initiative ? Do they have large partnerships so far ?Flow is for example launching La Liga NFTs (Spanish soccer) soon. Maybe itâ€™s more of the same and bad timing but itâ€™s again a high end sports competition with millions of followers.Also Ive used Flow several times and it works perfect (for me as a non-expert user)",
