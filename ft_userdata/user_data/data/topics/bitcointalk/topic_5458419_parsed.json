But I have seen such cases before. It probably depends on the type of investigation and who is conducting it. It may be a third party security provider so it is out of the casino's control. It does sound a bit on the longer side, though. A month or two should be the maximum in my opinion.",

You can go to the gambling board and check the announcement thread of very active casinos, use them instead.If not that and you are sure that you have done nothing wrong, going to third parties over withdrawal issue on a gambling site would be better. But avoid scammers, go to the appropriate third parties.

So I guess you need to follow up then to know what's the latest update about your case since somehow 7 months of waiting is so long.Maybe try to know what cause for more delays since for sure they have their own reason why this incident is happening.

Usually, any case should be resolved within 5 to 10 days no matter how complex is the issue. However, they told you that you will get an answer on Wednesday, meaning that they are working on your issue and hopefully your issue will be resolved in your favor. However, be ready as they can ask you for more documentation plus they can deny your request if they have any proof of yourself violating the terms and conditions of the casino.",

This can make the process take much longer. That's why they give themselves a margin and tell people everything can take longer but 6 months is over any margin that I've heard of.
