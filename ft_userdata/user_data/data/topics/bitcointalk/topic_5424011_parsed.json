      "body": "Most people are passionate about the work they do and the cryptocurrency community is particularly passionate about their work. But there is another, simpler reason why this community can be especially unpleasant: digital currency has a lot of value, which means that shady characters are attracted to it. When there is money at stake, people can become more hostile.In summation, the cryptocurrency community does have some bad elements and growing pains, but it is no worse than any other growing industry. There are still plenty of very smart and caring people in this space, but you will have to do your research to find them. It is also important to remember that in a market as unregulated as cryptocurrency, there will always be many con artists and fraudsters who use the popularity of bitcoin and other digital currencies as a way to line their pockets by lying or creating schemes that are built on lies.",

There's ton of money involved so things get heated.\"-Is this why people automatically worship Elon Musk and invest in Dogecoin just because Musk says so? The cryptocurrency community is too fickle to do the required due diligence to understand anything about anything.That's a weird connection to my sentence. Doge fans cheer because because someone famous talks about them. Elon has fanbois and i am pretty sure they are not all that into crypto. Most of the PLANET doesn't \"understand anything about anything\" so why are you singling out crypto here? If you want to talk with smart people start from smarter then yourself. There are some brilliant crypto devs out there that are not tribalistic/maximalists, nor they care about the price.Quote from: jvanname on November 29, 2022, 10:23:31 PM\"Those who support you now will support you for a long time\"-Well, I have not been able to find any long-term supporters who I know by name. I have nothing but haters because the cryptocurrency sector is full of hateful people.Yeah, i am starting to see the full picture of why wouldn't you have supporters. Even if you don't have people skills you can practise them. You don't need to be talking with everyone, nor everyone needs to like you. Obviously you will have haters, that's the reason famous people don't want to google themselves. Because they would focus only on the haters. Human brain is funny that way.But instead of blaming others and wanting them to change, maybe take a hard look at the mirror first. And think what you want, why you want it and why do you think you deserve it. Or if you rather just want to build, then build.Quote from: jvanname on November 29, 2022, 10:23:31 PM\"Just be transparent what you do and youl'll be fine.\"-I have tried this. But I find it impossible to communicate with people because there is a shortage of human intelligence in the world.If you can't dumb down low enough to get trough, talk with smarter ones. It could be that your project somehow attracts wrong people and you need to ask yourself why is that?Maybe take a page from people who have been transparent, and how they reply to fud and stupid comments. Emanuele Francioni for example has insanely good track record in their telegram/discord using their own free time explaining very technical subjects to idiots like me. Quote from: jvanname on November 29, 2022, 10:23:31 PM\"Most people are passionate about the work they do and the cryptocurrency community is particularly passionate about their work.\"-There is a difference between being passionate and being in a cult. I would say it's definitely not \"most people\", but there are those too. Yeah, this space is full of tribalism and bring out worst of some people, because that's what humans do, they treat this as a sport where they cheer the other team and diss the other one and that's just something i am learning to ignore here. Most of people in here are profit maximalists anyway caliming that they are \"in it for the tech\". It has been meme from the start. From the perspective of a smart person, majority of the people are immature idiots, you just have to accepted this blaming it all at one fringe sector for it is just lazyQuote from: jvanname on November 29, 2022, 10:23:31 PM\"There are still plenty of very smart and caring people in this space, but you will have to do your research to find them.\"-I don't believe this.That's really your problem, i could make a list but i feel like you are now just acting out as you are frustrated. I already gave one name but i am betting you can find hundred of others you can find just by reading the white papers. Most of the projects are crap and you need to weed out those. If you don't want to do the work, then i can't help you on that.Quote from: jvanname on November 29, 2022, 10:23:31 PM\"I would like you to be more specific about what kind of interactions and what kind of entities you have communicated with. . .\"-Um. People have been posting Nazi imagery in online forums, and nobody except for me sees a problem with this. This is what happens when we remove censorship, people aren't like they seem on any other social media. You can look at 4chan, that's how people interact when they can be anonymous. It's not problem in crypto, it's the human race.Quote from: jvanname on November 29, 2022, 10:23:31 PMThis is because the entities in those forums are Nazis. Just yesterday, someone posted a picture of a penis in a forum. And here you are assuming we are now all nazis. I guess that includes you too. How is this deductive reasoning? But if you really need an answer to this, if you haven't been paying attention, exremist right wing have been on the rise in the whole world. I mean \"The Jews\" were trending in the twitter just while ago. Again it's not just crypto. And i am not defending this by the way. I am all for censorship.Quote from: jvanname on November 29, 2022, 10:23:31 PMThe people in these forums constantly and relentlessly harass me. They do not know how to communicate in proper English. And no, this is not because they are foreigners. It is because they hate education. Nobody ever knows what I am talking out when I am trying to communicate. Stop interacting with people who harass you and kick them out. You can't feed the trolls, that's how they live.Quote from: jvanname on November 29, 2022, 10:23:31 PMThe cryptocurrency community also hates me intensely because I have a Ph.D. in mathematics. They think that I need to apologize for having an education. The Bitcoin community also hates science intensely.It sounds like Covid-19 masks and the Covid-19 lockdowns have inhibited humanity's social skills. And the brain damage from long Covid has caused people to become vegetables.Yes, some people have hated science since scientific method was a thing, long before even internet. This is not about crypto.Quote from: jvanname on November 29, 2022, 10:23:31 PM\"I have got the impression you may be dealing with the wrong people at the wrong place, since you dare to call out a whole community this way.\" -Then do better. I have no problem calling the entire cryptocurrency community out for being bad people, and I will continue to do this until the behavior of the cryptocurrency community improves. I would personally not want to transact with anyone using cryptocurrencies or with anyone who has any cryptocurrency since the cryptocurrency sector has been completely rotten.And you wonder why you are getting harassed? It's not just you, it's everyone in here. It's good that you want to defend yourself but you can't win the fight by arguing with idiots. This whole space attracts people from every possible group of people. So there are conspiratards, idiots, scientists, rich, poor, gamblers, idealistic, young, old, far right, far left, mental patients and doctors. All having a voice, so unless you actively filter out the irrelevant voices it's all noise where loudest idiot wins.You have to remember that normally you can act with people like yourself, in this space, you will hear voices that are borderlne illegal and dangerous, and these talking points and all this trolling is hopefully very much different from your normal circles and yes, that can be shocking. Again, this is all internet uncensored, not crypto.",

      "body": "\"Stop interacting with people who harass you and kick them out. You can't feed the trolls, that's how they live.\"-I tried getting rid of the harassers and those who refuse to stand for sanity, and as a result, there was literally nobody left. Everybody loves harassment because they are evil. May God damn their souls.\"All having a voice, so unless you actively filter out the irrelevant voices it's all noise where loudest idiot wins.\"-I have been doing that. And now, the only voice that is left is my own. Everyone else is a harasser and a Nazi. If you don't like what I have so say, then do better.\"And here you are assuming we are now all nazis. I guess that includes you too.\"-I will assume the crypto community has a lot of Nazis until I have evidence of anything otherwise. Perhaps 5 to 10 percent of the cryptocurrency community is not entrenched in Nazism, but those are not good numbers. When I called out others for their Nazism, there was absolutely nobody to defend sanity except for me. I was the only one. I know that this is hard to hear, but it is the truth. The cryptocurrency sector loves Nazism. If you do not like this, then do better. If I am the only person left after banning the Nazis, then that means that nearly everyone in the cryptocurrency sector is a Nazi.\"Yes, some people have hated science since scientific method was a thing, long before even internet. This is not about crypto.\"-And that is not an excuse.\"It's not problem in crypto, it's the human race.\"-That is not an excuse.\"That's really your problem, i could make a list but i feel like you are now just acting out as you are frustrated.\"-I am telling the truth. The truth hurts.\"Doge fans cheer because because someone famous talks about them.\"-And people who worship Elon are assholes; cryptocurrency chlurmcks are also assholes. Elon tortures and murders monkeys, so he is just like Jeffrey Dahmer, and Elon is only as rich as he is because people are stupid enough to worship him. I have encountered quite a few crypto chlurmcklets who worship Elon. And let us not forget the obvious. Elon pumped the price of Doge so that suckers invest in Doge and give their money to Elon. I cannot respect those suckers. \"Yeah, i am starting to see the full picture of why wouldn't you have supporters. Even if you don't have people skills you can practise them.\"-I get it. You think that the only people who have people skills are those who turn a blind eye towards Nazism because if we got rid of all the Nazis, there will be nobody left to do good.It is not good to get far more upset that I am observing that the cryptocurrency community is dysfunctional than to get upset at the dysfunction and dysfunctional people itself.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.Creator of Circcash",

Regardless of their advancement in the industry they might sometimes show some sign of immaturity due to their age or lack of experience. This also doesn't dispute the fact that most of these youths shows high level of maturity. I am studying for my Ph.D and one of the skills this level of education gives is the ability to manage people without causing conflict or any form of confrontation. People would always give their opinion about issues and most times it might be in conflict with your own belief or ideology but you have the option to either accept them or refuse them peacefully. At your level, you should be able to manage people regardless of their orientation or ideology.I can attest to the fact that this forum has some of the matured minds I have ever met in my entire life. Most people in this forum states their view or position without insulting or intimidating other users. I think you met some people that offended you greatly but generalizing your experience wouldn't be helpful to you because this industry has very good people. And I just hope that you would soon meet some of them.",

Obviously you can use your education as a mask to avoid any self reflecting.

So excuse me for not believing something that i have frankly have numerous reasons not to believe. Burden of proof lies on you as you very well know.If you rather believe blindly people in the internet (or maybe you are pretending to do so), that's your choice, but you can tell us to \"f*ck off\" in this forum and think we would obey.

You can always block me if you get annoyed want but that's not same as silencing.I can't believe i have to tell you this but it's maybe because you are new here, but you have zero idea who any of us are, what's our background are and if we would tell you, you would have no way confirming that, nor you should automatically believe it.Again, the fact you are seeing nazis around is because lack of censorship in here. You would see that on sports, mechanics, nature, computer gaming or science based forums. Any forums out there, if they had looser censorship. So far i haven't seen any of these here without someone confronting these trolls. Yet they aren't complaining how everyone here is a troll, they are just replying to specific person who is trolling. And since you are obsessed with Musk you know he had BS degree too.And go ahead, you can hate nazis all you want. Most of us like i, hate that ideology. But since you love to generalize, you must realize as educated man that one of the key things how nazism appealed to public and united them effectively was generalization of groups of people and dehumanising them.",

I have noticed that the entities in this ecosystem are some of the most immature and vile entities imaginable. The people in the cryptocurrency ecosystem have thoroughly earned my disrespect. They are just awful to be around and communicate to in any way whatsoever. Instead of trying to defend the cryptocurrency sector or tell me that I am doing something wrong, you should try becoming a better person.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.Creator of CirccashBy saying entities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What are you referring to in particular?The cryptocurrency sector is not the only sector that's hateful and evil just like you said I don't know the other reason you use these words apart from what you stated but you need to understand that no total Bitcoin enthusiast will ever support any altcoin movement or concept because BTC is the only safe haven cryptocurrency and their belief is that most altcoins are created to enrich the project team.Having said that, no one can understand your dream and goals like you and you expect something positive from someone that doesn't understand your dream but if you let their negativity stop you from achieving your dream you have no one to blame but yourself.",
