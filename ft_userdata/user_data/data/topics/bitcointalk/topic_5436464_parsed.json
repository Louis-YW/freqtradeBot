Because i saw someone complained that the wallet was hacked and the funds got missing. I want to know if every wallet have same security. Because from the research i make i find out we have different wallet and out of this wallet below which one should be more encouraging for beginners to use for saving of coins, and i want to know the different between custodial wallet and none custodial wallet.Edited and remove the confused list of wrong wallets which is not the real wallet's to be use according to the superior officers .",

Because i saw someone complained that the wallet was hacked and the funds got missing.Mind you that quite rightly some wallets are safer and better than others, but every wallet can be hacked, it all depends on how the user uses it, if one is quite knowledgeable with the right wallet, then their funds are safe, but the thing is that every crypto user has a responsibilty to protect their funds, notwithstanding the wallet they use. Thus because you saw someone who lost their funds through their hardware wallet being hacked doesn't mean hardware wallets aren't safe.Quote from: Onyeeze on January 23, 2023, 12:55:29 PMI want to know if every wallet have same security.NoQuote from: Onyeeze on January 23, 2023, 12:55:29 PMand i want to know the different between custodial wallet and none custodial wallet.A custodial wallet is one that the user doesn't have the keys/seed phrase to, an exchange wallet is an example of a custodial wallet, whilst a non custodial wallet is one that the user is in control of, and has the keys/seed phrase to, electrum is an example of non custodial wallet.

Although non custodial wallet doesn't really mean it's for privacy, but looking on how many wallets are better than Coinbase e.g. Electrum, Bluewallet, etc, it doesn't make sense if we need to use Coinbase wallet.@OP although it's true beginner is more easier to use exchange to hold their coins, but they must learn how to use non custodial wallet and how to verify the signature in order to make their coins safe for many many years later. A beginner doesn't mean always become a beginner, they can start from scratch and learn for everyday.",

There are many misleading articles that teach newcomers wrong things like \"exchanges are the best place to keep your coins\" or that \"self-custody is not for newbies and \"normal\" people, it is only for privacy-obsessed weirdos who don't believe governments that wish only the best for their citizens.\" No, self-custody is important: you should cut out of your life those wallets that don't offer such functionality. If you have full control over your addresses, private keys, seed phrases, UTXOs (indivisible chunks of coins), fee and privacy settings and also know that the code is open-source and being constantly reviewed by people who care, you're likely using a good wallet that makes you a self-sovereign cryptocurrency user. If you trust others (people you don't even know) to keep your money like in the case of centralized exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, etc), you are just waiting for them to breach that trust and run away with your money or some smart hacker to break their platform and steal from them, which in both cases will result in your losses and disappointments.",

Do not leave your Bitcoin on crypto exchanges (such as Binance, Kraken, etc.), but always use a non-custodial wallet where you always have full, independent control over your private keys. Exchanges are a great, easy way to buy Bitcoin and altcoins, yet they are not suitable for long-term storage. Exchanges get hacked, your access is blocked or you can't get your coins for other reasons.For this reason, you should deal with the basic questions regarding the storage of cryptocurrencies before (!) buying Bitcoin. Only when you have understood the basics would I make my first purchase.In my opinion, offline paper wallets or hardware wallets such as those offered by Ledger or Trezor are best suited for storage.However, I would start here: https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet",

For a beginner I think an Electrum wallet should suffice but it's really important that you use it on an air-gapped device, if possible to minimize any potential risks. For the optimal option, using a cold wallet such as a hardware wallet would be highly recommended especially if you're willing to spend a bit of money for enhanced security and privacy.
