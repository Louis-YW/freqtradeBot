I mean both of them are addicted at that point if they need someone to quit to manage their finances so sooner or later, it's going to spiral out of their control. It'd be better for them to manage themselves with control, either together or not it doesn't really matter so that any future issues can be resolved by themselves instead of relying on another person. In the case of the one quitting though, it'd definitely have to be the person who'd manage their finances and I reckon there'd already be an argument then and there really. Even rules wouldn't work since, well, an addict can go far and beyond if they really wanted something.",

If we're talking about 1 partner buying a lottery ticket each week and 1 partner spending all their spare money from wages on an addiction, then there is a big mismatch in the relationship. It's the same if two people in a relationship are smokers, knowing they have to quit, but chances are one of the two has a stronger passion to quit than the other - it's rare that people will hit that rock bottom moment at the same time. In reality, each person needs to figure out their own motivation to quit and apply it, but getting them to do it at the same time is harder. It's going to be difficult for just one of the two to quit if both of them gamble on the same things.",

If you're going to ask this hypothetical question then at least provide more context like who is earning more and providing most for the family expenses. It's traditionally the Father's role but if this marriage is a 50-50 then both of them has to reconsider their gambling activities. I wouldn't say both should quit if they're able to manage it to a minimum.",

Well because you raise a quite interesting case we think that one of the two is the most appropriate to stop of course the wife and focus on raising and educating their children. The child growth and development and level of emotional closeness are in the hands  of the mother. It is the mother who will be the director of her child while the husband has the obligation to earn a living even though in this  case gambling is actually not an ideal source of  income for getting a consistent income. It depends on whether he works at the casino or is just a gambler not involved in any specific activity with the casino.",

Despite the rules, they continue to gamble, and as a result, their business has been neglected, and their children are no longer being taken care of. These are just a few of the negative effects of gambling, especially when both spouses are involved. It's challenging to be in such a situation, can you imagine the impact on the family's life?They should consider the possible issues or consequences of such a setup; there should still be boundaries. I'm not saying they should quit altogether, but they should focus on moderation and finding a balance that works for the family. There should be limits on playing; sometimes, they forget that gambling should be just a form of entertainment, not something to rely on for the family's livelihood. In my opinion, it's also not good if both spouses are simultaneously gambling, especially in front of their children.",

Left with me alone, I can not marry a gambler if I get to consider the habitual barriers that is accompanied to it such as the addictions,the inability to control gambling emotions and the lack of conducts about setting up a gambling budget.But if by such of this threads scenero, they can both set up a gambling budget and must be disciplined not to contrarily bridge their gambling plans but to stable their bankrolls.Also that they must not discuss about their gambling life in front before the kids else they gets infected. Always tell each other the truth at when won or lost and every incomes made from the gambling must be in am account of the family so everyone can benefit from it since the goal of gambling is to make profits of solving financial needs. And they must not be in the gambling board together else it is either they are biased to each other at that moment if at lost or they looses focus for mathematical organogram on predictions and calculations.Quote from: Lida93 on December 10, 2023, 11:55:58 AMWould it help if  one of the couple quit for the other and if that's the case who should quit for who.Oh yes it would be wise if one must quit.And that should be the wife because women are liable to emotional breakdowns otherwisely she might be unable to control her emotions at when lost hoping to bet more and recover in other to prove her husband that she ya better gambler because Women are used to competitive lives even life living.The wife is mostly to spend more time at home with the kids so her present at home would be essential and usually indeed of to the kids at home.The men are more likely to be selfdefense able at an outbreak of mayhems so, the man who stay up while wife steps back because any negative occurances is liable to happen. Especially when one is publicly noted on a huge and amazing amounts of winning or beating (winning) aggressive opposition maybe in a physical skill based gambling.Moreover, the financial responsibilities of a family is usually on the mans task so let him step up having the gambling as a means make money even though it is not reliable while the wife steps back.",

      "body": "I'm a product of this kind of familial relationship, and I'll tell you that it's not pretty.My mom and dad were both gamblers who develop this habit when I was in 3rd grade. At first, they were just spending very minimal amounts in the gambling house and still manage to take us to fancy restaurants and a treat every so often. After a couple of years, both of them started hiding money from each other, up to the point that we're neglected of our needs so long as they can gamble. It was something awful, they never taught us how to gamble, but we know that they do it every night. The children are the most affected of this setup. They don't know that this is what's happening behind the scenes, and most of the time, they don't know the reason why they cannot go to school or cannot get food that they used to have before. Thankfully, I didn't develop into a gambling addict like them, and I still know how to control my finances. If I were to marry someone, I might give up gambling just because I don't want it to take up time that I could be spending with my family, and not because I'm scared of losing control.",

It is difficult to have both parents addicted to gambling. And it is impossible that their children do not see that. Except that it depends on the age of their child, who has a broad mind about gambling.  Even if one of them quits, it will be difficult for him to do that 100%, and of course he still sees that his wife will gamble. Maybe it would be better if they both stopped gambling; that would be better so they wouldn't be tempted to gamble.",

      "body": "Both spouses should embrace the gambling habit and learn more about gambling. They'll have fun as a family. What matters is being able to prominently control the affairs of the family. It's not bad for gamblers to be married. Who then will stop gambling, it's not bad. Unless they're pruned to getting addicted, then it's of no use to continue gambling. The fun gets better when they both, visit offline casinos and lodge in hotels to gamble during vacations. I understand that in a family where kids are just growing, they'll need to focus more on disciplining their children, and also maintain a mutual understanding of not discussing gambling-related topics around the kids. Don't think it'll be right for them to stop gambling. They both have jobs and should know how much to spend daily on gambling or set out an amount for monthly gambling. If their gambling habits begin to affect the family lifestyle, then it means they're getting something wrong. They can discuss ways of controlling money spent on gambling. Isn't it a nice experience for the gambler, who married a female gambler, or introduced his wife to gambling? Discussing with our wife about gambling and how to manage money. Gamblers need a companion to discuss, often their gambling attitude and encounters. One party can't get addicted without the next person being aware.But, in families where the man is gambling, the wife won't be aware if their husband gets addicted. Thereby causing more harm to the success of the family, mentally, and financially. provided that gambling is legalized in their country, then nobody is expected to quit. They'll be able to manage their bankrolls. I've read of a wife who is mainly interested in slot and the husband a poker player. They spend their vacations together in casinos and end up winning more money. Enjoy free hotel rooms, and food and get fun, as they're comp members. After their vacation, they'll go back home happy. In a family like Op described the kids seem to be young. In the long run, both spouses would appreciate being gamblers, if they maintain responsible gambling. But, OP, if they are currently undergoing any form of addiction, then open up in your thread. From what you wrote, nothing like that, you only care about their financial well-being. Which shouldn't bother you. They've figured out how to handle that aspect.",

But if only one of them has an income, then they should discuss together how much money they are willing to bet on the games without compromising the family's income.Time: Addiction is the main villain of those who bet on gambling and if both are addicted, the chances of their children having a terrible education are very high. Parents should decide together how much and for how long they will play, preferably at times when their children are not physically around so that their habits do not influence them at an unnecessarily young age.",
