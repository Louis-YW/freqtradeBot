But as I said before, your ego is so high that you live in your own world. And we are spamming or off-topic? His whole conversation in our announcement is off-topic.It shows the brain level on this forum, unfortunately. Also he deleted our reply, only then we posted the other reply with got also deleted. So you point of \"consecutive posting\" is false",
