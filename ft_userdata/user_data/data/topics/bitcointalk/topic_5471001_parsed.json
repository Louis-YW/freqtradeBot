      "body": "That's good news for European citizens because a few weeks back I was reading posts in which the OP was in doubt, about the crypto debit cards of Binance, The thing is, Binance cards were no longer supported in Europe and Binance did make announcement at that time that, the customers should no worry about it, we are working on an alternative to the payment method. And I think this is the alternative they are talking about, I am unable to find those topics now. Other than in the past, this new payment system will open new ways and the customers of Binance who are afraid to buy new debit cards, especially those, whose debit cards are going to expire soon. They can start using it again. And the new customers will also come and the overall, trading volume will be increased.",

This is what I found online: https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-shutting-down-european-visa-debit-card-december  It's a huge blow to all Bitcoiners in the EU. This card was quite popular among users. The US are blackmailing VISA, VISA is blackmailing CONTIS, forcing it to dump Binance cards. Payback time for refusing to freeze accounts belonging to Russian users.",

I think Bianance using SEPA is a good choice right now, I just hope the can do the same in my country",
