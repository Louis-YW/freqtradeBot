Since I normally don't work with these e-wallet services, I am not going to withdraw the funds to my bank account/debit card. These are personal and verified accounts btw.I am planning to use the money to buy BTC and USDT for it. Are there trusted members here who accept Wise and Skrill and who would be interested in 1:1 long-term deals perhaps? Escrow can, of course, be part of the deal, we just need to agree on the terms.Post below please or send me a PM.",

Wise will block your account if they find out and then they will take 2 months to figure out what's wrong with it.@OP, I accept Wise, I also have a 5 star rating at localcoinswap.com.

Thanks for getting in touch. I will keep that in mind. However, I haven't had the best of experience with Skrill in the past. Back when it was called Moneybookers, I remember that they were very nosy and showed a tendency towards locking accounts and asking questions who the people you send money to are, where the money comes from, what you use their services for? Despite the account being verified, they still freeze it and investigate for a week or two until they finally reinstate everything back to the way it was.Because of that, my current preference is Wise. Is there something about Wise that you don't like and that's why you don't want it?",

The other way is to find P2P traders in your city/area who exchange their trading profits, BTC/USDT for cash - the second way carries some risks, be careful who you meet and where you meet.

I have checked both before creating this thread. Wise is not a very popular payment method on Bisq. Last time I checked there were only 2 orders for Wise in EUR and not a single one for USD. Skrill, on the other hand, is not supported at all. The Hodlhodl margins are just ridiculous and not worth it for anyone.

Wise and Skrill are not cash on hand. When I have cash on hand, I know where to go with it, same way I know what to do with the crypto.",
