Devs?Yeah, I really don't understand here, it's not like gambling (maybe that's how they see it), but for us, it's a investment vehicle, sometimes to lose if you make the wrong decision and sell early and maybe the edge goes to the buyer because they got it cheap. Still though, you can't say it's a 100% guarantee win on the others party as he could also sell it at a lost.As for Charlie Munger, he has a lot already, has the experience, but this is a new kind of investment that maybe this old dinosaurs don't have any clue that's why they attack it.",

They are looking at BTC as investing in a stock / business which is what they do.If you look at it as investing in a currency it's a different thing. Because in this day and age with most countries money no longer backed by gold or some other physical thing but rather just by that country promising that it's worth that much and people trading on that BTC looks a whole lot different.It's also just his opinion. I think the entire Berkshire Hathaway thing is going to implode when Charlie and Warren do pass away. Most of the value they have built up is because of their passion and their drive. It's rare to find people like that who can drive a company that size for as long as they have and as well as they have. Once they are gone I don't see it staying up as high as it is.-Dave",

And when this bomb will explode, no one knows, but it will definitely explode.The data for 2022 says that the US public debt is slightly less than $27 trillion, but if you look at the public debts of other countries in relation to their GDP, you will see that there are many whose debt is over 100% in relation to GDP, and Greece and Japan have even over 200%. It is undeniable that the US is in a problem, but a lot of other countries are in an even bigger problem and I am much more worried about everyone else than about the US - because they will find a way to get out of the problem, just like before.https://eamond.com/public-debt-by-country-2022/",

Only very belatedly did Buffett buy Apple stock.Besides if they talk about \"cryptocurrencies\" they are not that far off the mark: there are currently a total of 22,505 and growing, 99% of which the only thing they are going to do is fleece the savings of the unwary who invest in them thinking they are going to make 1,000x in a short time.",

In fact the only lever that still works is issuing more bonds (and finding more bond investors and/or investors willing to buy more in bonds).",
