  "content": "Exactly 11 days from now, we will see the fight between Justin Gaethje vs Rafael Fiziev. So this battle will be OLD vs the NEW generation. Justin Gaethje has 79% of Knockout rate while has only 66% of knockout rate. In terms of Experience, I may go with Justin Gathje because he fought a lot of strong warriors like Oliveira, Chandler and of course Khabib. I do not know if Rafael has enough to experience to overcome Justin. The experience is more important than skill. So who you got in this Fight? I'll pick Justin",

      "body": "Surprisingly, Bookmaker and the majority of the fan doesn’t value experience on this match probably because Gaethje lose back to back recently on chasing the Lightweight championship belt. Rafael is currently on 6 winning streak with impressive finish. People is just tired betting for Gaethje due to the upsetting defeat by Oliveira since he should won that fight if he didn’t got choke to finish.The odds is really tempting but the winning streak is very hard to stop for Justin. I will bet for Justin just because bookmaker offer good odds also this might be his redemption match for another Lightweight shot. I’m not expecting much for Justin but I hope this bet will pay me.",

I'll pick Justin If you bet, on the stats/record for Gaethje (23-4-0), it is far behind the record Fiziev got (12-1-0), but make no mistake, anything can happen unexpectedly in an MMA match, maybe overall many gamblers have placed bets for @Gaethje, if you go by Gaethje's record.But if the opposite had happened to Gaethje in the wire loop, maybe the story would have been different. It was something new and a setback for Justin this time against Fiziev, to be honest, I have seen the two of them wrestle elsewhere, for me personally Fiziev cannot be underestimated with the mixed martial arts skills he has mastered, Fiziev has taken Muay Thai champion several times, even though Gaethje is known in every MMA match as a striker with a brutal hook style that he often plays, but this time I'm sure Fiziev can break all of that with the art of skill he has, I take points for Fiziev.",

      "body": "I liked watching Gathje's early fights. He was really into it, had a lot more heart. I'm not sure of his recent performance, so I would skip betting on this fight simply because the outcome is very uncertain. Would bet on Gathje if we were were back in 2013/14 but now I 'm not sure if he's not burned out yet, like McGregor.",

Rumor has it that he'd been calling JG to fight him but JG kept voiding him. They do have impressive KOs though but Fiziev is younger and sharper, it's legkicks vs leg kicks or Fiziev will just have to avoid leg kicks to outclass JG.",

      "body": "Many gamblers may prefer Justin Gaethje, and I can say that I am close to both names when making a basis. Justin had fights with very experienced names before. Justin Gaethje's ring experience is too much for Fiziev. This is a good station for Fiziev, if he can pass this place, his way will be wide open. He will carry everything into the match to clear his way. Fiziev will be my choice, as I will take a big risk in this match. But I want to give it a chance. No matter how experienced his opponent was, Fiziev was a very hungry fight and this fight is a big hunt for him.",

Fiziev has been calling Gaethje because all of his life he has been eating such fighters as Gaethje for breakfast. Gaethje is unique fighter, that during his mma career managed to forget everything he was taught about wrestling. A guy who has 191-9 record in wrestling, now is famous in UFC as one of hardest lowkicks strikers. And we have Fiziev, who has moved to Thailand without money, and had to earn by fighting (and win) against guys who chop bamboo trees with their lowkicks. Gaethjes most famous and dangerous weapon is like mosquito bite for Fiziev.",

What a very close fight, you can see the both fighters are willing to beat each other. Ths is one of the best fight in UFC 286, pure striking match and both fighters are giving their all. The damage that Justin Gaethje gives to Rafael is unreal, you can see his face that he is really hurt. Rafael has also moment that he hurt Justin but it didn't stop Justin to whoop his ass. Both are great fighters and their matchup is like the main event of the UFC 286. I'll look forward to their rematch, they have a great sportmanship after all.",

He's a good fighter, but he doesn't have the skills to beat you. He's an old-school fighter, and he's not a good fighter. He's going to be a lot of trouble for the next few years.The fight has already been ended almost two months ago  Gaethji has won by decision.
