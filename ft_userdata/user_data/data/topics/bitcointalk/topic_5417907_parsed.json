Although posts like these are important in creating a distinction between the two to at least separate them as two completely different concepts that just happened to coincide based on the circumstances.",

I see you unintentionally confused two things. Price speculation on crypto with crypto. Because crypto itself have nothing to do with gambling in oppose to crypto trading. Its the opposite of that because everything is coded and open source. So you know that there will be less than 21 mln bitcoins. You know each block is ~10 min. Fiats are more gamblish than crypto because you never know when supply will double or when someone will lock your money.",

      "body": "People often compare certain markets to gambling when they disapprove of them, but strictly speaking, it's not correct. Gambling is a game of known and truly random probability. The market movements are not random, it's just that they can't be well predicted when the market is purely speculative. This is what makes crypto market look like gambling - you can't predict the outcome, just like with random chance, even though the outcome is not random. That's why investors like stocks, bonds and other traditional assets - you can predict their value with mathematical models.",

The only parallels between cryptocurrency and gambling is that we do not know whether we will lose or win money on our investment. But we are completely leaving out the property of probability from the comparison.The probability of you making $10000 Dollars out of a $1000 investment with cryptocurrency is much much higher than you making the same by gambling. The reason for this is because in the gambling casino world, the casino always has house edge and mathematically, cannot be the one losing money over an extended period of time. It just would not work. We can all agree Bitcoin will definitely reach 100k (at least) during the next ATH. It might take years but that's already 5x profit with 99% certainty that you won't get from any casino.",

Not only for cryptocurrency but the rest of investments are considered gambling as they don’t give guarantees when to make profits, or maybe not. However, with bitcoin or cryptocurrency, it’s a lot more proven from successful investors that buying and hodling it for long term will give us sure profits in the end. But the problem is, most of the investors are not for long term hodling but for quick profiting so they end up choosing altcoins for short term profiting. In the end, some made profits while some loses their funds.",

While gambling relies on chanceFor one reason or another, most people still regard cryptocurrency as a gamble; it is either:1. They have a friend who invested in some shitcoins and got their hard-earned money dumped .2. They have received tainted information about cryptocurrency, which has cost them their investment in some altcoins.3: they have seen a friend or been told of stories that got some investors' funds sucked up.4. They have not really gotten to know that Bitcoin is the right coin to buy and hold for a long time.5. Some shitcoin investments have fallen short of their lofty expectations.Some other reasons apart from the ones I thought could have been the cause may have made them think crypto was a gamble.But gambling and cryptocurrency have one thing in common, which is \"uncertainty.\" But understanding the basics of Bitcoin and crypto investment before venturing into it is way better than taking it for a gamble and warding away one's money.For example, Bitcoinners are expecting the next bull run by 2024, and no one is so certain that Bitcoin will be $100K (it could be more or less) by the next bull market. No one can predict the outcome or score of a gambling game unless by chance. It's not always 100%.Quote from: BitcoinBarrel on October 21, 2022, 05:43:38 PMLife is a Gamble  In life, people take a lot of significant risks to get potential results. So, that can be equated to life being a gamble, because gambling is a risky venture. You are not wrong for noting that life is a gamble.",

Even life itself is gambling in the first place. However, there are some ways to lessen the risk and increase the chances to make profits. Like in cryptocurrency, if you invest in altcoins particularly in new projects, the chances of losing is high and chances of profiting is quite low so you have to consider thinking about that. But if you want to have greater chances to make profits, choose bitcoin. Although bitcoin is still a gambling investment, but you know that you could make a lot of money out of it simply by buying low and selling high, and being patient of course.",

They also may not know well what crypto is. Most of these types of people are beginners, they only know how to make profits without understanding deeply what they are doing. At the end of the day, they must realize that trading or investing is different from gambling because trading and investing have a strategy to optimize the chance for profits. Those people need more experience to understand trading, to know more about crypto deeply as well.",
