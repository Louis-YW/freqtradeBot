      "body": "The forum largely describes events I didn't know about earlier, so it was informative, but it also seems that it's not really the history of the forum, as much as it is about hacks and financial discussions related to donations (and how they were used). To me, these are not the most important aspects. The article doesn't talk about the life of the forum, prominent members, popular topics, features that were added at certain points in time (like the merit system), signature campaigns etc.As for the author, I tried finding the info on the website, but couldn't find anything.",

TheAymos, despite being a kid at that time, according to the article (he may confirm it or not, I guess), was able to always come up front and speak openly without hiding anything or making shady moves. That is something one needs to have some maturity at the age of 19 or 20. And we need to put it in context. Bitcoin was just some random piece of software created by someone without support of any major or notable partners. I mean, if it was with me, I would see it as some joke at that time! So, I wouldn't bother much with responsability.",

Another thing I saw in the article is that they don't care about privacy; they use provided data of users from different sources that was posted years ago on other platforms to determine the users real names and ages. That's some worthless information for that article. All the information I found educative was how funds were raised and used for the betterment of the forum. I was actually not aware of how the forum funds were raised; I knew about forum donations but didn't know they were its major source.",

      "body": "According to the article:QuoteAt some point in 2011, the forum, complete with all the users and posts, was transferred over to a new dedicated domain, Bitcointalk.org. This new domain was registered on 24 June 2011. The domain is also owned by Cobra. “Theymos”, whose real name is Michael Marquart, quickly emerged as the lead administrator of the Bitcoin Forum. And this is the story of how Theymos become the admin of this community, also there is a fun-fact that he shared in this post:Quote from: theymos on February 28, 2015, 06:18:51 AMThe story of how I became head admin is actually pretty boring. Moderators were needed, so I was made a global moderator. Then admins were needed, so I was made an admin. Then over time the other admins slowly lost interest and resigned until I was the only one left. I guess most of the people who were around here to see this have more-or-less left the community now. That's a bit sad.It's not entirely clear, but for simplicity I usually say that I became head admin at the beginning of 2011, a little over a year after the forum was created.The forum was originally located at bitcoin.org/smf, then forum.bitcoin.org (hence the redirect), and finally bitcointalk.org. Fun fact: The name \"bitcointalk\" was invented by Jeff Garzik, and he's the one who bought the domain.It would be cool if the author has included this information,",

I don’t know maybe the forum members accounts where affected during the hack and if yes, I don’t know how they secured their accounts back, or is it that every member will have to create new account again? Also what was the primary aim of the people that hacked the forum, or do we think that the hack was backed by some government agency just to stop the spread of bitcoin. I will like to know if their is anything we should do that might help us recover our forum account back incase if their is any hack in future, but we all don’t hope for that.This is really a nice article, I don’t know authentic every thing in the article is but am sure lots of people will learn what they don’t know about forum before from the Article.",

Anyway, I agree that Theymos has captained this forum quite well. Considering that he started as a lead administrator at a relatively young age and must also be busy juggling other responsibilities outside this forum, he did quite well. He always seems brilliant and balanced and decisive, too.",
