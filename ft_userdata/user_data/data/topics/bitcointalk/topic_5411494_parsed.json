      "body": "I'm interested in your services. Do you have your own Korean Telegram community or do you shill for others? Are there any potential investors or are these just botted channels? If you can demonstrate that there are investors interested in investing in tokens, I can connect you with a few clients who need to promote their projects. I'd appreciate it if you could send me more information about how your shilling works.",
