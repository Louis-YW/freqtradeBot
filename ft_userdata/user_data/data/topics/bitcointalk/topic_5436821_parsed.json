As a member of this platform, you are advised to deal and trade with caution as no one would be held liable for your misfortune if any incidence or occurrence takes place. You having a deal with someone you do not have any contact with should have been a call for an escrow for transparency and credibility. I was wondering how you managed to have a deal with that person without remembering to call for the services of an escrow. Next time for your own safety, do well to seek for the services of an escrow so as not to have this experience again. So so sorry about your predicament. Keep contacting him, let's pray he pays you your money.",

Without the proof, it's unfair to tag him.To avoid these scams don't make deals with newbies, or always use escrow.

His old supplier of this item might not be available right now so he choose you since there’s a chance that he has a loyal customer that he is supplying. Being a reseller is not a sufficient evidence that the user is a scam. Your proof is so hard to verify because it contains incomplete info about your transaction.With this question of yours. It looks like you are using this as reason to decline your responsibility to deliver the goods to him.",

To clear your accusation you should post screenshots of all the messages here, it will show when he refused to pay you, it will be easier to understand what actually happened to you.

So the OP did not sent back the fund even did not sent you the account details what he was talking about. It’s clear that you always went upfront but the OP cheat you.This is actually a good lesson for you. You are looking for a low price and scammer is taking this room to cheat you.  Don’t  make deal without using escrow.I am going to tag OP until he come back with the proof of that you did not pay him.",

And I doubt you are gonna be calling the cops for help with this, considering the kind of business you two have been doing. And FYI, buying and selling personal KYC information and verified accounts online is illegal in most places around the world.",

A few moments later like the way most centralized exchanges do, the balance will be swept to an address that is none other than the Binance hot wallet address based on the label on bitinfocharts https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qm34lsc65zpw79lxes69zkqmk6ee3ewf0j77s3hThis means the address that accepts $10 bitcoins on the first txid is CashApp247's binance deposit address.",
