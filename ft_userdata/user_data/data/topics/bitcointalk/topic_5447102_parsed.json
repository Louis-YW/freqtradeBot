It's great that AI is detecting them and saving the forum.I think this is a plan from satoshi nakamoto. He told theymos to remove the spammer from the forum urgently. theymos can't check everyones profile so he took this approach. AI will help him detecting all the spammer.Well, this is injustice. I'm also a spammer. I don't know how will I save my account now. Shit. fuck theymos.",
