You mean working remotely from your country for another company in another country. You will have to possess serious and valuable skills to be considered for this kind of jobs. If there are many other people who can do what you do, that is the service you provide to the company, they will be more interested in employing someone from their own country even if they will work from home than someone who is another country and wants to work from home. To get these kinds of jobs, you have to develop your skills to an extent that you are sort after and put yourself out there for consideration.",

If so then you should have a lot a major in Computer Science or what the latest is, Blockchain Technology.And maybe if you can find jobs that is about crypto and apply, who knows, maybe the employer is going to hire you and obviously sponsor you to get a visa to work in their country.It's just weird though that you ask that because the current trend is that people love to work remotely or WFH status now.",

If you get a job in a company then it is possible to manage the visa?I don't think this necessarily applies to the bitcoin forum. More suitable for a forum about making money and the like. However, if you want to find a job in another country, I think nowadays there are many possibilities to contact a specific company, there are many - in the industry you are interested in and just ask if it is possible. They may be able to handle all the formalities, but it may depend on the particular company. Nowadays, remote work is also very popular, but often you have to be physically in a given country to work, i.e. you cannot work for a company branch in England, e.g. from China. Of course, as I mentioned earlier, everyone has their own work policy and it's best to check it by contacting specific companies.",

However, this is a bitcoin forum and your questions may be off topic...I lived the same story, a few years ago I participated in several campaigns as a translator and/or community manager, and although the clients were from different countries there was no problem since they paid in crypto, and crypto is not forbidden in my country. I even registered myself as a freelance , paid my taxes, and nobody asked for more details.Of course, if OP wants to physically move, then visa is mandatory in many countries. But as this is a forum about Bitcoin, who knows, maybe he didn't think about it and we gave him a good idea",

If you get a job in a company then it is possible to manage the visa?Given your mention of a Visa, I assume this job would involve in-person work. I believe such an arrangement is possible, and the company might even provide assistance. Additionally, I assume that your initial salary payment method would be in Bitcoin, correct? While there are online companies that offer the setup you're seeking, it's crucial to proceed cautiously. Always verify their legitimacy before getting involved. Unfortunately, there have been numerous cases of job seekers falling victim to fraud when pursuing jobs abroad, so it's important to stay vigilant.",
