Because those transactions not actually always mean anything to predict the market and price. If you focus on those big transactions and make predictions, you will make wrong decisions.Focus on fundamentals and invest long term, you don't need those whale alerts.",

How can I see the transactions?Blockchain is an open database, and since people are lazy to transfer a billion dollars on the basis that it is a thousand million, then with a simple filter you can determine the movement of the rich or the capital of the rich. It is true that it may be difficult to know the total amount in the wallet and the owner of the wallet, but you may have general information, especially if We were talking about billions of dollars, not a few million.for bitcoin Activate notifications associated with this account's tweets ---> https://twitter.com/whale_alert",

How can I see the transactions?Thank you.You can use any tool to track the whale transactions for example the following ones. Whale Alert it will provides you the details of big transactions which can be considered as the ones made by whales and when these whales make transactions it does not mean the market will make moves instantly or slowly even sometimes market don't react to these transactions so be careful while using whales transactions as an indicator to make trades. https://cryptocurrencyalerting.com/crypto-whale-tracker.html can also provides you the list of transactions considered as made by whales. You can use any tool mentioned by YOSHIE in his post. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452269.msg62224069#msg62224069 if you still wanted to know more then don't only read yoshies post instead read the whole thread and also search on google too for btc or any specific whales transaction tool or you can find all rounder whales transaction detection tool. These tools comes with telegram bots too where you will get the notification of whales transaction directly on your telegram feed or you can subscribe there twitter accounts to get information.",

How can I see the transactions?If you want to buy a coin solely because a whale moved some of that coin, then maybe you should rethink what you want to do. For starters you don't know if the whale is just moving their coin from one of their wallet to another or if they are actually selling it. That being said, alerts of whales moving their coins can create FUD, but only for a short time, thus if you buy a shitcoin because of such alert, there is a high chance you'll end up bagholding the coin.Buy a coin that has an actual utility, like Bitcoin. Don't buy a coin because a whale bought that coin or because of hype, because all of that can only last for a short time, but a coin with an actual utility is sustainable for the long term.",

How can I see the transactions?Thank you.The moment you get information about these types of transactions, it is usually already too late to get involved and use them for trade. Usually, you would have to know who moved such a large amount and why, to be able to use such information.It's not quite as simple as it looks.",

There are a million and one transactions that are initiated every second on the chain, which can be seen as transparency and is among the reasons why blockchain was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. However, you can still see whale transactions on the chain, but you should note that not all such transactions are coming from individuals, as some of them are from exchanges that are possibly an upgrade or change of wallet or vault.As you can see,  the above quoted text has a link to whale alert Twitter handle, which was posted as a reply by a member here for your perusal. You should be able to read through it for yourself to see some transactions already broadcast by the bot. Like and follow the Twitter page so as to get whale updates.",
