That's around $260 per Bitcoin on that time.Now, that 50,000 Bitcoins is now worth $5B ($100k/btc). Yeah, that's a lot now and if that deal went through there will be for sure some holdings left on that seller but it didn't happen and the seller didn't like the idea and the worth of its valuation at that time because the value and the listing price of the apartment should be around $13,950,000 - $14,000,000 compared to the offer of the buyer which was valued less than approx a $1M. Man, we gotta love all of these Bitcoin purchases in the past and the sellers didn't accept any of these offers. I'm sure that there are other documented purchases that ended up the same.Full story and video: Man turned down a 50,000 Bitcoin house offer in 2015 and it’s worth a shocking amount todayX video link on the image below.",

Although you cannot blame the seller of the apartment for rejecting the offer of 50,000  bitcoins for the purchase of the apartment because he never new that Bitcoin will appreciate to where it is today. Anyone may likely do the same because selling an apartment that may be likely under insurance for 50, 000 bitcoins when you cannot predict the future of Bitcoin or when there is no assurance covering that 50000 Bitcoin is a whole lot of risk.I'm sure there are many cases like this and if truly the seller of the apartment knew that Bitcoin will appreciate to where it is today I'm sure he would have everage that opportunity and by now he would have been swimming in ocean of wealth.",

I'd say we might have had a big ass whale with a lot more than just 50k bitcoins.Additionally we can not really blame the seller either because the offer was $1 million below the ask price. In other words if they really wanted to invest in bitcoin they could have sold their property for $14 million fiat and then bought 3846 more bitcoins with that fiat which is an additional $0.38 billion profit ($5.38 billion total).Also lets not forget that 2015 was mostly a bear market year and filled with lots of FUD. To the point when even by the end of the year one of bitcoin core developers, Mike Hearn spread a FUD calling bitcoin \"dead\"! I wouldn't really blame anybody who didn't want to touch bitcoin back then.P.S. It is interesting to look back at all the FUD some of us have endured all these years and still kept HODLing...",

Your grandparents stories about buying land for little bit of money or trading things for it are great examples of how value of regular money can go down over time. On the other hand Bitcoin value has gone up a lot as shown by Malmi story of selling 10,000 Bitcoins in 2011. Fact that those Bitcoins would be worth over billion dollars today is amazing. These stories show that Bitcoin has potential to be good way to store value and that its value can go up over time making it attractive alternative to traditional currencies.",

I'm sure many of us would have stories like this if you've been on the forum since the beginning.

The average rent in NYC at present is around $4,000 or something, and based on that, you pay approximately $48,000 a year, or round it up to $50,000. This means you can rent an apartment, maybe bigger than a 2-bedroom one, for 20 years and pay nothing more than $1m. For someone who isn't a celebrity or a billionaire, renting is probably a better option based on how much money you can save with it instead of buying a house unless you are getting one for much less than that or unless you are doing it as an investment and hope to sell it for a profit.Things could have been different if the seller had accepted the offer and had some of those Bitcoins left somewhere in a wallet that he could access today, but just like any of us, he didn't know Bitcoin would be worth $100k one day. I used to have Bitcoin in the initial days and I used to sell them for fiat because I needed money to spend on things, and even I could have a lot of money if I had saved all of that for today.",
