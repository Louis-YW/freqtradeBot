  "content": "Whats up family. So ive been planning and working on this for awhile. It always bothered me that all the physical bitcoin videos were lame, wrong, or just plain bad. So I did it myself. The goal is to bring physical to the world. Hopefully inform the newbies and prevent people from getting scammed. Â The format is each video will talk about a different physical bitcoin. I hope to have some of the coinmakers even come on to talk about their coin. Even some guest hosts from the forum phone in and help. Plenty of you know more than me. By no means are these videos perfect. I definitely would like feedback, and Im not scared of criticism. So please let me have it.Thanks Dane https://youtube.com/channel/UCG0jGst7o-xiXpn6qitEwGQCardsmiths Currency Series 2 Sneak Peekhttps://youtu.be/MHaVNvbnthYSatori Chip and Bitflyerhttps://youtu.be/-Cmsctrkoo4Private Key protection in physical bitcoin (with Krogoth)https://youtu.be/d9jSLaDwL5s?si=XNWg1WlDYSv9GerBLealana Grim Reaper coinhttps://youtu.be/ODgAlWnkHD8?si=5iD7Ko03zERS4rhvCardsmiths Series 2 updates and reviewhttps://youtu.be/cjP4hj_QLw4?si=eZL8LHOEUukQY51f200 million dollar buried bitcoin treasurehttps://youtu.be/re0lhfX9TNo?si=9lm0kRspLDojkTUSCardsmiths currency episode #1https://youtu.be/U9HT9UF3A34?si=G4nb-Dh1r77O9aKy",

Â Firstly sorry I have no more merit otherwise I would have given you 10!I just watched your first video, I find the format very pleasant, and the concept very well thought out. Beautiful ! I really like your videos!I find that your explanations are clear and simple (afterwards I am not the best to judge at this level because I do not think I have the best English here, far from it), and it's nice to hear from you too! Â In terms of the youtube game, the decor is rather effective for my taste (by the way, a big thank you for showing the book \"Bitcoin attack\"!), In the future, of course, you could use a camera, a microphone and lighting to level up the viewer experience! Even if it's going very well right now! these are just details!Indeed the idea of â€‹â€‹bringing coinmakers or even collectors in IRL or via various audio discussion platforms such as Discord so that they present their collectibles and talk about their background is a very good idea!In any case, congratulations for this start! it is with pleasure that I will share your videos so that new people discover your channel! can't wait to see more!",

I plan on making many more videos. If you're a coinmaker i will definitely reach out to you prior to your video to see if you want to be involved. For most of the members of this forum these videos are elementary, but for the rest of the world a resource that hopefully brings them into our world.Â Thanks to all, look for the Lealana video this weekDane",
