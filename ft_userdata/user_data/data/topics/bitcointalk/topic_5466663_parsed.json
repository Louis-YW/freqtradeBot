Amazingly, all thirteen players that entered scored, which is a record that stands today.New York Yankees 25 – Philadelphia Athletics 2 – May 24, 1936The 1936 Yankees boasted four hall of fame players, including Joe DiMaggio and Lou Gehrig. However, neither Gehrig nor DiMaggio accounted for the lopsided victory over the Athletics. Tony Lazzeri went 4-of-5 with three home runs and batted in 11 RBIs.Cleveland Indians 26 – St. Louis Browns 3 – August 12, 1948Believe it or not, even though Cleveland beat the Browns 26-3, hall of fame pitcher Bob Feller got the save. Feller pitched the final three innings.Chicago White Sox 29 – Kansas City Athletics 6 – April 23, 1955The score ended up White Sox 29 and Athletics 6. But the game was over well before the ninth inning. By the second, Chicago had built an 11-3 lead.Los Angeles Angels 24 – Colorado Rockies 1 – June 25, 2023Angels versus Rockies, which happened days ago, makes the list. The Halos called off the scoring machine after the 23-0 lead. If LAA had pushed, who knows?Maybe the Angels would have made it to the top of the MLB blowout mountain. In any case, the Rockies may want to start developing starters and relievers after this debacle of a loss.Keep reading→ https://n2g.io/dbab5d0",
