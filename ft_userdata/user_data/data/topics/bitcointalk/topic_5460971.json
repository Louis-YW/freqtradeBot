I have never gambled there but I know the brand because of avatars from signature campaigns, I guess, and it seems that the reason for such a low rate in TP is that it has several scam accusations, but only there.Do you guys know what happened there? is it some kind of maneuver orchestrated by the competition, a very annoying user who was very upset about something, or is something really wrong with the casino? And OP, why is it among your top picks? I would investigate more about it myself, but taking into account that it is in red in the opening post I think that it would be interesting to clear it up in this thread.",

And OP, why is it among your top picks? I would investigate more about it myself, but taking into account that it is in red in the opening post I think that it would be interesting to clear it up in this thread.I won't argue with you on the fact that sportbet have such a low rating on trust pilot because most of the site that have such low rating on trust pilot have a great rating on other review sites,  and even on this forum,  and some other platforms that have tons of positive reviews on trust pilot how low review on other sites and forum where trust are measured by individuals in form of review from real users,  e.g such examples are casinos like 1xbit who's trust here in the forum is bad due to several resolved accusations against the casino and how there have paid little or no attention to those accusations thereby leaving players with no other choice than to leave a negative trust review for the casino. More also,  most of the rating sites have hard records of irresponsible and inaccurate rating because most of their rating scores are bought since platforms or scan casinos can easily pay their way to receive positive rating scores, I don't know how Trustpilot rates or grade their review but being the most popular dating site on the Internet,  there should be at least accuracy with public opinion and the rating should be decentralized enough to allow users reviews to count at all time. Back to the ops point of view,  seeing stake on the top list is also something that is undoubtedly true and should be a source of motivation for many of us that promote the platform here in the forum,  and from my personal experience on stake,  I can say that the casino is top notch and deserves to be at the top of the list.",

What you have created on your thread is good but if anyone wants to check ranking and recommendations about a gambling platform then it is better to check BTCGOSU. They have a comprehensive list and a lot of offers. If you can get some personalised offers and a comprehensive list then this thread would be one of the best source to find good online casino.",

Trust pilot review is biased which means a group of people that has an issue to the casino can easily nuked their review with negative like what happened to sportsbet trust score.Review site like BTCGOSU is a good site to use for reference since they are not bias with their reviews.What's your exact criteria on your best casino since topic is very subjective and will varies based on everyone perspective on what's the best for him.",

As for what made me stick to them, it’s just because of the interface since I’m sure of the game I’m logging into my account to place its very easy for me to access them and not stress myself aside from that nothing else, for now except when I finally resume using them for sports.Sorry, Op I just check the the link in the post just above mine and I found out that there is an already exist thread concerning casinos and also have their ratings attached to them, you could also consider checking out that thread and if perhaps you were able to find out what it is that you were look for then you can proceed to lock this thread of yours.

And what baffles me is the statement written in the image as shown below circled with red marker as it read \"We've removed a number of fake reviews for this company\", and I'm still wondering what might have been the fake reviews which trustpilot removed about 1xbit if not the series of scam allegations placed against that website as a potential scam, and yet they have done nothing or intend doing nothing about it.  Which now clearly shows that for a site to be declare either trusted or fake, one dont have to depend on a review gotten from a single website.",

But for me I don't really care about those rating sites since what matters the most is the community feedback especially when it comes to this forum since we can see a legitimate one came from reputable people here. I wonder why they rate sportsbet a 1.9 rate while sportsbet is performing good, maybe they didn't even do more deeper research and they just give a feedbacks without verifying their community and how they provide a service to their gamblers.",

If you are losing then it might not be your day; some are even having bad week or even a month. Try other gambling games or if you are into sportsbetting, try making a better analysis of the game. Or try going with the odds; there are many ways to come up with a win but ofcourse losing will always be a part of the game.I do agree with the list, these are indeed the best ones right now, in this industry. There are other platforms as well which are not mentioned but if things would be continuously good on those sites, eventually they'd be as well with players' list of platforms to engage with. Every platform can offer huge amount of rewards and bonuses but not all sites could give a quality service to their players.",

Honestly I see it as something unlikely to happen, in any case check it out on your stake.com account",
