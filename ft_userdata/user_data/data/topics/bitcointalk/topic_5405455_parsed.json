Did you know why your account has been locked?If yes, then just follow their instructions.I'm not familiar with this exchange, this is also my first time hearing about them. It is currently on rank 153.So at first, why did you choose them? Why not use instead the top exchanges?",

I think bibox exchange scamming me and steal my funds. What I do now?It's the first time I've heard of this platform, I believe you and I hope you can access your account but you don't provide enough information to help you: - Have you contacted the support team? - What was their response? - Have you searched for similar stories? - Have you read the terms of use and made sure that you did not violate them? - your country allowed?They generally have a bad reputation on fxempire[1], so avoid using them.[1] https://www.fxempire.com/crypto/exchange/bibox/review",

I think bibox exchange scamming me and steal my funds. What I do now?I don't think you have the right website from bibox exchange. is there any way you can share some screenshot for us so we could look into the website if actually correct or not. Secondly before creating any exchange account try to open it from CMC if they are being listed over there then it would be more better for you to get in contact with the right site instead of getting yourself involved with the wrong site.I will advise you to contact them through their live chat or join their telegram group for complaint.Be very sure it is the right website before your accusation.",
