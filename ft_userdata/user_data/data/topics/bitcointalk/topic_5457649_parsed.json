Appreciate the help.EDIT:This solved my probler for future refence to anyone who will encounter same issue.Quote from: Lucius on June 26, 2023, 02:59:39 PMI dug a little and it seems that there are many people with a similar problem - a possible solution -> Quote from: https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/sign-captcha-challenges-iphone-iph4f43a30c9/iosSome website and app sign-in screens require you to pass CAPTCHA challenges, such as recognizing letters in unusual shapes. iCloud allows you to bypass many challenges by automatically and privately verifying your iPhone and account.

If you use home Wi-Fi try to restart the modem and get a new IP address, and if you use mobile internet simply disconnect from mobile data and try again.There is also an alternative in the form of a special link that you can get on the login page, and with it you can avoid reCaptcha completely every time you log in.",

Okay! I understand that you are facing no issues with the Chrome browser. Why you did not post any images that show you are facing a problem with the Safari browser? Your topic is about the issue with the Safari browser, why are you, not post the screenshot? Please post the error message. In most cases, it is all about not updating the Safari browser. Please do post the screenshot of your Safari browser version.",

      "body": "@Wapfika, internet speed is definitely not a problem, but the thing is in the browser and maybe some other things that are related to the same. As for the link you can log in without a captcha, simply do not share it, and if that happens, no one will not be able to log in to your account because it will still need your name and password. The only problem is that such a link can allow someone to brute-force your password, since there is no captcha that would slow down the process.I dug a little and it seems that there are many people with a similar problem - a possible solution -> Quote from: https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/sign-captcha-challenges-iphone-iph4f43a30c9/iosSome website and app sign-in screens require you to pass CAPTCHA challenges, such as recognizing letters in unusual shapes. iCloud allows you to bypass many challenges by automatically and privately verifying your iPhone and account.

Can you tell us what exactly IOS gadget you use when trying to load the captcha?Also, tell us what version of Safari browse.?And maybe you are trying to access the forum with an outdated IOS device or Safari. I search a bit and it looks like the Safari browser has some bugs related to the captcha like slow loading or captcha that doesn't load properly. So I think this is not a forum issue it's your device issue that might need to be fully reset or it needs to be upgraded to the latest version.",

Please post the error message. In most cases, it is all about not updating the Safari browser. Please do post the screenshot of your Safari browser version. Because I think written words already explain it all. It's just simply captcha error. But as you requested, Check the image below. It goes like that and sometimes image is slow to reload when it available after couple of refresh.

This problem persist after I save my account password on my browser when it ask me. Thanks Lucius! I will give this a shot tomorrow.
