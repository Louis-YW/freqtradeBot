  "content": "The crypto and Defi sphere is growing rapidly, with new projects and solutions coming up every other month. It's becoming very hard every other day for crypto projects to successfully tread in the crypto space due to the high competition in crypto.

Launchpads are crypto projects designed to help these upcoming projects reach their full potential and mainstream adoption. Generally, there are many ways to safely raise funds, including ICO, STO, IEO, DYDO, SHO, etc. Launchpads help new projects attract the community, thus making it easier for them to tread in crypto. The platforms are like advertising pools which also help garner crowdfunds. Projects listed in launchpads are vetted for the utter protection of the investors' wealth.
