      "body": "This rude guy named \"CanaanScammers\" is a real scammer and his name on Telegram is JAVA SSM (maybe he has changed already)He verbally abused us all the time, he planned to PUA and drive us crazy, then we may send BTC to his \"new\" wallet address.Luckily we have a safe payment and refund process, our finance colleagues are very professional so we need to submit for approval with receipts. What's more, we have technician colleagues who are very professional too, they helped us verify both Email addresses, and this scammer is using a fake email system, that's why he could send us Emails with our real customer's Email address.BTW, here comes proof from our customer (Agreed by our customer)https://imgur.com/a/AgbeaTh  (100% original, just hide privacy parts)Again, never trust this real scammer.Any more questions about Avalon miners or orders, please contact customerservice@canaan.ioIf you have placed an order from our official shop, you can leave a message under the order, which is 100% safe.

We got all the chat history from our real customers till now. This is a very well known strategy to imposters. These days we don't see it on the forum that much (on the scam accusations) but in the past I think we have seen several similar cases. With Yobit if I remember correctly it happened many times. Their customer service were not active much and scammers used to create Twitter accounts including in other social media accounts pretending they are Yobit. The victims were giving them their account details resulting losing their coins. You may need to post the chat history of whatever accusation you are raising here so that others understand what's going wrong. It's difficult to justify the case.",

If you refund to that input address then that exchange or service will receive the coin, not the client.

Make it noticeable for all the clients and have clear FAQ for it. Bitcoin gives you full control of your money, but that's optional and shouldn't be forced on those who don' want it. Using non-custodial wallets is the way to go, but we all know that many people still rely on exchanges and custodial services to store their coins and keys. Asking a business to force people to use Bitcoin the right way won't get you the results you want. They will just take their business elsewhere where there are no such demands.

If the real owner was hacked and had his identity stolen, it can become troublesome. But for that, they can only blame themselves and not the company.",

Have the strict rules of sending from a noncustodial wallet but obviously you will have cases where people do not read the terms (most of the time no one read the terms LOL), in exceptional cases you can ask for screenshot of their transaction page, tell them to send a small amount from the same account and ask them to send the history page screenshot again. Even if you need, do a KYC which will include seeing them on Skype with their documents.All these will reduce the chances for you to avoid the scammers who will come with a false claim.No doubt, you have done well in the last case.",
