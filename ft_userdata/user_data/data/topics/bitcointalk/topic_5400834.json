  "content": "After reading some helpful and wonderful post about the need to introduce young children to Bitcoin early, I started teaching my 11, 9 and 7 years old children Bitcoin education. I was teaching them about the operations of Bitcoin but I observed that they were always fascinated when I discuss wallets. Immediately they saw the worth of the Bitcoin I own in Dollars they crammed the value. Once they observed that Bitcoin has appreciated and the Dollar worth have increased, they would celebrate and hug themselves because daddy have made more money. After few days, my children told me how they had informed their friends that I own Bitcoin and have “plenty dollars”. And my children advised these friends to tell their parents so that they can earn dollars. Immediately I became concerned and scared. In my country the US dollar is highly valued and anyone that owns One Bitcoin is a Millionaire. Who are the parents or relative of these my children’s friends? Some might be criminals. I was scared because I can become a target of fraudsters, Kidnappers and armed robbery because of my children’s actions. Immediately I stopped the Bitcoin class and started teaching them cyber safety and general financial safety education.Fraudsters are motivated by money and look for easiest possible ways to get vital information and children are very easy target for identity theft and other cyber and non-cyber crime. Younger children don’t fully understand security and are naïve to the need for security because they don’t necessarily comprehend the extent of online and offline risks.  They might freely give out credentials like keys, usernames and passwords. Last year more than  1.25 million children in the US fell victim to cyber crime costing the families an average of more than $1.100 per attack.Hence before we teach Bitcoin education, our children must be grounded in security education. As parent we should never share our keys, passwords or username with our children. I know children have a way of discovering this sensitive information such as passwords, but we must keep them secret or constantly change them. We must teach our children never to inform anyone about our financial investments or transactions. They must not make online purchases without our permission or guidance. Our children must know the dangers of clicking random links, sending or receiving suspicious emails, sharing personal information with friends and receiving credit cards. Teach them how to use nicknames, keep their online pictures generic, never share personal images and should always use family device or computer fully regulated by parents.",

Not only is it a security risk as you learned from your example, but it is illogical for children to be introduced to something so early when by all measures they are far from legally owning or trading such assets.Despite the fact that some people persistently push the idea that children should be educated about how the online world works in the very early stages, and I am thinking primarily of computer and smartphone manufacturers who just want to sell as many devices as possible - children should be kept away from such things at least until they are 12 or more years old. If someone thinks it's normal for a 7-year-old to spend hours playing on the computer or watching TV and then be surprised that his child turns into a little zombie, don't be surprised when things go downhill.https://www.wgu.edu/blog/impact-technology-kids-today-tomorrow1910.html",

It's weird because I definitely agree, but right now the worlds children are basically being programmed on how to be a good worker, and understand the very basics of money. This is from a young age too. So, I definitely agree that Bitcoin shouldn't be pushed onto kids too early, same as Cyber Security. At the end of the day, they're kids, and should be doing kids things like playing around in the park, and playing sport. All that kinds of things. Learning social skills being probably one of the most important. Too many people these days are struggling with the social aspects of life. Bitcoin could be introduced as a optional class in their teens, just like teens are given the choice on what subjects they want to study, Bitcoin could be one of them or cryptocurrencies as a more broader approach. Same as Cyber Security. If I was offered a chance to study Cyber Security instead of geography, you can bet I wouldn't even know where Scotland was, because that would be right up my alley.",

Kids really love to show off, more than adults, because they don't see the downsides of it, like in your scenario of rumors of your wealth spreading beyond your control and reaching criminals. So teaching very young children about Bitcoin is not a good idea if you plan to keep the fact that you own Bitcoin a secret from everyone. A few years ago I blundered and told my parents about Bitcoin. You can trust your parents, they are responsible adults, right? Wrong, they told my grandma, and grandma told everyone. Now a lot of people ask me how my Bitcoin is doing, how many I own and basically think that I'm rich and they are entitled to get money from me. And this is adults, not kids.",

Their high level of direct exposure to the digital world teaches them that. They have computer subjects at school. They use advanced technologies every hour of the day. Their Roblox experience, for example, could teach them hacking and theft 101. Moreover, their vast Facebook experience could make them very much aware of dummy accounts and posers and scams and phishing and whatnot. Sometimes, there is this misconception, which is probably brought by generation gap, which makes older people assume that young children need to be thoroughly lectured on the security implications of the digital age when in fact these youngsters are more advanced than them and that safe exploration on social media and the internet is already second nature to them.",

I'm not exactly against the evolution we've taken. Someone might be less intelligent because of it, but they have anything, and everything at their fingertips, so are only seconds away from gaining the necessary information to carry out whatever they need to do. They should probably teach how to search properly though. However, that obviously changes when you come to more complex jobs or tasks. You wouldn't want a surgeon to not have any idea, and just uses Google. I mean, they do read a ton of books obvbiously as a reference point since storing all that information is futile, but you'd want them to have some sort of baseline ability.Cybersecurity is becoming more relevant as a skill to learn though. You can't just learn security over night, there's too much complexity to it.",

Of course, they should be neat and thrifty, but regularly checking the plus or minus in the parent's wallet, in my opinion, is nonsense.Moreover, there is a good expression: \"My tongue, my enemy!\"You yourself force children to brag to their peers, but you don’t think that your own children can later fall under the wrath of children who do not have such a successful dad and suffer from your \"good\" teachings.All in due time, don't let the kids grow up sooner than they should be.

I want to believe that you are not mounting any pressure on your kids to learn Bitcoin. Kids should be allowed to enjoy their childhood. Childhood is very precious. It is a time when the brain is evolving. They should be allowed to grow and develop at their own pace. I think your goal as a parent is to create a condusive environment to help your kids find out what they like, what they are good at. Enroll them in different classes where they learn piano, swimming class, dance class, crypto class. Create the opportunity for them to try and experiment with different things. As a parent don't force your ideas on them or mount any pressure on them to  learn crypto, programming etc. Let them grow and get drawn naturally to whatever  interests",

That ricocheted back at you pretty quick, sometimes this is actually almost inevitable, whether you told your children about Bitcoin or not, whenever you are living a good life and taking very good care of your family, the little kids tend to talk to their friends about it in school, about how their dad did X and Y for them, so if you did mention Bitcoin to them, chances are very high they would spill the bean. Well the case of Bitcoin is only somewhat different because of the misconception people have when they see a Bitcoin speculator, hodler or user, the immediate thought is that the person is rich and who knows what that could lead to.Having said that, i have the advantage of learning from all you guys about the best action to take on this matter as i am yet to have kids, i will very soon anyway. But for now i think the con of introducing kids to Bitcoin pretty early outweighs the pro, so i might just teach them about other things and leave Bitcoin for last.",

Providing education about privacy and security in real life, needs to be prioritized, because this involves close people. then we can teach about cyber security later. Personally, I will choose to teach about privacy and security in the real world first, because telling someone close will be more dangerous for our lives, the reason is, we cannot understand whether it is that people who know can keep this secret or not. whereas in the cyber world, sometimes this can be prevented with the help by Anti Virus for program, and stay away with share our asset value in social media.",
