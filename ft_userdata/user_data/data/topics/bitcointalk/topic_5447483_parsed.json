  "content": "Hi we are thinking on starting a fundraise to increase our current bankroll we have $500k but we know our site is going to get huge fast because we are going to be 100% KYC free and available worldwide.At this moment we have a list of high rollers $1.5M+ and a list of 10K users who are waiting for the site to get out.The site is 100% ready (we are just finishing some details with the marketing material) and we have about 500 players without a single ad our official announcement.Last month the site made $28k profit in just pure random players who got to the site and we have regulars customers who spend on average $1k per week. We want to raise at least $400k, you can go to the site now and create an account and test everything to see the site is 100% operationalLet me know what you think about this idea we have.",

You are not an established casino and you don't have a reputation here so I wouldn't risk the development of your reputation by asking to raise such a large amount. If you are still adamant that you want to find a partner/partners, go to the Long-term offers sub-board of the lending board and create a thread with proof of your statements regarding profit and existing bankroll by signing a message from the cold storage wallet of the casino to prove that these assets are in hand. Maybe you will have a better chance of negotiating a deal with someone if they were to be interested. I would also recommend offering multi-signature control over what people contribute to the casino to ensure that their funds are safe by having joint control. I believe that your odds might be even higher if you employ this strategy.",

Even though it seems slow, there is good progress, so if you are still focused, the benefits can also increase.You have started to have regular customers who can come to your casino to play. And maybe you need to make other promotions to attract more people.I do not recommend borrowing funds from other people, even if it is a long-term loan because it is risky. I'd rather continue what's working well and keep looking for ways to grow the casino.",

IMO those high rollers actually may not really wait for your website since there are a lot more reputable casinos around crypto than yours. The suggestion is to build a reputation to rival the top ones in crypto. If you have not yet hired a campaign manager, you should find one.

If I was a potential investor, I would definitely need more details about this, how would it work, why would investors trust you, how much the initial investment, how much is the maximum, and a lot more questions.Your platform is relatively new doesn't have a reputation yet within the community, so proving that it is a safe and fraud-free investment opportunity will be the biggest challenge that you are going to face IMO.",

From how I see it, if the bankroll would be shared then that means your profits would be reduced and it could delay the casino's development since you'll be stuck with a specific profit share. I just think it's more beneficial for the casinos to keep the profits because it'll open more options on what the casino needs to spend on in the future. And if what you said about your casino's monthly profit is true then it'll only take some time until the bankroll grows big enough to the point that the casino wouldn't need the help of investors.",
