  "content": "It appears that after having Larry Fink as the new mayor of bitcoin we might have a president of America that will be supporting bitcoin if Trump gets the victory on November hehehe. This is certainly shocking and very unexpected. I did not know bitcoin and the cryptospace would bring him much votes because why is he doing this if this is not a trick for bitcoiners to vote him?Former United States President Donald Trump and the leading Republican candidate for November’s election appears to be warming toward Bitcoin  BTC +1.25% , having been critical of cryptocurrencies in the past.In January, Trump said he'll “never allow” central bank digital currency issuance in the U.S. if elected. “Such a currency would give the federal government, our federal government, absolute control over your money… They could take your money and you wouldn’t even know it was gone,” he warned at the time.In a recent town hall on Fox News, alongside South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, Trump was asked if the next logical step was for him to embrace Bitcoin, given that it’s decentralized, the government can't get its hands on it and all the young people who are particularly interested in it, host Laura Ingraham suggested.“I always liked one currency. I call it a currency. I like the dollar, but a lot of people are doing it [Bitcoin] and frankly, it's taken on a life of its own,” Trump replied. “You probably have to do some regulation, as you know, but many people are embracing it. And more and more, I'm seeing people wanting to pay Bitcoin, and you're seeing something that's interesting, so I can live with it one way or the other.”Read in full https://www.theblock.co/post/278786/donald-trump-bitcoin-embracing",

Remember that those in power will do what they feel is in the best interest of the country first, and if things do not get a positive economic balance then it will be a good idea to turn your back on things. It's not surprising that he declared itBut it's really nice that he is expressing a positive opinion on bitcoin, I remember he also expressed before that bitcoin is really harmful to the US economy  when he was still in office President, maybe that information is wrong but I don't pay too much attention. Because really, with bitcoin, it exists without too much influence on someone's judgment, support/opposition, bitcoin will still exist and develop.",

Trump has to admit that Bitcoin is as useful as fiat currencies, in fact it's more useful than fiat. He knows that in order to get more attention from the crowd he should change his stance regarding Bitcoin.A politician knows well that how and when to say something, so I guess Trump can change his mindset as well his words regarding Bitcoin in future. Although, Trump as we all know is kind of advocate of USD but he'll have to embrace Bitcoin in the end. His accepting of Bitcoin and openly saying some good things about it would help him to secure more votes from all supporters of Bitcoin.",

He was anti-Bitcoin because he's old and because he was playing on \"America First\" idea, believing that it presupposes the Dollar First as well. But then, for the upcoming elections, one of his major contestants for the Republican nomination was DeSantis who made Bitcoin a major part of his campaign, linking it to the idea of freedom as minimal state intervention into processes, which is appealing to many Republicans. Now that DeSantis is out of the race, Trump needs to gather his former supporters around him, and making a milder statement about Bitcoin is a way to do it.",

I remember that he was very negative when it came to Bitcoin, and that towards the end of his term he tried to push through some crazy measures that were then suspended by the Biden administration.I honestly consider him a man with dangerous intentions in every respect, and I think that if he becomes president again, it will be bad for most people in the world. The man who called Bitcoin a scam a few years ago still thinks the same, and everything he is talking about now is cheap pre-election propaganda.Quote from: https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/trump-bitcoin-commentary-seems-like-scam-against-the-us-dollar-2021-6-1030500598?op=1The former US president told Fox Business' Stuart Varney: \"Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam. I was surprised — you know, with us, it was at $6,000 and, much lower. I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar, essentially it's a currency competing against the dollar.\" Trump also said that the currency of the world should be the US dollar and called for regulations on bitcoin. \"I don't think we should have all of the bitcoins in the world out there. I think they should regulate them very very high, but the currency should be the dollar,\" he said.",

Of course, this statement of Trump will have a huge impact on the crypto community in the US and they won't gonna just let this one go since it gives them hope for the better changes of the crypto holders out there. They may be hoping for insight into some regulations that make it easier for miners to operate in that country.",

He will never say for example: \"Alright, we are going to leave USD and use BTC as our national currency starting from tomorrow.\" That's not going to happen. It doesn't matter who the president is, Trump or Biden or anybody else. As long as they are not banning crypto, they are supporting it.

Even though Trump shows partiality or is open this does not mean that Bitcoin will easily be opened in the US if elected. The policy requires the approval of many parties and the process is very gradual to legalize additional currency where this additional currency cannot be controlled automatically which is very difficult. Because the state needs full control in order to have stability in state treasury revenues. All politicians make Bitcoiner voices their main attraction and embracing all groups needs to be done during the campaign.However based on my observations Trump could be better than Biden leadership, for some reason Trump figure has charisma and authority in the eyes of other countries.",

Don't easily believe the promises of politicians, it's just an art or trick they create to get sympathy from the public and it's difficult for anyone in the future who wins and becomes president of their union to make bitcoin as legal currency transaction in the future.
