Especially now that I see my money has randomly been moved.After reading the thread that you made and the discussion that went on there, it's really complicated. I think you should be monitoring the progress of FTX and how they are reimbursing everyone that has been affected by their downfall. It's about time that they do it. You should immediately be in contact on whoever to make sure that you can identify that the amount that you have there in the FTX wallet is yours with all the TXID etc.",

I'm also assuming they're willing to send your money back once they have it?Can't say anything about getting a full refund from FTX but the liquidation of assets have been handed to authorities/law firm so victims are likely to get some money back, just not sure on the exact percentage of course.",

Until now, the problem issue left by Ftx has not been resolved until the sentence SBF by next year is reached.It was the company itself that said that it would be difficult to receive, right? If that's really the case, just accept the truth in that matter, I guess. Sorry, I don't think anyone else can help you with that.",

Gox claims even up to this moment hasnt been given yet, how much more into this FTX incident? If there were movements then it doesnt basically means that those coins are already intended to be used up for repaying its users or to those who had been affected. There's always a process which needed to be followed and i dont really believe that it would really be that too short yet it would really be might taking up for some time but well we dont know if the process now is already that fast on which it would really be that a good news into those peoplewho had been that affected with this FTX incident.This is really that indeed the beauty when it comes to blockchain technology on which if there would really be some sudden move of funds then the publicwould really be definitely be able to notice it on which it would really be bring up tons of questions and assumptions about some development of such case or whateverarrangement that they are really that dealing about.",

Which is weird but still.I didn’t mean to create two threads about my situation. I posted this new thread as it was unrelated to Rollbit or scam reports. It just felt like now that the report was over with it didn’t really matter too much anymore. and at the time I was really wondering what happened. I felt like it could’ve been a good discussion in general since it was just weird seeing that happen. I did some of my own research when I calmed down and I heard hackers or feds have done this beforeAs for your other question, Yes i’ve contacted the company and i’ve emailed 3 emails relating to FTX and claims, hoping I can get a response. I’m not in contact with anyone big from FTX who could help sadly.",

You really should contact yourself the people dealing with claims and make sure the casino is also named as a claimant, and that you and all affected users are therefore part of that claim. I read your other post so no need to remind you how to transact in future, but a lesson to all with crypto. Never deposit from external wallet. Always with proof you can sign (so send everything to your wallet, then deposit from there).FTX affected so many people I feel lucky I wasn't affected. This is MtGox of the new era.",

The court is still in court and they are waiting for the next hearing on March which is going to determine the faith of the ex Ceo Bankman Fried Sam( Bank fried Sam ), it emus going to be a foolish thing for FTX to do that, it will only complecate SBF chance of staying maximum of 100 years as we saw on the media.It could also be a ploy by anti crypto group to create panic in the market. If you notice the day that news was spread, bitcoin market crash and it's was struggling until it broke out today but it's still below the previous all time high of local resistance. They hate to see bitcoin and it could also be that it was from some group of people to also create a panic sell off to manipulate liquidation of futures.My last but not the least assumptions is that the person behind that wallet address is only trying to move funds from wallet address to another address especially if there is doubt of the private key not secure. But I'm really terrified on how this guy's steal coins that is difficult to sell.",
