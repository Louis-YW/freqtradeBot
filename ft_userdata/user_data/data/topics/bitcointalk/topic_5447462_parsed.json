      "body": "Delta Investment Tracker. Hands down. I've used many crypto portfolio apps and this was the first one that had everything i had. I should get paid as i am constantly promoting them to my friends and everyone but the gui is sleek, it has real time crypto / exchanges wallet tracking to stocks and it even upgraded to NFTs which suits me just fine now that i am flipping those. I don't even know what other free app would have more features. But i would definitely like to know.Only negative side of it is constant watching of the portfolio. That can be unhealthy as you wouldn't need to react to price movements so fast when you are hodling. But when you are looking a way to report your taxes, having every wallet automatic transaction history in one place is pretty handy.",

I've also heard there is a new platform launching soon called unlockstats. What would people recommend?you were making your own ways to control your portolfios become so difficult by using excel for years. CMC is so good man. I have been using it for years and it will give you actual update to the price of token and how many portfolios available in your wallet. There are so many good tracker like blockfolio too but i still recommend CMC as the best choice. CMC is even far better compared with coinstats. It has actual update. https://coinmarketcap.com/portfolio-tracker/I just tell your the app that i used and i have been saying based on my review. The only a complicated thing sometime to adjust your portfolios but that's an easy task to be solved. The best app that can be tried to monitor your money anytime.",

      "body": "It's always great to use tracker app since they're really made for it, but honestly even excel have the capability of connecting to some of the API which means you could easily make the same feature that's available in most of the tracker apps you just need some advanced knowledge though and it definitely might take some of your time setting things up and it's quite complicated honestly, but I'd say coinmarketcap is sufficient enough, since considering they've got best information, but there are some other apps that might be capable of connecting directly to your exchange accounts so that you could observe it real time and there's no need to update the data manually. usually the biggest problem is that, it just feels so inconvenient updating all the data manually and usually we just get tired from it and eventually just dont care.",

What would people recommend?There are a lot of tools to track one's portfolio but ever since I created my first portfolio I only use Coingecko's portfolio tracker its everything you're looking for in a tracker and it's free, I have set it in my local currency and they have a new feature called inactive coins or token where you can see what coins in your portfolio that's become inactive and alert you so you can make a decision if you want to dump it or continue holding it.I'm contented and comfortable using Coingecko's features they also have rewards features where you can claim points that you can exchange for freebies like E-books, NFT, or subscriptions.",

What would people recommend?You can track the market using your own wallet, just like in ledger they also have a tracker there if you have you coins in a hard wallet. Coinmarketcap is already a good choice for you and seriously, using excel can still be a good one for monitoring your crypto activities especially with your trades, I still have this and I still prefer this because it encourages me more to do better with my trades.",

What would people recommend?To keep track of what is going on in the crypto arena and being constantly updated in prices I use coinmarketcap which is good to do this.However we are also in need of such an app that can offer us the same thing as coinmarketcap but which can do that for mining coins,which coins come,which coins is being mined and being loved,which coins are not being mined anymore as are not profitable and so on.I don't think we have such an app as I see in the mining section that different people put up a new thread for a new coin that can be mined.I don't think excel sheet are a good option when for example coinmarketcap gives you up to 1 year of data and all time low and all time high of a coin which is what needed before we make any decision,investment decision.",

What would people recommend?Coinmarketcap is good, accurate, and automatic and so is Coingecko both have a portfolio page where you can just add the name of the coin and the amount and it will automatically add the price so whenever the prices go up or down of the coins you add on your portfolio you will see the changes.I'm using Coingecko and Coinmarketcap, no need to make the changes the portfolio tracker will do it for you automatically, so you can see the prices in real-time.",

It seems to be more focused on providing a seamless experience for managing and tracking your cryptocurrency investments.But, for CoinMarketCap as a supplementary resource for market data and insights, as it is widely recognized for its accuracy and reliability in this aspect. If portfolio tracking and management are your top priorities, CoinStats is likely the better option. If you prioritize market data and insights, then CoinMarketCap may be more suitable.",
