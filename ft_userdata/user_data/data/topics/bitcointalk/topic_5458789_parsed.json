You can see in El Salvador, their government made Bitcoin legal tender in their nation but after early hype, it has been cooling down and their citizens especially business operators no longer feel interest in accepting bitcoin for their business purchases.Legal tender can help but it can not change a whole game if other infrastructures for Bitcoin adoption won't be improved and expanded.",

      "body": "As of now, Bitcoin remains to be an asset that many are holding for speculative purposes...and is finding a hard time competing with the usual fiat money especially in everyday transactions. Now, facing that reality, I think the goal for now is not to really make Bitcoin as the common money but as a solid and exciting alternative...until there can be a massive mainstream adoption. Just like the real/physical gold, I still have to see many people bringing gold to buy anything in the grocery...though BTC is a lot better still people prefer to deal with the more convenient paper money. Making BTC getting accepted globally is a big challenge and we are not yet there.",

Bitcoin will reach $100K with a very high probability within 2 years at most, and for that the legal status of bitcoin does not need to change. It is already widely accepted in most countries but as an asset, not as a currency. As it is so short what you say, I do not know if you mean that the rest accept it as a currency, such as El Salvador. But the fact is that it will reach that figure even if there are no changes in legislation.",

Yes. thus processing daily transactions is high, which in turn makes BTC as another option in terms of trading transactions in various fields. When it has been adopted massively. At the moment it still is, as @DapanasFruit said, But, I have a firm view, with time BTC will become less special and will be very familiar to the general public.​",

Honestly this is a tough one, legally  accepted everywhere means countries giving up on their local currency and this is also an impossible development as most countries wouldn't give up on this kind of control which also means losing out on revenue because of this...I know we want bitcoin to succed but this here is a big ask and won't happen like this.",

As long as demand increases for a limited supply product, we can expect the price to continue increasing.",

      "body": "Countries that are affected by the economy on a large scale will immediately find solutions to get out of the problem, when the situation gets worse it is likely that Bitcoin will play a key role in the global economy. At times of economic pressure, people will switch to Bitcoin which encourages Bitcoin trading volume to increase, the presence of Bitcoin will provide benefits when the economy is collapsing. Bitcoin trading volume has shown that in times of economic stress people are turning more and more to crypto assets, here it would be seen that the masses are starting to benefit from Bitcoin.To prevent a more severe economic crisis seems to be the most likely reaction to lead to Bitcoin being adopted as the world's single currency, if that condition occurs the world will have one global currency, namely Bitcoin. Bitcoin could become a global financial solution if the economic crisis gets harder to control or Bitcoin will evolve into a new world currency. This is just speculation, actually what will happen in the future no one knows.So far what percentage do you trust the fiat currency issued by your country? If the answer is not quite trust, it's worth looking at Bitcoin as a viable solution. Ultimately only the system that is supported by the majority will win. IMO.",

I was then a little over 20 years old. Naturally, if most countries accept this crypto as an alternative to fiat, then there is no doubt that the price will fly high.         Some countries have taken this experimental path, but the process of integration is somehow weak. Until now, there is a skeptical attitude towards such projects. It is very difficult to move from one system to another.",

The market is speculative, which means any sort of news relative to bitcoin getting circulated around will have its impact on the price. This could turn down in the short or it keeps moving bullish.Does its previous ath came as a result of large scale adoption. In my view ot isn't, what we experienced is the real growth that happened depending on the supply to the demand connected with good news that were getting reality around the market. Earlier when the price reached $20k to make its first ath, the move was unexpected. Everyone were hoping the price to be around $5k to $8k which took a big bounce and reached around $20k. Increasing usage will make the market stronger and not much in the rise of price.",

But to be honest, this isn’t at all possible. At least for the next 5 years, I don’t see this happening. The reason for this is very simple. Bitcoins are famous for their decentralised feature, i.e., that they cannot be controlled or ruled by any government. As no government can control bitcoin, no government will make it legal in the nations. So yes, what the OP is saying is practically impossible. I would love to hear other people's opinions on this.",
