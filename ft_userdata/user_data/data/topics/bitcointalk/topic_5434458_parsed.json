This is the biggest crypto related sites, hence, including gambling2. Majority of casinos started their promotions here, with signature campaigns and other to get the attention3. Why are the reasons casinos doesn't want to answer it? I will say that this community is not biased and will look for everything that the accuser has posted to see which one is at fault or not.Of course if both parties are not satisfied here then they can always go to askgamblers for mediation.",

If the casino's community is huge here on bitcointalk, I don't think it's best for them to avoid addressing concerns raised here by the forum members because that can be seen as avoidance to possible public scrutiny on how they handle such concerns. Obviously if casinos address the issues from the get-go, I don't think that it will reach to a point that it will be posted here in the forum. Then again you have a lot of impatient people here, and I understand why they are impatient because money is involved and no one likes to lose money.",

Partly yes but was thinking that, maybe other casinos in the future, I don't want to put any casino in the spotlight, but in general, where other casinos prefer to discuss their issues on other platforms because of their own reasons, will this harm the casino's reputation here or other platforms will prefer to be a third party on the issue like Askgamblers.I don't mean to put any casino name here but this is for the sake of the discussion on a subject related to gambling.",

The presence of CS who handles forum accounts will be very helpful in any case. So I think it's will be good if company representatives are willing to maximize this forum to become a place to solve problems and discuss for its users. Refusing any complains or questions from this forum, it can be said they are doesn't have responsibility for their customers.

There is no platform that is as fair as a forum, BTT is a forum, a community of real people practically reviewing and alleging if necessary, it would be fair for the company to answer if they are sincere. Not the so-called platforms that would be doing the wish of their paymaster.If a platform is strictly moderated by some set of people, you would only see what they want you to see, and they will always favour who pays them. I have experienced this kind of injustice with the so-called trusted ones, your voice might not be heard through their platform. While some voices would be heard and others won't be hard to pretend they are legit.Nothing could be compared to collective voices that are free to share their views without restriction and harassment by some entities called moderators and sole deciders.",

This forum would be an advantage to projects but it is not a requirement. What's important at the end of the day is  for projects to be able to aid problems raised by their users. Also, answers won't mean nothing if there will be no actions into it. Discussions are only for short term aids. There are even projects which are not directly answering accusations but are just focusing on the solution. Owners has their own ways to fix things in the first place. But on my end, I think it would be much better for them to answer issues on their platforms itself thru announcements to filter those who are really concerned and those who only adds up to issues they have nothing to do with.",

Bitcointalk is the best place to discuss about the issue transparently with an audience to decide who’s right base on the statement of both party but sometimes there are some issues that requires an evidence that can’t be shared on the public and this is the part where the Askgambler is very handy to handle this case. They can verify all the documents provided by both party privately and check the authenticity of it to decide who’s telling the truth which the forum can’t do unless someone here step-up and has a technical knowledge on handling the case for free.I believe only few or no user here will want to get involved on someone else case and decides who’s right since surely the losing party will not gonna accept someone opinion here.",

But if the reference is clicked on, it would be known that the case has been solved. But it supposed to have been changed to neutral or the tag to have be removed. No, it's not for several reasons. They solved the case only because they were negatively tagged and had two active flags above their threads. They were fine with confiscating the player's money before they got tagged and the flags got supported by DT members. The solved case isn't the only scam accusation against this casino. There were 3 the last time I checked. In a different case, they locked a player's account and took his money. After the player complained on this forum and an arbitrator site (can't remember if it was AskGamblers or Casino Guru), their reply was they will investigate why the player was banned. What does that mean? It means they will start an investigation to see why the player was banned in the first place. The normal workflow is to conduct an investigation first, come to a decision, and undertake certain actions. The \"experts\" from Trustdice have their own take on this. They confiscate your money, and maybe in the future they will check what happened and what you did wrong. Let me tell you another thing, maybe you will then better understand why they don't want to participate in the forum's scam accusation threads.One of those arbitration sites (AskGamblers or Casino Guru) doesn't investigate cases that involve sportsbooks. TrustDice has a sportsbook. Since they won't be investigated by the arbitrator, they are free to make their own decisions. The other arbitration site doesn't investigate breeches of terms and service. Are you getting a clearer picture? You confiscate someone's money with silly accusations that they were involved in late betting (proven to be false and a lie in the resolved thread you linked to), you mention breeches of terms and service agreements and arbitrators won't look into the case. Since they have decided not to respond to scam accusation threads on the forum, there is very little that their victims can do.",

In this case Bitcointalk is perfect on handling cases that involves casino with sportsbook.The only problem that I’m seeing on cases like this was if there’s no hard evidence can be show while the casino choose to become silent, A single or 2 DT opinion will not gonna matter especially if the casino is backed by user here that benefits on signature campaign. This is the only unfairness I can see when someone fights against a casino that has great influence here while his case is very hard to prove in the public because it requires data coming from the casino account history that already inaccessible due to block account.",
