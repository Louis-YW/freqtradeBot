  "content": "I'm going to remake this timeline graphicMany Bitcoin Mining Pools turned to scam at the ends. If they have announcement threads in Bitcointalk, they have active red flags and became defunct.A step-by-step evolution of Bitcoin miningAt beginning, difficulty is low and miners could mine bitcoins with CPUs. Later, they moved to GPUs and FPGA Mining. A last and current era is ASICs mining.When more efficient equipment were used for mining, difficulty on Bitcoin network increases sharply.Operational PoolsThe following mining pools are still running and paying out their users:Defunct PoolsThe following pools were once operational but have since shut down. They are listed for historical purposes only.Reward typesThey have many reward types (from Wiki)CPPSRB - Capped Pay Per Share with Recent Backpay.DGM - Double Geometric Method. A hybrid between PPLNS and Geometric reward types that enables to operator to absorb some of the variance risk. Operator receives portion of payout on short rounds and returns it on longer rounds to normalize payments.ESMPPS - Equalized Shared Maximum Pay Per Share. Like SMPPS, but equalizes payments fairly among all those who are owed.POT - Pay On Target. A high variance PPS variant that pays on the difficulty of work returned to pool rather than the difficulty of work served by poolPPLNS - Pay Per Last N Shares. Similar to proportional, but instead of looking at the number of shares in the round, instead looks at the last N shares, regardless of round boundaries.PPLNSG - Pay Per Last N Groups (or shifts). Similar to PPLNS, but shares are grouped into \"shifts\" which are paid as a whole.PPS - Pay Per Share. Each submitted share is worth certain amount of BTC. Since finding a block requires <current difficulty> shares on average, a PPS method with 0% fee would be 6.25 BTC divided by <current difficulty>. It is risky for pool operators, hence the fee is highest.Prop. - Proportional. When block is found, the reward is distributed among all workers proportionally to how much shares each of them has found.RSMPPS - Recent Shared Maximum Pay Per Share. Like SMPPS, but system aims to prioritize the most recent miners first. [5]Score - Score based system: a proportional reward, but weighed by time submitted. Each submitted share is worth more in the function of time t since start of current round. For each share score is updated by: score += exp(t/C). This makes later shares worth much more than earlier shares, thus the miner's score quickly diminishes when they stop mining on the pool. Rewards are calculated proportionally to scores (and not to shares). (at slush's pool C=300 seconds, and every hour scores are normalized)SMPPS - Shared Maximum Pay Per Share. Like Pay Per Share, but never pays more than the pool earns.FPPS - Full Pay Per Share. Similar to PPS，but not only divide regular block reward (6.25 BTC for now) but also some of the transaction fees. Calculate a standard transaction fee within a certain period and distribute it to miners according to their hash power contributions in the pool. It will increase the miners' earnings by sharing some of the transaction fees.Researches on Bitcoin Mining PoolsI found three researches about Bitcoin Mining Pools.Credit to The evolution of mining pools and miners’ behaviors inthe Bitcoin blockchain Credit to Neighborhood Pool Watch, November 6th 2016 Block Maker StatisticsCredit to Visual Analytics of Bitcoin Mining Pool Evolution: On the Road Toward Stability?ResourcesBitcoin Mining Pool ListMining Pool (Wiki)Pooled mining (Wiki)Comparisons of mining pools (Wiki)Bitcoin mining pools historical timelineThe rise of ASICs - a step by step history of Bitcoin miningVisual Analytics of Bitcoin Mining Pool Evolution: On the Road Toward Stability?The evolution of mining pools and miners’ behaviors inthe Bitcoin blockchainA Short History of the World’s Largest Bitcoin Mining PoolsSlush Pool.

(Household Electricity Costs)The average household electricity cost to mine 1 Bitcoin is $46,291.24, which is 35% higher than the average daily price of 1 BTC in July 2023 ($30,090.08). The regional differences in household electricity costs are significant, with Europe standing out with the highest average cost of household electricity, estimated at $85,767.84. In contrast, the Asian region boasts the lowest average cost for solo miners at $20,635.62 when mining 1 Bitcoin. This region stands as the sole territory where the average household electricity costs make mining profitable for a solo miner. Still, the disparity between Lebanon’s low electricity cost of $266.20 and Japan’s high cost of $64,111.02 accentuates the disparate nature of electricity expenses within the region.Now let's see the most Profitable / Unprofitable Countries to Mine 1 BTCQuoteThe Most Unprofitable Countries to Mine 1 BTCThe top 10 countries where Bitcoin mining is most profitable due to low household electricity costs are predominantly in Asia and Africa:Country   Electricity Cost to Mine 1 BTC (USD)Lebanon   266.02Iran   532.04Syria   1330.1Ethiopia   1596.12Sudan   2128.17Libya   2660.21Kyrgyzstan   2660.21Angola   3724.29Zimbabwe   3990.31Bhutan   4256.33b]The Most Unprofitable Countries to Mine 1 BTC[/b]It is unprofitable to mine Bitcoin in 82 countries, of which these are the top 10 most expensive countries with highest household electricity costs to mine 1 BTC:Country   Electricity Cost to Mine 1 BTC (USD)Italy   208,560.33Austria   184,352.44Belgium   172,381.50Denmark   166,795.06Germany   163,336.79Ireland   159,612.50Lithuania   152,163.92Netherlands   137,798.79United Kingdom   130,616.23Cayman Islands   128,222.04You can use Realized price from lookintobitcoin.com too.",

      "body": "Eligius mining pool is back with a new name, Ocean mining pool.Their pool: https://ocean.xyzIt is their slogan.QuoteOCEAN is a new type of mining pool on a mission to radically decentralize Bitcoin miningDash board: https://ocean.xyz/dashboardIt is launched by Luke Dashjr. Read why he launched this pool.https://ocean.xyz/aboutQuoteIn 2011, I started the Eligius mining pool.At the time, GPU mining was just getting started and the difficulty increases made it obvious that miners needed to work together if they were going to have any regularity in payouts. Over the course of that early period we found many blocks (11,631) and helped the community mine a lot of bitcoins (348,326).We were very successful, and we had a lot of loyal users who appreciated the transparency and non-custodial payout system of Eligius. Eventually, wizkid057 stepped up to maintain the pool and allow me to focus more on Bitcoin Core development before he also had to step away and shut down the pool. Since that time, the centralization and overreach of other pool operators has changed Bitcoin to the point whereQuotethe security model of Bitcoin is at high risk; we have already lost the censorship-resistant property many tout as one of Bitcoin's primary benefits.Today, pools operate like custodial bank accounts and have the ability to decide who can and who can't use Bitcoin. The so-called \"51%\" attack vector is already a reality because it only actually takes 20-30% of network hashrate to have a good probability of getting away with an attack.As for censorship, it is no longer a matter of actual resistance but merely if and when the pools choose to do it there are 11 entities who decide what transactions go in (or stay out) of almost every block, and simply the 2 largest can impose censorship on everyone else with 100% success. This is not some future risk but a present reality, and it's not sustainable if Bitcoin is to remain a permissionless currency.As we stand today, Bitcoin is not a censorship resistant network, rather it just happens to be a network that is not currently being censored. As with other forms of centralization (hardware, firmware, ...), the role of mining pools must change for Bitcoin to exist as a truly decentralized currency.To that end, I am relaunching Eligius as OCEAN, a new type of pool that enables miners to be truly miners again. At the start, we are already the most transparent pool giving you full visibility into block templates, generation payouts, miner stats, etc. As miners, you should have the ability to know what transactions you are mining with your hashrate. We are also the only non-custodial pool, making you, the miners, recipients of new block rewards directly from Bitcoin.Over the next year, I will be redesigning the process of block template construction, leveraging and improving Stratum V2 where possible, to truly decentralize mining. We also plan to incorporate Lightning payouts which will solve the dust problem for small miners. This will also serve the dual benefit of bringing more liquidity to Lightning.To make it worth everyone's effort to switch, OCEAN will be at 0% for the first 2 months of operation. After that we will need to introduce fees, but they will be kept reasonable and fair for all sizes of miners.~ Luke Dashjr, 2023",

Among other improvements, this upgrade fixes this long-standing vulnerability exploited by modern spammers. As a result, our blocks will now include many more real transactions and help to bring an end to the DoS attack being performed on the #Bitcoin network.So, in addition to our already-established benefits (transparency, non-custodial, and permissionless), we now also offer honest miners the first easy option to contribute toward blocks full of real transactions, effectively a several times larger block size in terms of transaction confirmations, without actually making the blocks any larger.Quote from: https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1732204937466032285?s=20PSA: “Inscriptions” are exploiting a vulnerability in #Bitcoin Core to spam the blockchain. Bitcoin Core has, since 2013, allowed users to set a limit on the size of extra data in transactions they relay or mine (`-datacarriersize`). By obfuscating their data as program code, Inscriptions bypass this limit.This bug was recently fixed in Bitcoin Knots v25.1. It took longer than usual due to my workflow being severely disrupted at the end of last year (v24 was skipped entirely).Bitcoin Core is still vulnerable in the upcoming v26 release. I can only hope it will finally get fixed before v27 next year.It is deployed with a Bitcoin Knots wallet software that went first with this initiative.",

I didnt realise that GPUs started to get into the bitcoin mining scene in 2010, and didnt know that the first BTC ASIC was introduced in 2013, when I joined the scene in late 2013, it seemed there was tons and tons of ASICs out already. I remember there was a miner like KnCMiner Jupiter/Saturn and there was a bigger ASIC called the TerraMiner. Both were crazy expensive at $10K or so which I couldnt afford.Its amazing how we improved in the ASIC efficiency over the years, the chips get smaller and smaller and we get a much bigger hash out of them. Too bad bitcoin mining is out of reach for most retail users unfortuntely.",

Thank you.I just read an interesting article of Bitcoin solo mining with data and information shared by CryptoQuant.Solo Bitcoin Miner Wins Big After Securing an Entire Block RewardQuoteSolo miners usually have historically had limited computing power to mine blocks, although new solo mining rigs like BitAxe claim to offer 500 Giga Hashes per second (GH/s).\"It is not a rare occurrence that a solo miner finds a block, it is just a low probability event,\" CryptoQuant's head of research Julio Moreno told CoinDesk. \"However, this has been happening a little bit more frequent as there has been a growth in the production of small ASICs (mining equipment), which is specifically targeted to people that want to mine by their own from their own home.\"Solo miner wins $200K Bitcoin lottery with just 0.012% of hashrateQuoteThe miner solved 14 Bitcoin blocks in the last year, receiving 59.3 Bitcoin, which is worth $3.5 million at current prices.",
