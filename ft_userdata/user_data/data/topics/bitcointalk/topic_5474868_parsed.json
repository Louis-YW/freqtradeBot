  "content": "I said let me share this here as it is already in our local board, which I used yesterday and my transaction went smoothly and confirmed within 6hrs. We can still enjoy using low fee for our bitcoin transaction despite the mempool congestion that has resulted to high fee for transactions to be confirmed. ViaBTC free accelerator is what you need, this tool is very easy to use and beginners can use it without any  problem. Viabtc is a mining pool, and when you use their tools, they will iclude your transaction in the next block that they will mine.Use this link: https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/StepsAfter you have made your transaction, you should just copy your txid and paste it on the space..after that click on free submission and you will see if it has been successfully added to the next block. All you need to do after that is to relax and wait for few hours for your transaction to be confirmed.Note : For you to use this tool and be successful with it, you must 1. Make sure that you are using a wallet that supports RBF, this will enable adjust the fee to that fee that will be easy for this tool to accelerate your transaction....2. Your transaction limit should be 500 byte or lower.3. Use minimum of 10sat/byte and above for your transaction fee, which should be around 19 sat/vbyte for native segwit.You can check the fee and size of your transaction by pasting your txid on https://www.blockchain.com/explorer.For people using electrum wallet, it is easy to see your transaction fee and adjust it to the stated fee above. Also I used static because it is easy to make the adjustment, and the fee is also very low on static.The only challenge that you can have is pasting your txid and after clicking on the free submission, if it does not respond, when you experience such, you should relax till the next 0'clock (i.e if you submitted your transaction by 1.15pm, you have to wait till 2.00pm on dot, and refresh the page and immediately paste your txid and click on the free submission.Note: ViaBtc can only have accelerate 100 free tansactions in one hour, and the funniest thing is that these 100 transactions will be complete in less than five minutes, this is why you must be vigilante and fast.Remember there are enough scam accelerators in google and be careful on the one you don't know. ViaBTC free accelerator is genuine.Motivated by Charles-TimEdited.",

All you need to do after that is to relax and wait for few hours for your transaction to be confirmed.Free submission, not subscription.The transaction will be submitted not that it it added to the next block like that, but will be added to a block if ViaBTC has mine a block.The transaction may be confirmed at anytime, when ViaBTC mine a block next. It can less than some minutes and it may be more than 1 hours. Quote from: Ruttoshi on November 21, 2023, 08:45:08 AM1. Make sure that you are using a wallet that supports RBF, this will enable adjust the fee to that fee that will be easy for this tool to accelerate your transaction....Not necessary, you can use a wallet that does not support replace-by-fee, but making sure that you use 10 sat/byte as the transaction fee rate. But replace-by-fee can help you to increase the fee if you use lower than 10 sat/byte fee rate, you can increase the fee.Quote from: Ruttoshi on November 21, 2023, 08:45:08 AMNote: ViaBtc can only have the capacity to accelerate 100 transactions in one hour, and the funniest thing is that these 100 transactions will be complete in less than five minutes, this is why you must be vigilante and fast.It is because the mempool is congested which makes more people to use the free accelerator.",

ViaBTC free accelerator is genuine.There is also binance mining pool I think but I don’t think they do free acceleration like Viabtc. Also people need to be aware that what does fake accelerators just rebroadcast one’s transactions and nothing more it is something that can be done from your own wallet.",

      "body": "If you want to pay the lowest possible fees, this means that you have to wait until the mining pool is empty. Otherwise, all you will do is pay the lowest possible fees and hope that your transaction will be confirmed in the coming hours. It is better to pay a reasonable fee and use the RBF flag if it is not confirmed. Your transaction is within the time you have estimated. https://mempool.space/ provides a simple interface that enables you to do this.Quote from: Zaguru12 on November 21, 2023, 09:10:55 AMI think this was a typo error it should be ViaBTC can only accelerate only 100 Free transactions in one hour but they are capable of actually accelerating more if it is not free since one block can contain upto 4,000 transactions in it.

Miners have a candidate block which contains the transactions that will be added to the blockchain if they manage to mine a block. If you submit a transaction to ViaBTC accelerator, they add your transaction to their candidate block. Once a block is mined, ViaBTC remove all the confirmed transactions from their mempool and build a new candidate block. If the mined block includes your transaction, it would be removed from ViaBTC mempool and it can't be selected for their candidate block again.",
