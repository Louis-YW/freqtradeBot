It will be highly welcomed by the community.List of Bitcointalk.org Userscripts/ Add-ons / SMF patchesCoding is one of many constructive ways in Bitcointalk.Quote from: theymos on September 23, 2018, 08:58:25 PMWelcome to bitcointalk.org, the Bitcoin Forum! You can access this welcome message from the \"help\" link in the top menu bar at any time.As a member of the forum, you are surrounded by legends; phenomenal successes and catastrophic failures. The forum was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and saw the first exchange, the first altcoin, and the first ICO, but also catastrophic software flaws, massive thefts, and incredible scams. You too have an opportunity to become part of the forum's history: whether and in what way you do so is up to you.Table of contentsThe purpose of the forumForum rankPosting images and wearing signaturesCommon rule violationsLanguagesBeware of scamsGetting helpThe purpose of the forumThis forum exists to provide a platform for the free (but ordered) exchange of ideas. If you have an idea to express, then it is probably possible to do it here as long as you follow the rules.A lot of people come here primarily looking to make money. The forum administration is very happy that people are able to use the forum in order to better themselves; indeed, one of the reasons for Bitcoin's creation was to break the artificial barriers which prevent so many people around the world from attaining prosperity. However, if your attempts to make money conflict with the forum's primary goal of enabling discussion, then you are swimming upstream, and you will not be sucessful in the end.If you view the forum as some sort of \"job\" where you complete some basic tasks and get paid, then you will almost certainly be disappointed, and the forum administration will not be sympathetic. If you do make money using the forum, then it will be through innovation and entrepreneurship, not any sort of mindless busywork.Forum rankWhen you start out, you are a Newbie, and you will run into various annoying limits. These limits will be reduced to the point where you shouldn't usually notice them after you have participated in the forum for a few weeks. If you are on the forum to talk, then that's all you really need to know about rank. Don't worry about it too much, and you will eventually rank up.If you want to maximize your rank, then you need to increase two statistics which are listed on your profile:Activity, which is maximized by posting once per day on average. Posting more than that is useless in raising your activity.Merit, which is gained by making good posts.If you make ten thousand posts in a week, your activity will be capped and you will still be a Newbie. If you make ten thousand useless posts over any period of time, you will gain zero merit and you will still be a Newbie. You can rank up only by making good posts consistently. It's quality over quantity.When trying to write quality posts, a lot of people act as though they're writing a book report for school: putting facts that we already know into their own words. Nobody wants to read that, and you will not get merit for it. Moreover, the length of your post and the quality of your English are only minor factors. In trying to write a quality post worthy of merit, you should offer new ideas, personal experiences, or perspectives that other forum users will actually find new and interesting.",

The better way to learn Bitcoin especially on software development side is to take online courses and participate on github contribution by looking for open source software that needs your work. Every developer starts in there since most of the open source project in Bitcoin is in there.You can contribute to the forum when you already have the experience and sharing it to the community by creating a tutorial or info thread and teaching other user that posting question on Bitcoin discussion and technical board.",

Ali I can say is that once a newbie you must learn the step by step procedure in order to learn this forum is like inn our school we need to take the lower level first before we achieve the highest degree. So it means that for this forum in order to learn and contribute we must take it slowly no need to rush because this is not a competition in the first place. And the first thing you need to do is to know what this forum all about, what are the rules and regulations, what are do's and don't here in forum. And once you already know that, then you can start participating some discussions.And also the best way, is to read more post less and search everything you need to learn.",

You may have heard alot of things about thos forum from different quarters. Of all those things which you may have heard, I know that the one that must have stood out the most was getting merit to advance to the next level and which makes one eligible to be accepted into a signature campaign. What I am saying is that take your mind off merits. Because it will make you begin to spam, create low quality topics and replies, this would lead to you being on the ignore list of most members on the forum.
