      "body": "When you are presenting a scam accusation such as this there are certain procedures to follow if you expect to get any traction or attention around here.You can find guidelines and a template here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=260073.0Something like this is difficult to parse through, because the PM they sent you was very undescriptive. \"Being in Contact on Telegram\" doesn't help me confirm that this particular user that you produced messages with is the same person; additionally I don't see any dates on the messages or the PM verification.It would be easier to navigate this accusation if you provided direct links to the accused profile, and transaction IDs/Addresses. I highly suggest only dealing with an escrow, unless there is extraordinary circumstances. More information on escrow guidelines can be found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=133931.0Unless you can provide more proof or something more compelling I'm not sure that you will get the desired outcome from this thread.",

I am not doubting anyone, just trying to be logical as 50 seem... too low to risk a reputation.Meanwhile, I see that ThatsMod is online today, I'll try to reach him through PM to invite him here and give his side of the story.Edit: invited",

Not judging which side said the truth and which side lied as it is too soon to pass the judgement, but suppose the answer for both question is yes, and that you're really waiting for him to send transaction before proceeding to do the job, why didn't you say anything when he gave a screenshot of transaction to the address --assuming, if they lied, then the address on the screenshot is not yours because if it is, then keraldk would have finished their side of contract by paying you-- knowing that they gave a screenshot of a transfer to a wrong address.For reference, the address is indeed credited with USDT and immediately drained, https://bscscan.com/address/0x0707d5e717f3090bdc6f8893fee2c3d12c27bb05",

I am sure DireWolfM14 will remove the negative tag if there isn't enough evidence to prove that you are a scammer.According to the screenshots, you first didn't want to work with that person until he sent you the $50. Once he did and you confirmed receiving the coins, what happened next? You told him to get ready and that's where the conversation ends. Are you claiming that the discussion shown in the screenshots is not between you and the OP at all?Telegram is an awful platform to use for business. The fact that anyone can delete private conversations for both parties is proof of that.",

The red tag given by DireWolfM14 was initialy raised to merely catch your attention toward this thread. It is not impossible that --if adequate evidences are given-- the real story here is the OP lied for whatever reason. But, so far, OP has evidences that incriminate you, so the ball is in your court.There is no need to prove that you can fabricate evidences to deceive people, no one challenging you to edit photos to work in your favor. What we asked is for you to give counter-evidence that the screenshot given by OP is not correct, but not by editing another image to fabricate evidences, if both of you keep doing this, everything will go downhill.As you said that you do sent a PM to the OP in the middle of, I assume, a job negotiation, I think it is safe to say that at least that evidence is valid. So, the story so far according to OP, you approached them to offer your service, asked for an upfront full payment --50 dollars, and I'll repeat myself just for thr record, IMO the amount is too small to risk a reputation-- and leave after you got the transfer.With OP claiming you deleted the entire chat -but it seems, not before they can archive some screenshot-- and blocked them, and you claimed they deleted the chat after you refused the job --unfortunately, before you can archive the convo to work in your favor--, the case turns into a whodunnit.I'll suggest we can start from whether TG name \"Crypto Has\" is really you or not, because I can't find your username using the handler you posted months ago, so I can't confirm it myself.Quote from: ThatsMod on September 29, 2021, 05:46:00 PMHaпиcaл вaм нo в oтвeт пoлyчил блoк, oбъяcнитe ? мoй tg @ThatsModAnd then, after we established if the name is correct --and thus, the screenshots provided were at least bear some truth in it-- I'll suggest you to point out, according to your version, which part of conversation is true and from which part is fabricated.I think it is rather futile at this point, but... keraldk, we are still waiting for the proof that ThatsMod blocked you from TGDireWolfM14, as ThatsMod is already present here and to give an equal position for both parties, would you mind to retract the negative tag for now --or at least change them into neutral-- until it is proven which side lied and which side told the truth?",
