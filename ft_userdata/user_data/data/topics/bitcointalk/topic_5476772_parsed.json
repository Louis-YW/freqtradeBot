      "body": "40 000 dollars will get if you invest enough money is a thousand dollars and more, the benefit of the project is in the interest for each transaction and for one round of arbitrage they can reach up to 100 thousand, and now count if 0.3% to take from each transaction the amount will be clearly more, when the project is already used every day more than ten thousand people, we have statistics every 24 hours comes 200-300 new users who invest 500 dollars and get a huge profit. No one disputes that there is no \"Money\" button, but this project is made to delegate all tasks to the bot, so it is a way of passive income with good profits",

This is somehow magical how would someone used a bot and made $40k within the less than 24hrs, why not he uses his service to make such profits and stops sharing to people. QuoteSuch trading bots can be of help to someone who knows how to trade, and for those who don't know how or are complete beginners, the result will only be a loss.This is a no go area I won't even encourage newbies to use a trading bot or even try to use this service because many newbie traders won't even look at their lost rather they would focused on their profits thinking it's not very easy and simple as op instructed above.In my opinion the whole concepts is too fake to be real, sorry op this part of my post made you angry but I am just giving you my own version of view.Always Act Smart and Play Safe With Your FundsGoodluck!",

OP thinks here's a forum peopled by ignoramuses.I'm also of the same opinion as that which you displayed there. No one will willfully give out what fetches them money to random strangers just like that. Anyone promising that makes their story sound too good to be true. That's why we should always verify whatever we intend going into. Never be in a rush. That hasty decision is what scammers capitalize on to catch their preys.",
