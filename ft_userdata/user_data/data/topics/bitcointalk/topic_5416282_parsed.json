For example, in Bitcoin, the longer chain can make new decisions such as creating new coins, modifying the sizes of blocks and other things, but for this to happen, you need to control the longer chain, which is something that you will not get easily due to the centralized distribution of the hashrate[1].In Binance Smart Chain they relies on 21 validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) which mean that those 21 validators who can suspend the network, delete coins, add new one, and more.Note that most or all of these 21 are directly or indirectly managed by Binance.[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20181231045818/https://people.xiph.org/~greg/attack_success.html",

More trouble for them and also for the people.People are¬† probably feel secure now, but must always remember the concept of not your key, not your coin.

Those tokens are actually worthless, but luckily those CEXs have an army of people who believe in fairy tales and think they own something valuable.Calling CZ some kind of smart leader is even more stupid considering that he personally got rich from all that, while his company was in the gray zone for years (and still largely is). But I understand that most people need some kind of leader, and that's why it bothers them so much that there is no Satoshi to hold their hands and tell them a good night story",
