      "body": "This is definitely likely to happen, in fact it has happened in the past although it is minimal this days. If you use a top cryptocurrency exchange like binance ( I am not classifying that is good to use it because it is centralized exchange). The exchange normally confiscate your funds because both the seller and buyer must  present proves of payments and if truly the seller sent the money and the buyer denies. The exchange will advise the seller to go to his bank and get the confirmation, the exchange usually gives 48 hours for this and then if the seller doesn’t give bring much evidence the coin is sent to the buyer while freezing the remaining ones. Note that the amount in transaction is what attract the exchange support attention. For small funds it usually takes more time to sort out because of lack of attention. The best form of P2P is with someone you trust or when on the exchange try to look for buyers or sellers with reputation like the amount of transactions they have been involved in and also the ratings on them. But this still doesn’t take away the risk it just minimizes it.",

Quote from: Kelward on June 06, 2023, 02:28:27 PMSo my question be, what if the buyer pay money into di account of the seller, den di seller no come transfer the bitcoin into di buyer account, no be scam be dat? And as bitcoin de banned for Nigeria, how di person go seek for justice for the scam?On p2p exchanges like Bisq, it makes use of 2-of-3 multisig. This makes scam not to be possible to some extent, just like on centralized exchanges too. For naira exchange to bitcoin and other crypto and vice versa on centralized exchanges, the exchange serves as the middle man which can help mitigate scam. But there is still possibility of scam if someone is not careful enough. Do not rely on alert, if you are paid, check your bank account balance and make sure the money reflect on your account before you proceed to release the coin from escrow. Quote from: Kelward on June 06, 2023, 02:28:27 PMSecondly e get any oda country wey dem government ban bitcoin wey dem de use dis p2p system?Nigeria government did not ban bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it is CBN that ban cryptocurrencies. If the government ban bitcoin, they can go to the extent of doing what they did to Twitter (when Twitter was banned in the country) to centralized exchanges to the extent that you will not have the option than to use vendor or decentralized exchanges.",

But in case where after making payment the seller refuses to send your coin, you just need to chat the customer care of the exchange and I rest assured you that you will get your Bitcoin or money back in not less than 48hrs.",

Point of correction my brother, Bitcoin is not a business per say, but a decentralized digital currency that is independent of it's own and not controlled by anybody whether bank nor government. But just that it could be used for doing business as a medium of payment for goods and services, and not that it is a business on it's own. Secondly, legalizing Bitcoin on it's own do not create job, unless people are skillful enough to engage in crypto related work and get paid in Bitcoin, trading or investing in it for a long term so as to gain from profit.",

Scammers dey those platforms too but dem dey in the minimum because dem get to do KYC before dem become merchant to the sell and buy Bitcoin.Now for decentralized P2P wey you dey do with another human being without any website, e better you only trade with person wey you know very well if not dem go scam you. The scamming fit dun reduce but some persons still dey fall mugu and that's why we still get this type of scammers full Telegram and WhatsApp. If you no wise dem go scam you and dey very cautious of all those high fee merchant because na them be the scammers.
