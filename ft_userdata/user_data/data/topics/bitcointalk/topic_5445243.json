  "content": "The content of this topic was originally written in Portuguese, on March 3, 2022. At that time ChipMixer was tested, and although it is no longer in operation, I will keep the information I gathered about it.EDIT 18/03/2023: I will be working on the topic over the next few days to include some of the suggestions already made. Thank you for understanding.Until \"today\", I had never used a mixing service. I didn't, because I had never felt the need, and I used it now because I wanted to test this type of service.Despite ChipMixer being one of the best-known mixes, and since I've never used one, I decided to take the opportunity to test Sinbad and Yo!Mix.My report will not dwell on technical issues, it will only present a view as a consumer of these 3 platforms and how the experience was in each of them.For this test, I used the same amount in all mixes: 0.00101 BTCI will present the report, by the sequence in which I did the tests since I test one at a time.1. SINBAD________________The first one I tested was Sinbad, which can be accessed via the regular web or Onion. It is noted that the focus is on being functional, having a basic website without a very elaborate design, which is enough to fulfill this objective.On the home page, I only present the steps necessary to carry out the mix: indicate the destination address(es); choose the service fee; and the mixing code - which serves, in case previous mixes have already been made, the coins already mixed do not come back to us.The minimum amount to be mixed is 0.001 BTC, if a lower amount is sent, it is ignored by the system and considered a donation.After having indicated the destination address, I chose the service fee, which I left at the default of 1.08%. If we use a higher rate, mixing should be faster.After advancing to the next stage, I sent the BTC to the given address. Between sending the money and receiving it back, it took about 8 hours.With all fees paid, I received 0.00089808BTC.2. CHIPMIXER_____________The second mix I tested was the ChipMixer, which you can only access via Onion. With an equally simple design, but a little more appealing than Sinbad, it's also very practical to use.When starting the process, just follow the steps indicated. Initially, we have to send the Bitcoin that we intend to mix, this channel - let's call it that - remains open for 7 days, so we can go on making several transactions, and then at the end mix everything. It must be done in multiples of 0.001 BTC, that is, 0.001/0.002/0.01/0.02/etc., if an \"intermediate\" amount is sent - let's say - it is considered a donation (this was the understanding I had).In my case, in which I sent 0.00101 BTC, the 0.00001 BTC was considered a donation. So, only 0.001 BTC remains in the mix. He is very quick to recognize the transaction, just 1 confirmation (if I'm not mistaken) to continue the process.Next, ChipMixer presents a series of options to make the mix, which initially may seem more complex. After validating that we have already sent all the intended Bitcoin, we choose how we want the mix to be done. Once the choice is made, we can keep a wallet that already has the coins with the mix made, or else request that the coins be sent to an address indicated by us.I chose to receive the mixed coins at the address chosen for me, which is the most time-consuming process since it is only done once a day. According to what I understand it is done at 00h UTC. Because of that, I had to wait for almost 23 hours to receive my coins.With all fees paid I got 0.00098889BTC.3. YO!MIX________________Then I tested Yo!Mix, which can also be accessed via the regular Onion web. Of the 3 services, this is the one with the most elaborate design and most similar to the style used on service websites, with images and several tabs with useful information about the service. But the operation is equally simple and practical.Starting the mixing process, we indicate the destination address, the service fee, and the delay to receive the mixed coins. I chose a minimum service fee - of 0.700%, and since then a base fee is still paid, which was 0.0000846 BTC. Then the money is sent to the indicated address, and as soon as it is received, the process starts based on the requested delay. This whole process took less than 1 hour, as I chose not to wait.With all fees paid, I got 0.00091833BTC.FINAL CONSIDERATIONS_____- At the site level, Yo!Mix is the one that presents a more common aspect to the style of sites we are used to. But all services are practical and easy to use, with Sinbad having a simpler design.- The service that took the longest to carry out the whole process was ChipMixer, but also due to the mixing method is chosen and the hours in which I carried out the tests.- The service where I paid the most fees and received the same was Sinbad, followed by Yo!Mix and the best was ChipMixer.- I found all services viable, with ChipMixer being the most interesting, since it is free (paying only the transaction fee) and where I received more money back.- Sinbad is the simplest and most practical, but it also tends to have a higher rate.- Yo!Mix although you also pay a fee for the service, it's simple to use and seems to be the fastest.I hope you enjoyed this review, from a mixing novice.",

      "body": "A good review of these mixers, as they are frankly starting to spread and gain popularity, and it is good that you have made many important points clear for each mixer so that it is easier for the reader or customer to determine the excellent mixer that suits his needs. I wish you would add [banned mixer] to your review; this is the best Bitcoin mixer since 2019, not just Bitcoin; it supports many other currencies as well and will add more in the future; in addition to that, the Coinomize mixer makes anyone 100% anonymous, and anyone can clean their Bitcoin in simple steps, they have a simple and modern user interface and at an appropriate mixing fee according to the choice from 1-5% and only requires one confirmation. The outputs are more than five addresses, and they also have a phone application, and there are many other great features. The minimum deposit to use the service is 0.0015BTC, frankly what I liked about this mixer is their customer service they are quick to respond and will guide you and solve all the problems that you may encounter as soon as possible.For more information, check out their ANN thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5247623",

How the analysis was done before this situation happened, and having built an analysis based on this information. I thought it would be logical to keep this same information. But you're even right.I will review this situation, perhaps when I test the suggestion you indicated: [banned mixer]Thanks also for the other tips, which I will try to re-evaluate. Soon I will bring more news.@albon thanks also for your tips.",

As the ChipMixer review was very recent and done around the same time, ie very much at the \"peak\" of it's existence, it makes for a very fair comparison.Worst case, if you don't find it useful - probably because you're already aware or it or used it yourself -Â  then you can just skim over and not read it surely.It's also a lot more difficult to read text has been striked-through than it is to scroll past imo. Just food for thought.",

      "body": "As an alternative to the testing method, you can probably try to mix some coins and deposit them on an exchange to see if they block it or not. If I remember correctly some users mention that their deposit is blocked after they mix their coins and send it to one of their addresses. IIRC, they use Mixero to mix and send it to Binance. Of course, there is no need to do this if you don't use any exchange, probably can substitute it with some services that don't allow mixed coins to see whether the obfuscation is good or not.Quote from: Findingnemo on March 18, 2023, 05:42:04 PM I wonder how it's possible to maintain the platform service provider to give ultimate privacy as well as follows the AML policies. I don't think it is possible. If what the FBI stated in their Chipmixer investigation is true, they can probably discourage some users to mix suspicious funds if someone asks for their help through chat or e-mails so that they are not considered as accomplices/allowing money laundering to happen on their mixing platform. But the investigators can probably use another reason to seize them. At the end of the day, you should not think they give ultimate privacy IMO. If that's what you want you probably should use Monero. CMIIW.",

I can understand that they might guess it came from Chipmixer because of the fixed chips size or from coinJoin because the protocol is open but the rest of the mixers don't leave a distinctive fingerprint that makes you think they are mixed coins.Most platforms easily detect if your coins came from casinos or gambling sites.",

But what lead to the downfall is not how quality they render service but about mixing coins for criminals. But about the mixing service, Chipmixer remain the best which joker_josue included. And you can distinctly see it in red on joker_josue (OP) post that Chipmixer is no longer existing. The benefit of his post can also be for someone that is interested in centralized mixing service, the person may like to do it just like Chipmixer did it.",
