      "body": "Not a chance. The token was just created to make the creators rich and not actually saving the Amazon forest or affect climate change. Just look through the past failed tokens and ICO projects, at least not less than 10 of them possibly talked about trying to stop climate change or something like that, but today they are no way to be seen after collecting money from people.",

      "body": "There are just too many inconsistencies with your team page profile which makes me believe that this is NOT a genuine project. My reason are as follows:First, the team member \"Rokya\" is clearly a female but she was described as a \"male\" with the use of pronouns of HIM and HE. In addition, you labeled her as a software developer but she is a graphic and image designer.Second, Huy Hoang's information is named as \"Anita\" instead of his name Huy based on his profile. Upon checking his photo, he is a graphic designer for fiverr. I really doubt that he has something to do with the project. Lastly, you have an anonymous team member and if you click on any of the social media accounts that they respectively have, you will just be transferred on the website itself.Though these evidences are not 101% conclusive that this is a scam project, it is enough for me or for the average audience to mark this as a red flag if they plan on investing.REFERENCE:https://www.fiverr.com/rokya_bokulhttps://www.fiverr.com/huydesignervn",

These problems will be rectified, the problems are that they were translated from Spanish to English, sorry if the translator misinterpreted the writing.The project is 100% real and is supported with my money and the volunteers so far the trees that were planted and the money that was invested are our money so if this token is not successful we will continue using our money to do good,There are projects that offer nothing 0 and do nothing like memes and other tokens that have no photos of the team and nothing, and even so people invest, we deserve everything that happens to us, when someone tries to do well we get critical and with the projects engenieros we support them",
