I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH, WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH!!! STACK SATS!!If we look at bitcoin price movements, everyone wants more bitcoin, especially considering the high possibility of halving and ETF approval, making the price of bitcoin move up in the last month. More Bitcoin will make us get bigger profits and we can buy bitcoin with the DCA mechanism so that the bitcoin we have continues to increase.However, if I have a lot of money then I will not save all my money in bitcoin because after all bitcoin has high risks. I will divide my money into 3 forms. Firstly in fiat form, this is used for daily living needs, secondly in the form of low risk investments, I will choose gold and this as a reserve if I need money suddenly, thirdly of course in the form of bitcoin, bitcoin will be long term savings which I will continue to hold and will not sell and perhaps will pass it on to my children and grandchildren in the future",

They are both assets, and both can bring profit to an investor, so let's not limit ourselves to bitcoin only if you have goals in life and you want to achieve more or buy things you want. Then, keep on finding ways to earn based on your abilities and explore more; bitcoin is not the only thing you can have. Be more ambitious in the sense that you will focus more on growth and wealth. Having more things in your hand is better than having only one thing, right?",

I wouldn't argue with the fact that someone from those other industries that can have the same feeling as us telling everyone that they've made more money from those that you've mentioned. As long as you're in and you know what you're investing, that's what matters and with the assets that we have means so much to us because it had changed our lives. If you're privileged to stacking more Bitcoin, that's nice. Because someday in the future, all of your efforts of accumulation and wait will be worth it.",

I have yet to hear a person who says I'm done earning money and from this day on I won't be looking for money anymore. On the contrary, even people in their old age want to make more money, not necessarily by working but they want to grow their wealth. This is probably the same explanation with people not having enough Bitcoin. But for as humans, echoing Nietzsche, it's probably the desire rather than the desired that truly drives us.",

This is just the human nature! Our wants are insatiable and thanks to Scarcity for this. Because the commodity is scarce, people will always struggle to acquire more, nobody wants to stop at a particular level. After getting one, we always aim for two. You call it greed? Yea we all have that atom of greed in us. All this we do just to better our lives. Of what use will it be if we keep accumulating more and more Bitcoins without taking out time to enjoy what we labour for?

Since in social medias many people flex their wealth and many contents that talk about achievements, most people use that stupid standard in their life.Like in 25 years old, we must have at least $1 Million in banks. In 30 years old, we must have one house, one car, one business and $10 Million. In 40 years old, we must have 3 autopilot businesses and many assets, then achieve financial freedom.This is why we need to learn stoic, it's ridiculous to compare our life with other people life.If money is the goal, @OP should compare his net worth to Elon Musk and start to beat him.",

Not on being pessimistic but at least we shouldnt really forget on the things like speaking about the risks involved with even on crypto space. This is why it would really be always best that you should really know on how to diversify you investment or moneyso that you could really be having that income source on different angles on which you could possibly be able to invest in other ventures or markets if you wanted  to do sosince you do have the funds on doing such thing.It is really normal that having that feeling of greed on trying out to accumulate more but since not all would really be financially capable then it would really be that normal that you would really be having those disappointments and regrets but actually there's nothing we can do about it specially if we dont have money.",

We all know that there are driven people who do not approach the issue of investment selection critically enough. What if Bitcoin resumes its decline and those subscribers who invested in Bitcoin lose a significant portion of their money?This option cannot be excluded. People who have lost money and do not want to wait for the investment to pay off will blame the influencer who pushed them to buy for their problems. This is human nature.",
