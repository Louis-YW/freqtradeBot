  "content": "So we see how a US President is helping to use a war to launder money for all kinds of people. As this news comes out into the open more and more, trust in the US dollar weakens more and more.Is the Ukraine War a Money Laundering Scheme?Quote from: https://www.lewrockwell.com/2022/11/joseph-mercola/is-the-ukraine-war-a-money-laundering-scheme/Many have suspected that the U.S. government's \"security assistance\" to Ukraine — which as of November 15, 2022, had surpassed $98 billion1,2 — is a money laundering scheme to somehow ensure its own security, perhaps relating to questionable activities involving American biolabs in Ukraine.With the sudden implosion of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX,3,4 suspicions of money laundering in Ukraine are gaining new support.As scrutiny into FTX increases, people are finding more and more links between the ill-fated crypto exchange, the Democratic Party, Ukraine, the World Economic Forum (WEF) and even the suppression of COVID-19 treatments through the funding of fake science.FTX, along with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation actually funded the TOGETHER trial,5 which sought to identify \"effective repurposed therapies to prevent the disease progression of COVID-19.\" Using fraudulent trial protocols, this trial concluded that ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were useless.6 Of course, to discourage criticism, the trial was given a \"Trial of the Year\" award for excellence.Where Did All the Money Go?Judy Morris for Peace, Liberty & Prosperity summarized many a sentiment in a November 13, 2022, Substack article:7\"Did you ever wonder where all those billions of dollars were going in Ukraine? Did you ever wonder why anyone was trusting the elites in US politics like the Bidens with billions in funds going to Ukraine? Today it turns out that these were excellent questions.We have information that the tens of billions of dollars going to Ukraine were actually laundered back to the US to corrupt Democrats and elites using FTX cryptocurrency. Now the money is gone and FTX is bankrupt.\"...FTX’s founder, 30-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried — now suspected of having absconded with $1 billion to $2 billion of client funds as the exchange went belly-up in mid-November — was a top donor to the Democratic Party, second only to George Soros....",

Hryvnia has fallen badly in the last year, why would a money launder convert to a plummeting coin when he can deal directly in dollars? Hryvnia does not have enough liquidity for transactions in dollars It isn't laundering money into Ukraine. It is laundering money through Ukraine. The article in my post two or three posts up shows that people in the US and other places - Biden family and many Democrats and other big money people - are getting US money, etc., back from what is going on in Ukraine. Money laundering.It's very complex, and I don't understand all of what is going on, but Ukraine was being used by the US the same way that Wuhan was being used... to produce bio-weapons... CovidIf it is good or bad for this to happen in the long run, who really knows? We don't have a clear picture of all the bio-weapons being produced in the world by all the countries. It might be fighting fire with fire. But the methods being used in Wuhan and Ukraine... the methods that involve the US... are illegal for the US to do.One thing is ultimately certain. Bio-weapons will be used to decrease populations >>> equal, to kill off people. That is the part that is not good.",
