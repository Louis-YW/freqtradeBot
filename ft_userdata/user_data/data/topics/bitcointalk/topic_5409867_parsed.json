With these changes, I wish to ask do you think the price of Bitcoin will ever hit $40k again?I'm just being curious as a new trader.Bitcoin at $40k in a few months is possible if everything falls right in place. But the reality is that nobody knows when everything will fall in place. There are a lot of factors involved. Bitcoin price has been struggling to stay at $24k since the past week. 40K price in a few months (say 3 - 6months) in my opinion is not attainable just yet.",

If $40K is your target, then I believe you won't be disappointed. The most important virtue you have to practice as a trader who holds Bitcoin for long term gains is patience.",

I highly suggest to wait a few months or even at least a year for the current price of bitcoin to double. Right now, it's best to accumulate more and more bitcoin and wait for long term results on your investment and accumulation.Also, you can check out the history of Bitcoin's price chart and you'll be able to see some patterns and indicators that we might reach a higher price at a later date. But still there's a chance that things might go the wrong way and we might see some dipping depending on the situation.",

Are you sure about that, because lots of red while we are still at $23000-24000 would mean that Bitcoin will fall under $16000-17000 and I'm not sure many people are expecting this range to be reached in the coming months. On the other hand 40k is a ambitious target , not likely to happen before the end of the year IMO.",

With these changes, I wish to ask do you think the price of Bitcoin will ever hit $40k again?I'm just being curious as a new trader.of course the price will reach 40,000$ again, this is something that has more than a 60% chance of happening in the long term, of course we also have to be aware that speaking of the long term we could be facing a situation of 1 to 4 years for the price to reach $40,000 and go up to your ATH. but if we compare the profit that banks give per year VS the profit that bitcoin can give per year, we can easily see that putting money to buy bitcoin now and doing hodl for years is a good moveQuote from: Saint-loup on August 14, 2022, 09:43:14 PMQuote from: Rabi3 on August 14, 2022, 09:21:21 PMQuote from: Sunrise360 on August 14, 2022, 07:41:27 PMI observed several changes in the price  within a few months.

The next bull run will be exciting and $40k might just even be a passable price if it comes again.",

I am always confident to say that bitcoin will reach a higher value, but the problem is we can't tell exactly as to when it will happen, maybe before the end of this year or probably early next year. However, if things will always be good for bitcoin and with the crypto market, then we can eventually witness bitcoin price surging in the next possible months. But if there will be unexpected negative news that will hit the market, most likely bitcoin will also be affected and will continue to have a downward trend in its price.",

If we see from that aspect, I really believe that BTC is able to reach $40k again and more, much higher in the next bullish era. I really bel8evvle this happen. The market has dropped so much and now this still keeps struggling during this bearish market. If the market is getting better too welcome bullish, the increase to $40k may be faster. The question is when this will happen. We may be abke to predict but we cannot predict it it 100%. We still need waiting.",

It's just a matter of time before it will finally be seen on the charts. $40,000 is just a mere short-term target. It could easily be achieved.

As a rule, during the next bullish period, the price of bitcoin rises even more than the previous ATH. Here one could even talk about the price of bitcoin at one hundred thousand dollars. In my opinion, this question will be of more interest to current cryptocurrency holders.",

The normal scenario is that after the next halving we will beat the previous ath of $69k, where the next strong resistance will be $100k, which I expect us to beat after several attempts.

The price will eventually recover but we don't know when it is if you check its history, more likely to occur after a few months from bitcoin halving and that's 2 years from now.
