  "content": "Hi guys,It's been a year since the last time I used Electrum and I want to consider using it again because I want to send to multi-addresses at once (I'm open to any wallet alternatives). I did that in Electrum before. Actually, it's still installed on my desktop for over a year even not actively using it.My question is, what's the safe version of Electrum currently, or just simply, what's the stable version of Electrum with no issues? I remember before that there was a version of Electrum where it leads to phishing or malicious activities (am I remember it right?) or something related to that.I know I can do research on myself but it's still good to ask directly the community about my question. Please feed my mind.Thank you so much!",

I remember before that there was a version of Electrum where it leads to phishing or malicious activities (am I remember it right?) or something related to that.Those versions below v3.3.3, since yours is old, it may be affected by that.Here's the release notes: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/c049b461bbd26c04c77448a01f506ca66257cbe1/RELEASE-NOTES#L778Any newer versions doesn't have that specific vulnerability.Take note that you may not be able to connect to any server when using affected versions;if you're able to connect, the server where you're connected to may not have patched or a malicious one.Current security concerns are listed here, including the affected versions: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/security",

All current versions are stable, but the interface of the latest version may not seem appropriate to someone who was using old versions. your last use for electrum was a long time, so you will not be affected by that.to avoid a newbie mistakes, make sure that you are using the correct Base unit, whether it is BTC or mBTC Tools → Preferences → Appearance → Base unit.V 4.4.0 is good.",

      "body": "Many wallets support sending to multiple addresses but few of them (one or two) support the Electrum seed format. Since you already have Electrum installed then better keep using it.Except some minor bugs, no critical vulnerability has been reported in the recent Electrum versions. If your only goal is to send to multiple addresses, then any version above V3.3.3 should be fine.",
