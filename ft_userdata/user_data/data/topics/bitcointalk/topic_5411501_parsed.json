  "content": "I found an amazing article online which i found to be funny, and at the same time quite educative and interesting, this are facts I personally think that the gambling community should know about, so i am sharing the same facts in this community.So without wasting much of your time, lets dive in.1. The Founder Of FedEx Saved The Company By Gambling In Vegas.        Here's an inspiring story for aspiring gamblers and small business owners: the founder of FedEx saved his floundering company by gambling in Vegas, earning $27,000 in blackjack! The company only had $5,000 in its coffers when Frederick Smith decided to fly to Vegas in 1973 and risk it all. Though this isn't good investment or business advice in general, Smith's gamble paid off, allowing the company to last long enough to raise $11 million and eventually earn its first profits in 1976.2. The Nevada State Prison Used to Have a Casino for Inmates.        Gambling is such a huge industry in Nevada that even the state prison had a casino inside it for 35 years. That's right: inmates could play blackjack, craps, poker, and even bet on sports inside the \"Bullpen,\" a stone building on the prison's grounds in Carson City from 1932 to 1967. A new warden from California shut it down that year, saying gambling was a \"degradation\" to the inmates.3. The Sandwich Was Basically Invented in a Casino       The legend goes something like this: in 1765, John Montagu, the fourth Earl of Sandwich, was such a huge gambler that he didn't want to leave the gaming table to eat. Instead, Montagu told his servants to just bring him some meat between sliced bread so he could eat and play at the same time. Thus the \"sandwich\" was born... sort of.In reality, the Earl wasn't much of a gambler, but he did enjoy his namesake meal. The legend came from a French travel guide about London and is the only source of the gambling tale. The story caught on, however, and soon people throughout Europe were craving sandwiches. Montagu didn't invent the meal - it's meat between bread, after all; people had likely been eating this combo for centuries - but he did give it a name and a cool story to go with it (whether he liked it or not!).4. Some Gambling Addicts Pee All Over the Gaming Floor.        Some gamblers simply take things too far: addiction counselors say that some problem gamblers are so impaired by their addiction that they simply urinate all over themselves or wear adult diapers rather than step away from the table or slot machine. For instance, in Indiana in 2007, a gambler filed a complaint with the state's Gaming Commission after he sat in a pee-soaked chair at a slot machine. And in 2015, a New Jersey man urinated into a slot machine's coin slot rather than leave the gaming floor.5. You Can Voluntarily Ban Yourself from a Casino.        If your addiction to gambling is getting out of control, several states allow you to ban yourself from casinos, making it a crime to step foot on the gaming floor. Ohio, for example, has a so-called \"Voluntary Exclusion\" program for gamblers looking to kick the habit that allows them to ban themselves for either a year, five years, or life. If you choose the lifetime ban you better mean it: there is no way to get your name off the list once you commit to quitting for good.6. A World War II Vet Won More Than $25 Million Playing Slots.       Most people think the big money at casinos is made at the table games, but there are rare exceptions in which the slot machines pay off the most. Las Vegas World War II veteran Elmer Sherman won a shocking $4.6 million from a slot machine at the Mirage in 1989, but he wasn't content to stop there. Elmer made it his \"life's dream\" to win another big jackpot. His dream came true in 2005 when he won a whopping $21.1 million at the Cannery!7. American Roulette Is Harder to Win Than European Roulette.        Gamblers playing roulette in America are going to have a slightly harder time winning. Originally a French game, Americans have tweaked the formula to include 38 instead of 37 possible places for the ball to land (adding a \"00\" as well as a \"0\" house pocket to the wheel). It used to be worse: in 1866, a version of the game featuring an American Eagle symbol added yet another opportunity for the house to win it all.8. Slot Machines Used to Actually Dispense Fruit-Flavored Chewing Gum.        Ever wonder why slot machines have little pictures of fruit on the wheels? It's because early 1880s-era slot machines would actually dispense fruit-flavored gum. The machines also dispensed tokens meant to be exchanged for drinks and cigars before pumping out actual coins in 1888.9. \"Craps\" Comes from \"Crabs\".        Why is the popular North American casino dice game Craps called Craps? It's a simple equation: language + time = bonkers. Historians think it all started with an old British dice game called Hazard (such a better name). In Hazard, rolling \"snake eyes\" was called rolling \"crabs\" (for some reason). French settlers in New Orleans in the mid-1700s kept Hazard alive, but over time, the combination of French and English-speaking players and changes to the game's rules slowly turned \"crabs\" into \"craps\" (for some reason) and a whole new game was born, eventually leaving Hazard nothing but a distant memory. Viva le Craps!10. The World's Smallest Casino Is in the Back of a London Cab.         The alleged \"World's Smallest Casino\" doesn't even have an address. The Grosvenor Casino in London has a mobile casino in the back of a cab, complete with a gaming table, dealer, bar, and a TV showing sports. The promotional stunt lets riders go anywhere in the city as long as they make a charitable donation... or they can go straight to the casino, free of charge.11. The Numbers on a Roulette Wheel Add Up to 666.          Gambling and superstition go hand-in-hand, so it's not surprising that some mystical properties have been assigned to some popular casino games. The biblical \"Number of the Beast\" makes an appearance in every casino with a roulette wheel: if you add up all the numbers on the wheel, you get 666! The coincidence, coupled with gambling's knack for ruining lives, has earned the roulette wheel the nickname \"The Devil's Wheel.\"12. Citizens of Monaco Can't Gamble at the Monte Carlo Casino.          The infamous Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco is a gambler's paradise... as long as you're not actually from Monaco. In that case, you best go elsewhere: Princess Caroline made it illegal for citizens to gamble in the casino in the mid-1800s, insisting that the revenue generated come only from foreigners. The good news? Citizens don't have to pay income taxes since Monaco uses the casino money instead.13. Las Vegas Is Not the Gambling Capital of the World.         The city of Macau is the only Chinese territory where it is legal to gamble in a casino... and it also happens to be the world's largest gambling city. Forget Vegas: Macau's casino revenues beat Vegas's five times over in 2012. Unlike Vegas, which makes most of its money in penny slots, most of the money generated in Macau (75 percent!) comes from high rollers making huge bets at table games in V.I.P. rooms.14. Casinos Are Illegal in Japan (But There's a Loophole).         The Japanese have devised a loophole to allow gamblers to get their fix: while casinos are illegal in the country, Pachinko parlors are not. Pachinko is a slot machine-like game that earns players little silver balls. The balls can be traded for alcohol, toys, or other prizes ... but you can also ask for \"special prize\" tokens. These tokens can be redeemed at separate, state-regulated shops for cash, thus enabling gamblers to earn money in a country that technically forbids gambling.There are actually 25 of this facts from the source HERE, but unfortunately, this is the much I can list here, to find out the rest of the facts, please visit the source website, link above and below.Source: https://www.ranker.comQuestion:which of this casinos and gambling facts do you find most funny, amazing or surprising?

Here it is, the Casino can play a role in changing fortune? whereas he luckily won on his gambling activity and used it to invest on his company, FedEx.Anyways, I have either read or watch something about number 4 which is about \"Some Gambling Addicts Pee All Over the Gaming Floor\" somewhere and it is kinda reasonable especially there are some casinos that are hard to get a sit on a table. They do this to avoid getting out of their place as it is hard to get back in. Some of them used water bottles to pee however some don't which resulted them peeing all over the place. About number 5 which is about \"You Can Voluntarily Ban Yourself from a Casino\", I kinda knew about this based from the movies I've watched but luckily I haven't been able to try it and even consider it.11.

The founder of FedEx could have re-rolled that money on to his dying company but he went all in and just hoped for the best. Perhaps this is the reason why a lot of people are trying to go all in on casinos when they are extremely down on their luck. I would not recommend doing anything of that thing just to save you from your finances, but I'm pretty sure a lot of us here are having an itch to get that kind of luck like the FedEx founder.",

I only wonder what spirit may have gotten into him to give him such courage. Or did he somehow rig the game or saw in a vision that he would win? I can only imaging. Still, it is not a story advising persons to take such extreme risks when it comes to gambling or investment. One should only take the risk he is willing to afford.Secondly, the sandwich story seemed kinda funny because I and some friends in some instances during a betting game can eat or drink whatever concoction, all because no one wants to avoid the moment.Thirdly, I find the fact about the world's smallest casino in the back of a taxi intelligently creative. The PR it must have gotten at the time would have been massive I guess.Lastly, from my early days till now, I never knew Macau is the world's largest gambling city. I used to think it was Las Vegas. This was insightful. Thanks OP for the interesting read.",

Some Gambling Addicts Pee All Over the Gaming Floor.        Some gamblers simply take things too far: addiction counselors say that some problem gamblers are so impaired by their addiction that they simply urinate all over themselves or wear adult diapers rather than step away from the table or slot machine. For instance, in Indiana in 2007, a gambler filed a complaint with the state's Gaming Commission after he sat in a pee-soaked chair at a slot machine. And in 2015, a New Jersey man urinated into a slot machine's coin slot rather than leave the gaming floor.What? That is disgusting and quite unexpected, you are telling that if I manage to save money and visit Las Vegas someday with my family and decide to visit a world class famous casino there is a slight possibility I sit down onto an urine soaked chair?! I wonder what is the punishment if anyone gets caught after defacing one of those expensive chairs I also wonder how often the personnel is supposed to check manually for urine soaked chairs!Honestly, I thank you for this information from now on, Ill always check before I sitting down in a public gambling place.",
