The world’s largest retailer has offered pay-by-bank through Walmart Pay since earlier this year. Until now, the transactions were akin to digital checks and took roughly three days to finalize when being processed through The Automated Clearing House, the same network often used for bill payments or paycheck deposits. Soon, customers opting for pay-by-bank transactions will see the purchase reflected in their bank account balance instantly – and Walmart will receive the funds immediately.nothing beats instant not even bitcoin...and not only instant but instantly in your bank account so you can actually use the money. unlike bitcoin where you have to sell it to usd paying a fee then put in a withdrawal with some 3rd party and wait days to see if they send it to you or not.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on September 21, 2024, 11:39:46 AMWalmart customers will soon have the option, just as Revolut clients already have the option to transfer money to other Revolut accounts with no transaction fee. what are you even talking about?  QuoteStill nothing beats transaction settlement within 10 minutes, peer-to-peer, privately, permissionessly and cheaply. enjoy HODLING then. that's about all you can do with it.",

      "body": "The news sounds a bit more about Walmart cutting out credit-card middlemen, rather than rejecting Bitcoin as payments, and maybe other new kinds of payments altogether. Instead, the new system allows customers to pay directly from their bank accounts, reducing the processing fees that Walmart faces and bypassing some of the delays associated with older systems like ACH. That, though, does not make Bitcoin irrelevant at all. Bitcoin is much more relevant in cases where current systems are slow and expensive, such as global transactions and remittances.Interesting how Walmart's focus is on bank transfers in almost real-time, reflecting Walmart's goal of smoothing the online payment process. Meanwhile, Bitcoin still serves a role in less-serviced or slower markets than those in the US. While that is quite true, Bitcoin does have proven utility in sectors outside major retail, particularly in cross-border payments. So it's not \"dead,\" just playing another game.",

That's what business do they step in and fill a need. That's how the world works Just to add I CANT IMAGINE a money transfer svc being slower than bitcoin. Sender had to send usd to an exchange could take several business days then the receiver has to cash out from some CEX could take several business days.

It's purpose is clearly written in it's whitepaper and Bitcoin does job very well. You can make a transaction without the help of 3rd party, it's still P2P.Yes, time has passed and modern problems need modern solutions but Bitcoin sticks with its original plan and purpose, that's all but it doesn't mean that this coin is about to die.
