According to estimates, initial damages could exceed $114 million.Justin Sun has confirmed that the Poloniex  was hacked and that they are investigating. To reassure users, Sun said the exchange has quite good financial potential and will refund the entire amount to affected users. At the same time, Sun also mentioned cooperating with other organizations or exchanges to prevent the flow of money and reduce the loss rate as much as possible. Poloniex currently states that its wallet has been disabled for maintenance and will update the information once the wallet is reactivated.https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1722942733680296246Quote from: ShinyStarPrincess on November 10, 2023, 02:13:49 PMTopic Security Breach and Protection Layers. Do you think that Exchanges and DeFI need more development and investments here or is this just something we have to lay down our heads and deal with?This is something we do not want to happen, but this problem will never stop, vulnerabilities are exploited and risks arise during use. But have no fear, as we are here to find what we hope it fulfills, this case will also be resolved and victims compensated for Poloniex's reputation. However, it is also a lesson for other users about managing their own assets.",

This happened due to a low security network of Poloniex. Probably they need to have more security protocols and not only them but a lot of exchange like Binance Kucoin, which is targeted by hackers. Obviously this is not new but considering the news it will have a great impact on market situation.",

I have always ask this question; tho, not on this platform, that \" what are some exchanges doing right (Bitget, Kraken, MEXC and a few others) to stay free of these security exploit incidence? can't other exchanges collaborate with some of these exchanges to strengthen there security? Despite the fact that I also feel collaboration and more investment in security could be the way forward,  white hat bonus payment should also be discouraged cos it's one of the reasons hacking have become a tradition in this crypto space.",

It is a well known exchange but not as big as binance or coinbase so i am not expecting a big impact on the overall market. But after so much positive news and mini altseason for the past few days a incedient like this can be a warning for those who think bull season has started. Many think it will heavily impact Justin Sun and the tron network but as i can see he is the owner of lots of other projects in the tron ecosystem and tron is also one of the biggest networks in TVL. So it is just a matter of time for justin sun to recover from this loss. We need to see how quickly he can manage to relaunch the exchange again.",

Do you think that Exchanges and DeFI need more development and investments here or is this just something we have to lay down our heads and deal with?Not the best time to happen but at least Poloniex assured its users that they will reimburse users that are affected, actually the 5% whitehat bug bounty is specifically for the hackers just to return the funds they are not looking for white hat hackers, if hackers is good in making that fund untraceable I don't think he will take a bite on that 5% but if he wants to keep it safe he might send back the funds and keep the 5% bug bounty.Offering bug bounty exchanges just encourages hacking but what if hackers offer a deal of 15% or even higher will Poloniex take the deal, we will see in the coming days if hackers agree to take the 5% bounty and return the fund or challenge the authority to chase them and prosecute them.",

Do you think that Exchanges and DeFI need more development and investments here or is this just something we have to lay down our heads and deal with?Yes, due to the nature of their centralization process, they need regulation to force themselves to invest more in security. Besides hacks, transparency and accountability of the exchange funds are also worth considering, noting the FTX issues. But specifically about security, yes, since they handle users' money, they should take security as the main priority.

I mean I have some contacts in some CEX and I search often on CryptoJobList and Ethical hackers are not searched. A good example is a fellow Argentinean who found a massive breach on Curve and he retrieved the money back (Thankfully). The reserves Aspect is another important aspect, If I want to invest heavily in a CEX I look at how much is on BTC and Stablecoins (I know stable coins are not a guarantee of safeness or transparency but in a crash they are not that critically affected.... if the project or team behind it is honest)",
