Most of the news coming from Ukraine and Russia is mainly propaganda to favor their actions. During wars any kind of illegal and heartless trade such as cannibalism, harvesting of human organs, and child sale/ molestation are promoted, hence I don't doubt the occurrence of such activities in Ukraine. But I doubt the authenticity of this video. This is because it is based on a testimony of an unverified individual without further investigation. This video is targeted at misinforming the people and pushing for the reduction of the support Ukraine receives from other nations. This is because the video keeps stressing the need for less support for Ukraine because of the video. Also, the website sense.com is well-known for promoting conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic content. And connecting this children's organ trade to Israel is proof of the website's dislike for Israel. My points might be wrong but more concrete proofs about this news are needed to determine if it is true or false.",

More specifically, it is a fictional drug from the novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S Thompson and popularised by the 1998 movie adaptation, which later formed the basis of certain conspiracy theories by people who are tragically unable to distinguish fiction from reality (or, more likely, find it useful to recruit and exploit such people). As BADecker is one of those tragic cases, I strongly advise you to place him on Ignore.",

It has also caught my attention how well the blood extraction part of the procedure fits the old theories associating the jewish people with the sacrifice and extraction of blood out of young christian victims, for ritual purposes. It may not be a coincidence that such themes have appeared these lastest years.On ignoring BaDecker, I would not go that far yet because I personally try not to ignore people, regardless of their political opinions or personal oponions. Being the exception those who outright call for death and violence on those who disagree on their political standings.",

      "body": "I ignore BADecker a lot. That's how I find so much good stuff to talk about in the forum.Regarding Adrenochrome, searching on it gives all kinds of contradicting information. However, there are a bunch of different websites that start out with the words \"Fact Check:\" in the searches. And it seems that the wording in all these \"Fact Check\" sites is very similar, and speaks in the direction that Adrenochrome stories are hoaxes and fake.The point is that when you get a bunch of sites that use the same starting format - Fact Check: - and say the same thing basically, that there is a promoter behind them all who has an agenda. So, it makes sense to fact-chect these \"Fact Check:\" sites to see if they are really stating factual things, or if they are simply agenda oriented.Often our personal opinion about something is driven by what we want to believe, rather than the truth.EDIT: In addition, when we voice complaints about a commenter who simply brings info to light, and claim that the commenter is 'bad' for doing this, or that the commenter necessarily believes what is written in the info he shows, the info must be personally affecting the mind of the complainants. Perhaps the complainants are against the idea of hearing about news... because they have something to hide?",
