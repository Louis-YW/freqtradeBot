Because not all the time you get some rewards from bounties because right now almost all of them are unreliable and not paying like how they used to be in 2018. Back then, you always come across some successful stories after they hit the jackpot of joining the right bounties which changed their life positively forever because the rewards they got were huge.",

Everybody's seen others succeed and wondered, \"Why not me?\" What works for one individual may not work for another, and vice versa.Getting caught up in the excitement is simple. Earning what you'd make in a year in a month would tempt everyone. Your problem is that if everyone was making a fortune in crypto trading, we'd all be millionaires.Therefore, stick to what you know and keep studying. Despite the appeal of crypto trading, why not stay to bounty hunting if it makes you money? That perfect spot between risk and reward is key. Remember that playing it safe is okay, especially when you have bills. Hope you succeed!",

The answer is always the same, nothing, they do nothing to achieve their dreams so it is not surprising they are not an inch closer to reach them than they were years ago, so it is important to work hard towards our dreams, and even if they seem to be far away, it will surprise you how soon you can reach them as long as you are constant on your efforts.",

The thing which reflect into my mind on the spot that these kinda people really think success will come into their feets with getting into  mud or paying off any struggle for that and still they hope to become successful. Then I be like Whats that rubbish.In my prospect every stage wants sacrifice and struggle to achieve so that the person who is trying hard to achieve that goal or stage really deserve it to be own at the end of the day.",

Truly hard work pays only if we are always ready to take decisions that may not be comfortable to us now but would be very good to us later. There is need for us to think carefully before we make any decisions because this will be a gate way for us when the time comes. One of the things I have learnt about life is for us to always make sure that we don't complain too much. We should learn the habit of learning at any time or any day. If we make sure that we learn then soon, what we have learnt will make a way for us to prosper and reach the limit we have been longing to reach.",

Sure, hard work made it possible to earn from it, but luck on the other hand can introduce to you various opportunities, so really, they just go hand in hand. Hard work makes it so that opportunities you get are not lost, and luck is that factor that can make said hardwork (or anything you do) noticeable to something (or you notice something instead) kind of thing. Trading involves more on the luck side imo, hard work can only get you to about breaking even imo, minimizing loss, and stuff like that. Even when you work hard to analyze the market, it's not exactly a guarantee that things will go the way you expect it to be after all.",
