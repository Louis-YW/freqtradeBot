  "content": "I have been battling with this thought in my head since yesterday after I came across this topic (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5533144.msg65099774#msg65099774) and that was the reason I decided to raise this discussion. From my previous comments about mixers, you guys will noticed that I am not against mixer, I know that it helps to increase privacy for Bitcoin holders that wants more privacy in their Bitcoin output/input source. Bitcoin mixers was specifically developed for a good course but as can see, even with the intention of good course, bad actors will definitely utilize every tool they see as an opportunity for them. Because of the stolen funds that have been cleared with Bitcoin mixers, that's why some people especially the government, have blacklisted mixers. But question regarding my thoughts yesterday is that, do you guys sincerely think that mixers are bad and should not exist? How about if you were a victim that lost a lump sum of Bitcoin and it got mixed and you couldn't track the coin anymore, would it cause you to hate mixer? I don't want to get misunderstood here, but I was just thinking that since am not against mixers and I don't feel bad about its existence apart from the fact that scammers are using it, what if I became a victim and lost my coins to thieves and they mixed the coins on Bitcoin mixer, at that situation, I don't really know how I will feel about mixers. Drop your Opinion.",

      "body": "Is bitcoin bad? Or should it not exist? You should also ask yourself this question since many also regard bitcoin as a perfect payment system for illicit transactions; they have labeled bitcoin as the most used by bad actors and those who have something to hide.There will always be an abuse in almost everything that is created for good, but just because a few or many are using a particular tool to commit crimes does not make the tool unworthy to serve the good purpose it's designed for; a mixer is good and should exist. If everything that could be used to launder money and sponsor illicit activities should be banned and not exist, then the fiat system should also not be spared. We all know where the big money laundering and terrorist-sponsored transactions always pass through long before crypto even comes into play. Bad actors have been operating, and Bitcoin and mixers just happen to fall into the wrong part where authorities have to use every bit of an excuse to condemn it. existence.",

You know reputation implies about bad and good things from mixers, how governments and communities think of mixers.Quote But question regarding my thoughts yesterday is that, do you guys sincerely think that mixers are bad and should not exist? Good or bad, it's just fine and there is nothing absolutely good or bad, and nothing is only used by community for good or bad practice. There are always black and white, good and bad and mixers serve both.Existence?They will continue to exist, one closed, seized, shut down, others will be launched.I suggest you to lock this thread and move your discussion to that thread.",

And just like this analogy applies to mixers, it also applies to cash, bitcoin, nuclear energy, and countless other things. But if your government prohibits it, we have no choice but to follow the law if we are not willing to face possible consequences.",

      "body": "My opinion: Mixers are necessary and using them should be a human right, because the Bitcoin blockchain is publicly available for anyone and mixing is one of the few methods (others being CoinJoins, for example) to ensure privacy and censorship resistance, and prevent extortion and identity theft based on chain analysis. If your addresses are exposed by someone, you otherwise could have a bad time.However, I would actually like to see mixers develop some strategies to be able to deal with thefts, hacks and other criminal activities without having to resort to KYC. I have started a thread several months ago with some ideas about a possible \"Gentlemen's agreement\" among mixers, who could, without harming privacy, create some mechanisms to freeze certain funds temporarily.Quote from: notocactus on February 26, 2025, 06:06:59 PMI see this topic is not necessary while there is another previous thread for discussion about mixers and their reputation. I think it is actually a different question. The linked thread talks about the reputation of mixers for the general public, while here the thread starter asks us for our personal opinion. Of course it's a related question though.",

If you're talking about privacy, then it's not something bad for us to have it because that is the reason for bitcoin network, but talking about mixers repeatedly after knowing that anything that has to do with them has being stopped from this end, I think it's not a good idea raining more discussions or talks on mixers except the government shifts their stand on it use or approach they have given, just know this that mixers being banned on this forum remained valid until any further changes which I believe theymos would communicate on that, but for now, we should talk less of mixers because the forum doesn't want to have anything linking to them for now, go after your privacy and I believe mixers are not the only means to that.",

When did the \"Mrbluntzy\" account come to be under your control? How many accounts are you controlling?How about you drop your opinion about this: I great you all, I am so happy today I found my account again. I often try to get back to my account after I created it but got admitted into the university, so I didn't bother looking for my account anymore because my first year in school was so stressful, I was just going through my old stuffs Last weekend, then I found my longin details in my old diary.",

I don't think I might have to  hate mixers because of this. It is just like if I lost my fiat currency weather it got stolen from my bank directly or as cash or any other way, this doesn't mean I will hate all bank or that particular one except they were at fault and all these are when it is unfortunate to trace the missing fiat. And this is similarly possible in fiat, there are ways criminals can still be able to cover their traces on fiat especially when the fiat are in cash i.e physical form. This just also showed there are chances of this happening in our fiat currency and we likely won't hate it and so seeing it from this angle also helps to see that fiat currencies and digital currencies like bitcoin can be used by criminals and mixers is just one ways they could do this but we just can't let the cons overshadow the good part of it.",

But nobody can say these businesses are bad and should not exist because that is not their utility. It is the same with bitcoin mixers. When blockchain analysis companies came to existence with the sole objective of invading people's privacy and to surveil, obviously there should be a tool to counter them which is when mixers come in to provide people with that additional privacy.Because of the nature of mixers (similar to nature of cash intensive businesses) they will also be used by criminals, which is unfortunate but we can't do anything about it.",

Definitely, but the government sees mixers as a tool for criminals, mainly because their biggest concern is money laundering. Since mixers aren’t regulated, it becomes easier for people to launder funds without oversight.But if you think about it, banks would have the same issue if there were no anti-money laundering regulations, it would be just as easy to launder money through them. The problem is that because of government crackdowns, even those using mixers for legitimate privacy reasons are affected. In the end, regulators see mixers as more harmful than beneficial, believing that the \"bad\" use cases outweigh the good ones.",
