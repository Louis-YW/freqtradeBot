      "body": "P2P exchange is the only option that you can buy without any problem and no KYC is required but the rate depends on the seller and the withdrawal fees are a bit high. Sample Bisq exchange where you can able to buy fiat to Bitcoin the withdrawal fee is around 0.0003 which is around $6 with the current Bitcoin price. If you don't care about the withdrawal fee then you can use the Bisq exchange or if you are looking for a list of P2P sites you can check this https://kycnot.me/",

      "body": "Use p2p exchanges to buy coins directly with your trading partner using your bank account, and then you can transfer that to Bitget. We have quite a number of them, both noncustodial and custodial.Since you are leaning to Litecoin. Localcryptos supports Litecoin trades. No headache to verify for KYCCertain exchanges such as Kucoin, bybit, Okx, Binance have custodial p2p services, but you will have to first undergo KYC verification.Bitget also has a p2p platform - https://www.bitget.com/p2p-trade.",

      "body": "I don't know what bitget is, but i think it is a trading platform you are talking about. Based on your post, I guess you want to add $40 into your trading account and start trading but your transaction is getting rejected by the bank or something? So you are going to buy from another exchange and transfer funds here? I guess you can do it without any issue. I doubt they would hold your withdrawal for few days (but they do in some cases when interacting with fiat). So like others suggested, P2P is the best options.You exchange it to XLM or XRP to send it instantly.",

If you still need to do it, I would recommend Kucoin p2p trade where withdrawing a small amount will not require KYC and there is no need to wait for your assets to rest.",
