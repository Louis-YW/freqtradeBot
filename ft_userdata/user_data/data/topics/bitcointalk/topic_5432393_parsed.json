Even more so is the amount that can come back to you every day.Then the 2$ per hour is also a big deal and 20% cashback is also a really big deal, mate.",

Even if they don't, the best the buyer can hope for is to get back their money + whatever they could gain from bonuses after buying it. If there are checks for change of IP address and whatnot, then it's definitely not worth taking the chance.",

In my opinion, there is nothing wrong selling your account even if you say you are an honest seller but selling accounts in bitcointalk forum is not allowed. Well, they can create their own account with their own KYC information if KYC is necessary and also safe from being reported stolen as sold accounts can be reported to the site where the account id registered as stolen or hacked account and the buyer can't do anything at all. I would say your account doesn't have value for other people or the buyer of the account and only to yourself that it has a value since you know or can say that you have spent decent amount of money using your account. Once again, your account does have value as far as I can say but it's value might be nothing if it is sold since if there's a buyer then that person may ask to bargain price. Good luck.",

I really didn't get what you are trying to say. Which of your account are you talking about? Is it this forum account or your casino account? Please be specific and precise. The way I understand your point is all about your casino account which you are planning to sell. And if that is the truth then it is impossible because your KYC will be different from the buyer's details.",

You risk losing your money by buying other people's accounts.He can just simply post a sale thread on the marketplace if his goal is to sell his account here. I think he is asking honestly a proper valuation of his account or if it’s possible to sell. It’s normal for a non forum member that playing on one of casino that has ANN thread here to create a new account if they want to ask a casino related topics since Bitcointalk is the most active forum to discuss this matter.Answering OP. Selling of the account is strictly prohibited by the casino. Your account has no value considering it’s illegal to sell because all its benefits will be forfeited once the ownership is transferred.",

You should be aware of that. Also, for those who are interested, you should keep that in mind.

As far as I know, you can only be continuously eligible for bonuses if you play and meet the minimum requirements.",

The account is surely already undergo KYC in the past before when he reach the higher tier level. Other concerns on this kind of account was the benefits usually being removed when the account doesn’t play anymore with its normal wager volume when he reach that VIP level.Casino will obviously freeze or block the account as per terms if they feel that the user is not profitable for them casino is not a charity while this kind of passive daily bonus will surely noticed by the casino security team.
