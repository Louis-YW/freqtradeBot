You have to understand that the transfer fee of Bitcoin is very high as compared to other *Altcoins* who have a much lower transfer fee which means the users might save a lot if they are super frequent with gambling as well. I think other that that you must find better sites to actually get into as well. There are certain sites which can give you better options than the site you mentioned is not looking safe and you can also refer to BTCGOSU for further information about the current sites and you can also try playing on the sites which are using tokens perse. There are a lot of places that you can find using ETH but there won't be conversion possible.",

It's probably the most successful industry really in terms of considering how Crypto is used as a medium of payment, compared to others that are close to non-existent. There's also the matter that compared to other industries, casinos are the only ones (afaik) that has pretty much created a separate industry for crypto, e.g. crypto casinos and fiat casinos. It wouldn't be odd then to see crypto usage in casinos to grow because of that.",

You make it sound like it's difficult to gamble with fiat. It isn't. Fiat casinos and sportsbooks have been around much longer than crypto casinos and they work just the way they are supposed to. I have started gambling on sports before I got interested in Bitcoin and I still do it. I actually prefer losing fiat than BTC, so I play more on traditional platforms. I wager Bitcoins on the things I consider safe bets.  Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on May 10, 2022, 07:07:54 PMCrypto has made online transactions very easy, most especially in gambling...
