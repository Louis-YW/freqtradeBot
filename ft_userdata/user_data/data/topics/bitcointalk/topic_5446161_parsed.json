If you want to be using your device to connect to a hardware wallet, you need to have safety practice to avoid malware, like the use of ad blocker like ublock origin, not clicking on ads and also not visiting just any site, visit the legit ones with the correct URL.",

That is why it is best to connect only on your own laptop or PC, and if ever you see that your antivirus detected something, it is best to reinstall the OS rather than treat only with scanning using antivirus.",

Not until you have completely wiped the system, just as Charles-Tim have recommended.If you have important files on that laptop, then you have to look for an external hard drive and backup your files, then completely install a new OS. When installing the new OS, make sure you get it from a direct dealer who is licensed to sell them. Their are lots of infected OS out their which when you install it you can also be affect by clipboard virus which are hardly detected by anti virus.",

What and what can someone do next to be able to operate the hardware wallet on the Laptop. It all depends what type of hardware wallet you are using and what software wallet is connected with your device to make transactions.Virus can't infect your hardware wallet from computer, but there is a chance keylogger can detect what you are typing on keyboard and use that to collect information they can use against you.For example, Trezor One hardware wallet must use computer keyboard for certain operations, and that could potentially expose passphrases or pins.That is one of the reasons I won't suggest anyone to buy Trezor, but any closed source hardware wallet can be even worse black box.My suggestion is to use dedicated laptop with LinuxOS (best if offline)and use it only for crypto, that way you have minimal chances of infecting anything.Most viruses are made for wInd0ws OS, that is why I recommend everyone to switch to some Linux distribution like Fedora, Debian or Mint for beginners.",

      "body": "In theory, the worst case scenario while using an infected computer with a hardware wallet, it would be the attacker getting information like: the brand of your wallet, a list of your derivation paths, probably your master public keys, passphrases and if the malware is specialized, it could try to swap your address if your copy-paste it, with an attacker's address. But if you can check the address on the display of your HW, it would be a problem easy to counter.the Bitcoins would be safe, but the attacker may have enough information about your wallet to try to fish you in other ways (if he believes your holdings are worth the effort).If would move my funds to a new wallet as soon as I realized there was a virus on my PC, though. And also notify the exchanges I have interacted with, so they would provide me with new deposit addresses.",

Maybe your AV detected some ad trackers. Those won't cause you any loss of your crypto. On the other hand, maybe it's something much more serious, like a keylogger. As dkbit98, mentioned, you can't enter your PIN or a passphrase on a Trezor One. You have to use the Trezor Suite for that. A keylogger tracking your keyboard entries and recording your screen could be a real danger because of that. On the other hand, if you use a Trezor T or a Ledger device, than the mentioned entries are done on the hardware wallet itself. The keylogger wouldn't have any data to log. Unless you have saved your PIN/seed/passphrase somewhere digitally, and you are opening that file. But that's something you shouldn't be doing anyways.",

There may also be less attack on Linux. Also that Windows is close source while Linux is open source. But if used offline and correctly, malware will not be able to penetrate any device. Also malware have a mean of infecting any devices, someone can be expert enough to know the source like ads, fake URL and many others to avoid malware installation. You are correct that Linux is better, because it is open source, but if online security and safety is taken for granted, such person should not be surprised if his device is infected and his wallet compromised. But Linux users are not as many as Windows users, making Linux malware to be less numberous. And also most of the people that are using Linux are securities conscious.Quote from: Pmalek on March 25, 2023, 10:44:06 AMNot all viruses are the same and can't cause the same harm to your device and software.

Antivirus companies today's makes people to think that anything infecting devices are viruses, but they are malware. Viruses infection today are not more than 20% while hackers have seen malware like Trojan, Rootkit, some others and in combination to be more useful. Viruses do not do more than interrupting device functioning, making it to become slow, hot or not working at as it supposed to.",

Usually computer viruses have target's to the system, if it's out there looking for text files or setups that will be it's target and if the hardware wallet does have such files then it will be infected but again this is rare as not so many people have invested in these kind of wallets .Quote from: Z390 on March 24, 2023, 01:06:55 PMWhat and what can someone do next to be able to operate the hardware wallet on the Laptop. The problem is on your PC and your best solution is to get the PC cleaned/disinfected and this should be done with a genuine antivirus not the cracked softwares as these could be the source of the problem, and also run your Malwarebytes as it's one of those reliable antiviruses that kick a**...Once all this is done you could choose to reset your wallet too provided you have a backup and you should be safe going forward.But in the first place why plug in your hardware wallet into an infected PC when you can avoid the risk",

We know about this bug ONLY because this is open source software.In case of ledger and other closed source devices this could happen 100 times and we would never hear anything about this because of signed NDA's.OneKey so far mostly copied work from Trezor, but they recently started to move their own direction, they released new software wallet, and it was expected for bugs to happen.I recently listened one OneKey Classic review and interview with OneKey team member,  so it's not a bad ide to spend some time to watch this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfk4POv9wKk",

True, but what you don't see, you also don't know. The good and the bad. The biggest advantage of open-source is also its greatest weakness depending on who is looking at the code. If this was a more popular open-source product, like Trezor, maybe someone with nastier motives could have noticed what was going on. At the same time, maybe it would have been discovered earlier. \"its\" and \"when's\". It still requires physical access to a faulty device, which shouldn't be overlooked and significantly limits the attack options.",
