The price a few days back was wildly crazy as I was that transaction were posted on a staggering 200-210statoshi per fee and now after all the hurdles the price is currently down to a very low 17-34 stats, so what you said is notable because you can actually check to follow up to actually know when it's good to do your transaction to avoid high fee charges.",

If the fee can drop down like this and keep on going down then it will be a good thing for those who use bitcoin for payment on a daily basis, back then when the fee pump high like this did few months to the end of last year the fee after some time drop back down on its own but this last experience took longer than the previous one and I just hope we this one last a little bit longer and just the ordinals going for break of any kind.",

Some Bitcoiners, mostly new investors, and also those that were spending just a small fraction of Bitcoin, could not actually bear the high transaction fee.Some people used the lighting network to overcome the high fee, while those who don't have the LN, like myself, surfer the high transaction fee, and it almost led me to take the decision to not accept Bitcoin payments in my shop because customers were not ready to cover the fees. It's a good thing that the fee has reduced; it has also been an experience for some new Bitcoin investors. At least if this kind of high fee issue arises anytime in the future, they will know it's temporary and will not give ears to FUD.",

Changing Bitcoin fees is an obstacle to real adoption. We are unable to use Bitcoin as a payment method when fees increase. We can't wait to see when fees will be reduced and then make the transaction. For investors, fees won't be a factor; they will make transactions when fees are reasonable. But the real Bitcoin goal is to create a global payment solution without centralised involvement, where we are failing due to high fees. I tried a week ago to make a payment to Namechap, where I needed $17 in transaction fees to transfer $50. So it's clearly unrealistic and an obstacle to real adoption.",

Looking at some of the few past blocks mined I didn’t see smaller transaction amounts like dust amounts which signifies that the ordinals and inscriptions users that have been disturbing us have reduce their mass transaction for now. Probably everything is going to be this way again until maybe after halving before we start seeing movement again because I believe they have just stopped to hodl for the future bull run after that we will see their transactions again.

I don’t think miners didn’t enjoy it",

I am sure you know that if you are transferring small amount of btc then almost all or even almost half will only be used for transaction fee if the fee is high that's why it's better to wait for the transaction fee to decrease before sending your btc.",

Changing Bitcoin fees is an obstacle to real adoption.  I totally agree with you. the recent change in Bitcoin fees is really impacting its adoption in various ways. Even though it has temporarily reduced, we don't know how long it will stay that way. The root causes behind the initial increase in transaction fees haven't been resolved yet, so the reduction might be short-lived and could go back up unexpectedly.During the period of high fees, many small investors might have felt frustrated and turned to investing in other cryptocurrencies instead of Bitcoin. Some businesses that previously accepted Bitcoin may have switched to alternative payment methods. This surely affects the adoption rate. A friend of mine who was eager to invest in Bitcoin last year got discouraged when he learned about the high transaction fees. He decided to wait until they came down. But do you think he'll invest the same amount he initially planned?",

We also must understand that there will be more transactions lately because people are preparing their Bitcoin assets toward the Bitcoin halving and bullrun season.Exactly the thing about bitcoin transaction fees is that they can change every day based on the situation, so it's exactly right that before you transact, you will check the transaction fee. You can use this link Bitcoin Average Transaction Fee to check the current transaction fee. its better to do transaction with a large amount than frequent transaction, its a common sense every transaction you do you will need to pay the fee then its more practical to do one big transaction. If it's not urgent, then do this strategy, but if it is urgent, then you have no choice. You can use Light Network, but it's not practical to do LN if it's only for a specific person because you need to spend money to fund and open an LN channel. Anyway, it's up to you how you will deal with the transaction fee. You can choose to wait or to bear the fee.",

Transaction fees might have dropped now but will someone have to wait until the price is reduced before carrying out a transaction? Some persons use Bitcoin to make payments for business transactions and such delay could hamper the smooth running of the firm. I have also observed that transaction fees also reduce during certain hours of the day. Observing the timing of the transaction fees in the mempool to identify favourable hours might also be beneficial. But I know that Bitcoin will gain more adoption if the spamming of the network by these ordinal inscriptions is put to check.
