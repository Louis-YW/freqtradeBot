There wouldn't be as much of a need for him to continue to develop it as an existential money problem, because there are many torch-bearers who can do a better job.If Satoshi were alive today and not enjoying retirement, I doubt he would be interested in cryptocurrencies full-time but aim to address greater existential challenges using decentralisation. I'd think he would enjoy working with nostr, a decentralised social network that uses bitcoin cryptography methods. There are many social challenges that can be addressed with decentralised technologies like this. For example, standard political voting should incorporate cryptographic verification features, and yet I've not yet seen a solution implemented, which is an opportunity lost.",

The protocol is open-source allowing anyone to develop it further, build upon it, and perhaps suggest better features when they become available. Satoshi didn't create SegWit and he didn't create the Lightning Network, but they still exist and we use them. Isn't that what open-source is supposed to be about? Constant growth and development. I'm sure he knew that others would mimic his creation and build their own coins and blockchains. But I don't think he expected they would stray so far away from the initial ideas and the pillars of what Bitcoin is. I think he would have been proud and happy if Bitcoin was the starting point to an even better digital asset of the future. Instead, it's used as the foundation to create centralized and trust-requiring solutions that are more restrictive and not censorship-resistant.",

Exactly, because what else could a person say when he saw that people are constantly looking for a replacement for Bitcoin, and everything that was created after Bitcoin is completely contrary to his idea. However, someone as intelligent as him would surely understand what motivates people to invest in altcoins, although at the same time they know that behind all these projects there are people who put profit first.You see, even the OP thinks that some of these projects have something big and significant in their future development projections, and after E moved to POS, no one realized how much that project went backwards, even though it was never of any real value.",

Centralized doesn't always mean bad. Bitcoin has many flaws as well. But it is still enjoying the highest popularity just for being the pioneer of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin transactions are slow. it doesn't have smart contract functionality. The block size is small and that's why we are seeing the requirement of having Segwit and LN sorts of addons. To be honest, no cryptocurrency is flawless. All big cryptos have their own strengths and weaknesses. Just because some cryptos are somewhat centralized, doesn't mean they are worthless.

But it is still enjoying the highest popularity just for being the pioneer of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin transactions are slow. it doesn't have smart contract functionality. The block size is small and that's why we are seeing the requirement of having Segwit and LN sorts of addons.The biggest disadvantage of Bitcoin is that it is not adapted to the extent that it is understood by the majority of the population, whose level of financial literacy generally does not go beyond taking out a plastic card from a wallet and remembering a 4-digit PIN. The greatest popularity is based on trust, which is based on decentralization, which is something that no other cryptocurrency has.Regarding the slowness of transactions, if you were a beginner I wouldn't be surprised by such a comment, but if 10 minutes on average is what you call slow, that's quite fast enough for me. Of course for all those who have no idea what fee and mempool are, transactions can be really slow, but that's not a problem that should be blamed on Bitcoin.Quote from: avikz on December 27, 2022, 01:29:38 PMTo be honest, no cryptocurrency is flawless.

It is my main financial reserve and savings for the future. So there's no way I am going to blame bitcoin. But in the real world, we have multiple options available to pay instantly and without any fees (from the sender). Just do research on what IMPS is and then you will understand the level of innovation already available in today's world. Bitcoin will never be able to reach there. Bitcoin is a great reserve currency, but not as great as a method of the local transaction. For cross-border transactions, obviously, bitcoin is way ahead of the mainstream options available. That's exactly what I want to point out - centralized doesn't always mean bad things. In the current era of speed and convenience, bitcoin doesn't stand a chance to become a preferred payment method. It's hard to admit for me as well but that doesn't change the truth!

Every single day, some nonsense tokens are getting listed in the market where people are gambling to get rich.
