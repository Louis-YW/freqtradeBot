But the congestion problem of Bitcoin is my concern, ordinals could add more to that problem than solving it.  I won't mind missing out if ordinals will be one of the biggest gainers in the next bull market, at least there are many other utilities that can still do very well in two years time, I am not ready to risk and thing for ordinals, I prefer Bitcoin.",

This whole Ordinals and BRC-20 staff is not bringing back attention from non-bitcoiners so no help in adoption either. It's just clogging the network with more and more transactions without any real good. NFT market has already started drying down. In next couple of years, it will be vanished. Because nothing good can happen to the society by selling some nonsense pictures over a blockchain. You can check cyberpunk series of NFTs to know what I mean by nonsense.",
