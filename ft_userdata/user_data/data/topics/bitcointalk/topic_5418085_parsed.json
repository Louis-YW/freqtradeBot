But I'm not sure, if the senders address would be visible on Etherscan or not.I haven't used this feature of theirs so, let's wait for someone to confirm it if it doesn't show the senders address. But usually, with internal transfers, since the transaction is happening off chain and Binance pay doesn't requires its users for fees since it's free. I don't think that it will make your address appear from someone since the transaction is internal. Because it will just use an internal transaction number that won't require its appearance on the actual network of the coin that you'll send to the receiver.Quote from: Aztecanaxa on October 23, 2022, 05:31:31 PMOr do you know another way to transfer funds to a fresh wallet address without being traceable or linked to the old wallet address?

I don't want to use Tornado cash or something that could lead to blacklisted wallet address...Exchanges by their nature are not private at all.  Their reason for being is also their greatest flaw.   They can only maintain privacy until they draw too much attention for what ever flavor of reason.   Any gov can just threaten the exchange with jail/violence/heavy tax and they will just roll and pass along the info you thought was private right to the people that prob dont have your best interest at heart.   Its harder to threaten in first world countries but still happens usually by law-fare and regulations so technically legal but ethically/morally not so much.",

Tornado cash is trading in about 5 different exchange if am not mistaken, and Binance has the highest trading volume, since you want to make your wallet anonymous without anyone know who sent and where the token is coming from. All you have to do is create a separate wallet which you have not use before, since your coin is a private wallet, move the Torn token to Binance and trade it to USDT or any stable coin which is you prefer. you can then create an account with  MEXC  after email verification you can move your fund from Binance to MEXC using the Tron blockchain since its cheaper. you can then re-purchase your Tornado using your USDT you sent from Binance, then you can apply for withdrawal into your private wallet. which the record on the blockchain will only show a transaction from MEXC into your new wallet, their will be no other trace to the old wallet where the fund is coming from. I choose MEXC because you can withdraw little amounts without undergoing through the KYC process.",

Although both of them still survive and hasn't been shutdown by U.S., but that's the part where @OP is doesn't want to face in the future. Also centralized mixing service will leave a trace of \"big amount circulation\" which make blockchain analysis is easier to trace his wallet address. That's why I recommend Monero since it doesn't leave any trace if you use Bisq.",

As long as you're use it for good purpose, what are you worried for?You have to choice, either use centralized exchanges who ask your documents which make you uncomfortable or use decentralized exchanges who doesn't ask your documents, but you could receive dirty coins.",

I doubt your funds is as big as those institutions who have large sum in exchange and can move them anytime because of transparency. I don't think you have too many options than to either what is suggested above, use one of the mixers suggested above or use privacy coins.",
