We all know that bitcoin would only continue to be scare as times goes, right now their is no asset that can be more scarce than bitcoin, not even gold and bitcoin offers more than an investment opportunity but also a good store of value.And right now I can see a lot of happy faces as bitcoin reaches a new hight of 51k, I do believe a little correction might occur, but let's not be surprised that all our patients and steady buying might payoff soon as bitcoin can reach a néw ATH of 100k, its still early in the year and who knows what to expect.Just hold and keep patience right by your side.",

      "body": "Yes, patience is key.  Pretty much anyone who has mined or bought bitcoin in the last 15+ years has made a profit - with the exception of a few weeks and those people are close to breakeven.  It has been pretty easy to do well with bitcoin but patience and lack of panic has been the enemy of many.  Another enemy was those who believed the nonsense about it being a scam, tulips, \"rat poison squared\" etc.  I remember reading comments when I first read about it on slashdot saying things like, \"well, I'll just copy the block chain and private keys and double my money.\"  Talk about a whoosh moment of incomprehension (that was July 2010).   Another enemy of many has been inertia and not doing anything. I told people about it at Thanksgiving 2010, and many times thereafter, including tech people and many people did nothing or procrastinated or \"didn't have the money\" to put $50 or $500 into it or the desire or \"time\" to set up a miner (back when CPU and GPU were options).  Pretty much everyone I told could've gotten $50 or $500 quite easily.My advice has been the same all along:  buy or mine some. If you aren't going to use it, then move it to cold storage and leave it.Is it guaranteed?  No, but the binary choice of it being worth a lot or very little increases the likelihood of the \"a lot\" every day and every new use.",

Most of the time you will be tempted to sell even if it is not necessary. But that's how the market continue to flow, if there are not sellers then it's going to be stagnant.So that's how everything, gonna be a cycle, sell make profits, buy in dip, DCA, hold and sell in the bull run for bigger profits.",

But Even though that incident happen still bitcoin manage to climb back and reach above $50k and that means more to come from it as we didn't surpass yet the halving effect. And since bitcoin reach at unexpected figures then that indicate that provably we can see more demands to come that can help bitcoin to get a good pump when halving will take effect.
