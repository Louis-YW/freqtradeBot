So, I do not have much to comment about that. Only the person that gave you the negative trust can remove the negative trust, but might not be removed as she may want to first check your moves as the ban has been lifted already. Post good and contribute nicely on this forum, I believe he would remove the negative trust with time if you do not use your different accounts to act like different users. But I think neutral tag would have been better on both accounts.",
