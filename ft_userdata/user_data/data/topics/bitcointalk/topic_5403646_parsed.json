  "content": "Few days ago I saw one interesting open source device called WiPhone, but wait before you say anything, this is not the regular phone that uses sim cards for calling.This is modular ESP32 device minimal phone that can make high quality free calls using WiFi and VoIP, and price is very affordable in my opinion ($89 - $139).WiPhone can be used as walkie-talkie if someone makes a software for this, but I am much more interested in using it as hardware wallet.This can be modified to work with MicroPython code (Krux DIY wallet is using it), that would make it very similar to Passport hardware wallet.Great thing about WiPhone is that you can open it easy, repair and change any components you want.Using this as a hardware wallet I would remove or disable wifi functionality, and maybe think about installing camera for QR codes.First issue I have with WiPhone is they are located in Hong Kong and there might be some delays with shipping to other parts of the world.Second thing I noticed is the fact they are still using micro USB for charging and firmware updates, it would be much better if they switched to usb type-c connector.There is no encryption currently, but developers are open on adding this in future.Note that developers still didn't release code in public.Specifications:Quote4MB PSRAM16MB FlashESP32 Dual core running at 240 MHz3.5mm audio jackmicroSD slotSize: 120mm x 50mm x 12.5mmWeight: 80g700 mAh Battery, 8 hours talk/1 week standby timeMicroPython for user applicationshttps://www.wiphone.io/",

If you're thinking of using the wifi or Bluetooth parts it might become as secure/insecure as a hot wallet as well (in a worst case scenario).You'll probably be needing a keyboard as well (unless you plan on dumping runnable python code from a computer straight onto it and doing all your inputs to that via a camera or the keypad it comes with).",

(it's a shame they didn't get an arm processor as most hardware wallet's code run off those). You can load other code based on Arduino, but I know few DIY wallets that work perfectly with ESP32 devices like this, so I see no reason why they couldn't work with WiPhone.For example, Krux wallet project works with M5StickV devices that has RISC-V processor, as well as with Maix Bit, Amigo and Maix Dock.Quote from: jackg on June 22, 2022, 03:04:48 PMIf you're thinking of using the wifi or Bluetooth parts it might become as secure/insecure as a hot wallet as well I said I would disable or remove this, if WiPhone would be used as hardware wallet.On side note, there are hardware wallets that have something similar available, ledger X has bluetooth, Coldcard mk4 has NFC, and I don't like it.WiPhone is modular, that means you can change and remove stuff you don't want to have.Quote from: jackg on June 22, 2022, 03:04:48 PMYou'll probably be needing a keyboard as well (unless you plan on dumping runnable python code from a computer straight onto it and doing all your inputs to that via a camera or the keypad it comes with).Keypad is perfectly fine for any purpose, especially for generation that used old style mobile phones for years.",

      "body": "It seems a promising project, but trying to modify it may not be very secure because the device is, in essence, designed to be connected to the Internet, so removing the Wi-Fi card may not solve the problem 100%.It's good that they left out the hardware details, it's a good point and makes the project develop ideas outside of the original developers' design.Overall, the price is good and might be suitable as a side project.",
