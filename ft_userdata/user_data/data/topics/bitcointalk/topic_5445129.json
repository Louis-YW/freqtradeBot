Just use Binance to trade, not for holding your coins.If your friend can wait and doesn't really need the money in hurry, you can suggest him to use Bisq or hodlhodl since it's P2P exchange and there's no way they will halt your withdrawal.",

Another note is that you need to make sure his Binance account is KYC to avoid unnecessary trouble. Binance is still safe for instant transactions, it's just not safe when you use them to store long-term assets. But if the two of you really trust each other, why not do as you think? The two of you can trade with each other since you also have the need to hold bitcoins for the long term.",

It is everyone's right to choose self-custody over cex.

I recommend only exchanging on reputable exchanges because they are less likely to halt transactions suddenly.
