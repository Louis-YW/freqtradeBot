      "body": "BIPs simply means Bitcoin improvement proposals, just like the name there are proposed improvements for bitcoin by the community. This makes it transparent to allow the community to reach a consensus on a certain change. The BIPs you mentioned are derivation paths for wallets to generate addresses Bip44 is use for the derivation of non segwit addresses or legacy addresses using a pay to public key hash (P2PKH) and they usually starts with 1Bip49 is the derivation of compatibility segwit addresses using a pay to script hash (P2SH) and this are addresses that starts with 3 Bip 84 are for the derivation of bech32 addresses or native segwit adress they starts with bc1So most wallets have this three to able to toggle between which addresses to use Read here to have more insight on them",

There is oy one Bitcoin I believe but why different Bips and what's the differences and functionalities? the way they layout the derivation path is a common methodology shared by many networks. so that people can use a single seed phrase over multiple networks to get the desired public addresses that respond to those networks. so that you dont need to have multiple seeds per networkits for the address formats and the methods of starting from a private key/seed to a end result set of addressesthe 'cointype' (SLIPS)where by for instance the litecoin network it takes in the same seed and processes it with litecoins 'cointype' versionbit to produce litecoin public addresses. where as on the bitcoin network using bitcoins cointype it would produce bitcoin addressesheres a list of them https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md#registered-coin-typesthe 'purpose' (BIPS)starting from 44 which is where numbers 44+ are deterministic type derivations49 84 86 is for things like determining which format/function of deterministic addresses are to be formulated EG p2sh-nested-segwit(49) -bitcoin address prefix '3'native-segwit(84)  - bitcoin address prefix 'bc1q'taproot(86) -bitcoin address prefix 'bc1p'",

There is oy one Bitcoin I believe but why different Bips and what's the differences and functionalities? Zaguru12 has provided answers on 4 types of Bitcoin addresses.I would like to continue that to get this type of Bitcoin address, the owner needs a wallet.With more than one type of Bitcoin address available, each user can choose which includes setting fees. To make it easier to understand that each type of address is mutually compatible.When you already understand address, then choose a good and safe wallet as a place to store Bitcoins. Bitcoin wallet available software, hardware. For software I recommend Electrum and Bitcoin Core.For additional information, you can read the links listed.1. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Invoice_address2. https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet",
