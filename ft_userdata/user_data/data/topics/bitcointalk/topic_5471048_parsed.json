Yes, of course, at the time they know there is nothing they can do to stop Bitcoin from growing and getting into the mainstream. So they decided might as well join the fun and make some money along the way. Hence, many big and famous firms are now heaping praises on Bitcoin away from the time when many of them dismiss it as just another scam, fraud, worthless and even a Ponzi scheme. just how time has changed them...well I am just wondering whether these people can really be working good for Bitcoin in many years from now.",

We just recently saw how easy a 51% attack was on one of the shitcoins {PlusOneCoin} ...and we know this is almost impossible with Bitcoin, so that in it self, should give investors and users of Bitcoin some confidence in it's security.",
