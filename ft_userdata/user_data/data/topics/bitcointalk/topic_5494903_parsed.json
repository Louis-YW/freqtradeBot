If you invest in btc just because other people are also investing, then you will also be selling btc when they are selling and in my experience, the majority are always the losers. That means if you don't sell before everybody else, you will be selling at the bottom. If you don't buy before everybody, you will be buying the top. Following the majority the quickest way of getting poor.On the top of that, people need to understand what they are buying or selling. That's why they need to do their research before even touching btc or any other crypto. There are many resources that educates people for free. \"Price is what you pay, value is what you get.\"",

I mean it's all over the media, it has it's historical past and we see it as the prime mover and in it's young data, you can see that after the halving, price goes on a parabolic rise and then we see it hitting new all time high. And if you will follow the crowd then maybe you will see some saying that altcoins are also a good investment, even better than Bitcoin because it's gives you a higher return. It might be true, but it's not that easy to find a altcoin that will give you that so called x100 returns in the future. Perhaps what you hear in the beginning about Bitcoin is that it's a \"get rich quick\" scheme, and you fall for that hype or be influence by others that you think it's going to be very easy sail, which is not.",

Price speculations and how to go about your bitcoin investment is also being discussed, so I don't see why anyone here in this forum will start making too much research on bitcoin, when he already have the basic knowledge of bitcoin. It is people who thinks that bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme, that will be carried away by FOMO and jump into investing without knowing how bitcoin works.Anyone that is ready to invest in bitcoin, as long you are active in this forum, it is easy as you can invest in bitcoin and continue learning more about bitcoin, you must not know everything first before you start up your investment because time waits for no one, and it is impossible for you to learn everything on bitcoin in one year, because bitcoin is complex and there are new developments in the network frequently. What I will say is that make a proper calculation on your income, and use the amount of discretionary income that you have to buy bitcoin, regular either weekly or monthly with DCA method, amd learn at the same time on bitcoin here in the forum. Investment should be a personal decision , and not because others are doing it.",

Because they need to learn about the reason they want to invest in Bitcoin except the price, non custodial wallet, how to backup their seed phrase, choosing CEX or DEX and basic computer security. But if someone buy Bitcoin without learn anything, it's still a good choice if they didn't panic sell and can hold for long term. The biggest mistake that did by Average Joe is sell the coins when it doesn't move like what they expect.",

When people are trying so hard to pull out of bitcoin, enter the market just as the price drops. Do not think or be worried that maybe there is something wrong with bitcoin. Do your own research and better if you learn to analyze the past trends from before and try to speculate how the market will move in the future.",

One just need the basic knowledge of Bitcoin and some good cashflow for the accumulation part . Because if you are the type that want to focus on knowing more about bitcoin before investing in it , you may endup missing out big time . Because the price movements actually wait for no one . That's why most time is better to gather some nice basic knowledge about bitcoin first , then start accumulating and as you are holding and accumulating you can focus more in knowing more about bitcoin while you hodl. Because is only those that are into shitcoins would have to take their time to learn more about that particular shitcoins Before jumping which is a total waste of time .Instead of wasting time with such , just focus on Bitcoin accumulation and this forum a whole is full with nice knowledge about Bitcoin so as you are holding you can learn more about Bitcoin here from knowledgeable users here.",

At least you have the idea why people are flocking to Bitcoin. We tell everyone to invest and then we don't forget to give them a remember that they should only invest what they can afford to lose but before that, they need to do their own research. Even I, I didn't invest because everyone is investing but I did my silent research on it before I have entrusted my hard earned money and invested into it.",

      "body": "The problem is that people shouldn't be only investing in cryptocurrencies but instead using them as they are using regular banks and FIAT money - for a secure store of money and to be used everyday.Unfortunately most people got into cryptocurrency world due to countless stories of getting rich and they missed the point entirely, bought into X project and started mindlessly copy/pasting glorifying posts about it to hopefully increase their bags value which in the long term only hurts the value.If people would stop posting \"HODL\" and \"Number goes up\" threads and instead just used it as it supposed to be used (without CEX or any custodial wallet!) then the price would naturally go up anyway but would be more stable because it would be propelled by true usage and not mainly by speculators and their pumpy-dumpy scheme.Speculators who earn by pumping and dumping would still exist but the percentage of impact on the price would be much smaller as users (as oppose to hodlers) would have more moving force than them.By only holding (not using it) the true value disappears and what we get is a bubble of greater fool.I'm not saying you shouldn't use it as investment at all, you can just like you can FIAT money from different countries but mainly it should be used.Hodler = Zombie coins.If you're not using it, you are not participating in the market and actually making it weaker by handing more power to speculators who don't want for the \"number\" to go up but fluctuate, the more drastic the fluctuation the more gains they have.Cryptocurrency is not \"Digital Gold\", never was, never will.

The first thing they think about is how to make very short profits in crypto so they look for hyped coin news, I think that's where they go wrong.
