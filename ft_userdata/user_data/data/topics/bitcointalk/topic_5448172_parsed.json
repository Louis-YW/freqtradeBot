If you want extra privacy, you could always ask your campaign manager to keep your address out if the spreadsheet. But if you're the only one, it doesn't take a genius to figure out which address belongs to you.Public payment details can also be helpful to compare rates.",

Keeping your wallet address on your profile page is also important for two reasons; 1. Besides most authentication requests, for the wallet address provided in the campaign for managers, for cases where your name is impersonated. 2.The forum moderators will also ask for a signature for the provided account on your profile page in case of an account hack, so you need to have this wallet address public.

I’ve seen only one campaign already doing this, what do you guys think? Should spreadsheets and payout addresses be kept private? Keeping user payout addresses for privacy concerns will not be helpful. In the blockchain all transactions are recorded, and can be viewed by anyone. Even if the campaign manager keeps the payout addresses private, the problem is still not solved. During the payout cycle, all members of the signature campaign will receive Bitcoin from the campaign manager. Each member of the campaign who receives Bitcoin will be able to see what others have received. Although this approach is better than sharing the address on the forum, it still does not provide complete privacy.",

I don’t think it’s necessary to publish one’s transaction address publicly, you don’t have to prove anything to anyone.  It really depends on the situation. For instance, when repaying a loan, it may be required to provide proof of payment. In the realm of cryptocurrency, verifiable transactions hold significant value as the blockchain technology operates with a level of transparency and integrity that humans cannot match.Regarding the post you mentioned, nobody requested the OP to share his financial details publicly. It was his personal choice to do so.Quote from: SatoPrincess on April 09, 2023, 06:43:32 PMQuote from: decodx on April 09, 2023, 06:23:14 PMNo, this measure wouldn't protect your privacy at all, but it would rather benefit scammers who seek to manipulate the system using multiple accounts, such as those involved in promoting the 1xbit scam.

As for accounts promoting 1xbit, they are already tag dubious users including the CM, and I doubt the CM even cares about those cheating in the campaign. That's not what I meant. Even if the campaign manager is not taking action, it's important for the wider community to have proof of how the campaign is being run. If there is evidence of a large number of interconnected accounts and addresses, it shows that the campaign is not as legitimate as it may seem, and is using a farm of fake accounts to create the false impression of a large following.In my opinion, it's possible that other scam platforms could follow a similar pattern and create fake signature campaigns by hiring fake accounts to make it seem like their promotional efforts are legitimate. That's why I think it's important for campaign payments to be transparent and public.",

      "body": "Usually it should be so but you know.. if a manager starts hiding sheet from the public they would say he or she has added his alt account in the campaign that was why they hide sheet so the general public won't see them to know how they are operating and managing the campaign. So if any manager decided to hide it should be after accepting everyone and they checked their names and addresses are very correct then sheet can be hidden from the general public after which he may instructs all participants to go edit and remove their addresses or they should pm their address to the manager for him to manually input them to the sheets. Alternatively the manager may share only to the participants, meaning anyone who is not promoting that campaign may not have access to it all less they are one of the participants. That is my opinion maybe lets hear from the campaign managers on their own view concerning this issues.",
