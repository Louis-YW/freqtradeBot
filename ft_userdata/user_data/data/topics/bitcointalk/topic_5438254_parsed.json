Don't you think it's a selfish request? Your case should be used to generalize about universities all over the world. You have not also told us what transpired between the university and you that let to the violence allegation. For me universities are institutions that teach educands specific or general skills that could help them to be productive and law abiding. Although there are some of them that promote other negative vices based on the educational goals of the country.",

So I will say get a college degree but do not let that degree make you focus on one particular career, rather let that college degree be an open door to multiple careers.",

This is because these institutions promote the violence because they are filled with the most bloodthirsty of chlurmcks. The only reason why you do not see their inability to apologize or recognize wrongdoing as a problem is that you yourself are a worthless bloodthirsty chlurcmklet who has absolutely no value to society.\"Generalizations are almost always wrong.If you have a degree from a top-tier university (in a civilized, non-corrupted country) and you graduated with a 4.0 GPA,it is pretty much guaranteed that you are well-educated.\"-And this 'education' means nothing except for indoctrination and Nazism as long as these institutions refuse to acknowledge that there is a problem. What about people from a second tier university? Are they uneducated then? Are you saying that only a few people who ever went to a university are educated? If you are, then you are essentially proving my point. If anyone has been educated from a university, it would be me instead of any of you chlurcmklets who I cannot even have a conversation with.\"Do you need a university degree to be well-educated? Almost always the answer is yes.\"-You are wrong because universities fucking promote violence and refuse to apologize. If you have a degree, then I will only believe that you are uneducated unless you demonstrate otherwise. And this demonstration begins by taking that stupid ass degree and setting it on fire because universities fucking promote violence.\"It's all about being a slave to the system long enough so that the system thinks you will tell others that the system is good.\"-This is almost as torturous as drinking a liter of gasoline and then lighting one's farts on fire when the gasoline passes through.If universities were worth anything at all, they would fucking apologize or acknowledge that there is a problem. Universities refuse to apologize, so we should all consider the people who went to these institutions to be extremely uneducation; and by uneducated, I mean fucking stupid.",

We need more education and apply it to the problems of the society. I share same belief with you, don't use your personal experience to general. Every institute in the world had its policy and management issues.  School it's self is a process and a continuous programme it doesn't have an end. Even if you read to the level of a professor you still can know all, if someone stop at first degree and he /she can't afford to proceed forward doesn't make them a failure.

They may have their own ways of teaching and they're enforcing it while the students are staying on the school.But once they come out, it really changes.
