      "body": "There are many analysts that say bitcoin had capulated when its price was $30000. But what happened? The price of bitcoin falled again above $30000 to almost $17000 before it increased above $20000 again. But likely that bitcoin price will still decrease further again before it will increase.Analysts are of different saying, some said bitcoin will fall below $10000, some analysts says that bitcoin will not fall below $140000, some are now saying capitulate has been around $20000. Do not believe analysts. You can use DCA to simply invest.",

If we trade sideways till the end of the year then I would say that we bottomed last month.However there is still a lot of uncertainly such as the large CPI we have been getting. If we keep getting High inflation numbers then fed might hike again and much higher percentages. If that happens we might go lower.",

We just entered the bear season and I don't believe that crypto has already capitulated. I think we are just in denial phase right now because there are still optimism left to some people. Once the market crash very fast that it causes panic even to diamond hands, then it could spark the capitulation.",

Do not believe analysts. You can use DCA to simply invest.Analysts are saying different things because indicators are suggesting different things. Many indicators suggest price has already capitulated at $20K, others indicate that price has only begun capitulating, some even indicate that price has yet to capitulate. It's not about distrusting analysts, it's about not relying on a single indicator or analyst to suggest one scenario or another, when there isn't confluence between them.Indicators only provide indications, not guarantees. This is the main mistake people make when listening to analysts who use different indicators. One thing that is certain is this is very different to 2018 capitulation when most indicators were suggesting that capitulation had occurred, so there was considerable confluence between different indicators. Without confluence, there isn't much confirmation.The only thing that is more or less certain is around $12K most capitulation based indicators would be suggesting that capitulation has occurred, so there would finally be more confluence.",

And I think it will increase even more in the future as the bear season continues to stretch. They are no longer able to sustain those that should be kept in good condition perhaps due to the intensification of the machinery.If the maintenance and the sustainability of resources are no longer possible and also due to the decrease or limitation of the recoverable return, there is probably no other outcome but capitulation.",

There are still many people who are not living in reality and has not considered that it is very much possible that bitcoin can go -40% lower from where the price is presently. Everyone is still buying the dip when it is much more advisable to hold dollars or stablecoins during the bear market.However hehehehe, if we did not have a blow off top, there might not have a capitulation?",

Perhaps the price could down to the levels of $10k-$15k, or even lower for those who wanted to buy cheap BTC again.So it's better to prepare ourselves next year to see this kind of price, just to be sure so that there will be no disappointment and surprises to all of us.",

Bitcoin didn't capitulate when its price was just $3,000 after reaching $20,000 in 2017. So why would it capitulate now? Mining unsustainable with Bitcoin at $20,000? Mining was thriving just a couple of years ago when Bitcoin was even lower than $10,000. So why would it suddenly become unsustainable when the price even doubled?",

Or it could happen next year, but the point being, we haven't reach capitulation yet, others might have to disagree, but if you look at the historical logs, capitulation happens a year after the start of the bear market. So for me, most likely it will be early next year and then recover some, but the market will continue to be a long and hard grind. Of course the only saving grace is the halving, but it will happen in 2024. So yeah, just be prepared for everything that the market will give us in the long bearish cycle.",
