It is really hard to lose your investment in case of a rugged pull. I didn't invest in Shiba Inu since it's a meme coin which I am not a fan of. It would be much better to invest in altcoins that have products and check the chart if it's going upward since day one it gets listed on exchanges.",

Still, there are plenty of its investors that help it to remain at the top spot and that's for sure going to alarm all of them.",

Well, I was able to ride some trend with SHIB and made good profit but for me, this is indeed too risky to hold for long term even before the dump of LUNA, you can easily say that SHIB is just a meme token with no purpose in this market. Be careful to hold your SHIB!",

      "body": "IMHO, I think everyone knows since the very beginning that Shiba Inu is just a meme coin right, and it is very clear that it has no real use cases because it's just a meme coin, thats why it's obvious that it has also no organic demand and thats the reason why the Shiba Inu price is very unstable as we observe even in the bullish market trend because without the hype pushing it Shiba Inu was nothing.So what can we expect? It's highly possible that anytime soon the Shiba Inu token price might go down to zero just like what happened in Terra Luna. so watch out guys because if that article is true that was a huge red flag and it was a very alarming sign!",

I think though that the founder of Shiba Inu should be a pretty well known man by now as Shiba Inu was the most successful one among all those hundreds of second generation meme-coins that came out in the last months, so i don't think that deleting all social media posts would not really help him to disappear.That is why i don't think that this is a sign for a rug-pull that is coming shortly. I also think that a complete rugpull is not even possible anymore with Shiba Inu, as it is also listed on centralized exchanges by now. Of course if the founder of Shiba Inu would dump all of his tokens at once then this is pretty much the end of the project too..rugpull or not.",

In that case, Shiba Inu was far below it.  The position you are looking at now may not be the same maybe it carries the this message, by delete the owner's tweet.  It can also become like Lunar who knows  .
