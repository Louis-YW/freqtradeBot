      "body": "Talking about Bukele’s policy in El Salvador, I feel people that are against his policies or his administration are the ones painting his idea of having bitcoin a legal tender bad. It is purely politics and I don’t think it was forced on them.The government definitely will be a big role in the global adoption of bitcoin by making it a legal tender. When it is a legal tender or even free from ban people will use more of it and through the process it will attract more investors towards it. But if the government placed a ban on it, it definitely has its toll on people mostly older generations as they tend to run off from everything illegal and this could reduce the rate of global adoption.",

Even now we have seen or read about investments spread across the globe accepting Bitcoin as payments even if the Government of that country hasn't pronounced it a legal tender, but I must say that crypto in general has been globally recognized or adopted, The 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index and you know we cannot really speak crypto without Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Like NdaMk, I wouldn't call Bitcoin adoption forced upon people in El Salvador (although you could say it was forced on the merchants, maybe), and I don't think it was obligatory to use it, and they still use the USD as their other legal tender. But in some countries, where digital literary and Internet penetration is low, whereas the poverty rate is high, people may not care about things like Bitcoin and may find it unnecessarily hard to rely on anything aside from cash. So I think what can help, apart from the things like a $30 bonus and the legal framework that was implemented in El Salvador, is an educational campaign and business partnerships (the state convincing businesses to accept Bitcoin rather than requiring it), as well as highlighting the economic benefits and ensuring that people are easily able to use Bitcoin.",

This is truly evident in my country and I saw how much the people suffered during the last month of cash scarcity as people couldn't use their money since cash wasn't available and the network signal was so poor and I had to relate this to ease of Bitcoin acceptance and I think my country might be one of the least countries to adopt Bitcoin.",

When people start looking at bitcoin as a safe, easy, and decentralized way of peer-to-peer payment and stop looking at the rise and fall of the price, then we are ready for global adoption.",

Simply being better in one aspect, like being resistant to inflation won't cut it. Because people don't choose their money based on only one parameter.Bitcoin needs to become stable and not fluctuate by more than a few percent over a quarter. That's why the world still uses USD and not Bitcoin - it's better to predictably lose some 2-8% of your value in a year than to risk losing 50% in one month with Bitcoin - the latter makes economic planning nearly impossible.Lightning network needs to be perfectly stable and free of bugs and vulnerabilites so it can be used for small transactions, since on-chain is increasingly more unsuitable for that purpose.And lastly, Bitcoin requires a culture of good computer use literacy - losing your coins to mistakes is too easy. And despite everyone living in digital world these days, the levels of computer literacy are not improving, as people use simple one-click solutions like phone apps rather than tinkering with command line, OS settings, registry editors and so on.",

After learning that IMF hates Bukele for adopting BTC, we are already aware that there will be news that will paint Bukele as to fail but he did pay off the country's debt to IMF. What might trigger global BTC adoption is the bank failures that had happened recently with Silvergate, SVB, and Signature bank.

Although his experimentation on Bitcoin as legal tender failed due to the declining market but yet the US Dollar was also adopted along side Bitcoin as legal tender abandoning their local currency the  colón. Which gave its citizens two choices to make either spend their Dollar or spend their Bitcoin equally on any commodity. I am thinking the enticing offer of Bitcoin lured the citizens.Bitcoin been a legal tender or an investment offer cannot make the world adopt it as a global currency. Not when they cannot control your funds. El Salvador felt Bitcoin could salvage their dieing economy. And since El Salvador experimentation didn't work out many nations will see it as a reason not to look at Bitcoin as a legal tender",

I get your point mate be the truth is that we users can't make Bitcoin a legal tender and if Bitcoin is banned in a country, then whoever is found using it might be tag as enemy of the state for disobeying government and might even get penalized.On the other hand, what we're really pushing for is the general acceptance of Bitcoin in the country  and world in general so we wouldn't have to move in fear when holding Bitcoin but rather be free if it's a legal tenderNo matter how successful Bitcoin might be, we still need the approval of the government so as to be able to use Bitcoin freely without any hesitation.",

You only need it is not prohibited legally and it is enough for you to find people who accept Bitcoin or business that accepts Bitcoin to exchange your Bitcoin for their fiat currencies, altcoins or products.Like in El Salvador, legal tender does not bring too many people to Bitcoin and does not create natural adoption in that nation.QuoteWhat do you think could aid the adoption of Bitcoin?Let it grows naturally and avoid to shill it as a Get-rich asset that sounds too good to be true.
