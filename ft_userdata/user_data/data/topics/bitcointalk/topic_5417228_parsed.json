With how parents are naming their child nowadays, crypto-based names could be a quite common choice.Quote from: BitcoinBarrel on October 15, 2022, 03:08:37 PMIs there a kid out there named Doge? heheÂ  Based from this reddit post looks like there is someone named after dogecoin.Reddit: Got a little one on the way. If Doge reach $2 in 8months I will name my child Doge As for the topic, yes, I can imagine myself naming my child after a crypto as some of them are already based from the name of the creator of the token and some crypto out there has great name.",

Also, regardless of the coin, it seems inappropriate to me to name a child after a currency, any currency. Associating a child with money like that just doesn't sit with me well. But if a crypto has a name that sounds well, it can coincidentally become a child's name, of course, and a fact that there's a coin shouldn't stop parents from choosing the word they like.I am surprised that 4 people voted 'yes' to the poll so far.
