  "content": "So, I am learning about the concept of sport spread betting. It is still a bit confusing to comprehend when compared to the regular Fixed odds betting which I am used to. For a definition of the both of them see the quote below.Sports Spread BettingQuoteSpread Betting is an unfixed bet type that empowers the punter to predict an outcome of a match or event and back their judgment against the 'spread' quoted by the sports spread betting company. The 'spread' is a scoring range created by the sports spread betting company on a specific event or match. If punters believe this spread is too high or too low, they can sell or buy accordingly. The winnings or losses are calculated by the stake multiplied by the point difference from the spread.Fixed Odds BettingQuoteFixed odds betting is the traditional form of betting where a bookmaker will offer odds on a specific outcome in a match or event. If that outcome happens, i.e. a horse wins at odds of 10/1, then the bookmaker will pay winnings of 10 x the stake, plus the original stake.I do understand fixed odds betting because it what I am most used to. Can someone who have actually, engaged in the spread betting explain it to mean using football(because it is the sports I most bet on). Which is better in terms of payout and risk?https://www.spreadex.com/sports/get-started/sports-fixed-odds-betting/https://www.financial-spread-betting.com/sports/Spread-betting-sports.html",

Which is better in terms of payout and risk?https://www.spreadex.com/sports/get-started/sports-fixed-odds-betting/https://www.financial-spread-betting.com/sports/Spread-betting-sports.htmlInformative on my end. Been on sports betting for a year and I think I am playing only with fixed odds betting. I was not aware of thesports spread betting but as I have quite a reading about it, I do think that fixed odd betting is a less complicated side of sportsbetting.  If I comprehended it correctly, Sports spread is evident with Dota betting platforms during TI and other tournaments wherein there are already placed outcomes punters may bet which I find it hard to come up with a win. But somehow there are punters who are earning huge amount from such type of betting style so I guess it will just be a matter of gambling preferences. But to answer the question and to aline it in football which is a sports teams are having a hard time to score, I guess sports spread would be easier because of the low team score (most of the time). In terms of  payout rates, not only in football, Fixed Odds would be bigger, in my opinion.",

It is still a bit confusing to comprehend when compared to the regular Fixed odds betting which I am used to.Maybe we don't need to talk about Odds betting, I think it is a common bet that many people make in every online sports betting site that offers Odds betting.Straight to the point.I'm studying as you said (Sports Spread Betting), this bet is quite foreign to me, maybe you could say I've never made that bet, it's interesting to talk about and I'm curious if there is a desire to make this bet.I've been looking into what Spread betting means and how to do it.As I see sports Spread betting tends to be more towards (Point Spread Betting), it is more popular.I think we can find a full discussion below, about sports Point Spread Betting.What Is A Point Spread Bet?QuoteA point spread bet differs from a moneyline bet because the outcome of a spread bet, for bettors, does not always mirror the final result of the sporting event. Where a moneyline bet involves picking one team to win outright (or a draw when offered as a potential outcome), the losing team in a point spread bet may still provide a win for bettors, depending on the score of the sporting event.From the sources I've seen, maybe I already understand how to make these bets, but what I don't understand is who I'm betting with or which sports betting sites offer sports Point Spread Betting game options.• What the betting methods that must be carried out in the real world, such as in a casino.• Or there are certain online sports betting sites that offer sports Point Spread betting options.At first glance, how to bet like that already understand, but with whom and where, this is a good topic and a little curious for me Spread betting options.",

      "body": "European football being similar to Major League Baseball (MLB) in the USA, comes in two main formats.1.  Total points scored.2.  Points a game is won or lost by.If team A scores 2 points, and team B also scores 2 points. Total points scored will be 4. In which case the total points spread might be over or under 5 points scored. With the under 5 points scored bet being the correct one.If team A wins a game by 1.5 points. There is a points spread where a team is allowed to win or lose a game by a certain spread.Those are the most common spreads for sports like european football, american football, MLB, etc. But point spreads can also be found in combat sports like MMA where the spread would be the duration of rounds the fight lasted.Some of the main factors determining total points spread in european football and baseball, are whether or not the games are playoff matches. Playoff games usually have a slower pace and are more tactical. These are the big games that have more eyes on them and more pressure to perform. Which can result in lower average points scored. Whether teams are in contention to make playoffs can also be relevant. As well as a wide variety of factors.",

      "body": "Well, in my personal opinion I have always made many bets but in a traditional way, what OP talks about in the first place is that due to the question of points that they give on a platform I have never understood it well, however it is very famous and Most people like to bet a lot if they understand it, but the traditional for me is the best.When it comes to money, I think that and I am also very traditional, I like what is safe, and since many people will always trust systems that are safe, and despite the fact that the other way of betting is also safe, I do not trust myself very much, perhaps because the little interaction I've had.",
