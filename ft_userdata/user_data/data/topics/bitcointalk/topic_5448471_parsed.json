But of course this was entirely my fault even that I am still bothered by the withdrawal requirements on deposits. It is well known that deposit bonuses or any bonus offered by a casino will have wagering requirements that goes to x50 or more. What truly concerns me is the 5X wagering requirement on normal deposits without any bonus in order to withdraw the initial deposit or winnings.To clarify things better here is an example : if you were to deposit $1000 and win $200 in your first few games then you wouldnt be able to withdraw your winnings or even your deposits without wagering at least $5000. This means that 80% of the time, you would lose your money before reaching the required amount.In my opinion this term is unfair. I am not attacking any specific casino, but I do believe that if users were aware of these requirements they would be less likely to deposit their money in such casinos since there are other casinos without such stringent requirements.",

      "body": "5x wagering requirement for a normal deposit before you can withdraw your money? It seems to much, as long as I know the wagering requirement for normal deposit without bonus is only 1-2x in most casinos. 5x is just too much if you ask me but if we are talking about whether it is fair or not, it is obviously subjective question. However, every casino has their own terms related to deposit and withdrawal. It sounds unfair because you did not read the terms in advance, if you read it earlier, I'm sure you will not make a deposit because of the 5x wagering requirement of your deposit. This is why it is always important and recommended to anyone to read terms on conditions of the casino before making the 1st deposit or even before creating an account so we wont regret something because we did not read.",

This requirement will only affect those people who feel that they are too lazy to read T&C before signing up. If they are not careful,the casino will end up keeping your funds in their wallet when you don't meet up to the wagering demands.

But a high wagering requirement doesn't make a casino a scam. But it really discourages gamblers. A 5x wagering requirement is apparently a mechanism to make sure deposits are drained even before the player considers making a withdrawal.Keep us updated here as to what happens after you make your deposit and complied with the wagering requirement. We'll see if you will be able to withdraw your bonus winnings, or more requirements are asked like KYC. Trustdice also includes KYC in their ToS.",

Anything more than that automatically is going to make me feel like I'm being scammed. The casino is making you wager so much hoping the house edge on the games nets them some profit on each deposit. Seems pretty unrealistic.Trustdice has had a few scam accusations lately as well and have been pretty slow to respond. I also think they were the casino saying they will no longer reply to scam accusations(I could be wrong). If that's the case and they will not reply to accusations opened against them, I would def stay away. QuoteHello everyone,We have recently noticed a persistent and ongoing attempt to distort our announcement here . We would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to a few crucial points.Quote from the announcement:\"we have decided to stop participating in any topic on this Scam Accusations board going forward.\"As clearly stated above, the decision solely concerns the Scam Accusations board. We arrived at this decision due to the behaviors of certain individuals who appear to be particularly obsessed with us and are frequently active on that board. With that being said, we are still actively monitoring issues posted on other boards of this forum.In fact, there was an issue we recently noticed on the Gambling board and had discussed with our CS team. Over the weekend we were unable to reply to the post. When we were about to reply to it today, we found that it had been moved to the Scam Accusations board. This means that we can no longer provide a reply, which we feel sorry to see.Best regards,TrustDice Team",
