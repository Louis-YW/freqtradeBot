  "content": "Alik BahshiAre Russians ready to die for Ukraine?        Despite the colossal superiority in both the quantitative and technical equipment of the army, Russia is losing in the war with Ukraine. The reason for the failures, first of all, must be sought in the motivation of the soldiers. A similar situation was in the Afghan war, which Russia lost in disgrace. The Ukrainian soldier fights first of all for his land, for living on it the way he wants, speaking his native language and being free from the dictates of Russia, which for some reason decided to control his fate without any rights. And for this Ukrainians are ready to give their lives. One involuntarily recalls the famous phrase of Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk), who led the bloodiest battle of World War I at Gallipoli, “I do not order you to win, I order you to die,” and 74,635 Turkish soldiers obeyed the order, winning this battle.   What is the Russian soldier fighting for, on Ukrainian soil, and is he ready to give his life for victory? According to the plan of the bloody dictator Putin, he was sent to a foreign country for the denazification and demilitarization of Ukraine. So on what basis did Putin decide that power in Ukraine is in the hands of the Nazis, who, in accordance with Nazi ideology, carry out militarization in order to attack Russia. According to Putin, as a result of the 2013 rebellion, Ukrainian fascists seized power in Ukraine, when Alexander Turchinov, as the Nazi, as it should be understood, was elected interim president after the fugitive President Yanukovych. But then strange events uncharacteristic of the fascist regime take place. Half a year later, as a result of popular elections, Petro Poroshenko becomes the president of Ukraine, who was also nothing more than a Nazi, if it was under him that the law on the Ukrainian language was adopted, which received the status of the state language, which caused Putin's rage and indignation. However, the status of the Russian language in Russia is exactly the same, because in accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the law “On the state language of the Russian Federation” (2005), the Russian language is the state language throughout the country, and this is in a multinational country, which is Russia . Then, in accordance with the logic of Putin, the Nazis are in power in Russia.    However, let's continue about Ukrainian oddities: after the end of Poroshenko's presidential term, in accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine, as a result of again popular elections, Vladimir Zelensky becomes the president of the country, who, according to Putin, is even more of a fascist than Poroshenko. And this is the lifelong dictator of Russia talking about the Jew Zelensky! Moreover, how could it happen that in the fascist country of Ukraine, elections could take place three times, and even three dictators, this is already transcendent nonsense. Hitler, if he could, would roll over in his grave three times. What kind of popular elections can be discussed under the conditions of the fascist regime, and even with the change of dictators?! And an example of this is Putin's regime. In short, the famous world liar Putin has outdone himself by calling Ukraine a Nazi country that needs to be denazified. And, if we take into account Putin's historical delights that Ukrainians and Russians are one people, then his plan for denazification is understandable, that is, the destruction of the Ukrainian nation, in other words, this is called genocide.    As for demilitarization, here Putin, as usual, lied. It is known that before the Russian attack on Ukraine, Ukraine transferred all its nuclear weapons to Russia, and sold the rest of the military equipment to anyone. You have to be crazy to believe in the militarization of Ukraine. As a result of such a reckless attitude towards weapons, and more so, faith in Moscow's assurances of a guarantee of non-aggression (the Budapest Memorandum), Ukraine became in dire need of them after the Russian invasion. It is good that the West, after long hesitation, finally realized that Ukraine is essentially opposed to Nazism, which has revived in Russia, the worst enemy of Democracy (1,2,3), and decided to arm the courageous soldiers of Ukraine. The high motivation of the Ukrainian soldier, combined with Western weapons, changed the situation at the front. Having withstood the first onslaught of the fascist invaders and, having defeated them near Kyiv, and then Kharkov, the Ukrainians moved from defense to expelling the enemy from their native land. Putin is already silent about the denazification and demilitarization of Ukraine, the goal of the war he started has changed for him personally, because the defeat threatens the Fuhrer of the Russian version not only with the loss of power and stolen goods, but also with a tribunal, followed by the inevitable collapse of his beloved Empire of Evil and Lies. (4)     Returning to the issue of Russian motivation in the war with Ukraine, it is well illustrated by a horde of Russians of military age leaving Russia and being rounded up by Putin's security forces. Why should they die in a foreign country? For the palaces and yachts of Putin and his henchmen who hired false propagandists to stupefy the people.1.

After all, we thanked them at the end of WW2 for wiping out the Nazi's.Should We Thank Russian Troops for Their Service?Quote from: https://www.fff.org/2022/10/28/should-we-thank-russian-troops-for-their-service/After the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the American people were constantly exhorted to thank the troops for their service. The mantra spread throughout American society. Politicians used it in their campaigns. Church ministers emphasized it in their sermons. Airliners  used it when giving the troops early boarding privileges.That raises an obvious question: Should we also thank the Russian troops for their service?I think most Americans, especially those imbued with a strong anti-Russia mentality, would say no. They would say that Russian troops don't deserve our thanks because they are waging an illegal or unjust war against Ukraine.But doesn't that imply then that when we thank the troops for their service over here, it's not because there is something special and noble about being a soldier? If that was the reason for thanking the troops for their service, it would seem logical for Americans to thank the Russian troops for their service too.The decision not to thank Russian troops for their service obviously requires an American citizen to make a determination of whether the war that Russian troops are fighting is legal and just. If Americans decided that Russian troops were fighting a legal and just war, I don't think they would have any problems thanking them for their service. For example, during World War II most Americans, including U.S. officials, effusively thanked Russian troops for their service against the Nazi regime....",

Dying to give others a better life is an adventure I would like to embark on. Sometimes when I see the suffering and agonies caused by greed, pride and selfishness of the political class, I feel I could take the status of the messiah that can give me the privilege of dying for these innocent people so that they can have freedom and a better life. I don't think I would ever fight for any politician who tries to brainwash me that I am fighting for my country because war mostly cause more problems than the one it is claiming to solve.Back to the question, If Russians believe that the war in Ukraine is a just course and it would promote freedom and better standard of living in both Russia and Ukraine, then it is worth dying for. But if it was born out of pride, selfishness and hunger for influence, then those Russians that migrated out of the country for fear of conscription made the right decision.",

Russia is not in a position of self-defense because it is in an offensive position and is fighting a war outside its territory. In addition, its campaign against Ukraine cannot be considered a preemptive attack, because Ukraine does not pose any threat to it. Russia targets energy production centers and provokes humanitarian crises, which leads to the displacement of civilians and the disruption of basic services. Russia also annexed Ukrainian regions.

The war is on Ukrainian soil, not in Russia. What is the Russian army doing in Ukraine? Killing Ukrainians. The question is why? Because Putin explained that there is no Ukrainian people.
