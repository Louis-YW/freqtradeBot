What is a good price for starts offering?  However, lets start with a offer ... 0.001 btc plus shipping expenses on my own Hi , bitbollo Great questions  The mags will be coming from Euro zone - I sent a few mags this week euro to euro country and it was €8 to send - so should more or less the same  I do prefer auctions, but to be honest I had no idea what to start this at  Please be free to ask any more questions  And finally …..Thankyou for your offer, but it’s not quite what I was looking for Hope this helps and I’ll definitely do an auction format in the future as yes it avoids a lot of confusion",
