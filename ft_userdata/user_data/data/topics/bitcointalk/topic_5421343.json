By the time I started working here, I had completed my bachelor\\u2019s degree in International Business and had more than 2,5 years of experience in customer service. So, starting in customer support seemed like a logical step in my career path. Also, I have always wanted to work in the financial industry.When I was going through the hiring process, I talked about LocalBitcoins with a few peers of mine. Turned out no one knew much about this company, so I didn\\u2019t have high expectations. Guess how surprised I was when I actually started onboarding! I was shocked (in a nice way!) about how international, developed and supportive LocalBitcoins was.Before joining the company I didn\\u2019t know much about Bitcoin either. Working for LocalBitcoins has taught me a lot about how Bitcoin works, why people buy cryptocurrency, what is important to LocalBitcoins\\u2019 customers, etc. It has been a really nice journey filled with new knowledge, challenges and opportunities.What do you like most about your job?I would say that what I value the most is the people.I like interacting with our customers and looking into their issues for them.

Through reading those, you can find a lot of information on what practices are allowed on LocalBitcoins and which are not.Before starting your first trade, I would also recommend you check our guide, here. Please remember that LocalBitcoins is a P2P trading platform through which you can trade with other people.
