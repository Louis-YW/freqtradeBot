The fall of the market price that took place some days ago is nothing new in the market,  what we are experiencing in the market has always been there since the existence of bitcoin , that is why you need to understand it first before investing. Bitcoin is not what you should run into without considering the volatility of the market. Bitcoin is profitable if only you can have good patience with market to hodl, it is not something you just have a mindset of making money from it so fast, with such mindset you will be disappointed.",

Which is once you caught for sure you will regret.Op the Price of  Bitcoin is volatile which means you can not predict when it goes up and down so you need to be careful if you have the plan to invest in Bitcoin You need to study in it .",

      "body": "You are right. The main purpose of BTC was to make people able to send and receive money directly to each other without the need for middlemen and without giving any personal details or documentation beforehand. But one of the great features of BTC is that it is a great investment that provides a hedge against inflation, and most people who are investors are not trying damn hard to save the value of their money, which they are slowly losing by keeping it in banks.And we all know that when we put our money in banks, they use it for their own purposes and make huge money on our money, while in BTC, we are the owners of our money, and nobody can touch it or use it. The point is that everyone has their own agendas, and we cannot force anyone to not hold BTC for a longer period of time. Instead, I am also in the category of people who love to hold BTC for a longer period of time, but the point is that not everyone could hold BTC. Because adoption is worldwide and different types of people with different mindsets are investing in or using BTC, the probability that all the users will hold BTC is very low or near zero. Due to many other factors.",

The current idea that seems like a sure thing is to buy small amounts over time and hold onto it.BTC was created for decentralised and anonymous p2p transactions, along with giving you full control of your assets. But a lot of people really use BTC to make wealth, like traders, but let me assure you, the figure of 80% is not accurate, and I think It's just an assumption from you because there are traders and then there are holders, and in my sight, the number of active holders is lesser than the number of traders who are trading in BTC, and we all know that when one is trading, they are not holding it for that long.But still, you have got a point, but it's an open market, so anyone could do anything when they have bought it.Quote from: Hewlet on August 24, 2023, 02:24:16 PMAlso, the price is going up mainly because people think it will.

Some of those new coins are already being used and have real value.Those who think and have full belief that the price of BTC will go up should have some knowledge about it because saying such words does require some words that could back them up later. And BTC is worth less now as it should be valued more, but due to misperception among people and manipulation from governments and other icons, BTC has a lower price than it should have, and you are asking, Is it valuable? Well, as I said before, optimism about BTC depends on how much you know about it. But still making assumptions and asking blank questions with no basic knowledge is not going to take you anywhere.",

Although Bitcoin technology is not a forceful technology on users, it's for every user to take their time and study the technology, and if they like its relevance, they can decide to adopt it or not. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, and its profitability is still because of its volatility. During the bear market, the price of Bitcoin plummets, and Bitcoiners, both old and new, buy Bitcoin at the dip. During the bull market, when the price spikes, some investors sell their Bitcoin and make a profit. So, your money is safe with Bitcoin investments because the value of Bitcoin increases with time.
