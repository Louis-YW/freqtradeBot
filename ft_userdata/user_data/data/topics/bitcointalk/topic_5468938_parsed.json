You should also have a reason for buying Bitcoin, either to use it as a currency or as an investment. If you're using it as an investment then have a trading plan that works for you.First thing to remember is to buy as much as you can afford to lose so you do not have to be forced to sell when you do not want to. If you use money that you might need in the future, when they need comes, you can be forced to sell even at a loss.• Get a reputable wallet software which is non custodian and open source,• Create an wallet on it and back it up on paper,• Do not use electronic back ups cause they are exposed to the internet,• Use a reputable exchange to buy and send coins to your wallet,• Always do your research.",

Bitcoin is very good for sure to invest but I will advice you not rush if you are not aware how volatile Bitcoin market is. The market is very volatile and for you to be successful in bitcoin you have to exhibit some level of patience in you to hodl your coin and not to be panicked when the price of the market is falling down.  If you don't understand bitcoin and you quickly run into investing it can be complicated to you. And one thing you need to understand is that as you are investing in Bitcoin, if you are depending in the profit to quick come you may disappointed. Hodl and wait till your investment is due for profit.",

By that I mean how to keep it under your watch where you have the private keys with you or the seed phrase as back up. You should never in anyway live your bitcoin on any exchange. You can use the exchange but as soon as you are done buying it, withdraw it from the exchange and take it to your personal wallet you have set up and make sure the private keys or seed phrase is well protected.The forum is big enough for you to understand anything related to bitcoin, you can ask any questions, people with the reply will answer you swiftly if they know the answer.",

Do your own research on other coins apart from Bitcoin, majority of other coins are scam, and also I do hope you know which crypto wallet to use for storing your assets, some are bad choices, stay away from any closed source and custodial wallets, they won't give you access to your private keys or recovery phrases, even if they do they also have access to your fund and they can steal from you. If you have the money you can buy a Trezor hardware wallet, if not, you should download an Electrum wallet from their official website, and make sure you keep your recovery seed to yourself only.",
