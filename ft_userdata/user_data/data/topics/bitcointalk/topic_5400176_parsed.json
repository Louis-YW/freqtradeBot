  "content": "Bitoreum is a free and innovative financial blockchain technology that is fast, reliable, secure, low cost and accessible to everyone. Bitoreum is a completely transparent and scalable system that aims to make a huge difference in the world.Why choose Bitoreum? Has its own blockchain which is a fork from Raptoreum, and the developers have made it easy for miners  to operate and access the tools required for accessing resources such as secure wallets, pools and blockchain explorer. Bitoreum is scalable and decentralised. Investors can trade BTRM on available exchanges, miners can mine and earn BTRM using CPU or GPU consuming a lot less power than most coins, node operators can stake BTRM and earn coins with their smartnodes with little power consumption.Bitoreum is thriving to be a secure online payment gateway of the future across several marketplaces and small businesses across the world.Our team believes that POW is more fair way of coin distribution.But you can stake your coins just by making an internal transactions within your wallet.Note: You don't need to send your coins to someone else wallet!Thanks to staking with SmartNodes mechanism, you contribute to the security and decentralisation of the Blockchain network.The higher the percentage of staked assets in the network, the more difficult it is to attack it.In case you need help in deploying SmartNodes We have detailed document on ourwebsite.Our team believes SmartNodes is better than POS as all transactions are verified byminer yet you can stake your coins without locking them.The idea is simple: a coin that helps people earning assets while mining and staking using the Bitoreum features.Each Mined block offers 5000 Bitoreums, from this75% goes to the miner20% goes to the smartnodes5% goes to the developers to maintain the network.The Bitoreum blockchain has already integrated private wallets where the balance can be hidden directly from the wallet.The SmartNodes are accessible directly from the wallet as well.CPU FriendlyGhostRider algorithm is both CPU/GPU Minable but CPU's are more efficient for mining Bitoreum.SmartnodesSmartnodes are used to handle smart contracts, and provide 51% \\ double spend protection. In addition this allows:- Larger allowed contract size.- Greater variety of programming languages can be used.- Removes the scaling issues and large increase in gas tx fees.More InformationWe'll update this thread soon + all future core developments will be updated on this thread.
