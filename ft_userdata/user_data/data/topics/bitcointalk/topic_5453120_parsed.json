  "content": "Ever wondered about the oldest casinos in the world? Well I know we are all about winning and avoiding losses from our bets however, I think it wouldn't be a bad idea if we learn about some of the oldest casinos that has been around. It will surely be of benefit to you, maybe not today but someday. Here is a disclaimer for the moderators. I am not in anyway affiliated with the websites whose link I will be providing. I do not write for them, neither am I promoting them. And as such I will limit the quotes from them. This is just for educational purposes. I am putting it out here so that it doesn't get deleted as I have noticed with some of my posts in the past.Now lets get to itKurhaus of Baden-Baden -GermanyQuoteThe Casino located in Baden-Baden opened in 1838. Games are mostly played at the table: roulette, poker, blackjack and baccarat. Slot machines occupy a very special position. They are in a separate area and are also accessible to people in casual clothes. Poker tournaments are held regularly and they are attended not only by Germans, but also by people who come from all over Europe. Casino di Venezia - Venice, ItalyQuoteOpened in 1638, it is considered the oldest casino in the world. People still gamble here today. The casino changed its management several times and it is currently owned by the Casino di Venezia Gioco S.p.A. Even though the stately gaming house is almost 400 years old, it is one of the most technically modern casinos in the world. Over 5,000 m² of floor space await players with a large selection of slot machines and table games.Casino de Spa – Spa, BelgiumQuoteIt opened in 1763. In 1918, reconstruction of the Casino took place following numerous fires during the World War. Ardent Group acquired the casino in 2003. And in 2004, the first slot machines appear in the Casino. In 2014 broadcasting of the first live roulette in Belgium on 777 by the Casino de Spa. The brasserie received a larger area, and opening of a smokers area equipped with slot machines in 2017. https://casinodespa.be/en/Crockfords Club in LondonQuoteIn 1828, a gentleman and an avid gambler named William Crockford set out to establish a luxurious club fit for diplomats, royalty, and the aristocratic elite. At that time, gambling establishments were illegal, but that did not stop Mr. Crockford. He kept being fined, but he paid the fines without a peep. The casino at Crockfords is not a typical casino. It is open daily from 12 PM to 6 AM. It has an 18th century “crème de la crème of English” feel to it with elaborate décor, old-fashioned furnishings, and warm colors. Upon stepping foot into the building, you will feel like you’ve traveled back to 1828.At this casino, you will find classic table games like American Roulette, Baccarat, Blackjack, and Poker. Also, private rooms and private high-limit areas are available to the high-rollers and VIPs. Two of the four private areas (called the London Room and the Penthouse Suites) offer direct access to the building’s rooftop smoking balconies.https://www.casino.org/uk/local/crockfords/  Casino Wiesbaden, Wiesbaden, GermanyQuoteThe Casino Wiesbaden is reputed to be the oldest casino in Germany, having been granted a public gaming license by the Duke of Nassau-Usingen back in 1771. Daily from 11.00 o’clock (slot machine game) and 14.45 (classic game) until at least 4.00 in the morning, the guests seek and find small or big fortunes. The current gambling offerings are as comprehensive and exciting as is the history of Casino Wiesbaden. These range from classic French roulette, where all eyes are set on the track of the ivory ball once the cry \"no more bets\" has been heard at the up-market tables to American roulette, Black Jack, and poker. https://www.casino.com/blog/news/oldest-casinos-in-the-world/, https://www.primomedico.com/en/cooperation/casino-wiesbaden/Casino Spielbank Bad Homburg – Bad Homburg, GermanyQuoteTwin brothers Louis and François Blanc opened the Bad Homburg casino in 1841 and it remains one of the most celebrated in Germany almost two centuries later. Spielbank Bad Homburg was a popular gaming venue up until 1872 when gambling was prohibited in Prussia and it was forced to close its doors. Life began again in 1949 when the casino reopened, and it has gone from strength to strength since then.Pay a visit and you can choose from 8 roulette tables, a mixture of French and American variants of the game. The four blackjack tables here include unique variations like Chance Blanc, Golden Jack and the tempting Free Bet Blackjack game. Poker tournaments and more than 140 slot games round out the gaming offerings here. https://www.spielbank-bad-homburg.de/en/Casino Interlaken - Interlaken, SwitzerlandQuoteIt opened in 1859, two months later the Cantonal Government banned all forms of gambling. Baron Azène du Plessis – who had built and run the Kursaal at his own expense – fled Interlaken after taking this brief, unlucky gamble. It was not until the era of belle époque, when gambling at the Kursaal was allowed to a limited extent, that there was an upward turn. In 1883, Jeu des petits chevaux , a game similar to Ludo, was introduced in all casinos in Europe, including Interlaken. However opponents of gambling sprang into action and won a long referendum campaign in 1920. Gambling was finished. But in 1928, boules once again became socially acceptable for a modest stake of 2 francs. It was not until the beginning of the 1990s that the gambling prohibition in Switzerland was lifted. On 13 June 2002, the Federal Council granted the Kursaal Interlaken a Type B casino concession and hardly two months later, on 31 July, the first guests were able to indulge in gaming.https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=67946 Thank you for reading . I know that the list is inexhaustive. But like I wrote earlier this is just for educational and knowledge purpose. You can do more research on your own. Maybe start with finding out the oldest casino in your locality, state/province or country. I bet there are interesting things that awaits you. Good luck.[/list]",

Or we can say that Europeans as early as 1600 loves the richest and gamble their money. And I wouldn't be surprised though that we have heard a lot of richest family from Europe that their bloodline still exists today. Not saying that their money came from gambling or something, but money for sure has been flowing since that time that their families lineage still survived today.And it has evolved so much in the last 100 years that now almost every country has one or two big casinos.",

I would really believe these casinos are meant to thrive forever if they adopt BTC. I guess its quite obvious because BTC is currently leading the casino business market and If  any  wishes to operate for a very long time that casino needs to be flexible and by flexibility I mean they need to adjust to the current trend of the market and bitcoin is currently making the gambling business thrive a lot as it is giving a boost because most people are into gambling with crypto. A business must often make changes if they want to succeed for long as change is the only constant thing among humans.",

Gambling really did exist even before, but just became more rampant and patronized recently since there are already casino websites online which are easily accessible and can provide convenience, since you can gamble wherever and whenever you feel like it. But establishments like these now have great value for history, since most of these has been built in 1800s and even 1600s, it's a good place to see some architectural structures or ruins if there is left of it still. Perhaps it could be aa good tourist spot for gamblers who want to feel the old and traditional gambling vibes of a casino house which could be a great experience since their minds could be opened up into something entirely new, specifically if they seldom visit casino houses or if they frequently do, they will be able to compare and appreciate the past designs and its story.",
