The fee should be at least not less than 10 sat/byte. The transaction must also not be more than 500 bytes. Also the transaction must not have unconfirmed parent. Recently the free accelerator is difficult to use unless you wait for another one hour to submit your txid. It takes seconds for the 100 transactions to have been submitted now. Although, I am still using it and it is working.",

However, it's not until I test it that I can conclude about it, or at least someone tests it on BTT to give feedback. But all I've been reading from people's replies are still nothing to write home about, except the one that states we would have an account before using itI have no issues with that. All the stress will still amount to nothing if it's a free service, but I doubt it. Nevertheless, if the service is cheap compared to the outrageous ones out there, it will still be manageable.Let's see how far they will be distributing the accelerated service too.",

I don't really get why they would offer a service like this when they can just process the higher transaction fees instead of getting paid less than what they can get on the mempool. Can someone explain what the benefit is to the pool exactly?Because people will essentially be paying at a premium price. Took a quick look at their pricing and there is a fixed 100K sats as a mempool.space fee among other things -- emphasis on among other things as there is more depending on the transaction/options you choose.With that said, you don't save anything, the service is more of a desperate attempt/last resort if the situation calls for it. If you wanna save, best to use viabtc's free transaction accelerator and setup your transaction in such a way that it meets viabtc's conditions.",

It is taking longer but it will still later be confirmed.First is the limits that have killed the demand, Viabtc has really half closed to gate, so you have to pay 20sat/vb to be sure and keep your tx under 0.5kb, plus of course no unconfirmed parents, so there are times when there are simply no tx out there that match the requirements, as for the next block issue, it happens when ViaBTC has really bad luck and is not getting enough blocks spread across the day, they offer 100tx every hour but sometimes they don't mine a block for 6-7 hours, so not to fill the whole block with cheap tx they postpone a few of them to the next one, I read once something about a 500 cap but don't know how accurate that claim was, probably it's more about size than raw numbers.",
