Of course, citizens will at a point get fed up with bad governance and at a point, it could result in civil unrest and possibly escalate into a full flag war or crisis just as it has happened in many countries before until there is a change of government or the system. France is a well-developed country that its government suppose to have legitimacy and not a revote in this nature.",

This is not a case of revolutionaries standing up against their rulers, only a case of left wing radicals raising racial tensions by capitalizing on an OIS involving a black kid. Law enforcement in France rarely are involved in shootings, so you will have to have commited a particularly heinous offense to be shot by European law enforcement. Looks like a person using his vehicle as a weapon is what prompted the shooting, an entirely justified use of force under that premise. Hasn't stopped rioters from destroying property and brutalizing law enforcement.Macron looks particularly weak in this situation too. Last reports I've read is he's sent some tens of thousands of agents into Paris to restore order. But that's only after rioting has peaked.",

George Floyd wouldn't have had an altercation with police if he had willfully followed their instruction, even if it was clear that he did nothing wrong. Nahel M, the 17years old that was murdered would have been alive if he didn't drive recklessly and disobeyed the instruction of the police officer. There was no need to try to run away if you have nothing to hide. These police officers are humans and can make mistakes.

Looks like a person using his vehicle as a weapon is what prompted the shooting, an entirely justified use of force under that premise. Hasn't stopped rioters from destroying property and brutalizing law enforcement. .European police officers are indeed far better than their US counterparts in terms of dealing with immigrants. But there has been an increase in the killing of low-income immigrants and just this year about 13 people have been killed in the same manner. One of the reasons for the increase in this riot was lies. The police officer lied that he was in danger that was why he shot the younger boy. But when the videos was released it was clear that the boy didn't pose any danger to them or others around. Even the police authority confirmed that the legal standard for him to use a firearm had not been met, so he acted against the law. Criminals will always use a just course to carry out their wicked activities. There is no need for the destruction and looting going on in France. This protest would have been peaceful. But sometimes it seems the only language that some politicians understand especially in my location is violence. They don't give attention to peaceful demonstrations, but this shouldnt be the reason for violence. A peaceful demonstration is an ideal medium to show displeasure.",

Perhaps he got it easier since his opponent or political foe was rather an extremist, I recall she wanted France to also abandon the European Union and the Euro as currency. People voted against an authoritarian person and still, in the end, they got what they were trying to avoid: a leader who tries to go over the will of the people.This also reminds me what happens in Israel, There was also some civil unrest there, for about the same reasons.",

The former governement canceled the law proposition thanks to the riots, and situation became ok quickly. Macron is not Sarkozy, and the recent ''Reforme des retraites'' proved that he refuses to cancel any law proposition, on the contrary, he even use 49,3 to make it going faster.In France, mass demonstrations, more or less violent (like the ones you mention on the subject of pensions) are considered normal, but riots are not considered normal by anyone in the country.Here we have people robbing gun shops, burning schools, fighting with random people in the street, the government sending in the GIGN, the BRI, the RAID in certain cities (Lyon, Lille, Paris). Citizens' militias are starting to organize themselves, and that's a bad sign for the health of our society.What's really worrying is that the police unions are starting to communicate in dubious ways.No, the situation isn't classic, even for the French people. I think it'll calm down, as it always does, but we're all aware that each riot becomes more violent than the last. We all know that every major demonstration is more violently repressed than the last.These riots are just a reflection of the fact that our French society has reached the end of its patience on two specific issues: police' violence on the one hand, and immigration seen as virulent by some of the French on the other. What worries all the compatriots I talk to is the never-ending rise of this respective violence (police as well as demonstrators / rioters).Quote from: Shortmaster on July 01, 2023, 10:54:06 PMSituation in france not good now i hope it don't go over nice area like st tropez Cannes the french riviera wich one is always safe and nice location to be.Don't worry, rich people and tourists are not the one who will burn everything in France lol",
