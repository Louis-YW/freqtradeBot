A blockchain having zero nodes running is just like deleting a file or like a torrent file reaching zero seeders.",

      "body": "If you made a token on a blockchain and that blockchain stopped being \"maintained\" (ie mined) the value of your token would have probably become worthless before the chain did. If it didn't, you'd be able to take a snapshot of the blockchain at a time and tell everyone their coins are available on a different chain (most snapshots are announced before they occur to stop actors like exchanges from stealing money, but they don't have to be).",

      "body": "Your crypto will become worthless or lose value if the main blockchain crumbles because the underlying blockchain support no longer exists and there is no assurance that your crypto will survive.However, it may be necessary to migrate your crypto to another blockchain or network to make sure it's survival like other coins out there they migrate to ERC20 or TRC20 to survive.",

Maybe true that other experts said, if you save the file on blockchain, your file is saved forever until doomsday or internet shut down.",
