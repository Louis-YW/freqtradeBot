Most times we can also let them out to the public and seek their opinion, but it's our personal life, so it's private to us, and we don't need anyone to know about it in an open space. The same way we have free means of entering the forum without any government or individual approval, so I see it as the same way anyone can leave the forum, irrespective of what reputation they have gathered; It's their choice, which I can't stand to question. The good part among the two mentioned members is that they announce their existence, which will save a lot of stress in the future from their accounts being hacked and impersonated. Maybe the second user's account will be tagged or locked, to avoid it being hacked and used by anyone, just like that of your 1st example.",

By this, they have many different reasons to leave the forum.Struggle to rank up?Reason is they did not contribute enough to rank up. If they have good contributions, ranking up is not a big challenge for them.Quote from: LoyceV on December 05, 2023, 07:53:25 AMShow me[/url] 50 users with good English (or Dutch) posts) who need 10 to 50 Merit to reach their next rank, and I'll bump them up.

You only rank up when you get up to a particular number of merit and to get that number of merit requires that you have made a reasonable amount of quantity post that has the tendency of yielding merits.No doubt, it can get frustrating at times and if care is not taken one can become seriously uninterested in the forum and might even give up along the way. But knowing that nothing good comes that easy should be your motivating and should guide you to put in the needed effort in making quality post and replies that will get you meritedIt's not always easy but I think it's a good thing that encourage one to bring out the smartness in them if you have the intention of ranking up anytime soon.",

With dozens of post created daily, its natural that not all are gonna given merits depends on its quality of post. Newbies only complain if they dont understand what quality means. Some even got merit with a slight response but that is probably helpful for others. Before clicking something make sure you are contributing in a simplest or even helpful way. Theres no path to success right away.  You as a user just need to put up some effort or analyze well some topics.",

If they became more experience and knowledgeable for sure they can reach their goals especially to rank up in this forum.Also everyone has their own reason why they left in this forum and for sure anyone not only him will came to that point especially if the reason is so important than anything else. Also its not about what they build here but rather those important aspects in life maybe they see more better opportunity outside that's why they suddenly left. And we should not feel bad about it since for sure the person you put as example is for sure happy for his decision made.The only requirements need to reach your desired rank is to do a lot of research since everything will be placed in right time especially if lot of people see you as good contributor of this forum and for sure you provably receive those merit that you wanted.",

Speaking about the beginners struggle to rank up, it's just an excuse because nowadays beginners are easier to rank up than before. When they achieve 8 merits, they will get extra 2 merits to become Member rank. When they achieve 80 merits, they will get extra 20 merits to become Full Member.When they achieve 200 merits, they will get extra 50 merits to become Senior Member. But, if they make a report to merit sources who want to help users that lack of merits to rank up and there's nothing wrong with that.",

This forum is just a discussion platform where people share and gain knowledge about the crypto space. People engage in other engagements outside the forum that might make them stop posting on the forum, so it is not necessarily government policy. Some members might have secured a more demanding job that gives them no time to engage in discussions. Others might want to go back to school or pursue a skill and they need time to focus. Members of the forum also take their privacy seriously so we might never know why they left the forum. Like in the case of BlackHatCoiner, where he just started a goodbye thread and locked it immediately because he didn't want any discussion. However, I saw a member who is taking a break from the forum because of health issues. health issues. The forum is a free community that you can walk in and walk out at will.",

Because most of the users in our forum tend to hide their identity. Moreover, due to the rules and regulations of many countries, they keep many of their information secret.

Maybe they have their personal reasons or just feed up on what is going on with the community, specially the latest one that our dear administrator Theymos has to say about mixer here. We might or might not agree with this decision, and perhaps those who are not agreement chooses to just go out moving forward with their lives outside of the forum, simply as that.I'm not sure that luck has something to do with it though, yeah they got a lot of merits but so are others who are still here.",
