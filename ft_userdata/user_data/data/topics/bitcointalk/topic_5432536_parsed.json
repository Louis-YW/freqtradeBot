If you use a @yahoo email account, consider signing up with a different email domain address.@HrN: Leveraging the warning that they have against using yahoo email accounts, have you tried opening a ticket in their support platform in order to change your account e-mail address[2] to another provider (I recommend a Proton e-mail)? I find it really odd that they haven't responded to any of your support tickets in the past month, I guess you'll just have to keep pushing them? On a second notice, they do have a reddit account[3] - u/blockchainwallet - and it seems that they watch the r/bitcoin sub for problems regarding their service. If you follow this[4] thread, the user got a very similar problem to yours and blockchain.com user account actually provided feedback - however I'm unsure if the user did get his/her problem fixed. Since it's already 6 months older, perhaps you could open a new thread over at r/bitcoin and see if someone also is having a similar problem than yours?[1]https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/4417092625044-How-can-I-update-my-personal-details-[2]https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[3]https://libreddit.spike.codes/user/blockchainwallet[4]https://libreddit.spike.codes/r/Bitcoin/comments/loviqa/comment/gr450xo/?context=3",

If it doesn't then I don't think it can solve OP's problem. OP can't log in because he uses a new IP, so the client he uses doesn't really matter afaik. CMIIW.Quote from: HrN on December 31, 2022, 05:55:35 PMI also sent them +10 DM on twitter...That's really weird. Have you tried mentioning them in one of your tweets before you sent a DM? Maybe they never check DMs unless you ping them first. But if you don't have a ticket ID, I think it will be a bit difficult for them to follow up since they always ask for it. It's horrible customer support for sure. I also suggest checking the Reddit account posted above. They don't seem that active but they respond in a timely manner if there's a new thread about them.",

That service has always been bad in every way, and if anyone has any funds there, I suggest they pull them as soon as possible.",

So, you my try to configure your yahoo mail in gamil; this way you can receive yahoo mails in gamil account. Here is the step by step procedure to configure: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825If this solves your problem of delayed receiving of mails from blockchain.com; I guess you will be able to reset your password and able to access your funds.
