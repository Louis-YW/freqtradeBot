It's much more reputed than one I mentioned. One thing to note, Eruda works in background, kiwi doesn't. Quote from: dimonstration on May 14, 2023, 06:24:31 PMFellow android user. You can use this script too using  your mobile phone by installing Kiwi browser. Kiwi browser has a developer feature which allows you to run this script same as using the desktop browser. You just need to make your phone screen on while the script is running to make it continuously running. It will pause when you put the browser in the background or your phone sleep.",

I didn't change anything on the forum's end, so imgur must've loosened up their limits. I guess it's not necessary to convert img images into links as long as imgur keeps working. But to prevent this from happening again, you'll get an error if you try to embed imgur images in posts from now on.I'd like to create a page which recommends services for hosting forum images, and mention this in the error message you get when you try to use imgur.

Me I have already made up my mind that I am not using imgur image uploader again because what will happen in the future might even worst than this. I will also prefer using TalkImg for all my image uploading. And since Talkimg. com creator is even a member of the forum, it make things easier because he here with us to communicate how he will fix any error occurred in the future.
