  "content": "This simple write-up might educate those that are confused or unaware of how to effectively utilize their BTC, particularly the new adopters. The reason why we bought it in the first place should have told us what we want to use it for unless we just bought it without a plan. But don't be surprised that some only participate in HODL (buy and hold) strategy, which makes me believe they are underutilizing it. Imagine those that started buying it at $55,000, what could have been their fate now? Also, opportunities must have been missed by waiting for it to return above the level. Personally, I bought my BTC for reasons to maximize the benefits, and the reasons are in three parts as shown below;1. I bought the ones I hold in a separate non-custodial wallet and nothing would ever make me touch them in decades (HODL).2. I bought the ones I hold on an exchange when I speculate a bullish market for it, but exchange them for a stablecoin when a bearish market is detected (I repeat the process often).3. I bought the ones I use for spots and futures trading, and I exchange part of my profits regularly to fiat, pay for external transactions and add more funds to my non-custodial wallet as explained in reason 1.With these, BTC is effectively utilized by me, and I hope others could do the same.",

      "body": "It's worth to mention holding your coins on exchanges increase many risk of losing your coins, so it's better to transfer the coins from your own non custodial wallet to the exchanges and convert it to stable coin rather than hold it on exchange.I think most people who bought Bitcoin at $55,000 already cut loss since Bitcoin price doesn't increase over than $22,000. But don't forget people who bought Bitcoin at $19K on 2017, if they're very patient, they already multiply their capital for 3x times since the highest Bitcoin's ATH is $69K on the last year.",

Best to have the coin on a noncustodial wallet, when you want to convert it, move it to a reputed exchange and convert it to the fiat or stable coin of your choice and move the fiat or coin to your bank account or a noncustodial wallet of your choice.Never leave coins on exchanges unless you are using the coins to trade frequently.",

That mainly depends whether that person bought bitcoin for the first time, or its a seasoned veteran who buys bitcoin in regular intervals, no matter the price ( I fall into the 2nd category as I bought some bitcoin around that price but I also bought it when price was only few thousands. I think that situation is different compared to 2018 and even newbies are more willing to hodl bitcoin through bear market as I know a couple of those who bought bitcoin for the first time during recent bull run are still (afaik) hodling so people are slowly realizing that this is just temporary and that there will be another bull run and that they will profit if they suck it up.",

Even the biggest ones like Tether. That's not to mention the risk of the company freezing your funds.",

My points are based on three parts, the second part is to move it between BTC and USDT frequently, so is it not an exchange that could do that for me cost-effectively? Even though the third part has justified it already, I still move my earnings to fiat and non-custodial wallet in addition to the first point. So, an exchange does not hold my money for so long, which is a good and safe deal for me.Quote from: Findingnemo on October 11, 2022, 05:30:14 AMRemember you are suggesting to the newbies so with the buy and sell according to the market movements so they can make more profits is simply asking them to take higher risks.

I can't force anything on anyone, it's an advice to those that want to replicate. There is no wrong in trying to maximize our utilization of BTC, which I tried to explain above just the way I do mine. Some could do less, while some would even do more than I explained above.
