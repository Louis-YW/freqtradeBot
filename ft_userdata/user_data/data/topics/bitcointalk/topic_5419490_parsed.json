What they are forgetting is that the stocks that lose value are from companies that have employees and are now losing a lot of money. In other words this is affecting millions of employed people.Remember the aftermath of 2008 stock market crash. It wasn't just stock market investors who lost money, it was all the employees that lost their jobs because the companies with shares that got dumped had to downsize, shut down, etc. that eliminated over a million jobs with millions of unemployed people most of whom became homeless.This also highlights the importance of having a well diversified portfolio. Look at bitcoin for example. When stock market started crashing bitcoin crashed too (which in my opinion was an emotional and irrational response) but it stopped because there is no correlation between bitcoin and stock market. While stock market continued crashing, bitcoin remained strong and is now starting to slowly go back up again too.Having other sources of income and a decent portfolio is very important at times like this when you are facing a cost of living crisis accompanied by looming threat of unemployment.",

We can confirm bitcoin is starting to have a strong bull run but it can be seen that it is resisting a new drop quite well, it can be said that bitcoin is starting to show its effectiveness in this crisis. I think after the crisis is over people will have a different view of bitcoin and they will have to know what to do to protect themselves from future crises, bitcoin is inevitable.Chart facebook(Meta)",

Seems like an obvious outcome to losing the vast majority of your supplies, equal to a gold mining company losing mineral rights on their major source of extraction. Companies should be more diversified otherwise this is inevitable and shows that there was a degree of high risk management going on. Then again, the sole purpose of some companies is to act as a shell around one particular purpose and it can more easily be closed now that there is little hope of mending relations with Russia, at least when it comes to oil and gas imports where they clearly cannot be trusted as a reliable partner again. Single companies crash and burn all the time, it's not a big deal.",

If they can’t find solution for this, they might suffer for a longer problem and their inflation continues to rise as well.

But if they did care, they might find it remarkable.It wasn't just the banking institutions that the government bailed out, they were happy to bail out other industries too. I understand why the federal government would want to keep the banking institutions from collapsing. After all, it's the government that aimed at creating more home owners in the first place which ended up incentivizing the creation of sub prime mortgages. In any event, with how incestuous the relationship is between the government and banking institutions, their bail out was a given.I'm generally not in favor of using tax payer money for the government to pick which industries are worthy of saving. Jobs are at risk when these companies collapse, but it seems to me a recovery is quicker when the businesses that can't responsibly manage themselves are taken out of the market for newer businesses to form.",

Considering your example of 2008 fall and also various after shocks it’s evident that people tend to sell everything they have. This is not caused only by the investors selling though, it is mainly because these companies and industries are shrinking. The worst effects are obviously on energy companies (like Uniper) but others are being affected too. For example the German car industry is not doing well either, so is the food industry in most of Europe including the fertilizer industry.Another reason for industrial failure in Europe is that most of them are in a very competitive global market. For example the automotive industry. There are other competitors elsewhere that aren't affected by the same inflation and high energy costs as EU so they can continue manufacturing car parts for example at much cheaper prices and put their European competitors out of business in long run and if they play their cards right.The governments may print a lot of money to bail some of them out for now but eventually they have to choose between only 2 options. Do what China did or what US did. China lowered their fiat value to gain even more edge but that means even bigger inflation in Europe as euro dumps. And that's only if China doesn't compete here too and if the energy crisis doesn't get worse next year.US industries simply transferred a lot of industries abroad but that means high unemployment in Europe as they don't take their workers with them!",

Also, I like the op's observation that stocks aren't just numbers, but there are companies behind them and jobs behind those companies. So when a stock goes down, employers, employees, and stock investors lose. But, I'd add, this is what makes Bitcoin a bit better: if it falls, only investors suffer, since there is no company with employees losing their jobs whenever Bitcoin is down, at least not the way it is with stocks.",

This agenda is really coming up in the world lately that more people have started coming to that reality that this phenomena that is confronting them will further impoverish them if they don't do anything to it. The global recession gradually creeping in is what I think has quickened inflation that prices are skyhigh and having more income is what equilibrium that people sort after. Nigeria is not left out in this and having capital to go into more investment is the real challenge because you have hardly got out of feeding, payment of house rent, children school feeds and other huge expenses. Moreover, approaching the banks for loan is even more difficult this time because you definitely need to provide some collateral and the percentage rate is overwhelmingly high.",

Uniper) -> inflation goes even higher -> fiat tanks even more -> government increases interest rate (to fight tanking) -> recession gets worse -> people don't have money to spend -> ....They recently ran a survey basically about cost of living in Germany among \"regular people\" focusing on Christmas since it is close.

Wohlrabe: \"Some products will be missing on the shelves there.\"In an INSA survey conducted by BILD, almost every third citizen (31 percent) stated that they had no money this year to buy Christmas presents for their loved ones because of inflation.Among citizens who have a net household income of less than 2000 euros, almost half will not be able to buy presents for Christmas this year.",

Cant agree more. If you are doing a job then you must develop other source of income too since in current uncertain environment you can lose job in blink of an eye. Btcointalk.org is also a good source of income as you can easily easy up to 200$ here from signature campaigns.I have a point of view about stock market investment, stock market crashes many time in history but it has the capability to bounce back every time. So as an investor its best time to buy when stock market crashes and same holds true to bitcoin too. We buy bitcoin only when it goes up and we refrain from buying when bitcoin is down as it is right now. I remember in 2008 in my country Pakistan stock market was shut down for months due to massive crash but eventually it regains its lost value. But yes it took some time.",
