Well this is true that no law holds anyone but technically they are luring users of this forum and to those who don't know about the site to start making use of it even though they are scam it doesn't affects its promoter right? To me it shows how selfish they are for not at least making this forum a better place for other people as bitcoiner, this shows you can encourage scam on the forum right? actually we know that the forum doesn't moderate scam but we the active users should try our best to eliminate scam and make this place home lovable by everyone and not a place to be recording more scamming people and their projects. The question is does the well known youtuber has a any basic knowledge that such site he is promoting is a scamming one?",

They will advertise whatever they get paid for. This is why I don't trust YouTube. Whatever is placed there must be subject to verification. At one time, I spent a lot of time watching many videos about how people on the forum, participating in bounty, made millions. But everyone grows up one day and stops trusting those who care only about their own interests. Do you think YouTubers, when they say something in their videos, are doing it selflessly?Quote from: libert19 on September 27, 2023, 06:21:58 AMHowever, in one of videos that I watched recently he promoted the 1xbet which is obvious scam gambling site.

It is better to stay away from any online casino that startes with 1X. Indian Youtubers are least bothered in checking the background of the sponsoring organization. They only think it as another opportunity of earning with their YouTube advertisement revenue. Indian influencers do not get high ad revenue like their counterparts based in the West. Then India doesn't have any law at the moment that can put influencers behind the bar for promoting scam. Many celebrities have also promoted scam projects in the past resulting in huge loss of public money. They are still roaming freely.",

You cant blame the guy for not knowing the bad reputation these guys have around the internet, because firstly his not a gambler, secondly these are the kind of gigs these guys look for to get easy money!Besides, I have noticed on how aggressive 1xbet is with promotions and using the most happening influencers currently in so many different countries and surprisingly nobody puts them to their defense with the bad reputation!!

No matter how popular and honest I think you are, most of the people who create videos on YouTube are just doing it for their own selfish interests, all they care about is the money they will be paid. He agrees to market for 1xBet without doing proper research about the gambling site, maybe it’s a legitimate site or a scam site, or maybe he knows that the site is a scam site, he just decides to ignore that and still decides to market for them just because of the amount that he is going to be paid.

I have seen different signature campaigns that have been stopped by managers just because they are being accused of scams. Before a manager launches any signature campaign, they will have done a proper invention about the signature campaign which they are about to launch, and if after launching a campaign, the site is being accused, the manager will immediately put a stop to the campaign. The investigation, which you should do, the manager will have already done it before accepting to promote the project, if they notice any red flags, then they won't even accept the offer. But its still better to do your investigation before joining any signature campaign and if you notice anything suspicious, you can inform the manager.",

We also have influencers advertising acholic drinks that are harmful to the body when abused and tobacco too. It's like a normal thing for celebrities (influencers) to be smoking cannabis on social media even when they know their followers might copy them and it's so annoying seeing all this happen and yet nothing is been done about it.

Money is not everything so we should not be blinded by financial gains and assist a firm in defrauding or scam the public.
