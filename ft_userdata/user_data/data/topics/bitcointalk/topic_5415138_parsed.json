  "content": "DYOR has become a regular slang in the crypto space that its even used often than its needed. I beg to say this that many crypto enthusiast who use this word don't even know how to start a research about a project. Some feel it starts and ends in chart patterns, ATHs and ATLs. Making research about a project goes beyond mere candle stick interpretations and its even deeper than price actions and volatility, Market Capitalisation and total supply can be considered as a measure for predicting a good project but its way deeper than that. Not all white papers are even sincere enough to stick to the plan of  the project.A project that will be profitable on a long run must have an active community and a good Moderation most especially for a decentralised project. Such project must have good engagements and rules governing the community. The mod will be active to attend to complaints, disputes, questions and the next plans or phase of the project. This way you can tell if there is possible liquidation in the near future.I am not saying studying price action and candle sticks don't have a part to play in determining how far a project will last. But i feel the best way to know the intent of something is through engagement. A research can't be done outside it's main domain which is it's community. To get the best of any project at all it takes active participation, question and contributions that way you can tell if a project has the tendency to last on a long term goal",

Trading is the only sphere were people are told to do their own research, and it's not a coincidence - this phrase is just a waver of responsibility.

A project can be liken to a coin, token, NFT, or any other digital asset. It is like an umbrella housing different digital asset class. To avoid making too much complexity in differentiating them, project is more collective enough to group all together. If we chose to use crypto to address them all most digital asset are not crypto related so i think its better addressing them as project",

Still need to know how to \"read\" all things, communities, engagements... For example, what is the value and what can the community tell us, where more than 70% of members came through the condition for participation in the airdrop or bounty program?",

A well established coins like bitcoin is different from just a project that is new. Your point is valid if a project is new, but I do not see it valid when it comes to coins like bitcoin.Quote from: Zilon on September 27, 2022, 08:23:02 PMI am not saying studying price action and candle sticks don't have a part to play in determining how far a project will last.

The price is studied not because of how the project would last, but to know when the bear and bull market periods.Quote from: Zilon on September 27, 2022, 08:23:02 PMA research can't be done outside it's main domain which is it's community. Not valid if it is not a new project. I do not have to know much about the high marketcap coins like bitcoin, ether and litecoin before I would know that they are worth going for and only research more about what the price could be at some point in time. But I have much believe in bitcoin than any other coins.Quote from: Zilon on September 27, 2022, 08:23:02 PMTo get the best of any project at all it takes active participation, question and contributions that way you can tell if a project has the tendency to last on a long term goalNot all projects are new. Yet some projects have all these qualifications in the past and yet failed.I would advice newbies to just go for coins like bitcoin, instead of new projects. You posts is more about new projects.",

I hear all analysis always ends with DYOR. Since crypto is close to the project then in fact it is very similar. Whether it's analysis on the project or technical analysis, fundamental analysis on trading.  This means that there are predictions made by people, but those predictions are uncertain, meaning that those predictions still have a chance to be wrong. Therefore the predictor leaves the final decision to the reader. But sometimes someone's predictions also provide a little knowledge and sometimes we can compare with other people's and add our own analysis.",

The particular coin/project you are doing your research on is absolutely important, you can follow the 'activities', 'team work' and 'roadmap' of a worthless/pump and dump coin/project all you want, and even if it prolly looked good at the beginning of your research, that won't stop the coin from dumping sooner rather than later, because that is what pump and dump coins do. Thus imo, first things first is to do a mini research about coins that are sustainable/long term, before selecting and then doing your full research on it before investing.",
