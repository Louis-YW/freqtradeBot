  "content": "One of the largest Pension plans in the world situated at Canada the Ontario Teachers' Pension plans has written off the total Investment the have pilled up in the collapsed/bankrupt FTX exchange in their report the suggested it will be treated as potential fraudThe pension giants writes off $95 million invested in the bankrupt crypto exchange but expresses their complete disappointment after the  affected exchange filled for bankruptcy protection. Their total worth in asset under management (AUM) is over $250 million. The financial loss from the investment will have little or no effect on the plan as reported by the Ontario Teachers'Quote\"The financial loss from this investment will have limited impact on the Plan, given its size relative to our total net assets and our strong financial position,\" said Ontario Teachers'. \"However, we are disappointed with the outcome of this investment, take all losses seriously and will use this experience to further strengthen our approach.\".This is not the first time large large Canadian Pension plan got affected by crypto-related issues. Quote This isn't the first time a large Canadian pension fund got caught up in the crypto-related contagion. This past August, Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec – with more than $300 billion in AUM – wrote down its entire $150 million investment in failed crypto lender Celsius Network.If there were no reserve funds from Ontario it would have been a lost investment for this retirees and there are other hidden stories of start-up pension plans that invested in crypto through various networks and got either scammed or lost their investment for various reasons. I wish there will be good sensitisation for the aged on how best to save their investment to avoid being a victim of future exchange crash, because this might have some negative image about Bitcoin when brought up to the victims of this planslink",

      "body": "This issue isn't exclusive to the crypto industry. 401ks and pension plans have been battered by stock losses over the last two years. Even Warren Buffett could be losing money with his current stock investments in known trades. Such as his recent selling of wells fargo to buy citigroup stock. Inflation also is not having positive effects on retirement and pension plans, despite assurances that it would only be temporary and transitory in nature. It is not only pension plans on the crypto side which are taking a beating. Its happening everywhere. Everyone's pension and retirement plans are being demolished whether they're denominated in fiat or crypto. I don't think anyone would argue that the FTX situation is very strange. The number of exchange hacks in 2022 is very strange. When crypto was first introduced into the finance world there was something called cold wallets which were used to prevent these types of hacks. If we want a legitimate discussion we can pose a question of why crypto finance which was founded upon principles of reliability and durability drifted away from the use of cold wallets as a standard protocol.",

I know a lot of people that have studied finance that seem to be bad at managing their own - it's probably the same for their companies too and further into a wider scope of the sector. I think a lot of pension schemes are insured against losses or use fancy derivatives to make more money out of risky investments than they'd lose by not doing (but this might be my clearly skeptical view of the sector - big companies are hard to run efficiently).I think the same also happens with a lot of startups getting investments from pensions schemes. If a company is forecast to go from a valuation of $40bn to $200bn, there's going to be some level of risk investing in it - that's pretty obvious.",

Even though I have myself invested heavily on bitcoin, I strongly believe that such a volatile asset must not be used for any kind of retirement funds. Unless that retirement fund is extremely agile and knows how to get out of a market in a second's notice. Bitcoin and crypto market is good for young lads who has time in hand. Bitcoin can offer a great return but it can also offer super disappointment just like what happened to this one! I completely understand that the loss is happening due to the collapse of an exchange but even crypto market offers same kind of risk. Unless someone can get out of the market at the right time and re-enter again at optimum low, it makes no sense to have crypto as an investment. It's the most riskiest asset in the world!",

It's that they were expected to show gains every month, every year. And there are years BTC price is going downwards. Even more, lately stocks and gold also didn't look good afaik. And then what else can get the numbers up? Shitcoins and derived businesses, yay! I guess that most of those investors failed to gasp that shitcoins are significantly more risky than bitcoin (I expect they were taught the stocks are risky and bitcoin is already off their chart).So I see it just as a simple and direct result of the pressure on getting positive results continuously and the current economic state.",
