Ordinals are different from the old NFTs, they are using bitcoin for their own non fungible tokens. There was a time that Omni layer for USDT was a common transaction on on bitcoin blockchain, no one thought it is not ideal. That one is still not actually bitcoin transfer on bitcoin blockchain, but altcoin transfer on bitcoin blockchain.

And they should really use OP_RETURN, not a Taproot hack.So in general I'm \"leaning against\" inscriptions, but not against the Ordinals concept in general.I see the benefit of a simple yes/no question (I'm aware of the problems of polls in general  ) but in this case I'd have liked some few more options, or a poll with a Likert scale (from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly oppose\"). However, even with it's minimalist design, it's interesting what the outcome of this poll will be.Quote from: tromp on March 13, 2023, 07:01:26 AMYes, ordinals help create a fee-market that's necessary in the long term.That would actually a much more biased poll design, because you're mentioning a positive aspect for one of the options, but not for the other one. I think also a fee market should exist, but within financial-type transactions (which can include contracts, options and even OP_RETURN based tokens with low data consumption). We're currently still near the bottom of a bear market, thus fees are low. If inscriptions stay popular while a bull market is entering its advanced stages, a big influx of large inscriptions could seriously impact Bitcoin's usability, a second \"end 2017\" scenario would be likely.",

      "body": "Well there have been significant improvement to transaction propagation and output selection in the core software (that were made since 2017) that will likely be mitigating against these attacks in real time. I personally do not think that this niche tech-art is going to threaten the current state of the network especially since it is highly ineffecient, is likely a zero sum profit game, requires centralized systems to operate, and seems to carry little to no social weight amongst organic bitcoin users. Things like this are kind-of annoying but I think the network has succeeded in preventing these types of nuisances from becoming a major issue.In some sense it is worth considering only how do we promote the most efficient network possible, banning something that just uses the current state of the software is literally impossible. We need to incentivize healthy usage, and for the most part we do. In fact if it weren't a well-off mining pool making all these huge transactions they would almost certainly not occur since they are unprofitable. (if something like this were to be sold at a profit I would almost certainly consider it a scam) Never sell 2 bitcoins for 1 bitcoin trust me haha.",

Even Satoshi wrote about trading Bitcoin for BitDNS domains:Quote from: satoshi on December 10, 2010, 05:29:28 PMFears about securely buying domains with Bitcoins are a red herring.  It's easy to trade Bitcoins for other non-repudiable commodities.If you're still worried about it, it's cryptographically possible to make a risk free trade.  The two parties would set up transactions on both sides such that when they both sign the transactions, the second signer's signature triggers the release of both.  The second signer can't release one without releasing the other.However, he also wrote that putting full data related to other assets is not a good idea:Quote from: satoshi on December 10, 2010, 05:29:28 PMPiling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale.Bitcoin and BitDNS can be used separately.  Users shouldn't have to download all of both to use one or the other.  BitDNS users may not want to download everything the next several unrelated networks decide to pile in either.The networks need to have separate fates.  BitDNS users might be completely liberal about adding any large data features since relatively few domain registrars are needed, while Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices.That means he approved BitDNS, but not by putting all of those domains' details into Bitcoin transactions. And this is the problem with ordinals: the concept may be acceptable, but not the way how it is done.QuoteAnd they should really use OP_RETURN, not a Taproot hack.Even better: they could use OP_RETURN inside TapScript (and then stop worrying about any size limits, except those enforced by separate network for ordinals). Then, the owner of a particular Taproot address can always reveal TapScript in some ordinals network, while it will be guaranteed that this TapScript will never be pushed on-chain.

      "body": "Quoteblock data does not designate which the opreturn/meme goes to.. is it A or B?Simple, it can be selected inside OP_RETURN, as a part of the protocol, also because there are no size limits, because it will be never pushed on-chain. It is just a way to choose any data, and link it to some bc1p address, with a proof that it is linked, so it cannot be modified by any third party. And then, all rules are controlled by separate network that will store those commitments. Of course, you can put only your image and nothing else, but then it is your fault that you didn't specify the destination in your commitment. And if you use a protocol that didn't specify it, then blame the protocol designers, that they didn't prepare some OP_RETURN format that will track ownership correctly.Also note that when you reveal your OP_RETURN commitment, then you also reveal some public key first, that has to be tweaked by TapScript, to match your bc1p address. So, you can easily use that public key to control ownership, or even execute it recursively in your network, if you really need that.Another thing is if you want to make commitments, then you don't need any Taproot addresses at all, because it was always possible, even with P2PK outputs. Every time you spend your coins, you have to attach some signature. It has R-value (that has to be a valid point on secp256k1), and s-value. So, if you want to create new commitment for any output that uses OP_CHECKSIG, you can get this R-value, convert it into Taproot address, and then check if your commitment matches that R-value. To do that, you can first produce a normal signature without ordinals, by using any wallet, then use that R-value as a Taproot key to be tweaked, then add some TapScript, and publish a signature using modified R-value instead.",

I think the use of NFTs for crappy randomly generated images is pretty stupid. If it was like an actual art scene that would be a bit more interesting, but its just companies/people putting out collections of generated stupid images and the fad driven NFT crowd being gullible enough to pay real money for it. There are MUCH more interesting uses for non-fungible technology but it seems the whole market has adopted the \"NFTs are images\" idea which is lame. But as for them being on Bitcoin that's perfectly fine it is just another use case for Bitcoin. BUT the problem of course is that they just spam the blockchain. This is not what Bitcoin is for and it crowds out the main reason for Bitcoin's existence, which is to be money and allow currency transactions.If NFTs only took up as much space as a normal transaction that would be fine, or better yet if they were done on a side chain where all the extra NFT data was stored on the side chain that'd be perfect. I could care less about NFTs on Bitcoin, but spamming and filling up the blocks with stupid image data is terrible for Bitcoin and the Bitcoin community and its viability in the future.",
