Even I started with Bitcoin, like some of my Bitcoins before were converted to altcoins and I lost so much, after that I learned the lesson and started to hold and focus more on Bitcoin instead of altcoins.",

So they also take advantage of an opportunity like this, and even with the airdrops of other platform protocols, they also do it because this is the right timing for them.But when the bear market season comes, the airdrops will gradually quiet down in the market, so what is happening is normal based on what I see.",

However, yes, there are quite a few people who invest in Altcoins that are of poor quality with the aim of getting rich quickly, but those who are lucky will indeed get extraordinary profits and of course they will not give up on investing in Altcoins or others. However, those who experience losses will certainly give up on investing in Altcoins and will definitely end up investing in Bitcoin because they learn from experience and think that Bitcoin is the safest crypto.To be honest, I was also in a situation where I experienced losses due to investing in Altcoins that were not of good quality and up to now I believe Bitcoin is still the safest but I also invested in Altcoins but only a little but still the money I use most is to buy Bitcoin most of the because I personally have tasted the sweetness of investing in bitcoin.Yes, experience is a valuable teacher and indeed beginners sometimes experience losses when they invest because they are not investing in Bitcoin. However, experiencing bitter experiences has made some people realize that BTC is the best.",

Quite the opposite, we do have businesses that accept crypto as payment method and the government is not sitting on the sidelines when it comes to crypto regulations either. The present government has managed to force Binance and other exchanges to stop p2p trading in the country.

Many people condemn cryptocurrency, Bitcoin inclusive,  after the lose money through scam. It is only those who are able to do some findings and discover that not all cryptocurrencies are bad, that happens to stick to Bitcoin knowing that it is different from the rest. Some people I started with have shifted from Bitcoin to other areas siting risk and scam that are prevalent in cryptocurrency. If you actually know how many scams some of us suffer in this journey, then you will understand why they took those decisions.

Many people who are investing in Bitcoin are attracted by the instant profit promised by some altcoin projects. These projects usually promise to give high profit that some greedy or uninformed people might not be able to resist the offer. When they are scammed, some of them will decide to leave the crypto space and never invest in the sector again. While others, through learning and experience, will come to realize that Bitcoin is the most reliable crypto. This might make them abandon altcoins and focus on only Bitcoin. It is just a two-way thing; a failed crypto project will discourage some people from investing. While others might decide to choose only Bitcoin because of a failed project.

Talking about investment, we all have different views, of course Bitcoin has good value for everyone, including investors, but we cannot force investors to return to Bitcoin, actually they know the positive and negative things in investing, whether it's Bitcoin or other types of crypto.As far as I know, investors currently have high desires, minimal capital and want big profits, that's what Altcoins are, they know the risks faced by projects that could die without being able to return the initial capital, considering that the current price of Bitcoin is high, it is quite difficult to choose Bitcoin as a core investment, indeed Bitcoin should be an option, but this understanding makes many investors feel difficult because Bitcoin must have large capital.",

But there are also some other people who think that because there are so many scam projects created and that has caused many people to misunderstand that bitcoin is also one of them, and that is why many people call Bitcoin a scam.  Having many altcoin projects helps the market become more diverse and competitive, thereby giving investors more choices. But with many projects created but not strictly regulated, it leaves the market rife with scams and gives the cryptocurrency industry a bad reputation. So, it's hard to say that the failure of altcoin projects is a good thing for bitcoin.",
