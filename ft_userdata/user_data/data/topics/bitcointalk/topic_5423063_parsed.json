  "content": "A group of creditors of Genesis Global Capital is organizing and hiring an attorney to negotiate with Genesis on a path forward to avoid a drawn-out bankruptcy. The group already represents a large share of Genesis' liabilities.A BitFinex-like outcome is better than a MtGox-like outcome, but this will require a collective effort. If one creditor goes their own way and forces Genesis to file for bankruptcy, everyone may end up worse off.If you are a current direct client of Genesis, please email genesiscreditors@protonmail.com (not me) to get in touch with the group. If you are a Gemini Earn client, this is not for you, as Gemini is the creditor on your behalf in that case.I'm using a new account for privacy, but you can confirm this isn't a scam by going here (not me):https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1593243570051239942Please spread the word to other large holders you may know.",
