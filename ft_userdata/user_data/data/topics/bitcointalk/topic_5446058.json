Thanks to bitcoin for it existence in this difficult time of life.I am one of the many people who are greatly helped by the presence of Bitcoin. Honestly I get extra income through Bitcoin investment and from this forum. I feel grateful because while many people my age in my country are experiencing financial difficulties and are looking for work, I can still make money and meet my daily needs and it's all thanks to Bitcoin.",

I understand what you are saying,  and I somehow feel your pain. In developing countries bitcoin is much more needed than in developed countries.  I am from Brazil and I can say that bitcoin made things way easier here  , specially for those who want to send their money abroad (in investment or just traveling)In Nigeria bitcoin is probably way more important",

In bitcoin the rich, poor and middle class can go into it, this is to say bitcoin is for every body.This is true, imagine all the challenges we all have to face in economic issues if bitcoin doesn't exist. Let's say not all in the world are knowledgeable about bitcoin and how it can provide your needs such as jobs and life investments. In my country, let's say you earn $100 dollar which equivalent to P5000 which is enough to provide your needs for a week. And some of the campaigns provide a weekly payment for all the members. This is one of the jobs I have think for bitcoin which helps a lot for people who's unemployed. Also investing from bitcoin and doing trading also could be consider as a full time job since you have to look for the possible outcome in the market to gain profits. And those profits is enough for people to earn enough like an employed person.QuoteWith the recent challenge in Nigeria where the resigni of their currency has caused scarcity of flow of cash which is really affecting the citizens, I know bitcoin will also make a good contribution in this case because lots of young people in the country are engage to bitcoin. In different occasions of economic crisis in the world bitcoin has always been there to play a good role. Thanks to bitcoin for it existence in this difficult time of life.It's expected that whenever an economic crisis occurs there will always be an impact to the bitcoin. Sometimes it plays a huge role like such making bitcoin pump and often dump. So I must say that bitcoin is a good alternative source of income and assets incase an economic problems happen that would affect the money for example is the inflation which is very common.",

The high rate of inflation would have caused so many bitcoiners to be hopeless assuming they didnt adopt bitcoin. Bitcoin has made individuals to be self employed in terms of trading and mining. In my country the rate of poverty is alarming due to hardship caused by recession. CBN has failed to circulate cash in the country which is adding value to more hardship in the country.With the ugly situation the fiat currency is passing through and banks collapsing,assuming there is no asset like Bitcoin where will those customers who have lost trust in their banks safe their money. Bitcoin is a store of value to many businessmen currently. I also keep my savings in bitcoin so that inflation won't depreciate my funds.",

In bitcoin there is no monopoly like other ROIs. The recent collapse or rather bankruptcy of banks will have left many stranded if at all bitcoin hasn’t came to light. Regardless of its massive advantage to humanity I don’t buy the idea of people having to invest all their little earnings in it just to gain profit. Mentality like this in bitcoin only get people on the losing side. The best way to earn profit easily on bitcoin investment is by holding for long and this can only be accomplished by having extra savings or income outside bitcoin",

Bitcoin can indeed help increase someone's finances, but if someone is able to use it properly.It's true that Bitcoin can actually be reached by everyone and some people have also been helped financially because of Bitcoin, but that only applies if we understand and do it the right way whether it's from investing or trading Bitcoin.Keep in mind that Bitcoin was created as an alternative to fiat currency in digital form but not a get-rich-quick way.
