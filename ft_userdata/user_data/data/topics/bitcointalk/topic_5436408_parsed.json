You have not been scammed but that person tried to scam you. If you checked your email and send funds then you could be scammed. But as you have checked closely to the email associated and/or checked the balance you could know that you have received a false email. Though I doubt you could send the fund.Anyway, my point is that would you like to make us clear proof that this has been sent by the user you have mentioned?",

Also, I can not understand you already made 27 posts today after a long inactivity btw it's another way of making scams. Maybe not a new way but you all should be aware of it. And OP please also try to share the chat between you and jl33213 so that we can tag him.",

However, I do not see clear evidence linking your story to the suspected account. Could you provide the video of your chat conversation and a screenshot of the matching Telegram account that was mentioned in the post?Another thing I don't understand, if you have the funds to exchange, why did you ask for a $50 no collateral loan here?",

Also, I can not understand you already made 27 posts today after a long inactivity What you guys mentioned makes me not feel comfortable about the @OP. Can he answer? Also, he did not attach any Chat Logs with the other person, but from the screenshot that he put, it seems that the other person sent him a fake message for Zelle payments. It is good that he paid attention to the sender's email address, which is not Zelle's official Email. Whoever wants to carry out any financial transaction and guarantee his right, I advise him to do it with people of good reputation and rank in this forum, through central exchange platforms that allow the P2P feature, or through LocalBitcoins.",

The question is whether the story is even true and what his real motives are. It is always best to be cautious and protect ourselves from potential scams, but we should also avoid jumping to conclusions and accusing someone of scamming without solid evidence.
