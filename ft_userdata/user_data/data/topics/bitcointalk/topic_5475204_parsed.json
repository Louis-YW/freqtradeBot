      "body": "The only problem is how to pinpoint what altcoin will increase next. It's true that they might pour their profits into Altcoins like how it was years ago because this is how making profits is but it actually doesn't stay that way for a long time. Once Bitcoin plunged down next it sold those Altcoin to buy Bitcoin back. But I don't think that's now. The FOMO is high in Bitcoin because of the upcoming ETF and then there's the halving. I mean, what is a year to us investors, it will be like waking up the next day and it's already a year. Time flies fast and while they can ride the boat at this price, many investors will use their purchasing power to make a profit when ETF is approved. It's not bad to buy a little bit of those altcoins that you mentioned, just be sure that you are also ready when Bitcoin starts pumping.",

But if you hold on, it's not necessary, just wait for the coins you bought previously to change to USDT or what currency you use. Previously, I tried to explain in that manner, but the deceptive bitcoin maximalists were against me. It is clear that altcoins cannot exist without bitcoin, and we have all seen how bitcoin dictates the bull market. However, I still believe that bitcoin should only be bought by the wealthy and low-risk investors. Although I do not get the clarity of how this market works, I think it might be a little like bitcoin. While some will have the bull and go down through the whole process, some will be there all the way through and some will arrive late. During the bull market, one just needs to catch coins at every stage, but bitcoin will be there throughout",

Splitting your investment to other alts when bullish season is speculated to occur is one of the best decision we do knowing that alts will also pump once bitcoin pumps more higher. Your list of alts is good and I also believe that many are listing it on the coins to have that's why lets hope for the best next year since provably all speculation regarding on top alts to invest discussion will provably gives us positive result.That's how we can play more safer in the market unlike if we invest on new token where for sure the risk is so high and we might not get what we trying to expect since they could potential turn scam immediately that's why we should always go on top alts upon investing.",

It start with Bitcoin > Huge Cap Altcoin > Small Cap Altcoin then the final blow will be pump of all coin no matter how shit it is because everyone is already in profit from different altcoin so traders will keep looking for other tokens that is still not moving. This is the time when they are get rekt since the market will correct once everyone jump out to Bitcoin.Leveraging on top altcoins is really a good idea if Bitcoin pump and read a safe level so that it will not slide down.",

It is possible that a few days from now it will continue to decrease gradually, and I think there will be a bounce in SOL between 38 and 40 dollars based on my technical analysis.  Now, if you are a first-time investor who wants to invest in the above, I think you should study first before you invest in it. That's why it's important that you have knowledge of crypto trading.",

Solana tripled in a week while bitcoin is just increasing 50% from a month ago. some individual coins would surely out perform others in market of every movement.But the overall market trend remains the same whether it be BTC or altlcoins. There could be a sight delay but all of altcoins would fall if bitcoin starts to fall and similar would be seen if it sticks or rises. And at the point, it's difficult to be sure if the market is in it's crest or it's still on the way up.",

Yes that's right. Among the many altcoins, for me only Eth is the best, especially for beginners who don't understand much about crypto, it's better to invest in Eth of course after investing in BTC. because for me Eth is an extraordinary fundamental chain, and So many benefits.QuoteSOL though is kind of good because it really skyrocket weeks ago, it would probably shoot up again when there is another BTC green candle by next month. in a way, most altcoins are dragged up when BTC is having a bull run.

This mini altseason lead some potential projects to their peak, but i think all these project will eventually come back to its previous level before the halving.
