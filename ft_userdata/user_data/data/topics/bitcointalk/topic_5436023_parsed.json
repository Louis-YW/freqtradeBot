Reading this would give you an edge on how to go about this platform so you do not default in anyways. So well to take note of how post are done because some poster do give guidelines on how to respond or make contributions to there post so as to get it flowing accordingly. Just as they have explained above for you, you should note that getting merits is not feasible if you do not make contributions and quality post or if possible activities here too could help you scale through to merits award.",
