If you your net profit is positive, you will be taxed.Quote from: Davidvictorson on March 17, 2023, 07:58:52 AMIf needed, I can request for my yearly statement, which shows how much bet I have placed in that yearOn some gambling sites, you can check for your betting history, the total profit and loss can be seen, but this may differ from one betting site to another.Quote from: Davidvictorson on March 17, 2023, 07:58:52 AMIf needed, I can request for my yearly statement, which shows how much bet I have placed in that yearWhat that matter is your total profit that month or year.",

      "body": "From my experience with tax laws, no country will tax you for gambling losses, they can only do that if you have an aggregate gambling gain over the tax period.And the issue is that it's not easy for countries to tax their citizens the way you have explained, though it's viable for you to prove you gained or lost. However, some would still evade tax through that as there are many schemes through which they do this, especially when they could gamble online, and with crypto.This is why a country that wants to tax its citizens always has arrangements with the gambling company, they might tax your ticket directly or have the record they will duplicate for the government in order to know how to tax you. But one must be living in their country for the latter to be effective.Either way, it depends on the country, but you shouldn't be taxed if you are not gaining.",

Since you are playing online I am sure that you have your gambling history, better if you can convert it in pdf so that it would be presentable since I don't but last time I asked my accountant to bookkeel for me she asked if I can compile it and make everything in pdf. Hmm since it is online, make sure that it is acceptable by your tax bureau as well.",

Anyone who files their income tax return faithfully has the right for this deduction. Quote from: EarnOnVictor on March 17, 2023, 09:18:52 AMEither way, it depends on the country, but you shouldn't be taxed if you are not gaining.I agree. Every territory has their own tax rates when it comes to winnings. In our country, winnings are fully taxable and subject to 20% final tax in excess of 10,000. But for other countries, if you really do want to get the privilege of claiming itemized deductions in your taxes, better to report your income rightfully as well and keep your winnings history with you. Also consider that there are some policies where foreigners are not allowed to deduct their losses in their taxable income.

I thought that when you gamble you just risk your money, you lose, and voila no one cares. Rich people, especially businessmen, take advantage of these kinds of tax laws. In order to reduce the tax that they have to pay, most of the time they report part of their income and claim any deductions that they have the right to. They usually hire people who can legally help them with their taxes and do tax avoidance.",

Let's say your beginning bankroll is $500, you're keep gambling and now your bankroll become $750, which mean you're make $250 and this is the net profit you make through gamble. You can actually just include this $250 in your transaction report, but you're not allowed to include your gambling losses. You can include the losses but you need to count it yourself based on your gambling history. Your gross profit is $4,000 and your gambling losses is $3,750.At the end it's same your profit is $250.",

The tax office will not ask 90% of taxpayers to further prove their statement. It happens usually when the discrepancies are very big, or you're operating on large sums of money. From time to time they'll ask you for something at random, just to show you they care  but most of the time they won't.

Besides that, nobody here can give you a proper answer based on this information alone, because it will heavily depend on what country/state/region that you are in. While it would seem like adequate proof, different jurisdictions can have different standards and may not accept receipts from other places if those gambling companies are not \"friendly\" towards them. If you have been successful at gambling, you should re-invest some of that money into proper financial advice, otherwise you could end up in a lot of trouble and potentially pay fines far outweighing your gains.",
