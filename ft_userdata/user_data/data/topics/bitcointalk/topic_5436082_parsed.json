They're too small if it's going to be coming from handheld devices but the advantage of it is that you can lie on the bed while gambling.

For users who go from one place to another all the time on a daily basis, I think phones. In my situation, I have to travel every day up to 5 miles a day by bus to another. So much time browsing using my phone and there will be time to spend on casino. Using a browser however to navigate to my favorite casino because they don't have an app.",

Is that because they do not have access to a desktop computer? It may also be a regional issue, the same as people that do not use a browser?I guess playstore and appstore have a strict policies against gambling apps. For that reason it’s hard to find the app of the popular casinos and gambling sites. As many people don’t have access to desktop or PC, so the casinos have made their site mobile optimised also. I am the one who loves to gamble through PC, i mean using a PC gives more comfortable, and works smooth if we compare to the mobile versions. I know this is user based choice and will vary from users to users, but yes I feel more safe and secure if I place bet with the desktop version.",

It's much easier imo, I don't need to install any of that local bs that they want plus I can play it both in my phone/tablet and desktop freely (though I mostly use desktop tbf). I can play while doing some other stuff, I've never really been a fan of using my phone while using my desktop to do other stuff, I'd much rather do it all at once in my desktop if possible. Besides, web-based can easily be optimized for phone to make it feel natural and smooth as mobile apps, I don't think it's much of an issue plus there's not much specific stuff they need that phone apps can give compared to web-based ones.",

Is that because they do not have access to a desktop computer? It may also be a regional issue, the same as people that do not use a browser?Even I prefer desktop applications and web based applications the most. You have already stated the two most important reasons for that.Desktop provides a bigger screen and so the experience of gambling sites is better on bigger screens.At the same time there are so many scam gambling apps which steals user data and so installing it on mobile is a huge risk.Mobile holds most of our personal info and installing any such apps is a threat.Besides that when we look at the ease of convenience then desktop apps are much convenient to use than mobile apps.",

Maybe it was the convenience of the big screen as compare to mobile phone wherein you can't really feel and enjoy if you are playing slots games.I have nothing against those who love their mobile phones, but it's a big disadvantage for some of us here and still prefer our desktop.",

I really prefer in desktop as it is because big and easily play but over time the gameplay in mobile is getting better as you can play anywhere and also it is easy as sometimes you can use only one hand. though still i prefer desktop over mobile as it is easy to see those details that needed to see",
