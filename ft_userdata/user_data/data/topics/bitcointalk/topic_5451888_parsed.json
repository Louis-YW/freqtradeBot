      "body": "It's true that adolescence is a time of significant change and growth, which can lead to some challenging behaviors. I agree with you that good parenting is critical during this period, and it's essential to provide guidance and support to teenagers as they navigate this stage of life. However, it's also important to recognize that not all teenagers will exhibit the same behaviors, and some may require more assistance than others. It's crucial to approach each teenager with patience, understanding, and an open mind, so we can help them achieve their full potential. As adults, we have a responsibility to create a safe and supportive environment that allows teenagers to explore their identity and grow into confident, responsible adults.",

I posted some really stupid embarrassing things when I was younger.If you’re a parent you have to let kids be kids. They will make mistakes but as long as they’re not doing anything illegal then it’s just part of growing up. Just be there for them if they need you, they will do the maturing & growing up bit on their own.",

Parents should learn how to spend more time observing the behavior of their children at adolescent and should always give them advise to help them overcome these vices. Bringing them close to God and allow them to partake in things of God will be a good way to prevent them from getting influenced by their environment because they will have less time to mingle with their friends and will put into consideration whatever action they want to carry out. It is the duty of the parents to know which type of friends that they keep by interacting with both child and friends once a while. See your child as your friend and also vice versa,with this you child will be able to open up to you in whatever challenge he/she is passing thorough during this stage",
