Hello, i'm from Indonesia and no, i don't need any VPN to use electrum or accesing Bitcointalk. That been said though our main issue is our internet connectivity speed, we are on the really slow side of the internet.",

I think China have many good qualities, but their politics is somehow restricted(to put it simply). China is a big country with a long culture history, foreign things such as websites is often seen with scepticism. Interesting that you can't even connect the network through wallet without VPN, thats news to me regarding china's offensive against bitcoin and such...However, the Chinese ain't a dumb man and he know that the technical skill this world has to offer is too overwhelming. Sure, governments will do everything they can in their bureaucratic power to prevent innovative things, but some will escalate without any governmental approval.

Have you tried TOR? that wont solve the wallet-sync issue....but im curious.I think ToR is being banned too, but it's not confirmed. I have seen someone posting something about a new Tor type browser with a new VPNCoin here --> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1138930.0What is the main reason for the censorship of the internet in China? It cannot be only for political reasons. It all seemed to start with one of Deng Xiaoping's favorite sayings in the early 1980s: \"If you open thewindow for fresh air, you have to expect some flies to blow in.\" It seems to be a whole program to dumb down the citizens to the world out there... but I think it's a failure based on the activity we find on the internet from these people. OP, tell us a bit more, on how it influence your economy, if you are blocked from the outside world?",

And limitations on military personnel accessing news sites like the guardian, etc. It's not as bad as China but there is censorship. It's not always done directly by the government though. Often it relies on private interests self-censoring or pursuing others to court for example. Didn't know bitcointalk was blocked in China though. Had to double check on http://www.greatfirewallofchina.org/index.php?siteurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcointalk.org to make sure.",

We live in the 21st century and we should have freedom to choose which sites are we visiting or not!I hope things will change for better in China and that these restrictions will be removed.Until then, all you can do my friend, is use proxy, VPN or TOR. Thanks God these options exist also, so at least you have an alternative. I guess no government will ever be able to stop the technology!",
