      "body": "Chasing yields and profit is probably the most important thing to avoid. I made that mistake in the first year, getting so caught up in investment and chasing ICOs and following so many projects.I invested so much effort and time to download wallets, help to mine even and even contribute so much to projects my own work was suffering. I took as few shifts as possible, I didn't focus on myself, didn't train extra, skipped all the additional learning. Even did not play as much sports.Truly, Bitcoin is for buying and holding and using. And focus on your life, do more to advance your jobs, health. Keep active and interested in crypto utillity and enjoy the discussions to keep your spirits up on Bitcoin (not crypto lol).",

Congratulations!Any other views? What else could have been done or avoided? Isn't avoidance of pitfalls as much impactful as chasing \"yield\"?Your points are on point OP! I also have some to add:- Read between the lines. Don't take mainstream media drama for what it says, question the motives that could be behind the article.- Diamond hands. Don't sell what you don't need to and don't get sucked into the tricks of the charts!- Learn the tech. Dive deeper into what is behind Bitcoin and blockchain, learn how to understand and appreciate its intricacies. - Don't limit yourself. Expand your horizons and look for new opportunities, there are still plenty today!- It's worth being said twice...DON'T USE CENTRALIZED EXCHANGES UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO! Definitely don't hold anything inside of them either. Every crypto has a supported wallet! Even the shitcoin long shots!- Invest in your work environment. It will only allow you to do all of the above much faster.- Invest your time into improving your cyber security knowledge. We are in the age of digital warfare, it is happening every second of the day and NO ONE is excepted! The last thing you want is for all of the hard work you have put into both following these principles and whatever you are pursuing to go to waste from bad security practices. In your spare time, research to become safer!",

What else could have been done or avoided? Isn't avoidance of pitfalls as much impactful as chasing \"yield\"?Well, I've avoided toxicity of people on social media platforms and I guess that's an achievement when I was able to block and unfollow a lot of them because of different shits in life that they've nonstop discussing.And what's good to me is that I never chased the profitability of those yields or lending platforms, I kept mostly in bitcoin as I've seen the risk in those.",

We as humans have all got lots of different potentials and it’s left to us to discover and unlock these potentials.

You know why the fud keeps growing is as a result of many putting their focus and too much attention on bitcoin to making them rich quick forgetting that bitcoin is not a day bull neither is it a jackpot to quick riches bit s gradually process of building that takes a little time as the market is volatile.Let me just add a little to your listTalk to someone about bitcoinAvoid too much of I too know.Learn to do research.Always be comfortable to asking questions.Avoid problems so you could enjoy yourself.Always surf the internet to get updated with the current technological innovation.Make sure you run maintenance, update and upgrade on your device do as to avoid loss of assetsAlso run maintenance on you automobile so you don't have any accident because of that happens, you would not be able to enjoy your life and your assets would go for bills and payment.Always remember \"not your keys,not your coin\"",

For instance, if they had the right knowledge concerning bitcoin they would have made a fortune out of it but at this they kept warying at bitcoin thinking it would collapse some day whereby focusing their time and efforts on a high yielding platform or even leaving their assets on cex, that was why many fell in victim of what happened between ftx and terra. Hence they should avoid chasing black goat at night and rather chased it at day time. Meaning chosing the right investment on time gives a reasonable profits in returns.",

You can’t get rich for one night, but if you earn at least a penny every night, then wealth is guaranteed.To do this, you must not bet all your money in your investment. If you bet it all, you will need money to use and if your bet is not right after a few months, where is money for you to use. To have money for expenses, you have to sell your bitcoin at discount price which is lower than your entry. It means you sell it at lost price to have cash to use.
