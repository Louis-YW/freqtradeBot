  "content": "Hello!My new account was banned because I copied the text of my topic from this account. Describing the situation. From this account I created a topic on your forum. But some of the information in the topic has become irrelevant. The fact is that due to a force majeure situation, we were forced to change the domain of the site that we wrote about in the created topic. Due to the fact that we cannot change the login of this account, we created a new account and wanted to publish a topic with up-to-date information from it. After registering a new account(Hi******ey), we saw a notification that our account was banned. If necessary, I will write the content of the notification below.We ask you to help resolve the issue and cancel the ban of your account.",

However you should indicate the username of the account you are requesting to unban since the moderator will not gonna guess what’s your account username by providing an incomplete username. Make the username public so that it will official request from you to unban that specific account.Avoid posting outside the Meta to avoid being ban again here in the forum.",

It is understandable why you copied the texts before heh.Secondly, it would be better if you could also post a link to your banned user profile. I can't find a profile with that username with the help of searchbar or anywhere else.Edit:Quote from: Eternad on February 24, 2023, 10:58:55 AMHowever you should indicate the username of the account you are requesting to unban since the moderator will not gonna guess what’s your account username by providing an incomplete usernameGlobal mods are now aware of his username since one of his last  posts (in which he mentioned his username) was last edited by hilariousandco.",

And if you check the previous thread you'll notice that Op didn't just tell us the username willingly, it was after LoyceV provided that list and some users which includes Fatfork and Eureka_07 were able to prove which the account that Op was trying to hide that was when Op finally admitted it.",

I checked the profile link you put out here but there's no post in that account to know what happened. I guess you deleted them by yourself? Besides, that account was registered in the second week in February this year and got banned a few days later.

Personally, I wouldn't do it that way, but seems like they wanna distance themselves from their old domain (dunno why tho).",

However, I did some digging and noticed that neither \"hill.money\" nor \"Olimpchange\" are listed on BestChange's website as verified exchanges. We've seen similar situations before where exchanges falsely claimed to be associated with BestChange, only to turn out to be scams.I'm not saying that's the case here, but it would be helpful if you could explain your partnership with BestChange (if there is one), and maybe even check with them to confirm it.",

So you need to be active here.if I remember correctly, one member was also banned for a similar mistake, but his ban was lifted because he actively offered loans and it was important that he remain present for his clients.",
