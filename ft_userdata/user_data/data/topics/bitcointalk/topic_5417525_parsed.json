  "content": "Hi all, I first got into Quant in April this year when price was around £100, I have been buying the dips since and my average buy is currently £70. I am holding the majority of my Quant as I believe it will be top 10 next bull run and see great returns but I have decided to trade some in the hope I can earn a few more. When I first started investing into it in April there was hardly any mention of it anywhere but I in recent weeks I see more and more people starting to notice it. I have seen future predictions from £5000 - £50,000 , I personally think it will hit £10,000 minimum which would give it a market cap of only £120b. With Quant being one of if not the best performer in recent months I am just curious to know who holds and when did you first get in? What is everyone's prediction?",

Quant is not the only altcoin I hold but it is one of my main ones. ATH is £309 - it will treble that minimum next bull run. I think it will reach £100b market cap one day which would give it a price of £8,000. Will be interesting to see if this is the start of something big or not.",

Will you wait until bitcoin to reach 1 million USD per bitcoin to make it happen? i doubt even if bitcoin worth such money and that will make the price of quant will be going to the more than 10000",

Up until recently most of the market has followed Bitcoin but lately Quant has been on its own going up not caring what Bitcoin does.",

Bur it's certain that Bitcoin and a few other alts are gonna survive and those that survive are gonna sky rocket. Though I've sold most of the alts that I believe won't survive. But I'm still holding some quant just incase",

Right now, buying an overbought token at $180 is too risky and expensive because it's unclear how this year will end for the crypto market. But the $50 in June this year was a good entry point for investors of all types, as that investment has already made good money. I think the project has a good chance of renewing ATH in the next bull run, but we need to look for a good long term buying point.",

My average buy is £70 - I am not buying at these high prices I am waiting for a pull back down to roughly £140 before I start to DCA again.",
