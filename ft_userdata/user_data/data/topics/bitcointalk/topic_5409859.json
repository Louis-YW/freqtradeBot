  "content": "There's a new silver coin on Powercoin called \"New Lydian Coin\":https://www.powercoin.it/en/home/7141-new-lydian-coin-bitcoin-backed-1-oz-silver-coin-02-mbtc-2022.html(Have to say the design is somewhat nice IMHO.)First of all it's mistakenly labeled as Niue coin - it isn't. I assume this is an actual mistake, since most of their other BTC coins are Niue.In reality it's just a private coin from a company called \"Coint Co.\" that started supposedly in 2021, but their website is still \"being minted\" (alright, that's a neat joke):https://www.coint.ukSecond of all, Powercoin wants 169.95 EUR for that coin, but you can find the company's shopify store where they offer it in pre-sale for 99 USD.Also it seems they are going to offer a gold plated version of the same for whopping 700 USD (which means God knows how much on Powercoin).But what's really, really funny, is how the coin is \"loaded\".It's supposed to come with \"a password to a Bitcoin address with 0.2 mBTC\". But there's no public address nor sticker visible on the coin itself (not even serial number?).Please, (especially if you're considering buying it) do yourself a favor and read these instructions:https://cointco.myshopify.com/pages/instructionsI mean this kind of hard-core OpSec would make Jameson Lopp proud.Just wow.",

Why didn't you just use a fckn QR code containing the private key like most other modern coins? Or the mini-key like Casascius? What is blockchain.app and wtf/why does it have anything to do with redeeming private keys? Methinks you need to go back to square one and figure out what the hell you are doing lol.. also, How can you prove you are the coinmaker? Can you even?  I agree this seems ridiculous and just another stain on collectibles...

There is simply NO connection between those two.Coin itself has no public address, no private key and as far as I can tell not even a serial number - bitcoin (in a form of CoA) and the coin are totally separated.You can make a simple commemorative coin, there's nothing wrong with that.OR you can make a so called \"physical bitcoin\" coin with visible public address (so you check if the coin is loaded) and hidden private key (or as in your case a seed phrase, why not, even though it's longer), so you have to visibly damage the coin to reveal it. In that way undamaged coin automatically guarantees ownership of bitcoin - that is the whole point of such coin.(Please research Casascius or some other reputable maker for this.)What you did is neither.Plus your instructions for redeeming are very, very amateurish - and I don't mean \"simplified for ordinary people\", I mean amateurish and insecure.One problem with physical bitcoin is that it requires trust (which kinda goes against the whole bitcoin ethos, but that's another debate) in the maker of such coin.I have to trust not just you're not a scammer, but also that you know what you're doing.I am not sure if you are scammers, but just after reading your instructions I AM sure you don't really know much not just about making physical bitcoin, but also about bitcoin in itself.Please, either stick to making commemorative coins (as I stated originally, the design itself is quite alright) OR get someone knowledgeable, if you really want to do this.

Here’s the truth, they are full of shit. Completely full of bs. Check out their blockchain link if it’s working, I think they got mad at me for going in and out so much (that’s not what she said?-Michael Scott) so I can’t anymore atm. Anyways there were just a few total transactions between I believe just two wallets, and very little left in this wallet they posted above. Shady much ? Nah they came back and addressed all concerns as they promised…wait.  I am of the opinion they are part of TopWorldCoins who makes those dumb fucking United Crypto States coins with values and redemption and all that , which makes no sense.  Sounds familiar ..the original Sol Noctis Bull coins (by TWC) do not just have a simple private key under the holo, but some weird cryptographic nonsense that several cryptographers here couldn’t even figure out how the redemption works.  Oh and those are the coins where one member here reported on the coins moving out and shortly after back in to the coin wallet/address and he never even peeled it. This was verified by an expert as well. TopWorld /United Crypto States unsurprisingly refused to address it..to say the least. So what’s that all mean….they don’t want you to move the coins and have all gone to great/nonsensical lengths to try and dissuade you from doing so or simply not allowing you to do so at all. It’s of my opinion that TWC/CointCo/PowerCoin are all very much connected ..and not just because they sell each others coins..though that’s part of it. Most the coin designs are repeats or virtually stolen. If I had a penny for those who claimed they did it first lol..Writing sure looks familiarly ridiculous no- https://www.ucs-coins.com/ (Note I erroneously said Power Coin was behind the Sol Noctis Bull key issues but meant TWC. Regardless they are all full of shit and untrustworthy)",

The BTC can be swept at any point in the future, even if the seller gives you the CoA, since the mnemonic phrase is already known to them.",
