As for me, I am still holding strong irrespective of the amount I see today because I have made a promise to hold it for a long time, which is for about 4 years and above, since I don't have any intention of using the fund for anything in the near future. So if one invests for short-term profit, probably those who bought at 23K and pulled out at 28K have made a whole lot of profit.",

As of taking profits, people who are on short term investment is supposed to take profit. But many are targeting $30k while some are targeting $50k while others are patiently  waiting for a new ATH.Surprisingly some also will not sell even if bitcoin makes a new ATH. Some will not sell for ever and until.they die. It just am individual decision to make.",

Keep the record that it will pump no matter the delay.I'm pretty sure some Bitcoin investors have already withdrawn some of their money due to the recent spike in bitcoin prices, but personally, I've been holding on to my Bitcoins for years and have not withdrawn any funds. I rarely withdraw money, only in an emergency or when I need it. The recent increase in the price of bitcoin from $23,000 to almost $27,000 is nice, but it is not that impressive, as I think the price of bitcoin could increase much more than that when the good days come. Therefore, I am currently staying idle and keeping my Bitcoin in my wallet without touching them.",

Keep the record that it will pump no matter the delay. I think the reason why we invest in the cryptocurrency market is not to take profits once the market takes a little upward movement. We don't need to rush and take our profits just like that. It is better we hold and keep holding so that we can earn big from the market not for us to take the little profits we have when know that the market is still going to go bullish in due time. The market is try to balance momentum for now for the big move coming our way. Let's keep be ready to hold now so that we can earn better profits from the market in due time.",

While it's still 2023 and there is still a year before the halving yet there is already a huge pump in BTC, what more could happen to BTC price after halving? I think $100K may happen this 2024.

I don't sell anything at these prices, although I have bought bitcoin sub 20k. I'm not here to scalp pennies, but to escape the manipulated fiat system and save up for times where bitcoin will be much more popular and much more valuable, which is inevitably going to happen with every coming halving. Some of us here are in the space to get more bitcoin, but if you're here to have more fiat money, be my guest. We all have our own goals.",

We all buy in bitcoin to earn a profit, and because we all know that bitcoin can dump or pump at any time, selling a bitcoin when we notice a modest profit is not a big concern in my opinion. As a result, I don't see anything wrong with you selling bitcoin for a tiny profit mate.",

It's utter guesswork. Bitcoin can be $40,000 next week / month / year, or $15,000, or $80,000. I'm confident to hold coins for a decade, but I'm nowhere confident to playing with short-term trading. \"Those who play with fire perish by it\".What matters is we're +70% in the last month.

Although the price of bitcoin is unpredictable I am hopeful that the price will keep up till it gets to my benchmark to cash out. For now, nobody can convince me to sell my investment. Anybody that wants to withdraw and sell has his reason for taking the decision. Some investors have also made some profit (some even bought less than $10,000) from the high price and they want to withdraw it for other investments. While others might decide to sell because of pressing needs or emergencies.",

Come to know that i've been doing short trades with Bitcoin and accumulates it, which means that i could really be able to patch it up in case i did make a good profitabletrade.This is why It does really depend on how you would consider out on making one.",

You can also hold whatever percentage of profit you are currently getting, because selling and holding are subjective and must be adjusted to your investment plan.But first, try to get realtime prices before you make misleading statements about prices.",
