Obviously you got into Bitcoin early enough. Unfortunately you made the mistake of many which is the infamous \"taking profits\". The story is always the same for a lot of the early adopters of Bitcoin with few able to see beyond the immediate profits and held even up till now. You have just confirmed that selling ones Bitcoin under the guise of \"taking profit\" might actually be a wrong decision because there are chances you might not replenish your portfolio with the proceeds and may likely spend the money in such a way you might not actually be proud of on the long run. For your case, you got married and did other things which is wonderful and fine. But you would have still done most of those things by just selling a fraction of your portfolio and not the entire assets hoping to start all over again. In one of the thread, I made a statement that those who joined Bitcoin early and still held till date are the true believers who understood what Bitcoin was and where it was going. I just hope your approach should be different now...  for me, I will always have a Bitcoin portfolio irrespective of the price. Selling is entirely based on needs that will never involve killing the \"goose that lays the golden egg\"",

We shouldn't really be demonizing selling bitcoin because not everyone is selling their bitcoin for panicking reasons.Maybe I used a wrong tone but that was not my intention. I even stated that my philosophy is selling strictly base on needs because I believe Bitcoin is a safer and better investment option. However, what I'm not comfortable with is liquidating the entire portfolio with the hope of replacing it during bear season. This does not always work. You can see the confirmation from the OP that he is starting all over again and even small this time. In the last part of the post, the OP explained his situation which suggested he really needed to do something about it and holding Bitcoin would have still been the best thing to do because selling all without putting the funds into something that will yield more profits is a wrong move considering that he now have a family.",

Forgot about your poor background and work towards building a financially stable family. It is good that you have discovered and invested in bitcoin but you can still diversify your investment to other sectors. Other businesses could give you short-term profit as you patiently wait for your Bitcoin holdings to appreciate. You will not be able to keep your Bitcoin for a long time if you don't have another means of income. You need to get a job and earn money that will enable you to pay your bills.

That means there is only one way bitcoin can go in the long run which is up. You may buy bitcoin at the top of the last bull run and still make money if you hold it till the next bull run which usually happens every 4-5 years.You did great till now and now the hard part starts. People think getting rich is hard. No. Getting rich is very easy. The hard part is maintaining your riches. Lots of people went from being a millionaires to zero very quickly in the past.

So a little twist in your writing…Are you a child or an adult who’s solely trying to have a throw back at a teenage age experience along with the contemporary life as an adult Bitcoin investor?Something I have to point out though. I am pretty sure Bitcoin ATH is around $69k and it didn’t make the $70k mark, not yet with current historical records. Its ATH is around $68,789 to be precise.Still, I can’t say you’ve made any bad investment nor acted unwisely with your choices of having to take profit because, you met it early, took what opportunity you could and chose to better your life the much your investment could afford you and so, it’s a good one.Even still, you continue some small investments still, that too is a good one but, if you could, you can as well invest, keep topping up your portfolio and live it be, while leveraging other streams of income if you can accord yourself a few and run your life on that. Perhaps till Bitcoin becomes more widely accepted. You would be even more proud of your choices judging by what pride you’ve gotten from your past decisions with the currency.",

There are different kinds of people which we have in the bitcoin community, those who had the opportunity to buy and hold bitcoin when the price for one was really affordable which was as low as the money they spend on a daily basis, but they never grab that opportunity of buying then because they don’t know how it will turn out to be and now most of them are living in regrets instead of starting from where they realize how good bitcoin is. There are also those who did not even have the opportunity from the start, no body was their to give them the information and they also do not have stable access to the internet which will help them gain the knowledge many of those people join the network and are even big holders why many did not still join since they miss the opportunity of buying in the early stage forgetting the fact that no time is late to join the train. There are also those who had about bitcoin as a means of investment and they have been making profit from it base on the way they have learned to day trade it which has been a good source of income for them. Some people see it and have decided to be long time holders as holding for long is where the real profit comes from that’s if you can be able to hold for long time and until bull run. It’s good that you have enjoyed bitcoin and it have been able to add value to your life, why making profit you can also decide to add some in your saving wallet as it might be what will help your future generations in time to come.",

One of the things that I have learned about finances and investment or money in general,  is that,  even though you lose all the money you have to a bad investment decision,  as long as you still have the skills and knowledge that produced that money,  you will still be able to make xx of such amount again in the future,  so given up is what is worst of for any man,  Bitcoin is a journey and at the mo moment,  we are still at the early stage,  so we have to concentrate on the most important thing which is to keep taking advantage of the chances to become better off of what we used to be and never regret anything.",

I noticed that because of the bitcoin hype, many people choose to invest in bitcoin without proper knowledge of it, resulting in losing the investment, and many choose to invest a large amount of money thinking that they could earn a lot right away, which is not the case. You could use bitcoin as a side hustle, but not as a livelihood. Why? Because bitcoin is volatile and complex, not every day you will win or earn; that's not it, except if you are really good at it. But if you know for yourself that you are not familiar with bitcoin, then don't rely on it alone; bitcoin is for long-term investment, so if you think that bitcoin could give you earnings every day, then stop dreaming.
