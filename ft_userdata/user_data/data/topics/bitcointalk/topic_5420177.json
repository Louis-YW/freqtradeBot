      "body": "I don't think you can monitor them by observing traffic.What do you want to achieve?Why not check it through the pool or access the miner's IP and go check the miner's status? Or you want to access your miner through API calls? I can't figure out what exactly your miner is but Bitmain units have API calls that you can use like requesting a summary of miner status.",

There are also some tools that require a bit more work that can give you more information but they do require a bit more work / knowledge of networking.Depending on the network switch you are plugged into you may have to change a few things to see all the data.-Dave",
