I want to do this for the next 2 years and was at first going to go with Bitcoin however the profits will be a lot larger If I go with a riskier Altcoin, just not sure which one to go with.

Choose top competitor of Bitoin such as Ethereum, Near Protocol, Cosmos, Polakadot and so on. Just avoid problematic chain like ADA, Sol and Tron which might give you anLuna 2.0 investment like in the future. The DCA idea is very good and somehow encouraging for everyone here to statrt saving in crypto slowly and consistently. I find it interesting about the video that you watch.It will be nice if you can share the video that you watch for reference of this discussion.Go on youtube and search Bob Sharpe - it is one of his latest videos.",

Since bitcoin has increased tens of thousands of times since it was created, so it is probably still correct to assume that bitcoin will not be able to yield as large returns as altcoins because new coins if good enough will get hyped by sharks and profits can be up to 100x, 1000x. However, that would be very risky, since such new projects would not have much to look for, so you would have to spend a lot of time and money to find it. You can try it if you're determined to take the risk and it doesn't affect your daily life. Good luck finding that hidden gem.",

There's nothing with that if you think you'll make more with altcoins because, with this bull run, too many of them have pumped.But just look right now at how low most of them are and thanks to bitcoin. They're all affected with bitcoin's drop and that's why if you think that you'll be getting more profit with riskier altcoins, think about it again.",

I haven't invested in Bitcoin yet as it has always been too expensive for me but now it is around £15k It feels like a good time to get involved and this £5 per day strategy could be a good way of doing it. Dollar-cost average is the safest strategy for me if you want to invest into crypto.If you are more of a conservative investor, then I'd rather go with Ethereum than in Algorand. I heard that coin already but as a conservative, most of the time I'm investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum only.In the end, it's your money, but Bitcoin and Ethereum is the safest approach if you will ask me. Now if you want to be a more aggressive investor, I think you should invest on the other top 10 coins but remember, not all coins on the top 10 right now will remain at the top a few years from now. Just look where EOS, IOTA, BCH, NEM and TRON is right now. There is a chance that projects in the future will eliminate coins such as SOL, ADA, DOT on the top 10. Maybe try to invest into XRP or LTC if you want .",
