The debt was to be paid off in 50 annual repayments commencing in 1950. Some of these loans were only paid off in the early 21st century. On 31 December 2006, Britain made a final payment of about $83m (£45.5m) and thereby discharged the last of its war loans from the US. yep the UK got into alot of debt due to WW2 which the US bank rolled and then asked for yearly payments for 56 yearsyep the uk only paid off the 1940's war in 2006",

      "body": "War certainly pushes countries to make huge debts to fund their military and their cause. No matter the aftermath of the war, debt still remains, and the country who asked for that debt will be bound to repay it no matter the cost. Even if the country is obliterated to bits after the war, the remaining officials of that country will still have to pay that debt otherwise there will be some form of collateral to it. Power crisis/outage and all that kind of stuff will only force the country to borrow money to provide for their needs. You have to force the country to not spend, and in sabotaging its necessities you are not clearing debt but raising it.",

If the war is over for Russia and they lost against Ukraine, their only hope is to open up those gas pipes and start accepting customer from Europe again. For sure that wouldn't be that easy for Putin to do, but one way or another he has to accept defeat, because no one's going to constantly fund this war for him. Those gas deposits that Russia has is the only way to save their country financially, but good luck asking to the IMF or the World Bank for loans because in their eyes, Russia is the bad guy.Quote from: davis196 on December 22, 2022, 11:03:25 AMQuote from: NotATether on December 22, 2022, 09:59:33 AMIt reminds me of Ukraine and Russia.

      "body": "The cynical and stereotypical response is to say banks and governments would loan money to both sides of a war. To rake in massive profits on interest payments. As OP mentioned state bureaucracies already carry high amounts of debt, which would make it difficult for them to finance war. More than 50% of banks also carry large amounts of debt.If war arises, it would require other methods to fund it. We have seen nations like russia and china amass armies of forced conscripts who are paid lower wages in contrast to professional soldiers. We have also seen russia deny the use of its airforce to keep war costs down. With the exception of big american spending in the russia vs ukraine conflict, cost cutting has been the #1 priority.If war breaks out, it will be a budget war. No one has the deep pockets to finance massive invasions like the US vs Iraq. Not anymore. Everyone is broke by this point.The only major nation carrying low amounts of debt is russia. With debt near to 20% of GDP. The origins story of how that happened, has to be an interesting one. Whatever it is.",

Sure, the IMF has Ukraine covered with restructuring loans, but who is going to finance loans for Russia after their war? Their collaborators (Belarus and Iran) do not have that kind of money.The answer is extremely simple: either \"voluntary\" reparations to be paid by Russia. Or the forced seizure of assets, raw materials and similar highly liquid objects for their sale and compensation for losses to Ukraine. Moreover, this will be the total amount, which will include both direct losses and indirect ones, such as the loss of the country's population, loans, and so on. In that number, I will clarify once again - and the loans received for armament and support for the economy.The only question is whether payments or forced withdrawal can be somewhat complicated if Russia, as a result of the expected loss in the war it unleashed, breaks up into several independent states. But, in this case, the rule of collective responsibility will most likely work ...PS The US Congress has already passed a law on blocking and seizing the assets of Russian aligarhs who support the terrorist war against Ukraine, with further sale (if it is not finance) and transfer of money to Ukraine!",

If you are going to make such bold claims and accusations then why not actually link to a source that people can trust, because it certainly isn't you. Norway is actually exceptionally rich because they have made a lot of money from oil which goes into a sovereign wealth fund that in turn owns large shares of many companies around the world. Besides that, being in debt itself is not a problem - in fact being able to borrow in your own currency because you are so trusted in repaying your debts is a position that most countries aspire to get in. You are really clueless and delusional when it comes to your ideas on world economics.",

Their collaborators (Belarus and Iran) do not have that kind of money.It is clear that neither China, nor India, nor even the outcast country of Iran, will want to mess with Russia much. Yes, Iran supplies drones and may supply missiles to kill the civilian population of Ukraine, but it does this only because of one thing - Russia promised to help with their nuclear program ...The cash cow of the terrorist regime of the Kremlin is the 100 million population of the country. No, 140 million people are not there, this is also a fake ....So, these weak-willed bodies will suffer and live in complete shit, but they will \"wait for victory over NATO and the USA.\" This is a sickly genetic fantasy  I remember this dream of the USSR from my childhood, which I spent in that very vile USSR ....A few facts about which pro-Russian propagandists and their supporters will not tell:1. No more than 25-30% of payments for the death of Russian terrorists (officially - military personnel of the Russian army) are paid from the budget. The rest of the money is stolen. That is why Russia does not take the corpses of its soldiers from our territory - if there is no corpse, it means that he did not die, but is considered \"missing.\" Such an abomination, but a fact2. All programs and budgets of the social orientation of the Russian Federation have been reduced at times, many are simply frozen. For example, retirement savings. Well, Putin will not wage war \"out of his own pocket\"? He has slaves who will pay for it3. Just the other day, the head of the National Bank of Russia, Nabiulina, made a proposal to the Director of the Department of Financial Recovery, that it is necessary, forcibly, without agreement with depositors, to replace all deposits of individuals in Russian banks with government bonds of the state defense program. And trust me, they will. And the weak-willed inhabitants of Russia will again silently swallow this act.Then they will sell oil/az/gold to China for a penny. Then they will hand over the Trans-Urals to China \"for a long-term lease\" for some money. By the way, some of the territories have already been handed over to China for 99 years, and there ... Russian legislation does not apply  China has begun to return its historical territories",
