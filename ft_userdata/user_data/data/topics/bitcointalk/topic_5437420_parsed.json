The rate hikes narrative started since last year and the prices fell from 69k to under 20k. So the effect is there, you cant say we got here without rate hikes.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on January 31, 2023, 05:08:49 AMI believe it's FUDHaving a different opinion on price behaviour is completely okay.

Honestly, with all these crises that are happening, we've dealt with it pre-pandemic. We all thought that it would crash the market but it reversed our expectations.The price of bitcoin has increased even more and gave way to the last ATH on 2021. I guess the same thing might happen again, halving next year, with crises that we have to face including the vast layoffs.Maybe it will be the opening to make the price of bitcoin higher again by end of 2024-2025.",

A wise attitude that must be applied and always take advantage of declines to accumulate or do DCA and hold it for the long term, and keep in mind that the market price of bitcoin or crypto is still very volatile and cannot be predicted with certainty. Because whatever happened was due to several factors that we also don't know.and although an increase in interest rates may have a certain effect on the crypto market, there is no guarantee that this will definitely happen. But an increase in interest rates can also affect the inflation rate, which can affect the value of crypto or bitcoin assets.",

Bitcoin is currently priced at $23k so it doesn't look like it will drop below $20k again. A few days ago when Bitcoin dropped to $15400 that was the lowest price Bitcoin could hit.  I personally don't think Bitcoin will ever go below that. And those who invested in Bitcoin at that time are now entitled to a large profit and holding it long-term will yield many more profits from here.  So I think those who are waiting for Bitcoin to hit 12k are making a big mistake",

It would be on the favourable side that one takes advantage of the current market situation by taking a good position if it because it would take the test of time and bounce back with full momentum to the peak. This time around, it would definitely go beyond it's ALL TIME HIGH. In as much as no one knows the next step of bitcoin, the speculations are coming and some are kind of accurate but that does not mean that they are all in it as the market is generally volatile. In all, if you can, bag more of bitcoin for a long time and wait for the next bullrun.",

But this should not necessarily mean it'll drop back to 12k like levels.But overall it's hard to tell. Some say we're out of crypto winter, some say we're not and it was a fake breakout. The truth is that we're in sort of \"gray area\" (in between). So I can easily expect some agree with you and some oppose the idea.However, why is this in Bitcoin Discussion and not in Speculation where it belongs?!",

Because I see from several corrections that occurred in Bitcoin only experienced a slight decrease in a short time which then increased again. And also I don't think that unemployment which is still increasing has an influence on this, because some people who are still unemployed are because they are still lazy to work and some don't know where to work.So there is not such a big influence from the unemployment sector because those who are still unemployed will definitely look for free things that can be used like in the crypto space even with very small amounts and this will actually trigger more crypto users. As for the perspective on interest rates that are still high, I can't give a clear enough picture because I personally have never felt the difficulties caused by this.",
