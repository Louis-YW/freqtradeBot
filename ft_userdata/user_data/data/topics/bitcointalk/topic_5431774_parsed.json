If you want to leave a mark on the world years from now, you have to produce big projects and these projects should be something people can see or talk about forever. The rich, the commanders or the big buildings are forgotten, it is your story that is not forgotten. We create a scenario with the help of the functioning of the shibagun ecosystem so that the story of Ryosin and our great master Satoshi Nakamoto is not forgotten forever with a documentary. Satoshi Nakamoto has managed to become an unforgettable person in the world even after centuries. He did this by making people believe in himself. He did this with only a computer, he had no money and no large army. We follow the path of our master Satoshi Nakamoto, and with the vision we learned from our master Satoshi Nakamoto, we will do everything we can to make people believe in us. We will show the world that small companies can do big things. Big beliefs can succeed, not big companies. As all software developers, we bow respectfully in front of our great master.                       We are making a documentary of your life as Blockchain brothers. Wherever you are, we know you've heard of us and Satoshi Nakamoto will be proud of us. It would be a great honor for us to make you proud.                                         CONCLUSION   Shibgun Token founder Ryoshi Nakamoto realized that Satoshi Nakamoto and Ryoshi are not much known in the world and also Ryoshi Nakamoto wants to prove to the world that coins, tokens are not just a means of payment, they have souls and beliefs. Coins are not just a means of payment. With experience in token making, he issued Shibgun tokens to find investors for the documentary, along with a team that decided to shoot Satoshi and Ryoshi's Documentary to write the script for the documentary.                   WHEN THE STUDENT IS READY THE MASTER APPEARS.                   WHEN THE STUDENT HAS LEARNED ALL THERE IS TO TEACH,                                       THE MASTER DISAPPEARS.                          Shibaarmy Immortalized Ryoshi and Satoshi. Please follow our roadmap to get your movie                 tickets and front seats. Our tickets are limited.                       https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shibagun#markets                                    SHIBAGUN TOKENOMICSHow is SHIBGUN deployed?● 47.02% Burn● 52.98% Uniswap Liquidity⚫️ Total Supply: 27111960392shibgun⚫️ Verifiable Burned: 12748669078 Shibgun⚫️ Uniswap Liquidity: 14363291304 Shibgun● ZERO transaction fees…● Burn Rate will make the Shibgun coin become deflationary over time. The continued filming of the Satoshi and Ryoshi documentary will combat the effects of inflation on prices in the years to come. This is already evident with >47.02% of Shibagun being permanently burned by this function as of the time of writing.● The rate of development will allow the Shibgun Token team to wholeheartedly focus on the development of Shibagun and its surrounding culture. This also allows the team to hire/outsource any additional work needed to shoot the Satoshi and Ryoshi documentary. (i.e. mods, social media managers, animators, artists, developers, etc.)● The Liquidity Ratio will help stabilize the trading of the Shibagun-ETH pair and provide more liquidity to Shibagun holders. This will help maintain the fair value of the Shibgun coin and reduce the impact of large sales on the overall coin's value.● Marketing Ratio will be used in a variety of ways, from directly funding marketing campaigns in social media and other media to event planning and organization. This will also be used to recruit ambassadors, DJs, entertainers and much more for our live events. As well as holding giveaways and contests for our owners",
