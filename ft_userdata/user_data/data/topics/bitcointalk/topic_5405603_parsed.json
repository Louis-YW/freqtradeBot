I expect the next movement will be pure punishment for all crypto user up to the point that crypto user will leave the crypto voluntarily due to there stricter policy same as what happened to India which the government insane tax to all crypto user.I don’t trust US government that will be pro crypto in near future because it will hurt the $ badly.",

CBDCs are about giving more power to gatekeepers, meaning fewer freedoms for you.  Bitcoin/LN doesn't have gatekeepers.  You are free to do anything with your wealth.  Anyone attempting to conflate the two is either grossly disingenuous, or simply doesn't understand why CBDCs are a threat to your liberties.",

(the same as how fiat does it now)even china's CBDC is like thisthe PBOC and the chinese authorities dont/wont watch all activity on the agent123. and will only get info about SAR reports about customers of agent23 customers. if and when the banks of those customers see red flagsnone of the CBDC are a system where governments see and read every payment of every customer. they simply do not have the resourcecs, time manpower(get that out of your tin foil hat thinking they do)even in fiat today, they delegate that duty onto the bank/payment service provider to to the customer overwatch and only send SAR's for the suspicious customers(learn what info is sent to authorities in fiat and what is not and why those that are sent, are sent.. (take tin foil hat off when doing research)so now you are clearer of how the 'privacy' and 'overwatch' is of most planed CBDC worksyou need to then learn how real life privacy and limitations are then caused.EG we all know right now people with debit cards can go to an ATM and without question do ~$500 withdrawals no questions asked. but as soon as you want to move serious money. then banks start asking questions(EG in the UK i have to talk to a team at my bank each time i want to move £5k to ensure its me and that my purpose is my choice and im not being coerced into handing serious money to scammers/criminals and that im not being suckered into a bad advice investment, even when i am trying to deposit into a legit bitcoin exchange)yes i hate it. and yes i will still have those headaches in a CBDC. but for small amounts ill just have a small account for daily spend stuff..however then you need to learn about the flaws of smart contracts vs blockchains. and you might then see why i prefer network wide public open audited blockchains. rather then private non-blockchains with no network wide auditits not about \"authorities learn everything\" (EG authorities dont learn everything from bitcoin network about my usage of bitcoin) its about the audit and security of funds that prevent double spending/money printing/ fractional reserving,",
