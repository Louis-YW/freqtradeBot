Since they were managing so many campaign and i guess that if they were not actively watching this section. I hope that you can get what you want but your reputation doesn't seem to be a good thing to be hired by them. This suggestion is good for you. Contact any manager to offer your service and let's see how they will be seeing it.",

Well, project owners that are meticulous would ask him the same thing.But if not, then they're just accepting anyone that can do the job even without experience. That's all on them and maybe some managers have their own assistants that do this job before.So, if a manager needs one, I don't think that they'll have to look for one as they'll just ask those people that they've worked with before but for new projects, they might think of him and consider.",

The thing is you're a newbie account and have been exposed since you're a cheaters with your alt accounts. I think the reason why you want to become a campaign manager assistant is you're want to take advantages by giving more stakes to your alt accounts, so you make all of your alt accounts are eligible for the payment.",

In the campaigns that are launched in the altcoins section, the supervisor has to verify the entries of subscribers on social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and others. The number of subscribers is in the thousands, and it is normal for the campaign manager to need help either from his assistants assigning them to work for him, or by developing a bot to help him work.However, this is no longer necessary given the very low number of campaigns in that section compared to previous years.",

I think that i would prefer to see you are making your own portfolios visible for anyone here. Im sure that some members were also giving you the right explanation about that. It seems like that you need a very hard effort to let those managers to see you as their assistant for spreadsheet checking. Any manager won't need him because a newbie account with a bad reputation of course no one will glance at him this is a trick for him to place a lot of bets on his alt account with what Jawhead999 says so don't be surprised he will definitely insist on this.The task of checking the bounty spreadsheet for every manager has already been arranged, whether he is himself or his assistant because what I know as a bounty manager is that there is always a team formed by them.",

Will post reports after a warning that the bounty campaign is over. I would not hire you if I'm a bounty manager, if you have this cheating character for all we know you're just going to credit all your bots and alt account if you want to be part of a bounty team you have to set an example because what you've done will just come back to you.",
