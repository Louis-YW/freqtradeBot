This is what I plan to do as well, peace.I am very happy with the amount I make daily now as the difficulty is from 15 P to 14.09 P a decent decline,the same for Ethereum Classic which is from 315 T to 282 T.I used to make 0.0076 Ethereum maximum in two days,in these last two I made 0.0089 and I am sure in the next two days I will make 0.01 which I consider great and the conversion in Bitcoin as I said is better and bigger.I don't want to try solo mining as it depends on luck so I don't want to lose a single day of mining in a pool with others as solo I may keep missing.",
