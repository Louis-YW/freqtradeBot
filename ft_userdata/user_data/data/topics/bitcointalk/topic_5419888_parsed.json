Then you can raffle the reward, one lucky user or maybe few will be win the prize.It's better like that, because I know you can't reward each person due the fund.",

There is no way you can pay all those who submit their answers because the questions are only easy to answer and I think it can be abused easily. If you are serious then you should specify how much people you will need depending on your budget and all those who are willing to participate must post a reply here first together with their wallet address.But, what wallet are you using? I think there is a wallet which enable you to send to multiple addresses at once and I think you can save fees that way. It's also normal that the fees are high if you are using an Ethereum network in usdt but you can always use tron to greatly reduce the fees.",
