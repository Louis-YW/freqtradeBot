I got a delivery Job were I was receiving $300 per month just to keep myself busy until a bigger job will come.

And he introduced me to online business which is Bitcoin investment because he knew that I study business administration in school those days and he thought me everything about Bitcoin investment include buy Bitcoin when the price is low in the market and hold until the price increase higher to my satisfaction before I can sell to make something good from the market. I started developing more interest on Bitcoin investment, because the way he impacted the knowledge to me how someone can become a rich man through Bitcoin investment that made me to do everything possible within my power to aquire the knowledge at the moment. And I started Bitcoin investment in the month of October 2017 when the price of Bitcoin was $6,468, were I invested $10,000 all the money I saved from my delivery job in Bitcoin investment and hold for like 3 years before I released my bitcoins to the market in the month ofÂ  December 2020 during the Christmas period when the price of Bitcoin increased to $23,400 that helped me to achieved massive incomes from my Bitcoin investment that changed my life in the society.HERE'S HOW BITCOIN CHANGED ME AND CAN CHANGED YOU TOO:1) my relationship with people: Try to have a strong relationship with people who can impact positive things in your life that will make your future colorful, like what my school childhood friend did to me that changed my life in the society.2) Opportunity: Try to embrace genuine opportunity that will change your life in future, like what I did to eliminated poverty in my family by embraced Bitcoin investment to quit my delivery job that changed me in the society.",

Still working your regular job while investing in bitcoin can still be very profitable and even so ensure that you do not concern yourself much with the market fluctuations which can aid your decision to hodl.

No doubt with bitcoin have changed my life better than before I know with bitcoin, but you are men who strong hand keep holding bitcoin assets with bigger investment fund $10,000 for investing on bitcoin still price $6,468 then three years later sell on$23,400. You have real job and passive salary income and looks easy how to be strong hand on your bitcoin funds investment until three years later for selling, but have many investor just get passive income with bitcoin investment only and they can't become strong hands like you hold bitcoin until three years later.",

Then it turns out that he invested $10,000 to sell it a few years later for $23,400 and thatQuote from: Sebas.tian on September 11, 2022, 01:32:45 PMthat helped me to achieved massive incomes from my Bitcoin investment that changed my life in the society.Then he would also have to explain what he has invested in again in order to generate an \"income\" that I don't know if he knows very well what he is saying.Anyway, I can't imagine in which country the difference between having $10,000 and having $23,000 can change your life. If you live in the USA it is little capital and if you live in the Philippines it is more considerable capital but the difference between the investment and the final result does not change your life. And it turns out that supposedly this has changed his way of being, his relationship with society..... It seems to me quite a lot of bullshit that has more to do with expecting to get merit for the story than anything to do with reality.",

For instance, some people quit jobs and go investing in Bitcoin, ending up losing a lot of money if not even owing others. Moreover, a job is something that certainly gives you money (at least, if you're working officially and in a fairly stable environment where an employer can't just refuse to pay the salary), whereas with investments, you can win and can also lose. Investments should be made more reasonably, when there's still a source of income in case things don't work out.",

You don't necessarily need to quite your job to focus on bitcoin investment its not that it needs the all day. Moreover you can earn from the job your doing to help pay for other expenses and also cover for emergencies like the bear make. Once there is another source of income you can actually holdl your bitcoin in peace during bearish period",
