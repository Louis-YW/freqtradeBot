The server secret represents randomly shuffled card deck. The server seed is a cryptographically secure random alpha-numeric string. The hash of these 2 strings helps to ensure that the initial card deck is not altered after you choose the bet amount. After the game is finished the server secret and the server seed are revealed, so you can easily calculate and verify the hash.When you play a game you can pass an extra custom string - client seed (if it's not specified a random number is automatically generated by your browser). The server will then calculate another hash using the server secret, the server seed and the client seed. The last 5 chars of this hash (representing a hexadecimal value) will be converted to an integer. The result number will be divided by 52 (number of cards in the deck) and N cards will be cut (moved from the top to the bottom of the deck), where N is the remainder of the division. Because the client seed can not be predicted by the server the number of cards cut from the initial deck is completely random and hence you can be sure that the game result is fair.DiceThe algorithm works in the same way except that in case of Dice game the server secret represents intially rolled random number (0-9999). When you place a bet this initial roll is adjusted by the Shift value to get the final roll.SlotsWhen you open the game page the server generates a secret and a seed and reveals its hash (using HMAC SHA256 algorithm). The server secret represents the number of spins each reel should make. The server seed is a cryptographically secure random alpha-numeric string. The hash of these 2 strings helps to ensure that the initial numbers of spins are not altered after you choose the number of lines and bet amount. After the game is finished the server secret and the server seed are revealed, so you can easily calculate and verify the hash.When you play a game you can pass an extra custom string - client seed (if it's not specified a random number is automatically generated by your browser). The server will then calculate another hash using the server secret, the server seed and the client seed. The last 5 chars of this hash (representing a hexadecimal value) will be converted to an integer (Shift number). Each reel will be spun N extra times, where N is the remainder of the division of the Shift number by initial number of spins. Because the client seed can not be predicted by the server the number of extra spins is completely random and hence you can be sure that the game result is fair.We accept the following 85+ altcoins:BCH - Bitcoin Cash, BTC - Bitcoin, BUSD - Binance USD (ERC20), CBUCKS - CRYPTOBUCKS, CELO - Celo, CLOAK - CloakCoin, COM - CommonsOS (ERC20), CRW - Crown, CURE - CureCoin, DASH - Dash, DGB - DigiByte, DIVI - Divi, DOGE - Dogecoin, ETC - Ether Classic, ETH - Ether, ETN - Electroneum, EURS - STASIS EURS, EVC - EventChain, FIRO - Firo, FUEL - Fuel Token, GLX - GlobCoin, GRS - Groestlcoin, GUAP - Guapcoin, GUSD - Gemini dollar, ILC - ILCOIN, KMD - Komodo, KRS - Kinguin Krowns, LTC - Litecoin, MET - Metronome, OKB - OKB, OXEN - Oxen, PIVX - PIVX, POA20 - POA20 (ERC20 Token), QASH - QASH, QTUM - Qtum, ROC - Rasputin Online Coin, RVN - Ravencoin, SAI - Sai, SBC - SB Coin, SKIN - SkinCoin, SMART - SmartCash, SNBL.Old - Snowball, SRN - Sirin, STORJ - StorjToken, SYS - Syscoin, TPAY - TokenPay, TRP - Tronipay, TRX - TRON, TUSD - TrueUSD, UCA - Ucacoin, UKG - UnikoinGold, USDC - USD Coin (ERC20), USDT.ERC20 - Tether USD (ERC20), VTC - Vertcoin, WAVES - Waves, WOM.Old - WOM Token (Old Token), XEM - NEM, XMR - Monero, XVG - VERGE, ZEC - ZCash, ZEN - Horizen, ZYN - Zynecoin, cUSD - Celo Dollar, magTAC - The Advertising Currency - Magazines, outTAC - The Advertising Currency - Outdoor, radTAC - The Advertising Currency - Radio, sBTC - Siambitcoin, socTAC - The Advertising Currency - Social, teTAC - The Advertising Currency - Traffic Exchange, tvTAC - The Advertising Currency - Television, vidTAC - The Advertising Currency - Video, vmTAC - The Advertising Currency - Viral Mailers",

Since 2013, FinancialTechnologies[1] has been selling fucktons of casino game scripts. I am not passing judgment on their business because I believe it is still legal to design programs and be paid for them. However, utilizing them for commercial purposes feels like cheating gamblers in some respects even if you say that they have bought them.But, yeah, would you mind telling us how you identify websites that bought scripts from the market?[1] https://codecanyon.net/user/financialtechnology",

But if @OP does not add more gambling games to his casino, I am not sure if he can invite or attract more users since the games on his casino are classic games.

The license is enough to prove that they have a good reputation but since they don't have any license, They are doing that scammy tag line to assure players that they are not scammers which is ironic. The website seems a cheap software that bought on random person that selling a generic script. It's very laggy while the live support is not available.I don't want to accuse them since they are new but that's the vibes I'm getting when I visit it.",

Usually it's also terrible if they attach a big size images since it's long to wait the images loaded successfully.I looked the site there's a betting history either the user won, lose or tie about the games, but how's possible those gamblers keep playing when the withdrawal feature isn't working? Does it's fake history?",
