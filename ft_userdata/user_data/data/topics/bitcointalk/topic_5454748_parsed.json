And about DEX, only try popular tokens, not some token that anyone is not aware of. All the required information about security concerns and especially about how to use the platform should be listed on their own respective platform's helps or documentation page as follows.https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-ushttps://docs.pancakeswap.finance/readme/get-startedhttps://academy.binance.com/en/articles/a-guide-to-pancakeswaphttps://docs.aave.com/faq/One thing to bear in mind, just in case you join their own social media communities, be aware of scammers that pretend to want help you, usually they are messaging you in DM instead of on the public chat group.",

I would like to try some type of defi or anything else that would be useful to try/learn/use etc. There isn't much about \"how to use Dapps correctly\".Dapps are just apps which run in a decentralized plataform. There are many kinds of Dapps, from DEX to games.Games are usually very boring, like Cryptokitties or something else NFT related. Basically, all Dapps so far are focused on financial transactions somehow, as even NFT are most used to speculate and make money.",

Unfortunately as long as Metamask won't be a standalone application it will remain not fully safe. And it's always better to keep a browser dedicated to its use.But if OP has some concerns about that it's better to choose a wallet with the WalletConnect feature in order to interact with Dapps, he can find a comprehensive list here : https://walletconnect.com/explorer?type=wallet (You can use most of them directly on your PC if you need it, by using an Android emulator like BlueStacks for example)The WalletConnect feature is very easy to use, you just need to flash a QR-code(or to manually enter the string of the code) and to confirm the connection.",

Well I guess its safe enough for me. So far dont know which altcoin wallet could be better than metamask. Yes not fully safe, maybe you could suggest one besides it which is like 100% safe and secure. Though its will depends on someone habit how he can protect himself from unwanted dapps that are made by scammers. I guess I remain safe from thieves since I was careful on dapps as well and not easily caught up with lousy one.",

But it can also be corrupted by the browser in order to steal informations entered into it. Backdoors can be implemented in one version(of the plugin or the browser) and disappear in the next one, in order to avoid being spotted. That's why I don't like plugins.",

Its a dapp and new one and they only used metamask for the sale. I have a whitelist spot there and got a 20% discount. Its not like I dont want to use metamask, especially in dapps its the most required one to use. Anyway thanks for the heads up.",

And most of them are easy to connect and use via metamask, and you can completely trust the security when using, of course there are still many problems for newcomers to join but please remember to join reputable dapps to avoid unfortunate incidents.",

You can  use the interet  to search more  information about the dApp you plan to use and you can also find tutorial on youtubr or other platform on how to use it. It's simple but there's really so much to consider especially if you plan to try unverified ones. Interacting with it will be easy as you repeatedly doing it but yeah always be careful.",
