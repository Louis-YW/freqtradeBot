  "content": "You'd see some exceptional women tag themselves \"king\", but no exceptional man tags himself queen.\"Happy Father's Day to my mother.\"\"The Woman King.\"There's no \"The Man Queen.\"Does it mean everyone unanimously accepts that the symbol of power and authority is a man?This tweet came across my timeline, I gave it a thought (maybe there was little to think about anyways) and agree with the contents.
