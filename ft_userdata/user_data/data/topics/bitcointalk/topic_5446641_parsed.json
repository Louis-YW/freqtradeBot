What's your take on the price?If trap on top, you can't do anything about it but to wait for the next bull run not unless you can afford to sell at a big loss.This is a reminder that you should always have your cut loss price and don't be greedy. Timing the market is very important.The current price is still cheap, buy if you still have the money but again you have to timing the trend so you will not be trap again.New ATH are still possible though, just be more patient and try to look for other opportunities in this market while you are still waiting for the bull.",

What's your take on the price?It is very important that you have enough knowledge before investing, otherwise you will end up paying a huge price for your decision. Bitcoin is a long-term investment, so don't worry too much about its price in the short term, and make sure you're investing with cold money. When investing in bitcoin, please pay attention to how much bitcoin you can hold, don't care too much about its USD value. You should stop checking the price every day and learn about bitcoin instead, when you know all about bitcoin, you will know what to do next. Remember that 1BTC = 1BTC, so if you do not sell, you do not lose anything.",

What's your take on the price?Bitcoin is a volatile assets that is why you should understand and have the proper knowledge of it. Don't get upset that the price has gone below the amount you bought, that is why it is wise for you to invest in a long term investment, so that the dump or pump in price wouldn't be a problem. Relax and wait till next year after bitcoin halving, so that you can recover from your loss when bitcoin price hits ATH before selling some part of it. I hope you didn't use the money for something important to invest. Stop checking the price and remove your mind from your loss instead see this as an opportunity for you to accumulate more bitcoin for yourself. Nobody can tell if the price will shoot higher than what you bought tomorrow. Don't panic as this is a norm to all bitcoin investors that understands the price movement. Bitcoin is not a quick profit investment, there is always a time for you to make profit from your investment.",

It is barely above the previous ATH, about 30% above whereas in every previous cycle price were at least 900% above that previous ATH (ie at $200k).As for my take on the current price and the market, I still think the demand is increasing every day specially as the banking system fail and the inflation grows since people are losing their faith in the corrupt monetary system and want something that can act as a hedge against inflation.But the problem is that at the same time we have recession in most countries that are mainly defined in the Western Bloc and in recession people liquidate their assets and are not capable of making more investments.The combination of these two forces is creating this weird market where price shows all kinds of rising signals and yet it only goes up a little.",

What's your take on the price?When we have bought bitcoin at a high price, make it a bitter experience and of course very disappointing. However, it is important to remember that investing always involves risk, and losses can occur even with the best investment decisions.I think there are a few things you need to do when you're in a situation like that. Don't let emotions rule your mind. When you experience loss, you may feel upset, angry, or hopeless. However, it is important not to let emotions take over and to think rationally and objectively. Learn from your mistakes because Every failure can be a valuable lesson. Try to evaluate why your investment is not working and what you can learn for the future.Most importantly Don't panic, Sometimes when the price of bitcoin drops or you experience a loss, you may be tempted to sell assets quickly. However, it is important to remain calm and evaluate the situation wisely before making a decision because bitcoin is a valuable asset for the future so there is no need to be afraid when the price drops.",

What's your take on the price?It's hard to give an opinion on price when all you're looking for is Bitcoin. Because as you can see and also what everyone is seeing at this time that Bitcoin is still facing a correction in the market even though it will always be used properly by traders who believe they will get profits in the following days. But for some holders who are waiting for the best price at a higher level, of course there is saturation too, although they can still be patient waiting for that to happen. And you only need to be patient to return what has been lost or what has been reduced at this time and you don't need to distance yourself from the internet or Bitcoin because you still have hope of getting your capital back through price recovery the next day.",

What's your take on the price?For me, it is still a good price to buy, we are still in bear market, so consider it cheap. Of course the best time to buy is last year when we go down to $15,500 and that is the lowest low that we have in this bear market.However, we can't go back to that price anymore, just like when we did see $3k'ish during March 2020 when we heard news about the whole pandemic. So you really have to think at the price right now, could be good entry point still and then wait till the next bull run 2024-2025. As per my experience, you should go with long term investment here.",

Sure you can keep learning more about it later on but it is better not to be late and just buy bitcoin and hold it. That way you would be sure that you are doing the right thing while learning what the right thing is later on.Maybe they wouldn't know why buying bitcoin and holding it for many years is the right thing to do when they do it, but then they will have time to learn about it later on as well. If they start trading right away, that would be the hard part and I think that would be a trouble for most people and should be able to learn eventually but start with a big loss overtime.",

It's not good to check the price every single hour, that's not healthy at all. Find other things to get busy with.

The market is very unpredictable so you have to do your best to analyze, and don’t just make any guess trade. The price can be your basis, but don’t rely on that alone.
