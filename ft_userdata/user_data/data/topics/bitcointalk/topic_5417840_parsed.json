However, it concluded the military force is at risk of being unable to “meet the demands of a single major regional conflict” and would be “ill-equipped to handle two nearly simultaneous” conflicts.The Heritage Foundation listed each of the military branches for individual rankings based on capability, capacity, and readiness, according to the report. The Marine Corps fared the best, receiving an overall “strong” rating — an improvement from its “marginal” rating in 2021.The Air Force fell to the bottom of the list, receiving an overall “very weak” rating due to struggles with pilot production and retention, leaving “little doubt that it would struggle in war with a peer competitor.” The Navy and Space Force were rated as “weak,” and the Army was considered “marginal.”The report also analyzed the country’s nuclear capabilities compared to other countries, rating U.S. nuclear weapons as “strong” but trending toward “marginal” or even “weak.”“No matter how much America desires that the world be a simpler, less threatening place that is more inclined to beneficial economic interactions than violence-laden friction, the patterns of history show that competing powers consistently emerge and that the U.S. must be able to defend its interests in more than one region at a time,\" the report said.https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/heritage-foundation-ranks-us-military-as-weak-for-first-time/ar-AA136fH3....Interesting commentary here. What does it mean?I remember following the news as far back as 2012. Around 10 years ago it was known that the united states was losing the war in afghanistan. They were losing territory and steadily being pushed back by the taliban. The united states might have controlled 25% of afghanistan while the taliban controlled the remaining 75%. If I remember correctly, this was the situation near to a decade ago. Circumstances steadily deteriorated until americans finally retreated in a disorderly manner. Everyone was taken by surprise, as if they had not realized america was on the losing side of the war for 10 years.Now it seems that we finally have official commentary on the topic. Think tanks like heritage foundation are beginning to acknowledge the US military isn't the unstoppable unbeatable force many of us had come to believe it to be. It seems as if a shift of some type is taking place. Perhaps the illusion of american global supremacy is fading. As an american I would not mind. When people think they're the best, it becomes a powerful excuse to be unmotivated and lazy. What does this mean and will there be a real backlash or repurcussions due to it?",

      "body": "The state of the US Armed Forces and its combat readiness will now be greatly affected by the Russian-Ukrainian war, in which a lot of NATO weapons are used on the Ukrainian side. The experience of waging this war shows that the arming of NATO is much more effective than the arms of Russia. In this regard, orders for the purchase and supply of weapons from Russia are already rapidly falling, while the demand for NATO weapons, on the contrary, is growing. In addition, the countries of Europe that are part of the alliance are now dramatically increasing their defense capabilities. The defense factories that produce weapons for NATO countries, which proved to be effective in Ukraine, will be fully loaded in the coming years, which means that their profits will grow.Of course, the United States will draw certain conclusions for the training and equipment of its soldiers. In general, Russia's war in Ukraine will strongly encourage the development of the military-industrial complex of NATO member countries, and in general in the world.",

This should be no surprise after a decade of Obama and Biden being in charge of the military and the associated budget cuts. The focus on \"equity\" is not helping things either.",

I don’t see any reality where it could be classified as weak in comparison with any other fighting force on the planet. I don't think the heading is misleading because these are the actual words of the research institution and it has been reported by different reputable news outlets. The most striking feature of this report is that the research company is based in Washington and this is the first time they have been rated as weak. It might be true that the US is not currently giving the right attention to its military because this great nation is distracted by so many issues. This has led to poor recruitment and training. It is true that the US is the most powerful and expensive armed force on earth, but currently, China and Russia are also improving.The US government needs to wakeup and do more because America is a very important player in the protection and security of the world. It is a nation that protects the defenceless.",
