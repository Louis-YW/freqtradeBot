For this^ to happen>All shadowforks must pass without any major bugs. >Public Testnets should merge without any bugsWe have been through 4 shadowforks, and all of them went through successfully.They have planned a 5th shadowfork(possibly final) for 20th may. Lets dedicate this thread to the discussion of merge, the day when GPU mining will be officially dead(forever?)My estimate for now: Merge in August 2022Place your bets here : https://polymarket.com/market-group/ethereum-merge-pos",

      "body": "13/05/2022 Updates: Shadowfork 4 was a success, except for minor bugs with erigon.Another shadowfork planned for next weekSource: https://twitter.com/parithosh_j/status/1524767841773363200There's a dev meeting scheduled for today. Tune into the meeting at 1400 UTC(1 hr from now): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFxkGdPv4F8 Devs meeting has been concluded.Major point from the meeting: ->They are going to merge Ropsten chain on 8th June.->They didn't talk about the difficulty bomb at all(surprising).->There were a few voices rasied to delay Ropsten merge till 15th, but majority of devs wanted to get it done earlier. Hence, 8th of June.My conclusion from today's meeting and how it effects the merge:  Difficulty bomb has been predicted for 15th June 2022. We definitely aren't going to merge mainnet by 15th June 2022. So they are going to delay the bomb.  It's going to be the final delay(unless they stumble across some major issue during testnet merge).This delay will be in accordance with mainnet merge date(i.e. whichever date devs are confident with). Judging by how the development is going, it will be a delay of 2 months from June 15th. So 15th of August is my prediction for merge.",

The market may be a factor in their decision making.But what excuses can they give once everything is developed, tested, and concluded as working.  They can't stall it forever without any real reason.",

In the latest core dev call they set a date for Ropsten merge on Jun 8. Add two weeks and you get Jun 22 for the 2nd testnet. Add another two weeks and you get Jul 6 for the 3rd (and final) testnet. Add a further two weeks and you get Jul 20 when they can do Mainnet.This is all assuming no issues with the testnet merges.So why did you go up to Aug 15?",
