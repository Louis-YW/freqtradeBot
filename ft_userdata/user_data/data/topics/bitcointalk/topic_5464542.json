When I was a newbie to bitcoin, I checked the chart myself from 2009 and which I will prefer and encourage people to do.You talked about bitcoin to reach ATH of $69000, but you did not talk about how the price has fallen already which makes it cheap to buy again because the price of bitcoin is $26000 now and you uploaded that YouTube video not up to an hour ago.",

Maybe focusing about money oriented isn't really a good way to introduce BTC to newcomers, but your are intended to talk about the price, so I can't judge it. How long you create this video? considering this is your first video in this year, the previous one was a year ago.",

Actually I feel that the video is not only a video about a brief explanation about Bitcoin but I think the video is also an interesting and unique work of art.It's rare to see a video explaining Bitcoin briefly by combining or combining videography and the art of drawing like that in my opinion.I think this is a good and really interesting way to introduce Bitcoin to beginners because some people are more able to capture something new through videos or visuals than through reading, sometimes when reading an article about Bitcoin knowledge it will feel very boring and feel long but with visual videos like this it feels more fun and feels short.",

Not very professional and I felt your video lack sentiments like Why Bitcoin is importantWhat was the actual reason why the government to date fears BitcoinWhy Bitcoin is important and what makes it uniqueWhat I liked about the video is how you created hand-drawn images to graphics and I assume you might have used a video AI to create such content. The voiceover is not human I feel you might have used another AI to do it. Such videos using AI have been going viral on the Internet. I hope your video does the same as eventually it will help Bitcoin.",

I recognize the amount of creativity needed to put that clip together, and I applaud you for it. The video will be able to help newbies who are technology friendly but not to newbies who do not have a means to watch the short movie. Also newbies who will be referred to this video, will still need to be followed up.From now moving forward, I will refer people to your mini movie if they demand knowing about the history of bitcoins and how the journey has been so far.",

But after I watched for 20 seconds, I found it interesting, your speaking style and sound effects make it even more interesting. cool bro, you have summarized bitcoin price movements well and provided a brief background why bitcoin prices rise and fall like a roller coasterYou must have spent a lot of time creating those images and making those videos. I really enjoy the videos you make. I have subscribed to your channel, I hope you can be even more enthusiastic about creating content about bitcoin",

The video tried to simplify the volatility of bitcoin and some of the causes. At least newbies will understand the price history of bitcoin from inception till date. It can also make them overcome FUD because they have gotten a picture of the past. But I would have preferred the video to be more colorful with different pictures and not just a graphic display. I don't know if it was relative, the background sound was too loud. Notwithstanding it was a good try and a good teaching material for newbies. Well done for putting your creativity to work for the spread of bitcoin awareness.",

Bitcoin has passed 13 years since Satoshi first introduced it to the public, Bitcoin's journey has not reached its halfway, there are still other surprises that could happen in the following years. Regarding the price of Bitcoin which continues to increase without limit, I am very optimistic that Bitcoin can break new records when more people still find Bitcoin boring to learn or who are not ready to accept Bitcoin in their lives. When the positive direction has approached most of the people who have never been involved in Bitcoin become interested in learning Bitcoin, then it will be the golden age of Bitcoin as more and more people are competing to get Bitcoin.",

I have also become a follower of your channel hahaha.After watching the video, we see that the fall of Bitcoin has always been influenced by third parties who want to take advantage of people's panic. And they've made it this far, and I suspect they will be like that in the future too, unless people can avoid panic.",
