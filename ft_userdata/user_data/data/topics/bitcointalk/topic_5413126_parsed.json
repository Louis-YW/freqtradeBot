  "content": "Hello, I bought Sapphire RX580 from Ebay, the card is in really good condition. I was out of country when it arrived, i asked someone to put it on a rig after installing it mined at 24 megahash which is less for RX580. After several months I changed it's bios on hiveos under Overclocking. Usually when I change bios on hive it doesn't mod normally so I force bios and it work perfectly fine but here I did a mistake, instead of choosing PULSE Bios I wrongly select NITRO+ Bios because I have many Nitro+ so I thought it's also Nitro+ and I changed bios remotely. I main reason of changing the bios was because of timeout error and it also affect other GPUs in the rig sometime which need to be fixed manually and it was hard because I was out.Now I can't change bios because RX580 is not detected by amdvbflashWin.Please help me if something could be done, I bought this card quite expensive around $345 when ETH at $4000, it worked for few days only due to error and pulled it from the rig for month and half.I am attaching 6x screenshots will brief the condition clearly. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l9qicpfuar1ief8/AADmtv2lr8kj6jPG2lkEZLRda?dl=0Thank you all for your anticipation!Best Regards.",

      "body": "If Hive OS and amdvbflashWin cannot update the BIOS, then the easiest way is to take the video card to the workshop with the BIOS you need. If the master has special pads for flashing the BIOS without soldering from the motherboard, then it will be even better. In my country, this service costs no more than $20.",
