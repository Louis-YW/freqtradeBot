I check most of the apps out there with that keyword and most of the reviews are negative or bad. So you will never payout after 90 days and actually if you mine directly to the pool with real miner sample antminer s19 then the payout is instantly in your account until you reach the minimum withdrawal from the pool anytime you can request for withdrawal. So any miner apps all of them are scam and beware to install them in your phone it maybe collect sensitive data from your phone.",

Applications are very dangerous and your devices can be infected, compromised and your funds can be stolen.Why do you want to try 90 days and just wait for luck to get your rewards? If even if they pay you, they can cheat you by censoring your reward, pay less than what you should receive.Cloud mining is very scam too.Cloudmining 101 (ponzi risk assessment)",

Read reviews about the application/software to judge whether it's legit or scam is pointless because they can easily create fake reviews in order to convince other peoples. The best way if you want to check the reviews of application/software related to Bitcoin is this forum.QuoteHave you ever sat down to ask yourself; where will they get the money to pay me?

Most cloud mining tricked their customers by promising the fixed payment for every week or money after you make deposit depends on the plan offered by the sites. They're lying if they will use that money to buy mining rigs and they will take care of it, but in the end they will scam even though the plan is make sense.",

Some Bitcoin faucets pay in very tiny amounts of Satoshis when the withdrawal minimum is meet, I am not sure they still exists today, I myself made some mBTC through one of those apps but I uninstalled because it takes forever to get the withdrawal limit. If you are not claiming Sats every hours or 4 hours then that's a fake cloud mining app, do not waste your time on the app, in the end, you might not get anything after the 90 days you claimed to get paid.",

Regular apps don't mine Bitcoin, AFAIK.The BTC mining process requires alot of energy to conserve and drive the rig, which is impossible to account for so easily.No matter how many reviews you see in there, it's fake!! ... they've even improvised this days and have made much more unidentifiable reviews; back then, the work was obviously fake and crappy. Don't even dare to see what happens, cus you'll be asked to deposit a certain amount of BTC first -- which makes it a provable SCAM.!Sandra 🧑‍🦰",
