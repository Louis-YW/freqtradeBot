It is a website where you will get paid by viewing ads, all you need is to register with them and deposit $100 to activate the account and earn money by viewing ads. There is also a telegram group but I did not join it nor did I register with this platform. I checked Whois that it was registered in October 17 2022 and expired on October 17, 2032 does that show the platform is legit? I suspect it is scam because the site does not have term of use or privacy policy and no contact number only email address and social media links. Upon checking the address it is in Dublin Ireland but when viewing the address via Google street view it is an address for bicycle shop. Anyone heard of this platform. I searched in Google but could not find any info.",

They claim that you can receive 2.3% daily interest on your balance just for viewing 1 ad.If you are paid for viewing ads, why should you make a deposit and why should they give you interest on your balance?As already mentioned above that's a scam.Do not waste your money and avoid any get-quick-rich scheme.

This is definitely a scam.I previously worked on PTC sites, but they never asked to deposit any amount. Most of these sites are fraudulent, but at least they do not ask to deposit any amount of money to activate the account. Some sites offer you to upgrade the account to Premium by paying a sum of money, but in general, all These sites are scams and the honest ones pay only very paltry profits.",

I had to do a search here to verify for myself, but nothing of the nature here. Just like other members have said here, I will also join them in giving you such advice as well. Run away from that site for your own life; otherwise, you stand a chance of being scammed by scammers. You should count yourself lucky to have knowledge about this platform to make inquiries about them. This was a smart move by you to safeguard yourself from stress.I will request that you make that website known here so we can see for ourselves and take every necessary step and caution to stay clear of it.",

Adswage isn't the only platform that requires users to pay fees to participate in their earning program. Twitter, Distrokid, and many other platforms follow a similar approach. These fees are typically in place to safeguard the platform against scammers who might exploit the program by creating multiple free accounts.Now, I'd like to ask you: How would you propose preventing referral and bot fraud in such a program if it were made free for everyone? Consider why platforms like Twitter and Distrokid charge users upfront. Why do they not deduct fees from your account after you've earned money?This platform is legitimate, and I challenge you to provide any evidence of being scammed if you claim otherwise.",

My advice to the OP is this: if $100 seems like too much of a risk for you, then it might be better to explore other opportunities and move on from this platform. However, if you have the financial capacity to afford the risk, I recommend giving it a try. In investing, the absence of risk usually means minimal or no returns. Personally, I actively seek out risks as they often lead to profitable opportunities. I'm already a member of Adswage, and I can confirm that everything is functioning as expected there. That being said, it's important to note that no business or platform in the world is entirely risk-free.",
