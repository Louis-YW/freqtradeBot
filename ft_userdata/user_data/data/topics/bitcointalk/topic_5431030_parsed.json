  "content": "Something That Happened In My Area Few Days Ago... It was just the next street after mine, was there having an evening gist with a friend of mine.. Here is how it all started. someone I know (not a friend of mine, not an enemy either), on a Friday evening at around 6pm played a lottery, it's a local lottery that announces winners every 3 hours.For example - -The first round starts 9 am and ends  at 12 pm,Second round starts 12 pm and ends at 3 pmThird round starts 3 pm and ends at 6 pmForth round starts 6 pm and ends at 9 pmThis is how the game goes on every single day from Monday to Sunday, that is the entire 7 days of the week. So this guy played the lottery at around 6pm on Friday in a local game shop, at 9:15 pm, he went out to check the result of the game, luckily, he won, approximately $198.He took his ticket to the game attendant where he played the game, the game attendant confirmed his win but unfortunately was out of cash that night, he could pay the guy at that moment, he called his boss~that is the real owner of the game shop, they told the guy to come and collect his winnings on Monday, the following week at 10am in the morning, and the guy said no problem and left.On Saturday morning, he came to the game shop and asked the attendant if he could play the lottery and the payment deducted from his winning which they owe him, by Monday morning, whatever balance remaining from his winning, he would collect it, the attendant after confirming from his boss said yes, so the guy start playing the lottery again and the money deducted from his winning as agreed.Long story short... By Monday morning at the agreed time which is 10am, the guy went to the game shop to collect the money remaining from his winning, after the calculation, he was told he's the one owing the game shop an approximate of $5.First, it was amusing to him cus he started laughing, he actually thought they were joking until things become really serious, he refused to agree that he has gambled away all his winnings, not to talk of owing the game shop, he was then asked to bring all the tickets of the games he played from Saturday through Sunday, but unfortunately, he already threw most of the tickets away.A serious fight later broke out, as the guy went out, hired some thugs to beat and to forcefully collect money from the shop attendant, the owner of the game shop who i believe was called on phone, came with some thugs as well, and the result was brutal, unfortunately, I could not get the opportunity-Infact, it didn't even occur to me to take pictures or try to record anything as we all had to run for our lives at a stage. After about 30 minutes of fierce fighting, with many injured and properties destroyed, police landed and the thugs began to run away, at the end, they arrested the owner of the game shop, his attendant, some of the thugs the shop owner brought and some of the thugs the other guy brought, unfortunately, he that caused/started the fight escaped, some said he escaped even before the police came when he saw that things had already gotten out of control. As of yesterday, I was told they the police are still looking for him.This is an example of how a little issue can end up turning communities up side down. In this case who do you think is at fault, who make the mistake? Is it the game shop that allowed the gambler play from an unsettled winning? Or is it the gambler who gambled too much and refused to believe that he has gambled all his unsettled winning away? Let's discuss and you be the judge.",

If he did gamble the money away, I would've thought it'd be up to the store to prove he's done that, and not ask him for the receipts. However, obviously the customer shouldn't hired the thugs as you put it. So, ultimately everyone involved broke the law at one point on that night, and they all probably deserve the penalties for that. I don't think it's too much of a problem that the shop allowed deducting of the winnings, ultimately a lot of casinos allow you to do that. It's the upholding of rightful winnings, and then escalating the situation to violence that's not right here.",

      "body": "If I were the winner I would surely keep track of what I owe the gambling house and keep some proofs to cover my ass in the event that the gambling house refuses to pay me. What transpired on that day is probably fueled by emotions and not rationality, because if the latter is present then no violence and serious incident would have happened. Also, it is in the best interest of the gambling house to keep a record of everything that is going on in the platform that involves money. It will also save them the hassle and trouble if they can show a receipt of what a person owes, how much do they owe a certain person, and on which dates/hours does this person used his winnings to bet on. Well, the damage has been done, and I think both parties deserved those jail time if ever they incurred any.",

Let's discuss and you be the judge. Well personally I think i have experienced such scenerio before in my area and all this actually boils down to the person who won the lottery,  i think he is just an irresponsible gambler who lacks control over his gambling habit. The first mistake he did was to ask for the attendant to play more games for the money to be deducted the from his winning because the moment one gets lost in the act, you truly can't know how much you have used because at the time you will be confident that you still have money and may continue playing till you exhausted everything @#addiction. But for the case of calling thugs and fighting , i think the punishment given to both parties was actually fair.",

They should so that it will have a proof. And why the owner allow him to do that in the first place? And why not pay him right away?Not sure about bringing the thugs but it's possible that the person can do that, maybe he really has some influence in his place or the money to pay that thugs.In any case, it was kind of messy, so the best thing that the owner can do is file charges to the guy.",

Maybe the owner tried to cheat and that's why it ended up with that calculation. But if the owner has just enough cash, there will be no problem on it and the violence won't occur because the guy will just gamble and pay again no matter how many times he will bet again on that lottery shop. Well, both are at fault when they have resulted into violence wherein fact that they can just have a peaceful talk.",

It's a risk that can too easily turn against them. And this is a similar case.So on the money side, I think that the shop owner has made a mistake he has to pay for.Of course, on assault/body harm matter, both the gambler, the shop owner and both' thugs have the blame.",

But to all appearances he is a gambling addict, because he could not wait to win and started asking for new lottery tickets to win and it is quite possible that he did not keep track of the lottery tickets. In general, the situation is quite controversial, but the fight does not solve anything and is likely to lead to a more difficult situation for everyone. 200 dollars is not such a large amount to start such a conflict over it.  Yes, he should have gone to the police first and let them handle it, and not the thugs that somehow also lead the chaos. But I believe, both parties have their own faults and instead of putting the case into more legal, they even chose to make it more worst seeing damages around. But maybe, the gambler alone knows that he’s a gambling addict and try to cheat the lottery owner. But things turn out not on his side so calling all his thugs maybe the first solution he could ever think.",

He could try to call the police or look for some lawyers, but to bring friends to a fight is something different, it should be a last resort... and consequences are almost always worse than the initial loss. Now all of them are in greater problem than the sum in question for sure...Violence shouldn't be the answer, as I said, it's something like the last thing to do if you are really out of options... I think these guys involved now have a bigger problem just because they're \"hotheads\"!
