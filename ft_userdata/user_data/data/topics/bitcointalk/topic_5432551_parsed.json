  "content": "Thanks for checking out my post!My name is Rambo, and I've been playing guitar for 24+ years. I've been consistently teaching for a living for 6+ years now..I gave over 1000 private 1 on 1 lessons professionally in a major music store in Texas for 3 years, as well as taught my ownGuitar Masterclass at the West Texas Guitar Festival, at the Wagner Noel Performing Arts Center in 2017 and 2018..Here's a link to my \"official\" lesson ad    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsRFoa9Ez0kI've relocated, so I do my lessons online now - using Skype, Zoom, Discord, or occasionally Facebook Messenger.I've had international students, however I'm limited to english speaking students only I teach all styles, beginner to expert level -Technique, Theory, Rhythm, Songwriting, Composition, Covers, Recording, Stage Performance, Guitar Tech Setup, Gear, Improvisation, Strategy, Exercises, Drills, Patterns, as well as tips and tricks to take your playing to the next level, or speed up your progress.My personal style and interest are in lead guitar playing (Joe Satriani, Paul Gilbert, Jason Richardson, ect)however, I have alot of experience in almost every style on the guitar, and I have a very wide taste in music.My teachings are inspired by martial arts masters such as Sun Tzu, Musashi, Bruce Lee, and Hanshi Steven Kaufman.My pricing is very affordable (my standard rate is $30 in btc for 1 hour of lessons - 1 a week minimum)I also provide chord charts, scale charts, tablature, video examples, references, and more.I also have a great time teaching, and my students tend to enjoy the lessons! I teach Mon-Sun, from 10am - 10pm EST - I'm open to teaching out of my normal schedule if the student is dedicated If you or anyone you know is interested in lessons - please feel welcome to reply!",

      "body": "I so much like your skill and I could remember that I was once a classical guitarist then when I was in college and I still vividly have some of the insight about what it takes to play and teach students especially when you have students that are ready to learn and comprehend sight reading. I would like to know what kind of guitarist you are so maybe I could refer friends to you if you don't charge too much they can afford. This is a good skill and you can even earn more when you play in concert. Good luck!",

Life, you know?I'm actually doing the best I've ever done with teaching on my own, by myself. I've got about 14 students a week. Which isn't much but It's better than I've done. I can absolutely help make it achievable - I've taken students who were dead beginners and helped them learn to the point that they're writing and producing their own music, even shredding guitar! I appreciate your words!!",

I'm glad to hear that you're doing so well.As we are in a Bitcoin forum, the question is mandatory: are you getting paid in BTC by any of your students? I think that I know the answer because the market isn't mature enough and p2p payments are far from mainstream, but you might surprise me.I hope you keep doing this well, and let's see if any forum member is interested in your services now that your thread was bumped.",

Not at the moment though. I give a slight discount if they pay in btc, + a bit more time in the lesson. Most of my students haven't used it, so although I mention it, I don't particularly push it. I fully intend on teaching for the rest of my life. I've also got some plans to pre-record lesson videos, as well as my masterclass so that people can learn on their own schedule. Thanks again! I really do appreciate it!",

I'll be waiting for your reply, as well as saving this so not to miss out.Hey!! Thanks so much for your patience, I totally forgot to even check for replies after I posted this! I'm still teaching, and doing better than ever with it. If you're still interested in getting into it, I'm more than happy to help! I should mention that I do the 1st lesson free! Then,I do the lessons for $35 / hour for beginners, then $45 / an hour for intermediate lessons. I go up to $60 for expert level stuff, which is definitely worth it, but mainly for people who want to approach mastery, and become teachers themselves. If the student pays in bitcoin, I lower the cost to $30, $40, and $50 respectively. I also cover alot of topics outside of just the guitar along the way, such as pattern recognition, comparing other artforms to the guitar, different teaching methods, applying other instruments to the guitar, content creation, production, and basic marketing strategies.. You're more than welome to send me a message if you really want to try it out! Thanks again for your reply!!",

I think maybe I’m a bit too much of an old dog to learn new tricks, but maybe with the right YouTube videos anything is possible. Thanks! I appreciate it. I find that I play my acoustic more in the morning, and my electric more in the evening. I actually teach on both, depending on the song. It's tough to find the balance between learning a specific song and learning to play, but one way is not necessarily better than the other. There's more than one way to the top of the mountain. In any case, the best advice is to take any information you come across and try to find your own personal meaning to it. Regardless of where information comes from, whether from a youtube video, a book, me, or anyone else - the outside world can only show you the surface level of understanding of something. It's totally up to you to reveal the depths of understanding it, typically by studying it, practicing it with repetition, and potentially meditating on it. Feel free to shoot me any questions, I'm more than happy to help!",
