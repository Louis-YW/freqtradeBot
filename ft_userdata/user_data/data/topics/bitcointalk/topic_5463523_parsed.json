You can dream about what you are seeing very well around you. If you gamble, you can think about it and also dream about it at anytime. You may even think you won huge amount of money but woke up to nothing",

      "body": "I usually dream about things I give so much attention to. I once dreamt about winning big and the scream of my celebration woke up some people in the house from sleep. When I told the dream to some people, they said it is a good dream which means that I will soon win big. Since then I have not had any big wins. I love spots bettings and I am always active and passionate when my teams are playing. Sometimes I see a dream about gaming because of the attention I give to betting that period. I don't take dreams seriously because they are nothing but products of our imagination or daily activities. So I am not concerned about them because it is not a sign of any gambling disorder. This is because I strictly follow my gambling plans.",

I believe if we also have other things on our mind or we find away to clear our mind then this occurrence would be less.",

Seem an addiction at one point that even when I'm walking on the mall, the tiles I see on the patio are black and white chess board and I often hop like a knight. No shit    I'm not worried since I'm not losing money but during that time I think I'm losing my mind. Dreaming of gambling I guess is somewhat the same as addiction in my opinion. You are unconsciously showing what you wanted to do with your time and its manifested in your dreams.",

Therefore, there's no point on minding that much about your dreams because it  doesnt really mean something, there are really just those people who are really thatmindful on dreams meaning on the time that they would really be able to dream it out on multiple times whether twice or thrice on which i couldn't really blame on.Even myself would definitely be seeking out some potential meaning if thats the case because its unusual for dreams to reoccur or would happen again and again.",

Resource :https://gamblershelp.com.au/lets-talk-gambling/gambling-dreams/I'm surprised there's such a \"specific\" answer for it. Does that mean that any other dream I have, say about a certain game, means that I'm trying to shut it down? Honestly sounds really far-fetched to me. And while I do dream even if rarely, it's never in an instance where I was really bothered by it in the long run, heck I often forget about them after a few hours so I guess you remembering about it does have some sense of meaning. Well, I reckon anyone playing for almost idk, 12-13 hours maybe? would experience the same thing. I don't really think it's saying to shut down gambling, I think it's just telling you to take a break.",

I will consider it an indication of being too exposed to gambling if I have dreams of me gambling. It will be alarming when it becomes a common occurrence and I will take it as a pointer to reduce my relationship with people who always talk about gambling, reduce or temporarily pause gambling and steer clear of any triggers to such dreams. If you are not a gambler and you are having dreams of you gambling, if you allow these dreams to continue you will start gambling soon.If you are a gambler and you are having dreams of gambling, if you allow these dreams to continue, you will soon become an addict.",

Resource :https://gamblershelp.com.au/lets-talk-gambling/gambling-dreams/ You are not alone mate. Before when I was new in gambling, I kept on dreaming playing inside a casino and earning huge profits. That’s just normal for those who have been very excited to experience their first gambling in a casino and I’d say it’s never something that we should worry about. Gambling is a form of entertainment as what it’s designed, but in most cases we do gambling to chase bigger profits that are hard to experience when we only play at fiestas little casinos.",

      "body": "one problem I see about it is that when a person misinterprets the dream, especially those who are superstitious, it can motivate them to gamble more thinking that their dream is a \"sign\", on top of that I've heard and seen people say they have dreamt about winning in gambling and ends up actually winning, it doesn't matter how much they won, for them as long as they won they think that their dream was a sign and fulfilled which just deepen their beliefs about dreaming about gambling.anyway, just to be clear, I agree with you that it happens when you are doing it or thinking about it too much. I've had my fair share of dreaming that I gamble, and I also have realised that it happens when I think too much about it.",

Sometimes it's just tossing around random thoughts, feelings, and memories that we picked up while awake. They don't hold deep significance or foresee the future.^This is definitely right, that is just a dream.Every interesting activity that we have done will probably become our dream when we sleep and we give them a meaning but the fact is they are essentially the product of our brain's activity during sleep. Because for me, dreams can be a mixture of random thoughts, emotions, and memories that our brain processes while we sleep. They don't necessarily hold a profound or prophetic meaning, and they certainly don't predict the future. Instead, they are like a mental playground where our minds explore, process, and play with the information they have gathered while we are awake, nothing else.",
