The series premiered on February 20, 2022. In April 2022, the series was renewed for a second season, which premiered on April 23, 2023. In a nightmarish town in middle America that traps everyone who enters, unwilling residents strive to stay alive and search for a way out, but they are plagued by the terrifying nocturnal creatures from the surrounding forest and secrets hidden in the town.If you ever watched Lost, FROM has a similar vibe. That's because it comes from the creators of Lost. It's one of those shows that grabs your attention from within the first 10 minutes. I loved the season 1, and it's great to see that the season 2 lifted off with similar dynamic.You can watch FROM season 1 on HBOMax, all episodes. Season 2 is airing on MGM+ every Sunday. Currently, it's available only to fans from the US, but here's how you can watch it outside the states:1) Subscribe to MGM+2) Subscribe to NordVPN or any other VPN you like3) Choose United States as your location4) Enjoy the show!This might contain spoilers if you haven't watched season 1 yetTo kick off discussion, what do you think about Victor? He clearly knows a lot but doesn't share anything. I believe his parents were somehow involved in either building that place or something like that. What do you think?",
