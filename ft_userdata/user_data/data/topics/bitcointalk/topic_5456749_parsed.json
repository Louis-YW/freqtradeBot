  "content": "I have never discussed this on the global forum. so I don't know how people will understand it. I'm just writing to see what people think.I have been arbitraging in Korea for 3 years now. There is a special premium on the Korean exchange. It usually moves from -3 to 10% over the global price. If you enter this formula in TradingView, you can see the price premium on the Korean exchange.'upbit:btckrw/(balance:btcusd.p*fx_idc:usdkrw)*100-100'The premiums of some altcoins move even more dramatically. I profit from this difference, usually by moving money between the Korean exchanges and Binance when the market timing is in my favor. I then hedge the perpetual market to avoid the risk of price fluctuations. There are more complex techniques. In South Korea, I'm pretty sure I'm in the top 1% of people who utilize this trading technique.In 2021, I had a 334% return (everyone made a lot of money back then) and 53% return in 2022. This year, I'm already up 59%. So far, I've made a net profit of about $429,000 over three years from this trade. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there with better returns than that, but the strength of my trading method is not in the returns, but in the stability. I'm free from the risk of price fluctuations. If the price of Bitcoin drops to $1k, I'll still make money. As liquidity and volatility increase, so does the premium differential, which opens up more opportunities. SBF also left Korea around 2018 to hunt for price premiums. (It is now difficult for foreigners to operate on the Korean exchange). The only risk in this trade is that the centralized exchange goes under.Anyway, what I'm wondering is if these advantages are also attractive to non-Korean global investors. The returns are not bad, but I feel passive and foolish doing this alone in my room.  I've been doing this by myself for three years, and now I want to expand, and I'm always thinking that there are more opportunities if we collaborate globally. In a world where scammers are setting up sites and scamming investors, why can't I create an arbitrage system that makes real trades and generates consistent profits?Do you guys think I have a good chance? Or is this just an uninteresting story? I've been thinking about this a lot myself, so I'd like to see what the global forum thinks.Thanks for reading this long post.",

Arbitrage bots are super easy to make, you need 1-3 days in python even if you have zero coding skill.

You can’t buy it on the same exchange because price is higher. You need to use the other exchanges but it’s difficult getting money out of the country. It's pretty simple!You look for the opportunity to arrive, at that point you buy $50 BTC on Coinbase, you send them to Bitthumb, you sell at a 5% premium, you withdraw your money to the SK bank, then to your US bank, and then you try again.There is actually not a big difference between this and taking advantage of any other high commodity prices, traders do this with full tankers of LNG or oil when the price are better in Europe than in Asia, the same happened with the onions in Philipines.There are some problems:- you need a huge capital to make it worthwhile, you can't play with one BTC as the fees will eat all your profit.- the money flow from inside Korea takes time, a lot of time, so don't think you can do this daily, it's not SEPA.- sometimes the kImchi premium turns to a discount, you don't want to be caught in one so you might be forced to wait, sometimes even for weeks",

Well, ignoring that, and coming to your statements, i am so happy for you to make so much profit out of the crypto industry but i never thought one can benefit that much by just doing arbitrage trading, I would love to know why you think the prices of tokens are higher (premium) in Korea in comparison to other countries?I also love to know how you hedge against your profits so that you could avoid losing, Which technique do you use? And when do you get to know that the market is in your favor and now you can do arbitrage trading? And also tell me why would i trust your all statements blindly, you might be telling lies to get more paying customers so that you could sell them your strategy. Why did you not share some proof of it? I mean no disrespect but your statements do need proof to convince the global audience here, They do know how newbies came on a daily basis and make posts on to they can not hold. Just like this one.

Well i did not give a thought on checking the price difference because i trust the op on this one, i was skeptical on his profit ratio and why there is a big difference between these prices i thought arbitrage trading has small price differences but your aforementioned one has big difference. Why the korean did not prefer to buy it from Binance then (at lower rate) why would they buy it from there own local exchange (at higher rates) that what i was being asking in the first line and in the second question, i asked the op to share some proof so that people like me and other would quickly go through the price differences and it will definitely build some trust too. Overall, i am satisfied now with the knowledge of price in fact i was thinking to try the provided code tonight as i was busy too. So thank you for easiness.",

      "body": "Wow, that's a lot of different opinions, and I really appreciate your comments. As you may have noticed, I'm speaking through a translator, so it's not going to be easy to respond to each and every one of them, but I'm going to say a little bit more because there are a lot of people who are curious about this trading strategy. i don't actually send any crypto, and this is a very important point. There's a common misconception that you have to transfer when you arbitrage. You don't have to. (I say transfer in the body of the post because I didn't really want to say this, but I changed my mind because you guys are curious.) When I do this trade, I go short on Binance and buy spot on upbit, and then I just wait for the spread between the two to widen. In other words, I don't go in after the spread widens. I do the buy before the spread widens.But you can't just pick up any crypto and wait for the spread to widen, right? So I pick a crypto that's prone to price distortion. This usually happens with altcoins.  For example, the crypto I'm currently holding is 'flow'. In my experience, there is a good chance that this trade will give me at least a 1% return this week (but there are no guarantees in the world). I made a chart of FLOW's spread for you guys.https://kr.tradingview.com/chart/p60QXU2SOr, if you want to see more detailed movement, try plugging this formula directly into TradingView.(upbit:flowkrw-binance:flowusdt.p*fx_idc:usdkrw)/(binance:flowusdt.p*fx_idc:usdkrw)*100I'm holding when the spread on 'FLOW' is 2.5%, and you can see if it goes higher than that in the future. I'll probably exit the position between 3.5% and 6%, depending on the volatility at that time. There are many factors that contribute to this distortion. It could be that the crypto upgrade cut off deposits and withdrawals, it could be that the price has gone up a lot and people are going crazy, or it could be that the price has dropped so much that it's not keeping up with the price overseas. I'm trying to figure this out and do some proper arbitrage.In January, February, and March, I had fun with aptos.https://kr.tradingview.com/chart/r0EdVNMl/KAVA is a classic example of a crypto pranked by Korean whales. No matter what the price is overseas, it sometimes happens that it only makes a price in Korea.https://kr.tradingview.com/chart/f81jB9R7/Two weeks ago, METAL was doing this.https://kr.tradingview.com/chart/wqrts0jF/By the way, only Koreans can do this on upbit. Upbit doesn't accept foreigners, but since Korea doesn't have a perfect crypto policy, it's possible for Koreans to use Binance Global, so I can hunt for these arbitrage opportunities. Of course, I don't think this arbitrage will last forever. One day, when the crypto market stabilizes in terms of policy, the loophole will be closed. But before that happens, I've been thinking about whether there's something to grow. I was very curious to see how it was viewed by global traders. I guess the trust issue is the biggest barrier for me to scale it into a business. Thanks for your thoughts. oh. I have one more question: In my country, it is illegal for an individual who is not registered as an investment company to manage other people's money. I assume it is the same in your country? It seems difficult to create a legal organization and do business with crypto.Have a good day everyone.Additions to comments1) It's hard for me to provide evidence of profits. As anyone who has done arbitrage trading based on the distortion of spot prices knows, the short side records a deficit, so this side has a huge deficit, and upbit doesn't have a function to provide cumulative profit data. I can show you how much money I withdrew from upbit to my bank, but I don't need to do that in this post. It's in Korean. haha Additions to comments2) It is difficult to transfer money from a bank in South Korea to a bank in the U.S. That method is a premium hunting method used in the past. So many people used this method in the past that Korean banks, along with the government, are now strictly controlling it. This control seems to be isolating Korean exchanges and causing price distortions.I only realize profits through the spread between Binance and Upbit and increase the KRW on the exchange. It's similar to how you guys increase your USDT.",

Moreover, what amuses me is, all of this is from the altcoins trading and that's super risky asset so far in the trading. Its good that your portfolio was chosen pretty right.
