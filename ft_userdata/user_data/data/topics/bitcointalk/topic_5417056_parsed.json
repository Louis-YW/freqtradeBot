Liquidity is injected and afterwards, its a pump and dump time youll eventually needed to monitor and when to exit. Its rarely to see that a dumped price could recover many times maybe few times but in the end no tokens can survive for a long stint. So if you like to play here, better have some discipline when you earned cause if you are long term maxi then its definitely not your cup of tea.",

I remember the days when pinksale has become the most popular platforms among shit coin speculators. They were always raising money through this platform and then scammer will go away with all of money. The launch pad itself has no a proper development. This launch pad has been contributing a lot to the so many scam token that exist in the market.",

The project is abandoned right after the token sale and few listing occur because the team is dumping there tokens on the exchange which the liquidity coming from investors lock in. Much better to stick on trusted launch to make sure that you are not investing on ponzi shit tokens. You should invest on partnership to solid projecT for this kind of business.",

Up until today, I have not seen any projects launched on it that could be considered potential or successful. Check OP's profile it looks like your account is getting money to post shills for junk projects and the pink sale is your latest project just received. I recommend you research projects carefully before marketing them, to enhance your reputation on the forum.",

I am part of DuckDao and Poolz and i have to say that during the bull market it was pretty crazy. There were a lot of investment opportunities where you could invest into the priate sale of upcoming projects and in most cases those tokens did at least a x10 right at the listing. So you could have made quite some profit there. Now obviously it is much quieter in the bear market as not so many projects are launching but still i could invest into the magicsquare private sale through DuckDao, which is a great opportunity in my opinion.",
