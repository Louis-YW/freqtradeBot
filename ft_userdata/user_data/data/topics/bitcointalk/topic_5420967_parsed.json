  "content": "I am not surprise that some media now started to report crypto exchange as Ponzi and comparing it that way. This is because of the FTX crash making customers fund disappearing to $1 billion. The exact amount is still not clear because different people are giving different amount to what is lose and Â Sam Bankman-Fried saying he will write his own story about the issue but the point is he \"secretly\" transferred money to a trading company Alameda Research. This is IMO a black weekend for people in cryptocurrency because just when people start to look for investment in cryptocurrency now we have FTX top officials secretly embezzling customer money to secretly invest in trading to make personal gain. Where now is the trust? This is blackmail to crypto industry. There was ICO scam and others happened to cryptocurrency.We try to running off from Ponzi and we begin to have exchange crash not because of hack but someone trusted with customer money is taking it away secretly. . This is not good to hear. It is sad to read about it and I know you are not happy about Sam Bankman-Fried action that is putting cryptocurrency investors into economic challenge in this hard knock inflation season.Don't say you have to put your coins in your personal wallet or Dex. There you have someone you trust and breaking the trust. This is not good for cryptocurrency or what do you think about the trust broken?",

This is not good for cryptocurrency or what do you think about the trust broken?I will go with \"IT IS WHAT IT IS\".Exchanges was not the real \"idea\" behind satoshi's vision. It is actually exactly opposite what he thought and launched the blockchain. It's like Satoshi created apples for us but some thinker later created their own oranges and covered with the Apple skins. These days what you see is that skin is peeling off and reality is getting exposed. Imagine if there was only bitcoin and the only way to trade it was via sending them from one wallet to other wallet with trust factor being the mutual understanding. I think it would have been the best case scenario. May be the price would have been little but loss wouldnt have been in billions.",

This is not good for cryptocurrency or what do you think about the trust broken?I never trusted those people, so I can't say that they let me down in anything or that the trust was broken. Bitcoin was conceived as a decentralized system and everyone should use it that way, everything else is wrong and risky, which has been proven many times throughout the short history from 2009 to today.As a result of everything, it is easy to conclude that most people did not understand the essence of the existence of Bitcoin, but they understood that various shitcoins can be very profitable, especially when they are in a direct relationship with some people who position themselves as so-called crypto leaders whom people unreservedly trust. This whole industry is full of illusions of meaningfulness in false promises, which unfortunately many grasp as the last straw of salvation, but unfortunately they do not know that the foundations of this illusion are built on very shaky foundations, and that they are doomed to a complete collapse sooner or later.Unfortunately for all honorable and honest people who are in the world of cryptocurrencies, such events definitely send a very ugly and negative image to the public, who are wondering how all this is possible and why it is not regulated.",

Many people don't understand that putting money on crypto exchanges won't get any protection, bailouts, or whatever. When it's lost, it's lost... People can't ask for their money back. At the moment, just use wallets that only you have access to the keys. This situation will be improved with better regulations, but not in the near future IMO, so it's best to get used to the \"not your keys, not your coins\" thing.Btw DEX is also not secure, remember there's this rug pull thing...",

Gox, which affected investors who were into bitcoin in the early days.Â  This brand of shenanigans attracts the attention of regulators like nothing else, and I can't imagine the outcome is going to be good for any of us.",
