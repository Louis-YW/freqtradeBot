  "content": "I did start a thread titled  Some Limitations of Bitcointalk Members from Developing Countries. And some of the problems members of this great forum from developing countries face were discussed. Some contributors gave outstanding solutions to these challenges. And the solutions are summarized below.   Epileptic power supply: Unstable power supply can be tackled by seeking other sources of power such as good power banks that have a larger capacity, solar systems, or portable cheap generators. You should also ensure you buy phones with battery capacity as a priority. One can also charge phones in commercial businesses that offer phone or device charging services but you must ensure that the phone is protected. Don’t also focus on the number of posts you make. Use the limited time you have electric power to create a few quality posts instead of focusing on quantity. Two or three meaningful and quality posts a day is far better than spamming.  Poor Internet Supply: Ensure you buy 4G phones and check for the internet provider that has a strong network in your area. Using the internet when few people are using it might improve the quality of supply. Maybe late at night or early hours of the morning might be better. I have personally tried this solution and it is working perfectly. It can also be possible to pull resources together to buy satellite internet. Also seeking support from influential personalities such as Elon Musk would not be a bad idea (you will never know until you try). The community can write to him asking him to donate one of his devices for satellite internet for your community. The good news is that Starlink service would soon be available to some developing nations.High Crime Rate: Ensure you don’t use your phone in public places and always ensure that you keep it in a safe place. If possible you can get a smaller or cheaper phone that can be used to make and receive calls, while the other expensive or advanced phones that are used to access the forum can be left at home. Be cautious of your environment and if you must keep a late night, do it without your phone. It is also very important to keep a low profile and only inform trusted people about your earnings or bitcoin. Unexposed and corrupt law enforcement agencies: Create a private space in your phones and hide your wallets and other bitcoin-related applications. Ensure you don’t dress, behave, stay or hang out with internet fraudsters. It would not be a bad idea to start a bitcoin community in your locality and if possible the community can be registered and have identity cards. Public enlightenment about bitcoin would be able to expose these law enforcement agents to the operations of the bitcoin space. Although it might not be risky, report every attempt at blackmail and criminal acts, regardless of whether it comes from the police. Some law enforcement agents are trustworthy and not corrupt. The law court can also be impartial if a case of intimidation, exploitation, and abuse by law enforcement agencies is brought before it. Like in the case of  Linus Williams Ifejika, aka Blord , that floored the Nigerian anti-corruption agency in court.  Don’t sell your votes, only vote for the right candidate during elections.High Rate of Unemployment: Seek other means of income. You can get a degree or a skill that can assist you in getting a job or becoming self-employed. Joining a signature campaign might be helpful financially but the forum should not be a place for making money, it should only be something that comes as an additional thing in the process of information exchange and discussion.",

Should have one special device for cryptocurrency related things: wallets, exchanges, 2FA, etc. I would prefer to not log in my exchange account on a mobile device because I would like to allocate it for 2FA only. As a 2FA installed device, I don't want to login email, exchange accounts on that device.Device that stores 2FA should be different than the devices you usually login your email, your account.You can merge this topic to that one.

And while power generator for computer or all electronic device isn't cheap, you could spend less money on long run since you have less worry about broken electronic device due to power outage.",

Because smart phones have serious disadvantages:- You can not have a good overview with chart on smart phone then you can make wrong entries- You might more likely make mistakenly typing on smart phones than on laptops.- Laptops are more safer in security if you have Internet Security /AV softwares and use Linux. Mobile devices are very easily to hack especially Android",

If someone is an active trader, he may prefer to use phone Instead.You can get an inexpensive budget laptop for a few hundred dollars, which is even cheaper than some mid-range mobile phones. Someone who is an active trader certainly knows how to appreciate the comfort and functionality offered by a computer compared to mobile applications. As far as uninterruptible power supply goes, all laptops are DC powered. You can even use cheap car batteries and, with a cheap adapter, use them to power your laptop for a long time. You don't even need an inverter. The same applies to internet routers. For a little extra cash, you can get solar panels to charge the battery, and you'll have complete power autonomy.",

Starlink pricing on Brazil roughly about $50, while on US it could be around $100.What I know is that there is no Starlink in Africa as of July 2022. But I read on news that Starlink would be available in Nigeria by August 2022. Maybe it is now in Africa. The cost to setup Starlink kit in developed country is expensive. In US, it is around $599, but said to be four times cheaper in Africa, said to be $99 which is 6 times cheaper. Probably the subscription or service would also be very cheap.

Mobile devices are very easily to hack especially AndroidLet me put it like this for you. What is the safest wallet between electrum and hardware wallet? People are not going to think twice before choosing hardware wallet. But did you know someone that know how to use electrum for cold storage can say if you only want to use bitcoin and able to run electrum on an airgapped device, that electrum is safer, but on cold storage. I have two phones and a laptop. I use one one for exchanges, I have my wallet on laptop. Both are very secure the way I am handling them. I have another phone, also secure but the one I use most often where I have emu 2FA and if possible I want to have watch-only wallet. Laptop or computer can be very vulnerable if you do not do away with what can bring malware to your computer. Any device can be safe if you do what that would make it safe.The reason phone is more vulnerable which I agree to is because people use it most these days to browse and they carry it about and outdoor.",

And some of the problems members of this great forum from developing countries face were discussed. Some contributors gave outstanding solutions to these challenges. And the solutions are summarized below.  I am really sorry for this mistake. I think I have to lock up this thread and update the former one with the solutions to the challenges faced by bitcointalk members in developing nations.",
