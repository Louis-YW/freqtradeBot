[1]* FR: You pay taxes on the gains when selling, no need to disclose holdings earlier. [2]* NL: You pay taxes on your holdings on 1st of January. Need to disclose your holdings end of year. [3]* CH: You pay taxes on holdings, gains, or none at all depending on canton. [4]* DE: You pay taxes on the gains when selling, if you held for <1 year. No need to disclose holdings earlier. (trading BTC for a material object or other coin is considered a 'sell', gains considered income & up to 600€ in gains from all of your appreciating assets together are tax free.) [5]* AT: You pay taxes on the gains when selling, if you held for <1 year. No need to disclose holdings earlier. (trading BTC for a material object or other coin is considered a 'sell', no tax-free limit)[6]* FI: You pay taxes on the gains when selling. No need to disclose holdings earlier. (trading BTC for a material object or other coin is considered a 'sell', no tax-free limit)[7]* USA: Pretty good FAQ can be found on IRS webpage [8]",

Are you serious, JonnyDrama? Judging by the words of the media that demonize bitcoin at the whim of governments, bitcoin are only needed to buy illegal goods./sarcasm offCash conversion makes it possible to buy real estate almost anywhere in the world. With some reservation, of course. If the purchase of a house needs to be legalized, then you will have to buy a car wash like in \"Breaking bad\" in order to legalize the income. After that, with clean money, can purchase real estate legally and get an answer to OP's question.",

This is thanks to a very recent new regulation that affects the Order of Notaries.- But it does carry some additional steps. Namely:Quote•   Identify the parties involved in the business (name, profession, address)•   Reveal the price and type of cryptocurrency •   Present proof of purchase of cryptocurrencies (that is, registrations will be required from the acquisition of virtual currencies to the moment of business)•   Send information about the wallets (storage wallets)•   Indicate the date of the deedThe above data must be sent in addition to the Central Department of Investigation and Criminal Action, and to the Financial Information Unit.In addition, if the purchase exceeds a counter value of 200K €, then:Quote•   The operation must be communicated to the authorities;•   It will be necessary to compare the value of cryptocurrencies at the date of the promissory contract and their value at the date of deed.All in all, one needs to make sure that the origin of the crypto is properly and clearly justified in the eyes of the authorities …See (original source GTd into English): https://www-idealista-pt.translate.goog/news/imobiliario/habitacao/2022/05/06/52164-casa-em-braga-e-comprada-por-3-bitcoins-e-a-1a-transacao-100-cripto?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapphttps://www-idealista-pt.translate.goog/news/imobiliario/habitacao/2022/04/01/51658-comprar-casas-em-criptomoedas-ha-novas-regras-a-espreita?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapp",

(not your key not your coin)whereby that custodian(gemini/coinbase) can go into bankruptcy (MTGOX, btc-e, cryptsy, etc  example)oh and just organising a mortgage(no matter how its funded) is still a bad time with real estate costs being at a high right now.",

All both sides needs to do is turn the ownership of the house from one person to another person, whatever payment happened behind the doors may not be seen or known.This would be a shady deal of course and the house seller would be in trouble as well and there are taxes that are not paid so IRS will be an issue, but you could still do it. There are people who are buying drugs illegally and drug dealers are not paying taxes neither, so I am not sure if this is totally illegal at all, you could be charged with just avoiding taxes, all the other parts are allowed.",

Now, as pointed by another forum member here, this is not the best time to be buying anything especially real estate as the value of BTC is not going up so maybe the best thing to do is to HODL on and then just rekindle your desire once maybe BTC can be reaching its new ATH.
