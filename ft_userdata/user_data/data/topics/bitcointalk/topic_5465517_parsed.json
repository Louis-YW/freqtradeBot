It's just highly likely that the SEC is going to kick the can down the road for now and delay it further especially after Barry Silbert's GrayScale rules in favor against the SEC.But then again, while at least one is highly likely to be approved in the future, no one knows which deadline.P.S. I don't know how accurate this is as I know nothing about what the process of approving these things are.",

Because if we see only the USA as having a good or bad vibe on the market currently, I think it has become the new China for crypto.My personal thoughts have already been shared, but things are still blurry because if they really are accumulating BTC, then one thing is for sure: at some point, their ETFs will get approved, and they knew that because that's why they are accumulating.",

The good, the bad, the odds of getting approved?That ARK is either way going to get screwed.BlackRock will have its chance by October 17th, if this one gets delayed the rest will just be again trashed, if it gets a positive nod then ARK will have to wait in the shadows till November 11th despite being like what, two years earlier to this circus of delays and promises? Cathie Woods is probably at the end of her nerves with this, if Baclkrock gets in first it will completely eclipse everyone else.For 'the bad\" thing, are we still cheering for Wall Street money or do we go by the not your keys, not your coins?Depending on how you look at it it's both good and bad at the same time, the profits will be there, and the idealistic world is probably on its deathbed, after all, it's all about what you want from Bitcoin, it's a bunch of code,  you use it as you see fit or you just stop it and look for something else.Quote from: ZAINmalik75 on September 03, 2023, 06:36:45 PMBecause if we see only the USA as having a good or bad vibe on the market currently, I think it has become the new China for crypto.China was banning Bitcoin, the real deal, the SEC is deciding on IOU pieces of paper that might be backed by Bitcoin.",

Your thoughts on this? The good, the bad, the odds of getting approved?I do not think it is the first deadline as it was delayed before too. And these ETFs will still delayed at 17th October. And about getting these ETFs approved, I have solid vibe or I should say 100% vibe that these ETFs will be approved one day if not at 17th October. Because they are accumulating BTC and buying more and more btc at dips by doing DCA. Of course I have no solid way to prove that they are actually doing jt because it is an open market and anyone could make trades but if we look at the trade books then number might not show up there because we knew the reason behind it. They have direct broker and they need not to trade on exchanges.Well, another thought I have in my mind is these ETFs should not be approved for the well reputation of BTC because it will hurt the decentralization factor that BTC promotes as we know adoption of BTC' ETFs will promote centralization.  But we can not ignore a fact that approval of these ETFs will take the price of BTC to the moon in the next ATH. Many studies and analysis have been made by many news outlets which shows that approvals of these ETFs could take the value of BTC to $150,000 easily. But to be honest I think BTC could maximally reach to $110,000 because if it touches $70,000 again then the only thing that will push it towards $110,000 is the approval of ETFs.  I know another factor is interest rate but they are not going to decrease because if they will decrease that then Euro has to face many difficulties so interest rates will increase and lesser money will be in circulation and in market too.",

      "body": "The good thing about Bitcoin Spot ETFs is that they allow new players, including large companies, to enter the market. This means the entry of billions of dollars in liquidity into the thirsty crypto market. This will give a major recovery to the market.Also, the entry of large players into the Bitcoin market creates a kind of balance in the market by reducing the chances of large whales controlling and manipulating the market without competition. Having multiple big players is healthy for the market.As for the bad thing about Bitcoin Spot ETFs, they focus on profit only and do not care about adoption. This reinforces the concept of investing in Bitcoin for profit only without there being real adoption as a means of peer-to-peer payment.",

After the SEC v GBTC court decision, I think the approval is inevitable at this point, just a question of when. The sooner the better but I guess most people already expect the SEC to delay until the final deadline in 2024.The good side as everyone expects is fresh money coming to bid Bitcoin again, reviving this market that has been down only (price and volume) for almost two years Quote from: ZAINmalik75 on September 03, 2023, 06:36:45 PMWe all know ETFs are not going to be accepted anytime soon, or I am wrong about all of us because I have this idea that they will approve the ETFs after the halving of BTC because after halving a small dip comes and they might want to accumulate more BTC there too, so in that plan they will not approve the ETF.Yeah, the close timing between spot ETF approval and halving would be a monumental catalyst.

Instead, they are fake ones. But the point is, that's not why BTC was made—people would fork over fake coins using the BTC technology to earn people's trust.

I agree with you, but this is more about full ownership, full control, and full verifiability. This might not really be about decentralization. To a mere Bitcoin investor, decentralization might not matter that much. What matters is that he/she has real Bitcoin and that when the price of Bitcoin soars, he/she makes money.The problem comes when various financial instruments are created by these traditional financial players out of Bitcoin. The market will now be inundated with fake numbers, debts, IOUs, certificates, or whatever they are called. There might be an influx of money but much lesser growth in the demand of actual coins.Look at these centralized exchanges and other Bitcoin-related platforms that we have right now. Hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of BTC are being traded, lent, staked hour by hour, day by day. However, do they have the same number of Bitcoin in their wallets? No!",
