Did you also sell some of that holding of yours during the bull run? Well, if it's about those folks that have got in late, they've probably sold too when they're in profit but for sure, there are those that have waited for a possible higher price and didn't expected that it was the end of the run.",

But still down less then had you invested in many things in the stock market.Between those 2 times you could have lost 1/2 your investment.But you would be in about the same position if you bought TSLA at it's 52 week high and much better off then if you bought DWAC at it's 52 week high.-Dave",

Well im doing dca somehow and still end up being down and hoping that it can be recover in the coming months when the bull run started to show some sign. For now we can really feel how bad is the market is but dont lose hope, most of the coins and tokens are eventually going up when btc started to show some green movement.",

If you can handle your investments well despite of the unpredictable market conditions, then there's no reason to stay in red. Although losses are inevitable in crypto, but you can also maximize your profits if you do invest with caution, and of course investing in potential coins like bitcoin.",
