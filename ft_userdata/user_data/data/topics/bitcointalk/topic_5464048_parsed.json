Creating such shit topic on this board doesn't make any thing relevant for newbies. Stop focusing on any wallet and start working on having such a wallet.",

It is pointless to add some cents or a few dollars worth of Bitcoin to it. It is even ranked among the richest Bitcoin address. These small deposits are either dusts or deposits done by some random people.",

I don't have much idea about when mtgox was hacked or what but here I got a chat history which was right after the deposit and they claim mtgox was hacked and `~80k BTC was stolen. The screenshot says it was from March 03, 2011. Don't know who is who lol. The tweet says Craig Wright claims to own the address lol but he doesn't have the private key.
