      "body": "@Bitcoin Smith has provided a great link to curated list of Bitcoin Books in general. Having read several books about economics & Bitcoin in general, I think I may be able to provide some insights on this.Understanding economics & theory of money is far more important than understanding Bitcoin in general. If we cannot understand basic terminologies of economics, we can never understand why Bitcoin was created and on top of that we can never speak out in the public by supporting it and explaining to the masses how it can replace the existing government backed fiat currencies.Economics :Economics on a more general perspective serves many people on this planet. Some may be investors who invests or trades in stocks, precious metals, crypto or foreign currencies. Some may be entrepreneurs who handle millions or probably billions to scale their companies faster than their competitor. Some may be getting paid daily or monthly and willing to meet their day to day needs. Economics or the role of money differs from person to person and you need to identify yourself where you stand among them to proceed further in educating yourself.- The all time famous \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" might be an excellent starting point to understand the basics of economics or how money works on a more grander scale.- But if you want to be an entrepreneur, you need to understand how money changes its role from companies to companies. To understand more about this, you need to read either \"Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill\" or 1st half of \"Almanack of Naval Ravikant\"- If you want to be an investor, \"The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham\" is a great starting point. There goes a saying : If you wanna build new ideas, then search for the same in old books.- Once you got a good grasp on these subjects, read \"The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine\" before entering into Bitcoin. You should definitely understand how the United States Housing Bubble triggered the 2008 financial crisis. Only if you understand the 2008 financial crisis, you will know why Bitcoin was created in first place. If not, you will just roam around like other clueless people and never understand how or why Bitcoin came into existence.Bitcoin / Crypto :Bitcoin was the culmination of multi-year old research works in computer science to build the decentralized digital currency. satoshi alone never created Bitcoin out of nowhere.- If you want to be a Bitcoin Historian, start with \"Digital Gold by Nathaniel Popper\". The book starts from early days of how Hal Finney was contacted by satoshi and how did he start mining Bitcoin in his personal computer.Once done, move onto \"Bitcoin Billionaires by Ben Mezrich\". Excellent book about early days of Gemini Exchange and you can related to multiple early startup failures in the Bitcoin space.Finally, end with \"The Blocksize War by Jonathan Bier\". Another great book about Blocksize drama and creation of BCH shitcoin.- If you want to be a Bitcoin Developer, start with \"Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos\". All time great book which never needs an introduction.Continue reading \"Programming Bitcoin by Jimmy Song\". Another one to the shelf if you are a python guy.- If you want a general overview of Bitcoin, you should definitely read \"The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous\"Note : These alone would never suffice the thirst nor will get you ahead of others. You need to be an active X (Twitter) user and read a lot of threads to understand what is going each and every day in crypto world.P.S If you want to be a web3 developer (crypto developer) / Blockchain Analyst, let us know so that I can recommend a few good books for the same",
