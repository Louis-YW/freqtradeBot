  "content": "Hi folks,Please check out our new software wallet https://www.securebtcwallet.comWith only three HTTPS calls (one to check balance, another to check the network fees, and the final one to submit *signed* transactions), no personally identifiable information is ever submitted, and it is designed to be very secure and easy-to-use. In a sense, it is similar to hardware wallets. Like Electrum but without the whistles and bells.We know Trezor and Ledger are safer options and we recommend people to use them. But this one is free and I think it's best if one diversifies their crypto holding on multiple wallets, so if one gets hacked, you have the other ones available.Please check it out and let me know what you think. Your feedback will be appreciated. Cheers,Below you can find our press release:SecureBTCWallet launches to protect Bitcoin owners from custodial risksFollowing the FTX scandal, Bitcoiners have been running away from well-known exchanges like Binance and Coinbase in leaps and bounds. Non-custodial solutions like SecureBTCWallet provide a safe shelter.Nov. 15, 2022 -- SecureBTCWallet (https://www.securebtcwallet.com) is a secure non-custodial Bitcoin wallet that lets you store, send and receive your digital assets safely, available on Linux, MacOS and Windows computers.The security of SecureBTCWallets comes from its simple architecture that relies on a well-known Bitcoin standard, BIP-39. With BIP-39, one can create a unique wallet with 24 keywords. Plus, SecureBTCWallet is designed to minimize its users network exposure. The app is offline in all its critical functions, and makes three HTTPS calls only, to check the user's balance, fetch the latest network fees, and submit the signed & encrypted transaction to the Bitcoin network.The best way to ensure security is to hold on to your Bitcoins, and not give it to some third party exchange, the app creators suggest. As a best practice, the users would have to choose a cold-wallet such as a hardware wallet that they would need to pay for, or use a desktop based software like SecureBTCWallet. While software cold-wallets are available on both mobile and desktop, mobile wallets are known to be prone to misuse, because they're too accessible. Thus, the desktop is the only viable option if the user is not willing to pay for a hardware wallet.That said, one can increase the security of their funds by splitting them in multiple wallets. \"We do not recommend our users to put all their Bitcoins on SecureBTCWalllet. The user will be safer if they divide their Bitcoins into multiple wallets because no matter how secure the Bitcoin architecture is, one may steal your seed phrase and access your funds. So choose your seed phrase wisely, and¬† do not put all your eggs in a single basket\" says the founder of the company that goes by the pseudonym Satoshi.SecureBTCWallet does not require PII (Personally Identifiable Information) to open an account. One can open an account without entering any personal information such as their name, email address or credit card info. Also, SecureBTCWallet is intentionally kept limited in functionality, to establish a smaller and safer choice. For example, the software does not provide any exchange functionality, so you can't buy or sell Bitcoins, but you can accept payments, move assets from existing exchanges, or transfer to other wallets. \"For maximum safety and anonymity, we recommend our users to use localbitcoins to buy & sell Bitcoins\" states the company.For more information and to download, please check out https://www.securebtcwallet.comOriginal Link to the release: https://www.prlog.org/12940369-securebtcwallet-launches-to-protect-bitcoin-owners-from-custodial-risks.htmlüôè",

Just asking to end up with malware on your device.In regards to securitys risks, if anything, do not hold your Bitcoins in exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, OKX, or Gemini. Exchanges are good for buying & selling Bitcoins conveniently. While you have more anonymous alternatives like localbitcoins.com, exchanges are far more easier to use. So yes, they‚Äôre preferable. You may also use them to keep some small quantity of Bitcoins readily available for purchasing goods, withdrawing or sending. But that‚Äôs about it.If you‚Äôre hodling, or if some portion of your life savings are in Bitcoin, then keep them out of exchanges. SecureBTCwallet.com is not the only option there, you have ample alternatives, and I recommend you to look at them. Including Wasabi which I saw just below this thread on this very forum.But ideally, spare 80 Euros to store your crypto in hardware wallets. Trezor and Ledger are good examples. Then store in cold wallets like Electrum.org and SecureBTCWallet.com too. This is one step below hardware in security, but it‚Äôs definitely more convenient, and free to use.More importantly, don‚Äôt put all your eggs in a single basket. So let‚Äôs say you own 4 BTC.Keep 0.5 BTC in CoinbaseKeep 0.5 BTC in BinanceKeep 1 BTC in a Trezor walletKeep 1 BTC in a Ledger walletKeep 0.5 BTC in an Electrum walletKeep 0.5 BTC in a SecureBTCWalletAs for mobile wallets‚Ä¶ Call me paranoid, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them because you always have them in your pockets, anyone can steal them or you may lose them. And mobile phones are 24/7¬† connected to the internet.Most importantly, never ever put all your Bitcoins on a single wallet! Always use 24-letter BIP39 seeds (do not rely on proprietary seed protocols, like Electrum‚Äôs) ‚Äî preferably pick it yourself instead of having the software generate it for you, because the software may be compromised. Also, at least for the wallets where you store most of your Bitcoins, write down the seed phrase on a metal plate like Blockplate.com.Last but not least, stay away from shitcoins or tokens. Bitcoin is your safest bet in the crypto world.",

Paper wallets exist for truly cold solutions, Airgapped systems can be set up for those that want it, Electrum can be used as either a hot or cold client, or a Live OS can be used over DVD or USB.¬† ¬† Quote from: securebtcwallet on November 15, 2022, 11:27:22 PMExchanges are good for buying & selling Bitcoins conveniently. You may also use them to keep some small quantity of Bitcoins readily available for purchasing goods, withdrawing or sending. There is no benefit in using exchanges in order to purchase goods or sending crypto to another person when you can do all of that from your own private wallet. And you don't need to worry that your coins could be frozen, you could be asked for KYC or source of funds, or be treated like a criminal because your bitcoin has been \"tainted\" due to its history with gambling platforms or services that particular exchange doesn't like. Some CEXs like Binance provide P2P trading, which is free. That's a plus, but considering how cheap it is to transact with bitcoin, it's not worth risking your coins and having Binance hold on to them.¬† Quote from: securebtcwallet on November 15, 2022, 11:27:22 PMKeep 0.5 BTC in CoinbaseKeep 0.5 BTC in BinanceKeep 1 BTC in a Trezor walletKeep 1 BTC in a Ledger walletKeep 0.5 BTC in an Electrum walletKeep 0.5 BTC in a SecureBTCWallet First you speak out against keeping coins on exchanges and then you suggest holding 1/4 of your bitcoin on centralized exchanges. It can't be both. Unless you are a day-trader who is aware of the risks of using CEXs, no one else should be storing their coins there and using an exchange as a wallet. They are not wallets. They are places you go to if you want to purchase or sell digital assets.",

(And also appears to have registered a second newbie account to \"vouch\" for himself.) Sorry, but that's a scam in my books until proven otherwise.Quote from: securebtcwallet on November 15, 2022, 11:27:22 PM(do not rely on proprietary seed protocols, like Electrum‚Äôs)Electrum's seed system is not proprietary. It is free and open source. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using Electrum seed phrases, and indeed, their system has some advantages over BIP39 seed phrases.Quote from: securebtcwallet on November 15, 2022, 11:27:22 PMpreferably pick it yourself instead of having the software generate it for you, because the software may be compromised.This is awful advice. Manually picking a seed phrase is a recipe for disaster. Instead, use open source software (such as Bitcoin Core or Electrum) which you can personally verify to be securely generating entropy.",
