      "body": "When people say that transactions is \"confirmed\", it means that it got included into block. Only miners who mine a block decide which transactions go there. But confirming shouldn't be confused with validating. Validating means checking that transaction doesn't break any rules. Like trying to spend the coins without knowing the private key. Or spending coins that were already spent. Spending incorrect amount. And so on.Validation is done by everyone. If you are using any wallet, it validates the transactions that involve your addresses. But full nodes also help to spread new transactions and new block to each other. Together these full nodes + mining nodes are the Bitcoin network. The full nodes that don't mine are not getting any rewards.",

Is it necessary for the transaction to be confirmed by a miner?Full nodes check various aspects of a transaction, including its structure, signatures but it doesn't have to ability or control to pick the transaction to be included in a block. So running the full node will help you with the validation process quickly and broadcast the transaction to mempool which means they will be in the unconfirmed status.Whereas miners are the one which involves in the selection of all the transactions from the mempool and include them in block they mine. They are incentivized to include a transaction with higher gas fee to earn those as reward for mining a block.",

Is it necessary for the transaction to be confirmed by a miner?It seems you are comparing both Bitcoin and Ethereum since you mention gas fees.In ETH you can stake to become a validator and earn rewards while in Bitcoin full node even if you don't stake it can validate transactions but it can't confirm a transaction without a miner. Only miners who can solve blocks and get rewarded but only pool operators can choose what transactions they are going to include on the block they mine.Once a block solve where your transaction is included a full node will validate it if they follow the consensus rules and then include it in the blockchain.",

As you can see, only miners confirms transactions that will be added to a block but if you want your transaction to get confirmed right away is to use CPFP method or use RBF if you are using a wallet that supports RBF. If you want to confirm a transaction then you should start mining if you have a mining gear but If not then you can only wait for the transactions to be confirmed by a miner.",
