      "body": "Quote from: SeeBiscuit on April 16, 2024, 11:58:57 PM\"No, it's a p2p digital currency.\".Yes, but from a technical standpoint bitcoin displays traits associated with social networking. It's definitely not a easy-to-use social network (for most people), that's for sure. The only difference is, any identifying features of the user are usually replaced with random strings of numbers and letters.-connection between two users-communication between two users-sharing of information between two users-forming of relationships between two usersOn the other hand, definitions of social media usually describe a service that enables the ability for a user to create and share content, or to participate in the act of social networking.From what I understand, bitcoin doesn't support or really have a use for user generated content sharing and uploading. It's currency after all, not Instagram.  But it's currency that let's you talk to another person with the only requirement being they are using the same software._____________________________________________________________Of the three options, I think bitcoin is a social network.What do you think?It can't be a social network, you can't connect through Bitcoin, only use it as a currency or an asset. Or a social network, all that stuff is built around BTC, like this forum, but you can't call BTC that.",

And while Bitcoin has a community, being able to communicate over the Bitcoin blockchain as a side-effect of monetary transactions does not really make a social network either. You may be able to derive certain social relationships by analyzing transaction flows, but Bitcoin as a protocol itself does not facilitate social networking.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is a digital financial system, designed for individuals to manage their money privately. According to the research I did, \"Social networking is more like using internet-based social media sites to stay connected with friends, family, colleagues, or customers.\" We don't use Bitcoin as a tool of social networking but as a means of p2p payment or investment. While on the social space, you can use Bitcoin to make payment depending if you are in negotiation with a customer for an exchange of goods or a service. Take for example, some years ago,   Laszlo Hanyecz posters that he needs to buy pizza with 10,000 Bitcoin and Jeremy Sturdivant picked the order and delivered 2 papa John's pizza to Hanyecz, that's was a social network but payment was made in Bitcoin.",

Or is it a waste of time?I'm not quite sure what benefit you're expecting from communication via the Bitcoin blockchain. The way I see it we have enough problems with bloat as is, as such using the Bitcoin blockchain for storing communication data beyond transactional information seems rather wasteful.Thing is, \"the only requirement being they are using the same software\" isn't quite true. There's another requirement, and that is having the money to send a transaction (or a message, as would be the case).I might not quite understand what line of thinking you are going for though.",

I really appreciate your thoughts. My position in opening this topic is that it is not appropriate, in my opinion to compare Bitcoin to a social network or media. Yes, it is absolutely right that both Bitcoin and Sociak networks have the same characteristics like In these networks, two people are connected to each other and communicate with each other but the concept of Bitcoin is slightly different because of the Blockchain. Bitcoin adopts an anonymous track, no one has to do KYC identification, and the two suspects are not known, like who they are, where they are from, etc. While on a social network or social media, each other is known, no one works under an anonymous title, there all users can be tracked, including who they are, where they are from, etc. And this is what makes Bitcoin the most prominent show in the world of finance.",

The title said if bitcoin is a social network or social media and my answer will be neither of it. The reason why is because bitcoin is a type of currency that people can manage and also we cannot use blockchain to communicate with others that's why we need a social platform or a forum for example so that people can interact or send messages to each other for transactions or an exchange for example. If bitcoin is really a social media then we could have use it to post or whatever it is like facebook and more. If bitcoin is social network then it wouldn't be used as a payment and Satoshi Nakamoto wrote it in the Bitcoin whitepaper that it is Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.",

However, when tx's are broadcasted, nodes validate these tx's and communicate it to other nodes who check if it meets the networks rules and they validate it too, the same with blocks, when a miner confirms a block, nodes validate these blocks and communicate it to one another, before adding it to the boockchain. Now, if this is the kind of communication you are talking about, then i agree, but surely it has nothing to do with social media or social networking.",

And Bitcoin has none of those properties. Users are not connecting to each other, their nodes do and they do it passively and it all abstracted away from most users, and almost all Bitcoiners don't look to which nodes their node is connected, because it happens automatically.Bitcoin is a network, but users don't do any networking,g they simply send funds from A to B, and the software handles all the network routing for them.",
