Looking forward to your reply Kind Regards Avril Shackleton avril.shackleton@avetnus.ioDo you mean this topic https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1955231.0? It was already locked and the only thing you can do right now if you don’t have the control to that account is to create a new Announcement thread for the same project since the old one is already locked. There’s no way an admin will help you to access an account without any proof. Only sign message use by that Bitcointalk account is the only way to prove ownership here. It’s unusual for your company to not get the Bitcointalk account credentials to your employee that creates the account though.",

There is nevertheless a subsequent thread still open in its respective Ann section. The user is not banned, so he could come back to the account at any time if he wishes to.",

If the employee is no longer with your company you have not taken the account access from him? Have you tried contacting anyone on the forum before through PM as you said trying to contact someone from here?So the best way is to make the new announcement thread only as you have no option to have that account back and this is forum safety rule like assume it you have to prove ownership of the account you want back.",

This extension was one of the original domains established in 1985, and is therefore perceived as stronger and more credible than newer alternatives.Looking at that the above quote, you can agree with me that the forum has got far enough attributes to fit in the classifications given as an organization according to this findings. Bitcointalk remains a non-profit organization but individuals and firms alike could run profit oriented activities on it. Good one bitcointalk.

The forum can't help you hack into someone else's user because you had contracts with the user.",
