  "content": "The Kroco is a crypto meme project that develops a marketplace for non-fungible tokens. So, soon, users could create and trade their own NFTs. Also, the developers strive to make people successful in cryptocurrency. Therefore, the team created a $Kroc meme coin to bring crypto adoption to the mainstream. Kroc is a BEP20 (BSC) token with 8% taxation. So, the contract deducts eight percent from each transaction. As a result, 4% goes for marketing purposes. Another 2% goes to the liquidity pool on PancakeSwap DEX. The rest, 2%, goes to the existing token-holders. Besides, the developers have locked Liquidity (LP) until 2027. Furthermore, the management has already burnt 10% of the total coin supply. And regular burning events are coming.Token name: KrocoToken’s symbol: KROCToken’s contract address: https://www.bscscan.com/token/0x46944A120eb088b994F650d87944436d14b6a0B4Project’s website URL: https://www.krocotoken.comName(s) of Exchanges where a token listed: Tokpie https://tokpie.com/view_exchange/KROC-USDT/Link to WP: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16kd2VeMJYaOX9iN-CHNlssQDMxc3AQEC/view?usp=drivesdkBrief description: Kroc is a BEP20 (BSC) token with 8% taxation.
