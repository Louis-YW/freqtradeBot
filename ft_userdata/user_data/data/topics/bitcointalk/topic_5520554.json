Nothing... Bitcoin wasn't exactly the first try at digital cash, but it was the first one i consider to be successful. Because it was the first successful one, it has the most miners, the most users and the highest market cap.It's because of the POW algo and the vast amount of miners that bitcoin is secure, because of the widest adaptation the market cap is the  highest.But different from altcoins? Nothing, i guess? Even the first altcoin (litecoin) is just a slightly changed clone of bitcoin. It has a shorter average time between blocks, and they created a different POW algo, but the rest is *allmost* a carbon copy.There are tons of other altcoins out there that are *allmost* carbon copy's aswell, so i guess there is nothing really different between bitcoin and these alts, except the sheer amount of miners and users.",

I don’t think Bitcoin “stands out from others”. Why would you have to stand out when you are the ORIGINAL and the one that everyone tries to copy?Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency and is the most successful one. It has the highest marketcap and is the one most commonly traded even until now. Launched in 2009 but ever since then its value kept rising despite volatility and price fluctuations.If anything other altcoins should be the one trying to make themselves stand out from the hundred altcoins out there and step out of the shadow of bitcoin.",

Bitcoin has been the only consistent coin that even when its price drops, you are not scared that some big whales are going to crash it and it will be the end of the project. You can rest assured that the price will increase. This is what we are currently seeing. Some months ago the price tanked to $15,000 and here we are at over $90,000. My other perspective on why I think that bitcoin stands out from the other coins is that everyone can see that it is the coin that is drawing the most attention from everyone. Governements are interested in it, financial institutions are constantly talking about it, and entrepreneurs can't wait to hold a lot of it in their wallets. Private citizens are doing dollar cost avarage to hold more because of its potential. The handwriting on the wall about bitcoin is obvious. For all of these, we cannot say about the other coins.",

I hope it’s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we’re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.And later attempts are not as large as Bitcoin.The key thing here is that Bitcoin is now very resilient. It was almost a miracle that Bitcoin actually was able to exist. It was very fragile in the first few years, but now it has the power of so many miners, that it's practically impossible to attack it successfully.Any other altcoin will basically have to start from zero, and they would be too fragile to exist in this environment, whereas Bitcoin will continue generating blocks every roughly 10 minutes on average.",

But bitcoin still stand out from other coins because it was the first coin to be listed. It has the highest number of investors and it is limited in supply and has the highest market cap compeard to others. Bitcoin is the only coin that expirenced halving every circle. It experience bear and bull run season while others follow suit. Infactnit bitcoin is more reliable, trusted in terms of security of investment than other altcoins.
