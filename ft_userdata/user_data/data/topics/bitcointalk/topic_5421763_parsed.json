The rarity and demand of the low denom Silver Cas's are driving high premiums.For people that are looking to buy, the Silver .5 I think you would expect to pay 2x load. For the Silver .1 tenths 3x load or even higher. I know those prices may seem high to some, but that is the average ask for my sellers I have communicated with. I have seen Silver .1 tenths up to 5x load on ask price.  At around 900 made for the .5's and around 800 made for the .1's, the demand continues to grow for these rare pieces.",
