  "content": "Honestly I'm still trying to wrap my head around the amount of money that scammers are making each year from cryptoscams in all their nature. So I was thinking if bitcoin ETF could help reduce that percentage even if by only a bit this year, so I want to hear everyone thoughts on this.  But first I'll like to bring to the table that scam only prevail where there is ignorance or lack of knowledge and most times greed, it takes advantage of people that have heard the interesting testimonials about bitcoin but don't know about how to Start, so they end up falling for anyone that brings them a solution. And I think at least 15% of crypto scams are categoried under Investment scams and social media scams which may have same procedures or patterns. If you have ever been targeted or attacked before by a scammer before you would know that they always tend to bring a solution to your ignorance and give you an outrageous offer which is also part of their strategy.If I'm not mistaken ETF serves as a vehicle for people that doesn't want to go through the extra of learning how to invest or trade in bitcoin themselves and would rather rely on trusted firms or exchanges to do it for them. And I think a little percentage of scammed individuals fall under this category, and if they had trusted companies earlier, that they could rely on would not have fallen for scammers. While this might be true I'm also thinking that it could worsen the case of crypto scams because more investors would now have trust in bitcoin, even the regular small business native woman at my neighbourhood who doesn't have much idea about bitcoin who just heard the news that bitcoin ETF has been approved by the sec, would at the end of the day become prey for another scammer cause it all boils down to the fact that she doesn't have any knowledge about bitcoin or how it works.What do you think about this would it help out or worsen the case, or do you think it would have no effect on the current crypto scam rate?",

Of course someone with scamming mentality can take advantage of the situation and tries his/her best to scam the ones who are about to start investing in Bitcoin. Those people aren't aware of ETFs a lot and that's why they will try to know about Bitcoin directly instead of searching for the ETFs and if someone with scamming mentality somehow finds such people then he/she will surely take advantage of them.But, most of the crypto scams are only taking place because people aren't aware about such scams. They can only be safe from such scams if someone educate them about those scams and promote awareness related to such scams. The ones who might join this forum in search of Bitcoin investment will surely be safe from those scams but the ones who may ask someone's help in purchasing of Bitcoin could be targeted by the scammers.Bitcoin ETFs can of course be purchased from the legit trading platforms and this the amount of scamming with those will be low as compare to other crypto related scams.",

So when your talking about protecting, I bet you there are still many ignorant people that doesn't even know the basics, talk less of protecting themselves and with the news of BITCOIN ETF APPROVAL a lot of them would gain interest in investing and might end up as pray for scammers cause the awareness of bitcoin as approved by the sec would even help further their ignorance with making haste decisions.You replied as tho I was referring to people with knowledge about bitcoin, forgetting the majority that knows nothing",

      "body": "This is probably one of the effects of a Bitcoin spot ETF. The good thing about it is that it is now being widely offered by the usual financial brokers and platforms. The players are the known, trusted, and old players in the financial world. They have been the figures in the financial sector for many years. So people have the option to gain exposure to Bitcoin through them. This is much better and safer than when they sign up through unknown and even unregistered exclusive crypto platforms.",

Or they do self custody and end up losing their seed somehow. Etfs are a great way to expose yourself to crypto without worrying about all the technical stuff you need to learn ahead of time to make sure you don’t lose your crypto.

If you haven't found that then you should give it a try. That article explains in detail that how to purchase Bitcoin from centralized and decentralized exchanges and also gives insights about storing of Bitcoin. I know that you can get the best information on this forum but there are some more reliable sites that you can use to gain some information like Investopedia. I know that those sites aren't fully trusted for the reason that they promote the sites that pay them for promotion but for basic understanding those sites will also work for you.",

ETFs or even if we have hundreds of other regulations on cryptocurrencies, they cannot prevent scam in the market. As long as people cannot control their greed and still want to make money quickly, scam projects will always exist in many different forms. Furthermore, the ETF only applies to bitcoin and not the entire crypto market. Therefore, approval of bitcoin ETFs will not help reduce the rate of fraud in the market. And as I said, if fraud does not decrease and continues to increase, it is due to human greed and not the fault of bitcoin ETF approval.",

      "body": "Basically, Bitcoin ETF provides both positive and negative sides. The positive side is that it gives people confidence to invest or trade Bitcoin. The downside is that it provides a new way for scammers to deceive people who have no knowledge or are too lazy to learn more. When people hear about the benefits that other people are getting, it creates curiosity in them, and they will immediately follow it without studying and finding out more.That's what makes people deceived again by the same methods they have been using all this time. They don't want to learn what it is before they start so scammers can exploit this loophole to scam them. Scam cases will still exist, but if people are willing to learn before they use or join, they can prevent them from being scammed. By learning that, we have the knowledge to start so that we can avoid offers that we don't know about and that have the possibility of being scams.",

Scams will still be here, no matter what. One good reason why is that some people want the new kids on the block, not Bitcoin, they want the x100 gains and that is impossible with Bitcoin, this is only possible in alternative coins and that's why alts space is the den of scammers in this crypto haven.ETFs can't stop scam rate unless all crypto projects are going ETF and this is impossible, maybe few will, but many people will still invest in projects that are not ETF approved, before ETFs approvals, this has always been the way, nothing will change it.",

Do you use a bank account, do you use fiat currency for your life?.. If you are using those things but denigrating them then you are a liar. Instead, we should use the word \"risk\" which would be appropriate for the examples you mentioned. As a bitcoin investor, we don't need to talk bad about non-bitcoin things because that doesn't make bitcoin any better in people's eyes, we don't need to be so biased.In addition, if you are not greedy and know how to control your greed, no one can scam you.
