  "content": "Hello, I would like to say about the casino OWL.GAMES, so OWL.GAMESignores and does not pay out money, such support I have not seen anywhere!Yesterday I requested a withdrawal of about ~750$, After a while I see that they asked for \"KYC\". Okay. They have KYC verification through sumsub. I uploaded all the documents. But \"Proof of residence\" I uploaded 5 times, because in the documents they think that something is wrong, here the letter is wrong, here something else. I'm so tired. I'm thinking about what other document I can upload.I had a bank statement. They didn't like it.A utility bill. They didn't like it.I'm sitting there thinking... and then this window pops up:\"You have exceeded the number of times to upload your documents. If you have any questions, please contact the company where you try to verify your profile.\"And there are no more buttons. NOTHING!...... Oh... What's ready?You can only contact support if you have an account. Nothing can be done from that account at all, I created a new account and am writing to them.I wrote to OWL.GAMES support about what to do, how to send the documents again. To what I received such answers that I'm still in shock, how can you treat players like this, they just do not care. I will attach screenshots.In support on the site just write complete nonsense and go away for 3 hours, then come back to say: thank you for your patience, lolIn discord created a ticket, waited a few hours, the same answers ...In telegram they decided to just BAN me! FOR ASKING WHY I DON'T GET WITHDRAWALS...AND WHERE IS YOUR SUPPORT. This is already scam means, and I write here for nothing? Or is it a lecynized casino? In the end, 30 minutes ago they wrote to me on the site: Hello players,How may I help you?LOL........I posted a review on trustpilot, and this is what they told me:Reply from OWL GAMES5 hours agoDear Player,1. according to our Terms and Conditions, we do not accept Russian Players to our sports book.2. Our Sportsbook provider notified us you are a high risk value bettor.3. We use Sumsub as our KYC provider, they are one of the biggest KYC providers. We do not handle KYC by ourselves. According to the logs they banned you from upload documents because of multiple uploads of fake docs.Good luck.You know what's interesting? I've never bet on sports in my life...I've only played in casinos ...All the documents I uploaded are real!!! The only time I blinked was when I uploaded the wrong picture. THAT'S IT. I. wrote them that I can do a video interview if they doubt the fakery or something. Once again: I am ready to pass KYC by video interview!I guess that means I haven't faked anything? LOL, why are they even answering? And the support is still silent, while they replied to Trustpilot just instantly.... Well, if the problem is not solved and they do not return the funds, I will have to inform the major Influencers that Owl.games is a thief. And start a Twitter campaign, for which I will not spare some of my funds so that people know the truth, I ask your forum to mark them as a SCAM. If you need proof, I am ready to contact you on any messenger and show everything, thank you.I want people to know I can provide you with all the screenshots of their \"support\" ,all screenshots discord \"support\" ,all screenshots telegram \"support\" which is 24/7 haha \"help.\"It's about owl.games. They had a similar situation here, like stealing funds. They stole $750 in SOL from me.Is there an ambassador or people who play there?",

I will say you should be a bit patient, thought I didn't care to go through all what you have explained here but was just few of your line I used in replying you because I know such cases often much here.",

      "body": "Owl have exit the forum for a while now , and before their exit, they made a clear public statement so that all their clients from bitcointalk can channel their complaints to the support at all time, so for that creating this thread may not help you in particular,  although this thread may help newcomer from making the same mistake that you made or to avoid the owl project entirely. But secondly you have some faults from your end and at that we may say a large portion of the blame you may have to accept in this case if you are from a restricted country, just as mentioned in the terms of service of the casino, then you are violating their laws, because just as mentioned they're stated that from your KYC log, you presented fake documents several time which is why your account got blocked, it may be that the document in your own end I be right but since you may be from a restricted country but may have bypassed that restriction through the use of VPN it will become a problem when you want to go through with your kyc just like in this case currently.",

Maybe you could relate your concerns there as well as, create a more formal complaint on the scam and reputation board with follow ups in screenshots. Mind you, no need to have your KYC documents uploaded here, just the screenshots of your conversation with Owl.games.Apparently, your screenshot uploads might not be displayed due to rank restrictions but, am sure some user here might just quote your thread to ensure the detail is properly displayed.Owl.games have managed to resolve some of the earlier complaints on them through the forum and if you’ve got a good go at yours, you just might find a resolution to your issues with the casino.Don’t go rushing out with a campaign on them yet when your yet to exhaust all options.",

Otherwise, it will be too late for them and then we will see this kind of scam accusations.So I guess for everyone, specially newbies wanted to try new casinos, they better have to research it first as there could be multiple scams that haven't been settled yet or they are blatantly scamming everyone and lost all the reputation from this community.",

The irony on their ToS was they are claiming that they are a web3 casino which means user doesn’t need to create an account but rather just connect their web3 wallet to have an account instantly. Their ToS is confusing since they make the registration in web3 format which means they are giving the freedom for user to instantly create an account using their wallet address only.One thing I don’t understand about multiple account restriction is why they need to do that if there’s no bonus abused involved. People keeps changing wallet address for their investment and it’s the benefit of having a web3 platform.",

Based on the screenshot, he has passed some steps of the KYC verification successfully including the selfie verification. A person is required to blink his/her eyes during selfie verification process. I guess the 'wrong picture' and 'blinked' is related to the selfie verification.",
