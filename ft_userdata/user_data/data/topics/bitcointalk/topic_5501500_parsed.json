      "body": "You \"figured out\" 2 private keys? Supposing what you're saying is true, that's interesting. Can you please provide more information as to this figuring out? There probably are three possibilities: 1. You stole them, 2. You accidentally found them, 3. You generated them from their addresses. Since the third is virtually impossible, it's only between 1 & 2. You might want to tell us more.Regardless, however, the funds aren't yours. Therefore, you have no right to spend them. As to whether you'll be caught and your identity known, it has yet to be known. It depends on the investigators, but have you been strictly private in all your dealings in the past? Are you confident you can hide like Satoshi Nakamoto?",

And you want to know that will you be reported to police, get arrested if the real owners of two wallets know that their bitcoin is stolen by you.Your information is strange as figuring out private keys of other bitcoin owners is impossible, if you don't hack their computers and get access to their wallets.",

If you have a mortgage and you can't make the payment or you will lose your house, then yes sell your Bitcoin.If you have a debt with a loan shark because you gambled away some money, then yes sell your Bitcoin.However, you should consider exhausting all other options first. Is there any property or assets you have at home you don't need anymore, can you sell that?",

I think the reason is your addiction to gambling. You need money to compensate for your losses in gambling, and instead of letting gambling go towards illegal actions, I advise you to quit gambling before you find yourself in prison.It seems that you have great skills, why don't you use them in useful things through which you can get money instead of getting it illegally?",

Remember its not yours so better leave it there. If you decide to take it then you are similar to thief since you take the money which is not yours. If you have financial problems better work for it and don't get someone's belonging just to solve your problem since that's not really ideal thing or option to do. But since you said that you already taken out that bitcoin then I guess that determine what type of person you are. So hopefully no one here will follow what you do.",

Knows no law.You caused your problem by yourself and you think you can solve your problem by causing more problems for others and the society at large. If you lost your money through trading and gambling, it is your fault because nobody is forced to engage in it. Now you want to steal from others to cover your losses. Regardless of how much you get, if you don't handle your unhealthy gambling behavior, you will go deeper into debt. You should handle your gambling addiction and focus on your programming skills. There is no excuse for stealing people's funds. Some people are in the same condition as you but they are seeking other legal means to become financially stable. Finally, you will soon be caught and convicted for stealing. Maybe you might not have access to this forum because you might be in jail serving your punishment for stealing.",
