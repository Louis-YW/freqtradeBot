So you should keep that in mind when drafting a will.Regarding your example above: One Bitcoin can be divided into eight decimal places. What prevents you from writing a will that covers all five of your children equally? You then deposit this will (including the sealed private key of course) with a notary who, in the event of your death, will pay out the Bitcoin to your children according to their share.Problem solved. After all, this is how it is done with other assets that are passed on to the descendants. With Bitcoin there is no big difference, except that the notary has to be familiar with Bitcoin and you have to include the private key in your will.",

What will you do? Since non of them are aware.This is a simple situation, if you wish to share the amount of bitcoins you have kept among your children, you can include a clear statement in the WILL, that the amount of bitcoins you have at the time of death will be transferred to a trusted third party that will act as an escrow for the split and sharing of the bitcoins in any percentage you have specified among your children. That way you can avoid any problems that may arise by giving it to one of the beneficiaries to share to the others.",

      "body": "If you want to leave something like that to each of your five children, then make 5 wallets and \"fill\" each one with as much BTC as you want. When I say \"wallets\", I mean creating seeds, which is much easier than extracting private keys from public addresses and manually writing them down, which can easily lead to errors. On the other hand, if you want to print private keys, you run the risk that your data will be compromised, just like if you use the camera on your smartphone.When you have 5 wallet seeds, write them down on paper and store them in an envelope with the name of each child and an explanation of how to use them. How you store those envelopes is up to you, but I personally wouldn't entrust something like that to a lawyer or someone I don't trust completely.",

OK guys is up to you!You need a lawyer for this so that will be in accordance with the law of the country, every one of your children has the right to inheritance here in our country even illegitimate children have a share, my best course of action is to divide my Bitcoin to all my children equally what you say that you cannot divide your Bitcoin is not true you can divide it on as many shares as you want.I prefer to give their shares while I'm alive as a donation to each one of them so there are no more issues about shares when I die.",

      "body": "You have a number of options here and your actions depend on the number of people you want to trust, your situation at home, the area where you live (if it's dangerous or not).In your case you have 5 children and you want to divide the coins equally. One of the options is to make a will with the help of a law firm and seal private keys in envelopes, each with the name of one of your children. The lawyer will keep these envelopes in custody. As long as you live you can use the addresses, add and subtract coins from them, just that when you die they become inaccessible from your computer because only you know the password. After your death your children go to the lawyer and each gets their private key. If you don't want to trust the lawyers, make a new wallet and share the seed between your children so that each of them gets a few words. The only way for them to get the money would be to get together and access your wallet. Each option has a downside. First option makes you trust someone. The second can make the money inaccessible if one of your children suddenly dies before they are able to put the seed together. Imagine if you died and they are to meet to access the wallet and one of them gets into a car accident. Then nobody gets the money.",

If your topic is referring to yourself, you need to correct your mistakes before it's too late. I consider this a mistake because you failed to teach them about Bitcoin all this while, what would have happened if you aren't able to ask this question today and you aren't among the living anymore? Your Bitcoin will go to waste.  *Solution*•You don't have to give up the private keys to them, because this can cause a fight among the children later, case of one been greedy than others. •Like I've said, tell them to download Bitcoin wallet e.g Electrum wallet and send their shares to them one after the other, if you are rich, buy 5 hardware wallets and send the Bitcoins to each of the hardware wallets and hand it over to them. •Tell them to learn more about Bitcoin by doing some research themselves, also give them some advise how they can mess it all up, I meant every possible ways they can lose their Bitcoin to scammers.",

Sorry but in our country, as far as I know as long as you dont change it to fiat its not taxable unless you convert it.As I said before it depends on the place where you live. So you might be right for your country. However, there is no worldwide universal taxation of Bitcoin, so one has to differentiate depending on the jurisdiction you are living.In many European countries it is the case that assets up to a certain value can be inherited tax-free. Regardless of whether it is shares, Bitcoin or real estate. However, in other jurisdictions, inheriting Bitcoin may be tax-free and taxes may only be payable on a sale in FIAT currencies. The best thing would be to consult a local tax advisor on the subject. Here in the (international) part of the forum you will hardly get a suitable answer. If there is a local forum section for your country, you might want to ask there.",

There are humans with little or no sincerity or honesty; they can claim to be men of integrity, but in your absence they can do something totally different against your will. Trusting such information to a lawyer is something I cannot advise anyone to do. Just split the bitcoin into different wallets and keep a trace on how the kids can gain access to it when their father is dead.In a movie I watched with this kind of storyline, the man kept a record of how his three children could discover where he buried his will. What the man did was to contain little by little all his will information in three different diaries and inform the children that when he is dead, they should look for three diaries in his room that contain information on how they can get his will. So after he died, his children were already aware because the information was not just made available to one person. The diaries contain only a few pieces of information, so the three diaries need to be combined to get the full picture.",

OK guys is up to you!What prevents you from dividing bitcoin into equal shares for each child? Or do you think that BTC is not divisible?There is another option: divide btc not into equal shares, but depending on the abilities of each child. Why leave a legacy to a child who is prone to rash and irrational actions. For example, lose all the money in gambling. Then it’s better to leave the assets to the child who uses them wisely and increases them for the benefit of the family or even other heirs.There can be many nuances here.",
