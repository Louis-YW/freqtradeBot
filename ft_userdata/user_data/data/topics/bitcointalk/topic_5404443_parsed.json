This year, so many bounties I joined with that turned out scam especially with a project that deals with auto-staking thing.",

Now there are around Cryptos 20,056 and Exchanges 512, but only a few dozen really get attention which makes investors lose interest in this system despite the many promises and guarantees to investors from bounty developers, but I think so far have not been able to stop the decline in value due to the correction a very volatile market happens all the time and this could be one of the factors why the bounty campaign has been reduced in intensity for a while.",

In 2018 or 2019, when every cryptocurrency cost 4-10 times less than it cost now, we had more bounties that today. In my opinion, the amount of new projects reduced greatly, and projects have realized, that running a bounty campaign is not the most needed element of marketing. Bounties were instruments to create noise in the media and to stand out. Now, when there are only few projects worth investing, there is no need to create noise in media, because everyone spot such projects with any promotion.",

So they will have to wait or gamble and released it in this kind of situation. But there are no assurance that investors are willing to pour their money right now. Plus, there is still the war and then inflation all over the world. So most likely investors are going for a \"wait and see\" attitude.Of course, if BTC goes down, everyone is affected, including BNB and Ethereum. Normalcy will come back, but it mike take sometime.",

As you have mentioned mentioned covid, then comparing amount of bounties during covid and today, it is clear that back in 2020 we had more, I would say a lot more bounties. And I would say that covid hit economy more than current Russia-Ukraine war.You think there were no war conflicts in 2018 and 2019? What about endless Israel and Gaza clashes? Second Nagorno-Karabakh war with thousands of casualties? Bounties has stopped coming because cryptocurrency is cleared from silly projects like milk farm with blockchain and stop running ICOs with +1 million softcaps.",
