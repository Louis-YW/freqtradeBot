Well personally I do not know, i think the BC.game should display your chances of winning the jackpot depending on the number of tickets you have , cus if I still remember, that's how freebitco does .. but I leave the question to more experienced lottery players to answer though.",

      "body": "Still extremely low I used to think that in a lottery, the more tickets you have, the more chances of winning you have. But in reality those chances are still infinitesimally small when you take into account the number of balls they have to draw (6) and the number of balls the entire pool has to choose from (usually 1-50+). That in itself is already a huge number of possible combinations that even one in a million of your tickets may not hit at all.Still, your chances are increased anyway, but not enough to make a major difference.",

I see it's pretty much the same with other lotteries. You didn't hit the jackpot with a higher number of tickets so that should suggest you'll have lower chance with 8K.....but really it's tough to apply \"Math\" in luck-based games where the numbers to choose from are too many. We've seen it happen many times when someone won big with just one ticket.",

I think the math would go like this:1/36 * 1/35 * 1/34 * 1/33 * 1/32 = 1/45239040But since you can choose your numbers in any order, there are more possible combinations and therefore a slightly greater chance of winning. A sequence of 5 numbers can be written down in 5! (5 factorial) different ways, so there are 120 different combinations of tickets with 5 correct numbers. When we divide 45239040 by 120 to account for this, we get 376992. So, the chance of hitting 5 correct numbers from the sequence 1 to 36 is 1 in 376992.The chance of hitting the last number is 1/10, so if I did my math right, your overall chance of winning the jackpot would be 1 in 3,769,920.",

I believe it's just really destiny that makes someone a millionaire through lottery. I just hope that $800 is not an amount you can't afford to lose.
