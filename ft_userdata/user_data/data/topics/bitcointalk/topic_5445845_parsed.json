While there may be trends in the market, there are always unforeseen factors that can impact the value of cryptocurrencies. It's important to consider the risks and benefits of investing in any asset. If you're comfortable with the potential risks and feel that bitcoin aligns with your investment strategy, then go for it! But just remember, investing in bitcoin can be a rollercoaster ride.",

There will be new more trends that shall bump the price and mostly, the halving. But to discourage people to buy right now isn't sound advice. Instead of telling them not to invest, it's better for them to invest right now or whenever they're comfortable. That's the reason why many miss those times when it's too cheap because they've probably heard that it will dump some more until it didn't.Quote from: Greggry on March 21, 2023, 07:29:35 PMIf I have money now, I would buy half of bitcoin because in next three months it will double the current price.

      "body": "For me, you don't really have to wait til bitcoin drops in value and becomes cheap before you go out there and buy bitcoins. If that would be the case then you'd literally lose hairs waiting especially during a bull run. For me, the best is to buy as much as you can in the moment, with full confidence that you wouldn't sell those at the first sight of trouble of course, and consistently do this until you eventually reach your desired amount. That way you can ride all the small umphs in value and at the same time secure yourself a spot whenever a bull run comes. Buying low and then selling high is a basic person's solution to the problem of not being able to afford a bitcoin, but the above stated strategy for buying works more effectively.",

So how sure are you that the price of Bitcoin is not down currently today at $28k/BTC? Because if you can look at the chart below you will notice that the price of Bitcoin just 10 days ago was $20k \"11th, March 2023\", while today, the price of BTC is standing at $28k, and who knows if by next 10 days it's price won't worth another $8k difference making it $36k by 31st March 2023. So my friend, I will love to say that there is no good or bad time, in as much as you buy the little you can afford at the moment.QuoteIf I have money now, I would buy half of bitcoin because in next three months it will double the current price.

And this year will break more even.Actually, the best time to buy is the last year, it was when the price of Bitcoin dropped very severely. If you bought some Bitcoin with your money at that time, you even already get profits if you sell now. However, it is not too late to buy now but I suggest \"wait and see\" first. I think you need to wait for the next correction, it is the ideal time to buy. By the way, I don't know what will happen in the next 3 months, it can be an uptrend or a downtrend again. How do you know the price of Bitcoin to double in the next 3 months?In my understanding, a bullrun period happens every 4 years, but it is not a definite count. Since the first year of bearish is in 2022, so the possible next bullrun ideally happens in 2024-2025. So, it is not too late to prepare your Bitcoin now because there is still plenty of time.",

Believing that Bitcoin can only go up and up forever is risky. There's nothing that guarantees that, in fact Bitcoin's value is based only on speculation, which is why it is so volatile. Next, Bitcoin doesn't retain its value. If the price goes down and you have an unrealized loss, you can't always afford to wait it out till the price goes up again. Sometimes life forces us to spend money, and if the value of your money happened to go down when that happened, you could be in a big trouble.And lastly, you are using past performance to predict the future. But it ignores that conditions were different. Bitcoin market was small and had a lot of room to grow, and halvenings had huge effect because 25 and then 12.5 BTC were cut from supply every 10 minutes.",
