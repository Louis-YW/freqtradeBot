However, they always look for innovative opportunities to increase their earnings.Yes, they can diversify investment into Bitcoin but their investment decision in crypto will depend on each rich individual personal understanding of Bitcoin.",

Having physical work is not the only way on measuring how much effort you are putting on your job to become successful. Do you think managing a company to success is easy than doing menial job? Physically yes but it’s hard as hell mentally. You can’t measure the difficulty of work base on physical because the value of contribution to business success is what matter most.Wealthy person earned there through there hardship and wise decision making. They do it without Bitcoin so you can’t force them to invest on a new territory which they is risky while they already prove that they can be wealthy by doing the things they done. They are the living proof which is why wealthy person person is the hardest person to encourage to invest in Bitcoin. It like selling computer to the CEO of the company that making it. They are already on the pinnacle of Investment word, It’s nonsense to convince to not be scared on things that they are already on top especially when it comes from people like us that still nothing to prove compared to them.",

Well, from the perspective of this forum, yes. But there are many super rich who don't give a damn about Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi that will eventually go to 0, like Buffet and others.So the same as before. It seems to me that you are saying things that are going through your head with little or no basis.",

There are people who are in a conflict of interest, those who work for big traditional investment markets. So they can, of course, trash-talk about Bitcoin. But as for generic rich people, are they truly largely worried about Bitcoin? If you're very rich, you normally have the kind of wealth that won't be gone because it's in different assets, countries, property and other things. So unless it's an end-of-the-world situation, you'll be alright. Bitcoin doesn't do much to undermine traditional industries in practice. They still remain highly valued and powerful. There's enough for everyone, it's not really a competition IMO.",

I agree with this statement of yours, because they stand the chance of losing a huge amount of money in case the price of Bitcoin falls, and likewise make profit if the price rises, but they are more always worried about lost.QuoteFirst, they did not earn their riches by hard labour, I totally disagree with this point of yours, because if that's how it is easy to become a billionaire without hard labour, everybody would have been a billionaire today, because there are different ways one can implement his/her hardwork, it could physically, intellectually, and technologically, and there is always a reward for itQuotethey must setup charities to help the humanity. It is never a must for any rich billionaires to setup charity organizations to help humanity, it's always out of free will, so I totally disagree with what you said.",

Well I guess they did work their ass off early, getting enough knowledge on how to become rich by investing in any instrument, like stocks, mutuals and other financial assets. So there is some form of hard labour there.
