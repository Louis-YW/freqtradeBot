  "content": "Introducing ATLOSATLOS is a decentralized, permissionless, non-custodial crypto payment processor.What Is It?ATLOS allows websites and apps to accept payments in cryptocurrency, such as stablecoins, UCDC, USDT, DAI or other crypto.Why Decentralized Payment Processor?Most existing payment processors are built with web2 technologies. Many maintain relationships with banks for converting crypto into fiat. As a result, they are severely restricted in types of industries they can service. They require an approval and KYC prior to onboarding, and they can ban a merchant's account or freeze merchant's funds at their discretion.ATLOS is a permissionless payment processor. No approval is required to sign up. To open an account, a merchant only needs to connect a wallet, no other information is required.ATLOS is also non-custodial. It does not hold merchants' funds and cannot freeze them.IntegrationATLOS can be easily integrated with any website or app by adding only two lines of JavaScript code.LinksVisit ATLOS at https://atlos.io",

Is it open or closed source code?I don't consider your Atlos project to be decentralized when it is built on top of centralized EVM blockchains that have built in censorship, and I am not even sure you are supporting Bitcoin for payments.There is Bitcoin logo on your website but I don't know if this is Bitcoin mainnet or some tokens made up on shitcoin blockchains.There are much better open source payments processors like Btcpayserver, CypherpunkPay and few others.",

      "body": "Thank you for your feedback!Quote from: dkbit98 on October 25, 2022, 05:25:09 PMCan we see source code for Altos? Is it open or closed source code?It is closed source for now. We may be opening it and posting on GitHub in the future. The reason for the closed source is we don't hold any funds in the contract, so no risk or losing them. All funds are passed through immediately to the merchant. There's no need, for now at least, to audit the source code.Quote from: dkbit98 on October 25, 2022, 05:25:09 PMI am not even sure you are supporting Bitcoin for payments.We do not accept bitcoin at this time. Our focus is mainly stablecoins on EVM-compatible blockchains. But, bitcoin and other non-EVM compatible coins are on the roadmap.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on October 26, 2022, 11:28:37 AMIf merchant need to open an account at your website, that means your payment processor is centralized.Actually, the website only contains the integration instructions. It's not necessary to open an account there.Quote from: dkbit98 on October 25, 2022, 05:25:09 PMThere are much better open source payments processors like Btcpayserver, CypherpunkPay and few others.Sure, for people who want to run their own Linux daemon and only accept bitcoin",

Could you elaborate?This is correct, we are serving the payment widget from our server for convenience. It can be served from IPFS or locally from the merchant's server if they have one.",
