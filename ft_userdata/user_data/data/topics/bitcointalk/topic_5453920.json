  "content": "Hello Bitcon family!  I made an iPadOS and tvOS app called BitcoinTV.Live.  It's just mainly just a simple & free bitcoin ticker.  You can also see other market info like lows, highs, 30d&24h volume.  It also connects to mempool to get incoming transactions, and notifications of new blocks.  Nothing fancy, but I hope you enjoy it. Would love feedback from those of you who use it.  Thank You!",
