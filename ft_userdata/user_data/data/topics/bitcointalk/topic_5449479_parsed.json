If it's the exchange, then you shouldn't have any private keys to start with.Now, if you're confident that it's an actual private key or a seed phrase, and assuming you only have a display issue as I understood, then you should be able to plug it into your computer and access its files from there",

And now my phone that I saved the private keys on phone notepad is blind with issues of panel. How do I get this keys back or what do I do?You can not own a private key on Binance. When you send cryptos to/or buy them on Binance, they are not belonging to you until you withdraw them on your own wallet.Are you really talking of Binance or maybe Trustwallet ?FYI it is a very bad idea to store a seed phrase or private key on an online device (no matter it is a smartphone, laptop or desktop). Paper is better, always-offline devices are a better choice than online ones too.",

Funny but why not ask Binance for recovery?",

I think you’re referring to your Binance password, you can recover that using the email address or phone number you registered the account with.",

      "body": "If its with Binance, as long as you still have access to your login credentials you should be good to go, since those wallets are non-custodial and you can easily access them as long as you could log in and verify your account, although I did hear some changes in the way Binance handles ETH and BTC accounts, so that could be a cause for concern. Anyways;If you're positive it's really a wallet with its own private keys and seed phrases, I'm afraid we'd have little help with you on that, from the get-go you are given all the power to control your wallet by giving you the private keys and those are the only ways you can ever access it, if you don't have those they are gone for good.",

Many people argue that one of the reasons that they remain with exchanges is that they don't have issues of private keys. So, they won't have the stress to save private keys for long time. For the case of exchanges, what they need do is to provide email or any KYC requirements to recover their accounts. How come your own case is different, and how manage did CZ issue you a private key?Your posts suggest that you don't have a clue of what you said and maybe you never created a wallet anytime.",
