Most if not many can be mined on a PC with a decent GPU.  If you want to mine altcoins there area for those is https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=160.0edit: I see the mods moved the OP's thread to where it belongs",

You can mine anything but the speed will be slow and you will barely make anything.Right now mining is very unprofitable. Even with a high end CPU you barely make anything, same with an expensive Nvidia GPU.When ETH went POS a few months back the profitability just tanked on everything related to GPU mining.",

      "body": "Mining cryptocurrency with a low-spec computer can be challenging, as the process requires significant computational power to solve complex mathematical problems. However, there are some options you can explore if you're interested in mining with a low-spec computer.One option is to mine less popular or newer cryptocurrencies that require less computational power to mine. These cryptocurrencies often have lower difficulty levels, which means that they can be mined with less powerful hardware.Another option is to join a mining pool. Mining pools allow you to combine your computing power with other miners to increase your chances of successfully mining a block and earning a reward. By joining a mining pool, you can effectively pool your resources and increase your chances of earning a payout.It's important to note, however, that mining with a low-spec computer may not be profitable, especially when considering the electricity costs associated with running the computer for extended periods. Before getting into mining, it's important to do your research and ensure that it's a viable option for you.",

OgNasty gave you the only really useful link to answer your question, because without knowing your GPU or the price of your kw/h, we can't really advise you, it's a too vast subject and there would be dozens of potential answers to give you.For example, if you have an old CPU, you could always solo mine XMR and hope to get a block by some miracle, but it's not worth it if you're paying for your electricity. At the very least, you could use HDDs or SSDs with Chia farming or to host a Storj node, but that's no longer as profitable as it was a few years ago - it's hard to get into the business and make a real profit, especially with a small amount of equipment.",

If we add the cost of a computer here, then this is an absolutely irredeemable process. It's better to buy $100 worth of coins and not torment computer hardware.",

Low spec computers usually don't get good returns so a powerful computer should be used.If you decide to use a powerful PC for GPU and CPU mining, then after using the calculator you will see a payback of more than 5 years, because you need to consider the cost of the entire PC and not the CPU and GPU. And there are additional maintenance costs. This is the rookie mistake. And on the old PC, the profit will be measured in cents per day.",

I've tried it myself, and let me tell you, it's not always smooth sailing. But here's the thing: it's not impossible either. Sure, you might not get the same results as someone with a powerful setup, but if you're patient and willing to tinker around, you can still make it work. Just keep in mind the power consumption and potential return on investment, so you can manage your expectations. What difference does it make on which PC to start mining?On a weak PC, the electricity bill will be more than the profit from mining, on a powerful PC there will be a very long payback period. In good moments of the market, it is profitable to mine on a PC, when the profit from the processor and video card gives 4-5 dollars per day, but now there is no such income.",

Mining on computers has long ceased to be profitable, but the exception to this rule was the purchase of laptops for mining Ethereum. Beginners will not be able to compete with the big mining giants, but with cheap electricity, they can look for profit in altcoin mining.",
