Do you?Lets just accept the fact that inflation is an inevitable thing for us to avoid out.Yes, we do make out some sacrifices when it comes on trying out to achieve our goal or targets but if those money you had saved up would be in form of fiat then stored in banks then it would be subjected to have that kind of situation unlike if these amounts are really that been put up on an investment which it could potentially be able to gain up profits more. Somehow this would really be actually depending on a certain individual since not all would really be that risks takers and would eventually just sitting around on much less risky space and wont tend to go farwith those kind of decisions which is something that would really differ into each person. It is really that a huge challenge for us if ever we are saving in fiat where inflation could really affect that much. If we are really that eager and serious on reaching goals then dont stop just because you've seen that the price had increased.Its true that you would need to work hard more and would be wise on finding other sources of income or would really be touching up that investment thing as long it wouldbenefit you out and would be fasten up the process on achieving your goal.

One good here is that, you are able to save the money so when you needed the money you can easily have it.

This is where loans sets a good example rather than saving fiat (in a bank) for several years to get a car or house that we don't know how much the inflation rate would rise in the next year or two. Another option would be to invest to an asset with low risk involved but could protect your money from inflations. I say gold or real estate, but I'm leaning towards the real estate. I can also say Bitcoin for long term perspective. Saving fiat for me is like giving away free money to the bank because the inflation will kill the purchasing power of your money and the bank used your money to lend it to someone and of course earned an interest with it.",

Do you?Regardless of inflation, delaying your gratification just to purchase a depreciating asset which is a car is not worth it all because its value decreases the moment you purchased and use it. It can’t compensate for the time you missed out with your friends and the happy life that you can have just to purchase this car. I dream having a car but if took you a long time just to purchase then it means that this kind of luxury doesn't suits you because you can’t afford it without sacrificing most of your precious time just to save. What will happened if the car got damages and need repairs? It will cost a lot and give you a hard time on saving once again just for repairs. Is it worth it to save for a long time just to purchase a depreciating asset??",

Did you know that my dream car that was an equivalent of $15,450 rose up to $23,680...The problem with cars is that they have gone up more than the average inflation rate. In your case they could have looked for an interest-bearing account or something similar so that the savings would yield a little, although they will always yield less than inflation.It is usually recommended that if you are saving for something but for 5 years or more, put the money in an investment, for example a fund indexed to the S&P 500 because in approximately 85% of 5-year periods it has been profitable. The downside is that you have about a 15% chance of losing money. If you don't want to bet with those positive probabilities, what happens to you is what has happened to you, that you face the inevitable loss of purchasing power due to inflation, which has been exacerbated precisely in this period. Another idea would be to put your money in Bitcoin, which although it is very volatile, with a high probability of cycle to cycle you will increase your purchasing power quite a lot.",

One of the factors of inflation is the financial mismanagement of your currency, which means that the currency exchange rate is constantly declining, then converting to dollars or Swiss francs will solve the problem, and keeping gold or long-term investment is an ideal solution.Sometimes inflation is due to the smooth supply, as happened in the year 2020, and then trying to postpone the purchase will lead to a lot of fees being reduced. Taxes and customs exemptions are another reason for inflation.Try to figure out why the price of the car changed from $15,450 to $23,680 and you might be able to find a way to make things happy on your side.",

For example, investing in assets whose value tends to increase over time Buying land, rice fields or buying gold can help you offset inflation and maintain the purchasing power of your savings.",

Investing preserves the value of your capital and protects it from inflation.I'm not going to give you investment advise here. You should do you own research.2.Buying an expensive car(when you don't have high enough income to maintain such car) is a bad decision if you ask me. Expensive cars lose their value pretty quickly and the cost of maintenance becomes very high(especially when the car breaks).3.Why don't buy a cheaper car, which you could afford? Or maybe you should try to grow your income, in order to afford a 23K USD car.",

I know that I was far away from that, but I already saw the price, and start saving, and investing some of it to fight inflation. Then the pandemic came, and all was affected. From price of construction materials, to daily wages of the laborers etc. etc. The price of the dream home that I saw a few years ago went up by I guess at least 20%-30%. You can fight inflation by investing that money into different assets that can give you interest higher than the inflation rate base on your country. It's just that, the rate of inflation for the past 2-3 years has been high that all of us who are earning bare minimum wages are greatly affected. I also want to question you. Why didn't you invest the amount of money that you saved instead of just saving it? You know that the inflation rate will be that high right? I'm not saying that you must've invested it into Bitcoin, but at least try to invest it into different assets instead of you saving it knowing that inflation is that high.Your heart sunk, and I know the feeling. However, you must've been aware of what's happening with the economy like the inflation rate. There's nothing wrong with saving money because I'm saving a bit of my monthly salary as well. It's just that the inflation rate is very high at this moment that saving most of your money is the worst thing that you can do.",
