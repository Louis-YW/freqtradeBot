As long as the current fiat system is not viable, then CBDCs are even less viable as they enable the government to engage in even more currency debasement. CBDCs cannot save weak currencies like the Ghanian Cedis, the Zimbabwean Dollar, the Venezuelan bolivar, the Argentine peso, or the Lebanese lira. The eNaira, Africa’s first central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a total failure and did not save the Nigerian fiat currency. Infact, there are a lot of bad things that come with CBDCs and countries should avoid it. What do you think.

      "body": "I think there's a lot that can be said against central bank digital currencies. Central banks have no accountability and have repeatedly caused harm, often deliberately. I don't want to see them gain more power by introducing CBDCs. And it's hard to see how central bank digital currencies increase privacy. To me, the biggest threat from CBDCs is the loss of seigniorage, which would enable the introduction of a permanent expansionary monetary policy.So if CBDCs cannot save weak currencies, what can? It depends on the situation, but there are a variety of viable options. For tether-like issuance, community banks could issue their own currencies in line with their local credit capacity. There is precedent for this some community banks have issued their own private currency notes.",

Take Nigeria and the e-naira for instance, rather they were created to further strengthen their hold. But alas, it's also failing.",

They are doing this to meet the challenges of the new digital age, and those who want to admit it publicly say that they are actually afraid of the increasing influence of cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins.As we have already concluded countless times, not only will such currencies enable the authorities to have complete insight into all transactions, but they will most likely be used to show that they are safer, better and more stable than Bitcoin or some altcoins/stablecoins. It is known that the EU has plans for a digital euro, but also that the current views are that the maximum amount per individual will be EUR 300, which means that we are still far from CBDC completely replacing existing payment methods.",

In Jordan people are already using USDT for local trade as their economy is broken a few months ago and their fiat currencies become worthless.

We can not say the current condition in Nigeria is tantamount to what will happen in some countries when they implement their own version. In the first place, CBDC ideation does not merely thrive to improve the \"stability\" of FIAT currencies, so if we are goes by saying it mainly will improve weak currencies, it is truly a misunderstanding and nonsensical. Since unstable money should be improved by any other means, rather than moving the money into digital form.",

Even small Candy worth ₹1 ~ $0.015 !!! That’s the beauty of going digital. With this they are able to grow economy to the highest peak. Let’s not mix up the things with crypto world I guess.

It is worse than that. It gives the government more power over its people. CBDC is just a digital version of fiat currencies. There is no exception so there is no way it can assist in any way to a weak economy. It will create mostly an inconvenience to the majority of the population. Just think how some urban tribes in Afghanistan or Somalia will use CBDC without internet or a compatible device.",
