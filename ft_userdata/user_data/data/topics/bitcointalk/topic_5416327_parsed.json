  "content": "GrapheneOS is making a small fundraising event to preorder two Google Pixel7 smartphones for making their privacy oriented open source mobile operating system.Their first choice for accepting payments is Bitcoin and they posted address in public on their twitter post, but for regular donations they also accept Monero, Zcash,credit card payments, PayPal, etc.Everything they do is available for free as open source, so it would be good for anyone who appreciate their work and use Graphene to make donation, however small it is.QuoteWe need $3500 to preorder 2x Pixel 7 and 2x Pixel 7 Pro (2x $599 + 2x $799 at local prices with added sales tax). One for main device maintainers and one for main dev/testing set.Bitcoin donation address specifically for this purpose:bc1q2fh6j65w3rfvyn00zex2gh9eslhw9nvdnvkfy7https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1578073223316619271GrapheneOS Github: https://github.com/GrapheneOSOfficial Website: https://grapheneos.org/",

I think Pixel 6 is larger than I would like to see and it has some flaws, but they reduced slightly size for new Pixel 7 model, and Pixel 7A will be even smaller.Compared to other flagship smartphones I think they have very reasonable pricing, and Pixel phone loaded with GrapheneOS is next level compared to all other phones, if you care about privacy.",

Not just Google, even Samsung has its fair share. However I'm hoping the Gen 2 fixes the thermal and battery life.I assume you have no issues with the connectivity, but not all of us get to enjoy the privileges because they don't (want to) give a toss for users living in non-supported regions. Always the same \"You shouldn't be buying a device unsupported in your country\" canned response from those smartass contributors whenever you search for it.Quote from: dkbit98 on October 10, 2022, 03:35:57 PMSure Pixel phones has issues, but show me any other phone that can smoothly run open source operating system, be degoogled with Graphene that supports and uses Bitcoin.I wouldn't use any phone as a daily driver if support was dropped, but Pixel is giving four or five years of support, and that is very good thing.If you don't mind being spied all the time with other phones, than by all means use what you want.Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the Pixel at all. I only want what's the best for my needs. Their camera shots are sublime. What you said was the reason why I decided to get one. Support, limitless storage (before Google discontinued it) and the stock Android experience.However we customers have our own preference and either the phone or us could change. I wanted to get the 6A until I saw the overheating issues and the processor being built on the Exynos foundry. If you've owned one (e.g. Samsung), you should be aware that it's known to be inferior to Snapdragon in terms of performance and thermal management. I could relate as I have some and they can get real toasty. And then I have to bear with the lack of VoLTE and 4G band compatibility which further handicapped its capabilities.If the phone lineup doesn't suit me anymore, time to switch to a better alternative. Unfortunately Pixel's not in the cards because their next gen phones are still gonna use Exynos. Nowadays phone's ain't cheap; I ain't spending a fortune on another portable heater when I live in a tropical country. Being \"spied\" on, it applies to the apps and sites we sign up for, not just non-Google. I mean our data is already harvested by the giants themselves. Not like I care much anyway as convenience comes at the cost of security. Shopping suggestions, autocomplete, those are from data harvesting/ analytics. Heck, even Google is my go-to search engine because it delivers the answers I need.Anyways I won't further derail this thread. Peace out.",

You could not pay me to use an iPhone. OK, well if you give me enough I might use one, but I would still carry an Android device :-)The battery was not fixable in software, 100% just a bad battery, it would heat up to the point of the phone shutting down even with a 2 amp charger. Was just a bad battery out of the box, it happens, but there was no way they tested it before shipping.With that being said I put Graphene on the 4A late yesterday and it seems to be working. Had to jump through a few more hoops then listed here: https://grapheneos.org/usage#sandboxed-google-play-esim to get my esim working. Once that was good I went to bed, will do more testing later or tomorrow. At 1st use it seems slower then what was there stock, but it's been a while since I used that phone so I may be relating it more to what I have been using now. Threw them a donation since it's the right thing to do.-Dave",
