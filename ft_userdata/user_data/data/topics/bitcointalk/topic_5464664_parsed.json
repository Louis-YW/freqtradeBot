In fact, if you're relying on archived bets at any site to determine whether or not the outcome was provably fair - in most cases you aren't really proving anything.  If a player wants to verify a bet, they need to create their own records or verify after each bet or in small batches while keeping track of the nonce and how many bets were made themselves (not using live stats/graph pop up).",

If a company, customer support staffs are professional, they can open to take their look at your case but if they already did it in the past, then you complained here in such way, they have rights to ignore your complain.So if you want to get like an escalating support, you must be professional and use good words, not what you used in the title. Asking for escalating support is not a special right and receive it or not, it depends on many factors. One of such is your attitude when creating your thread.I don't have doubt about professional of Stake.com and Primedice.com teams.Being inactive a few months in Bitcointalk does not mean the person is dead.",

He does seriously thinking that all of us are Stake employees. Or, to be precise, everyone that's not agreeing with him, taking his side, running to support his accusation, or even remains neutral, are on Stake's payroll. Basically, if anyone question his evidences, boomm, they must be receiving paycheck from stake.But yes, he does not provide evidences to support any of his claim.

This is not proof that anything was manipulated.  Don't worry, if Stake were manipulating bets it won't be difficult to prove by someone that understands how provably fair works.  Until then, unfortunately, you're going to have to be lumped in with all the other rambling degenerates that can't accept the fact they lost so convince themselves they were cheated and decide to go back and find proof in the archives.",

As I previously mentioned on your other thread [amongst many other], you still ask the 1M USD even after they granted your demand and let the supervisor talk to you. In fact, the first thing you tell the supervisor is to pay him because you \"want to bury this\" and it'll be better to \"wrap this\", pretty much sounds like an extortion for moneyQuote from: JollyGood on September 04, 2023, 01:25:34 PMThe OP is clearly very upset but unfortunately for him he seems he is venting frustration in the wrong place.

If Stake were manipulating outcomes or altering historical data, it would have been picked up by now.Nope, he's leaning more toward grasping at straws and throwing muds rather than venting, if I may give my opinion. So far, he accuses Stake to be a scam family business due to the owner's father's past history, changing betID during live betting, using motion sensors to cheat their user, manipulating betting [mine games] history, and paid anyone who question his story as people on their payroll.But yes, I think he's in denial, he lost his inheritance money to gamble at stake.",
