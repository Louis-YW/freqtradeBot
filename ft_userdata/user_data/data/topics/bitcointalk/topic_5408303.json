No, but it probably is. What you can do is start making your Bitcoin purchases now, and buy every DIP. Unless a Black Swan event, Bitcoin should trade near the 200-week SMA for the coming weeks. If Black Swan event, big opportunity to deploy more of your savings. It's a risk and you shouldn't do it if you support a family/wife/kids.",

However there are many assets you can diversify into Aside the Bitcoin and ETH , therefore I suggest adding a little Gold and silver as  a hedge to inflation equally make sense , Maybe going into investing in real estate depending on the capital that you're able to save. Investing in this areas can actually help someone hedge his funds during this high inflation.",

Better to invest your extra money and don't rush things here.Crypto usually works for more years before you can actually say that its working, there's no easy money here but if you do that consistently, you can succeed on that. Go for crypto, buy only good projects and stick with your strategy.",

      "body": "Putting 20% of salary into crypto is not what I would recommend, keep that limited to 10%, if you want to keep all your \"investable\" money on crypto.If you are looking to diversify then dividing that into 5% each into crypto and stocks seems like a better option from my view. However this ratio will vary every month. In some months crypto will go up and you will not be buying any, in such months go for bigger numbers on stocks and commodities and vice versa.As far as crypto is concerned only invest in bitcoin. Do not go for any altcoin as a beginner. For stocks I dont think this is the best place to talk about, you should do your own research for the long term ones and stack those up. This is more or less what I follow. Crypto buying is once a month while I buy my chosen stocks every few weeks.",

My savings account(bank), on the other hand, only serves as an emergency fund worth of 3 months, this means that this is liquid and can be withdrawn immediately when things got bad.Outside the academic stuff, I also do some side projects(e.g., drawing commission,graphics), along with planning an e-commerce niche that runs on advertisement on facebook.The point is, you can't expect to beat the inflation by simply relying on the APY return from your savings account and you need to find alternative to increase your active and passive income. After which, you can then plan to diversify your asset (which I am planning to do so) with alternative like bonds, real estate/rental properties, ETF's..Do note that I am DCA'ing BTC while building all those stuff I have said..",

In my country banks offer up to 3% interest per annum but still too small compare pd to DeFi yield offer. Many popular exchange offers 4% to 6% APY using stablecoin. This is the safest path to choose if you are considering passive profit with less volatility risk. The only risk involved on this is the exchange itself which will hold your balance like banks doing on your money.",

Especially when you invest in bitcoin. If your able to hold, your sure it would yield some good value in the future.Hence, you actually did invest in an asset.That's what you should do when thinking of places to put your money. Is it an asset? Does it have a promising value in a few years? And not just to live money in some bank account and be expecting profit on it. Look out for businesses that works in your place study and invest in them. It's way better than savings in the bank.",

That is already a good start. Not all young professionals can invest 20% of their salary. Most of them spend them all on vices and unnecessary expenses. When you have enough profit from your bitcoin, maybe you can explore investing in land or buying houses and then rent them out. You will never lose investing in land because it never depreciates. Its value keeps on appreciating as time goes by.",

I would highly recommend you to just hold and wait for the market to pump and be careful of APY scams .. there are some ponzis out there luring investors with high returns.
