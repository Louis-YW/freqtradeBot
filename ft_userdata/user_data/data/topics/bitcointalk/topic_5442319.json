Major movement from your 3rd month. This is an ongoing service. There's no such thing as one time SEO. You can't expect to do some stuff now, to rank up and to keep your position up there, when on most niches there are 100+ competitors fighting for the top 5 positions ( and on highly competitive ones there are 200-300 listings fighting for the same spots). IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.  What this means is that, if you won't renew this service after your initial 3 months, your rankings will eventually drop to your previous rankings. How fast? IDK, depends on your niche and how aggressive your competitors are. How long does it take to start ranking in the first 5 positions? Depends on your nieche and location.

Even if its a new GMB.If you think SEO is a one-time thing, move on and keep searching for unicorns, this service isn't for you.  The only exceptions are GMBs in villages or secluded locations, where just having a GMB, gets you ranked all over the place because you don't have any competitors.Payment via BTC, ETH, LTC, USDT, Paypal, PerfectMoney, Bank Transfer.
