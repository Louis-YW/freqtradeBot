Never heard of this platform, no track on coinmarketcap/coingecko, blatant lies in article, half-assed website. I was surprised to see this on yahoo finance. Project featurings in news sites should be taken as grain of salt.",

Then I guess you rarely visit their website as that's business as usual for them, publishing articles for anyone that's willing to pay the fee. Quote from: libert19 on March 12, 2023, 06:48:13 AMProject featurings in news sites should be taken as grain of salt. More like with a handful of salt. They even have disclosure at the end of the text, basically saying that everything published there could be a bs.",

Yahoo Finance will gladly take your money and advertise your site explaining how revolutionary it is. I read somewhere that it's not even that expensive. Setting aside a few hundred dollars for a piece like that isn't a significant investment if you are running any trading platforms. But I am wondering if they do any screening before they agree to cooperate with someone. It would be interesting to contact them about a blatant scam just to see how they will respond.",

Any crypto user should always be skeptical about so-called recommendations and praise about this or that service, especially if it is little-known. Such sites are only interested in their own profit, they don't care about your future losses and risks associated with the use of certain services. If you want good advice about some or other services, go to bitcointalk, there is minimal probability to cheat and mislead.",

Then contact any of the PR publication services. You will find a few on our forum. Pay them the fee and get featured there. It's that easy these days. But you are right that we shouldn't take any project seriously just because they are featured in popular news media. In fact, without having enough study, we shouldn't take any project seriously based on other people's thoughts. To make it more short, no project but Bitcoin.",

It would be interesting to contact them about a blatant scam just to see how they will respond. Many a project today do very little screening and in some cases choose even to ignore obvious hints of a project being a scam as long as they can afford the service.

      "body": "Well, the difference between real news articles and paid press releases is that news articles are meant to give you the facts and keep you informed, while press releases are meant to promote something specific. News articles are written by journalists who have to stick to a code of ethics and report the truth, but press releases are written by companies or groups that have their own agenda.The problem is that some websites publish press releases without checking if they're true, just because they get paid for it or have some kind of relationship with the company. But this can be dangerous for readers like us because we might end up believing something and think we are getting real news when we are actually just seeing a company's sales pitch. So, it is important to be careful and make sure you are reading trustworthy news from reliable sources.",

These are promotional articles and whoever writes it just do it based on what the project is demanding and have it listed to those publishing and news websites that have traffic to be seen by their viewers.Then the project will use that as resource to say that they've been \"featured\" on a popular website like such.",
