  "content": "i play slots hoping to win 'big win' or 'jackpot' but many times it don't hits and my balance get drained after betting many times in one slot machine. i play more bets hoping it already took my so much balance it will definitely going to hit this times, but it never happens, and my balance becomes \"0\".so i am sharing some tips to avoid this type of losing streak or bad luck in slots.here it starts:1. always set a budget for playing slots and stick to it. do not chase losses or try to win back what you have lost by playing more.2. if a slot machine does not hit in 7-10 spins, consider trying a different machine. this can help you avoid getting stuck on a losing streak and losing more money.3. if you have been playing a slot machine for 50 spins and have not gotten any free spins or big wins, consider switching to a different machine.     this can help you avoid wasting money on a machine that is unlikely to pay out.4. avoid playing slots from Pragmatic and Gamomat as they tend to have low payout percentages and are not as likely to result in big wins.5. be careful when playing slots from Belatra and Spinomenal as they can be unpredictable and may not always pay out as expected.6. if you do hit a big win, consider tipping any nearby players who may have been unlucky or busting. This can help spread good karma and keep the atmosphere positive.7. avoid getting \"slot psychosis\" where you get stuck on one machine for too long. remember that slots are based on random chance and there is no guaranteed way to win.     so, take breaks, switch machines and remember to have fun!8. first check the RTP (reward to player) and RTP should between 96%-100%",

This is the period a gambler is vulnerable to spend almost all or all the money he has to gambling and it is the time of having poor mindset towards gambling.",

      "body": "Slot games and spin game are designed to drain gamblers accounts. The way I look at it these two casinos are just for fun and not to win for income. I went to a hotel bar then there was a game section so I went to just have fun but was also hoping to cash out small chances from the game to my own surprised I was drained to the core and I came back with empty pocket. I really don't know how people are winning bin this game. The game is difficult to play though there are some people that expert on the game. But as me I have not win the game in any day so I am not interested to play for now but might try again later.",

      "body": "These are very interesting tips that you gave, but in my point of view these tips will only make the person relax when he is having a losing streak, but the defeats will not disappear until he stops playing, he may even later have some wins, but then the losses will always outweigh the wins, the biggest problem in  Gambling that depend on luck is that the number of losses will always exceed the number of wins and the only way to do well in  Gambling that depend on luck of luck Is when the person wins a jackpot, for example if a person spends days losing and winning little and in all he loses 1000$ but later wins a jackpot of 2 million dollars then in this case he will be compensating for the time spent playingbut the problem is that there are few people who are lucky enough to win the jackpot, so most people are just losing money with  Gambling that depend on luck, I don't see any strategy that can change the current scenario of gambling that depend on luck people always have more losses than wins no matter what they do, while in sports betting, poker and other  Gambling that do not depend on luck the objective is always to have the highest number of wins and lowest number of losses and choose high odds. that's why I don't play those games that rely on luck",

So if you don't have luck when you play, you can lose and the losses will get bigger if you can't control yourself.The tips you provide are very interesting but try to have limited funds so you don't exceed the money limit you use for gambling. We know that slot games really tempt us to keep trying our luck so that we can spend a lot of money. Without restrictions on using money, our losses can be bigger than we imagine.",

But if the machines are okay and yet you decide to switch them you might still end up losing.",

      "body": "Yes, losing is a part of gambling, and slot machines are no exception. The odds are always in favor of the casino, and the longer you play, the more likely you are to lose. So while you might have some wins here and there, over time, you're likely to lose more than you win. But, if you approach it with the mindset of having fun and setting a budget for yourself, you're less likely to get carried away and lose more than you can afford. It's all about managing your expectations and not getting too caught up in the excitement of a potential win. At the end of the day, it's just a game.",

Self discipline is what it takes to control lose when gambling. Many people are guilty of all you have clearly stated above and no doubt you are talking from experience because it only takes one with experience to write such modalities and possible prevention tips for  a gambler to follow. So far, OP has been able to get through in itemizing or  listing some possible guidelines for averting excessive lose in the course of gambling and I do commend op for doing this effort.If this measures are followed, I believe there would not be much loses and gambling addiction would gradually and drastically reduce.",

      "body": "When you win slots and get the jackpot on your first account at the casino, that's where the dealer will give you a win, why do I say this because there is a former slot bookie who leaked this in the media where I live. there are only two wins in slot gambling, the first is because you are given a win by the dealer or become a slot dealer himself. since that's where I understand that gambling machines have been set up for that I always apply a budget where I'm ready to lose in the game. I'm not someone who likes slot games but I also play with other gambling machines in the casino.Some of your tips are veryimportant for beginners because this thread will be valuable for them, for me winning money is not the main goal in playing gambling so it doesn't burden my mind while playing, I always play with fun and seek experience so I don't feel disappointed when I lose and lose money, Luckily I was just a small gambler who only gambled small bets, so betting within a budget I could afford to lose. btw thanks for the suggestions and tips",

Sharing your winnings might not be ideal though, some may not willingly accept your money or this might put you at risk especially in casinos since they might think you hit the jackpot, so I don’t believe on this and you can’t spread your luck so better to focus on your own.",

Many of us do not know this and it takes a serious slot player to check the details many of us play hoping to win and not checking the details.But the best strategy for me although it may not guarantee a win, but it guarantees that you will not go home frustrated is this Quote1. always set a budget for playing slots and stick to it. do not chase losses or try to win back what you have lost by playing more.But overall whatever strategy you employ the most important is you enjoy the game win or lose you are comfortable with it.",
