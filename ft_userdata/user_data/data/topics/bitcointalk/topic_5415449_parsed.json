We have seen that those who consistently work and develop while we are living the bear market are some of the projects that build credibility and audience when everything explodes.We have a great example right here, BitcoinTalk is a truthful site that has brought the crypto community together for over a decade, and it's still growing.Recently I found out about a project that wants to build a community not only for online discussion + interactions but also for IRL events, I hope most of you know the kind of networking you can experience in these kinds of situations. Its name is El Dorado. [Link below]I have been on IRL events during bear and bull cycles, and I can assure you both have always been a great choice. I hope you guys check it out and share some communities with this kind of dynamic.El Dorado Twitter:https://twitter.com/EldoradoMRKT",
