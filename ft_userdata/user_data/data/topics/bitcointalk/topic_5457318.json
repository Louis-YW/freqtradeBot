  "content": "Verifiable Source wallets let you inspect code for flaws, but pre-compiled software lacks a way to verify if it matches the source. Reproducible builds ensure that anyone can recreate identical copies from source code, build environment, and instructions. That's why is important for all wallet users to learn how to build the firmware and verify it before upgrading their wallets.If not possible for you, at least see if there are proofs of others doing that verification. One good place to find those proofs is https://bitcoinbinary.orgThis week on Twitter & Nostr NVK (Coldcard creator) encouraged people to learn how to verify builds. This was a success, a lot of people could learn how to build and verify the Coldcard firmware.From http://thebitcoinhole.com we want to also collaborate. So, we added a new section \"Reproducible Builds\" on our website. There you can find for each wallet if they offer reproducible builds instructions and if there are proofs of verification on http://bitcoinbinary.orgWe encourage all the hardware wallet manufacturers (or anyone interested) to collaborate and automate proofs of verifications on http://bitcoinbinary.org.According to our research: Blockstream Jade, Coldcard, BitBox02, Passport Batch 2, Trezor, KeepKey, SeedSigner, and Specter DIY offers reproducible builds instructions and/or proofs of verification.Remember: #LearnToBuild #donttrustverify",

One good place to find those proofs is https://bitcoinbinary.orgI am not saying bitcoinbinary is bad but in my opinion there is a better website that first started doing this Reproducible builds, and it's called WalletsSrutiny.I think they have bigger base of wallets they tested and they are constantly working on adding new ones, not to mention they received lawsuits for doing this...Bitcoinbinary was created after NVK changed license for ColdCard wallet from open source to CC, because it was not showing reproducible Coldcard on WalletScrutiny website It's different story now:https://walletscrutiny.com/",

      "body": "I know walletscrutiny has more wallets, but sometimes it is not updated. They changed Coldcard to reproducible this week, after NVK started to talk about this topic on Twitter.If I am not wrong, walletscrutiny has two issues:1.They are not verifying all the versions, just one2. AFAIK, We don't have real proof that the verification was executed. We must trust on walletscrutiny.comBitcoinbinary.org fix those two issues:1. They have a bot to run the verification for each version. You can also manually upload a proof of verification.2. The github action with the execution is a proof that it was executed, so we don't need to trust in Bitcoinbinary.org",

We must trust on walletscrutiny.comWell, they show you the script which was run so you can re-do it yourself if you wish so.The whole reason for such sites to exist is that some people are not willing / able to verify builds themselves and want to trust someone to do it for them.Now, my main issue is: this site not only gets donations or is sponsored by a hardware wallet manufacturer, but is directly run by one.Quote from: https://bitcoinbinary.org/Patronage by Coinkitehttps://github.com/coinkite/bitcoinbinary.orgSo this whole thing is a charade. I see no logical reason to run a site that on first sight seems just slightly tied / sponsored by CoinKite / ColdCard, while being actually run by them, instead of just posting reproducibility instructions on the actual wallet's GitHub page and calling it a day.Something like: https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/passport2/blob/main/REPRODUCIBILITY.md",

This site is operated by them. For one, that is not obviously clear, it looks more like it's just sponsored by them.And secondly, I simply don't see the reason to make a website that shows their stuff is reproducible if they already have it on their wallet's GitHub page.Maybe I can't put it into words well.

I would agree with you if BitcoinBinary only showed reproducibility information about Coldcard. But that's not the case. They show the same information about other open-source and reproducible wallet builds. Bitcoin Core is there, so is Wasabi, Blockstream, Sparrow, etc. That's why it's not only a website to show their software, but it's a part of it.Let's put it this way. Imagine if I was the CEO of Trezor, and for some reason I wanted to run a website discussing and highlighting open-source hardware wallets produced and/or assembled in the EU. There is a list of every single brand except for Trezor, which is headquartered in the Czech Republic and thus belongs on the list. You would not find that weird? I would.",
