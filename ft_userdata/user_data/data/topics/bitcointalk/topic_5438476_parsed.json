For example, take a look at this access being asked from the Go keyboard.Your Phone's OEM would typically not allow some changes on your phone because of security vulnerabilities, but not a jailbroken smartphone, if you want to peacefully use a hot wallet on your phone abstain from bootloader unlocking or rooting your phone.",

It works on any kind of phone and not just jailbroken ones.That's why phishing links are so rampant. They can easily be made to work on any platform, by collecting the user agent and serving a different file for each one.",

So i expect those who can and willing to do it should already know the risk.Currently, there are many Android smartphone manufacturers that provide tight security on the bootloader system for their smartphone devices. This is done so that ordinary users find it more difficult to root and unlock the bootloader without having developer skills. This is also done to improve the security and stability of the device, but also limits the freedom of users to modify their device.All android devices from various smartphone manufacturers have their own community which is active and available to help root and unlock bootloader. it is advisable to do some research and ensure that you understand the risks and consequences associated with this process before starting. root and unlock bootloader are only intended for those who want to do android system development, after all Android is Open-Source, Unlike iOS which uses closed Source.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on February 07, 2023, 10:15:23 AMQuote from: Crypt0Gore on February 07, 2023, 09:12:22 AMThis will neutralize all the security features of the OS that comes with your phoneYou're exaggerating. Unlocking bootloader mostly weaken security related with boot process and other attack where attacker have physical access to your android smartphone.It's quite dangerous if the bootloader lock is unlocked. Some malware will enter easily when there are no security-protecting system files on Android. I often unlock the bootloader on various smartphones. Data security on Android smartphones will be more at risk",

So it's too risky if you are going to unlock the bootloader because some apps can do whatever they want to do with your phone.And about the Go keyboard, they actually record the text you type most of the guides out there using it as a keylogger. And sometimes some systems become corrupted due to bugs and malware that can turn your device into hardbrick you can fix this hardbrick but the problem is if you are using Qualcomm devices it needs to use a Jtag to be able to recover it from hardbrick only professional tech have this Jtag box. Samsung phones also disable Knox protection if you unlocked the bootloader I never unlocked my phone because most of my exchange apps and wallet are in my phone. Only unlocked bootloader if you want to do some experiment or test something just make sure don't use it to any sensitive data.",

It has been known for a long time that Go Keyboard is a Keyboard replacement app that collects user data. This finding was revealed by Adguard as a security company, Go Keyboard collects sensitive information including emails associated with Google accounts, type of android and more.Also, there are some plugins that are automatically downloaded, and these act as adware that will give a lot of ads typed using Go Keyboard.

Some of the methods used to deal with hardbrick android devices vary depending on the type of smartphone used.But in general using Jtag Box or similar tools can be very useful.The hardbrick that occurs makes the system unable to enter fastboot mode and recovery mode or download mode.The device will only be stuck in Qualcomm USB900e mode and cannot be executed.But for now, Knox protection on Samsung is quite difficult to break. Tried to do it on a samsung galaxy note 8 but always failed.",

Some malware will enter easily when there are no security-protecting system files on Android. It's been so long that I don't recall how to unlock my bootloader and flash a custom ROM on my phone, but I don't recall hearing of any malware that uses an unlocked bootloader to attack its users. Can you share some links about it? The latest malware news usually mentions installing fake apps, so it's more like phishing attacks instead of malware attacks, and I doubt most of them are done on an unlocked phone or custom ROM. Some vulnerabilities in the news are related to accessing some sensitive storage that is crucial for the firmware/phone to run correctly[1], and it requires some effort. If it was successfully exploited though, I can see installing a malicious system or app is way easier than ever. Some malware doesn't even need an unlocked bootloader to continuously infect a phone according to this research[2]. Luckily it is mostly older phones/system that is vulnerable to those attacks, but there is no harm in being cautious of similar attack vectors. CMIIW.I'm still seeing Go Keyboard on Google Playstore, is this a different app or Google is just too lazy to remove them if the report is credible? I also believe that these keylogging activities are possible even if your phone bootloader is still locked.[1] https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/09/06/fur-flies-over-android-bootloader-flaws-heres-what-you-need-to-know/[2] https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/04/19/months-of-research-finally-crack-android-malware-that-could-even-survive-factory-resets/",

Jailbreaking and rooting gives complete access so we on our own so if we know what should be done and not then it can be useful and if not just rely on the stock itself but even with stock we can't expect 100% security and we do still can find lot of malwares on playstore itself and they remove it only after receving enough reports.",
