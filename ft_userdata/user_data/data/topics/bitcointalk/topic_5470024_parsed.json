If you initiate a session, start sparrow and then close ssh, it will close sparrow too. So we will use the \"screen\" command. If it is not installed, run:Code:sudo apt install screenSteps:Run screen command:Code:screenNavigate to the path mentioned above (\"/opt/sparrow/bin\") and run Sparrow.Code:./SparrowIt will load the following screen:Insert the preferences tab and go to server:Then choose the option you desire for the node to which you wish Sparrow to be connected. Personally I run Sparrow on the same linux device as my node, so it looks like this:Then head back to the wallets tab and click on it:Click on \"Create wallet\":Go to the \"Deposit\" tab:It will give you an address where you can send your funds:Go to the UTXO tab and click on \"Mix Selected\"Once the process goes further, head back to \"Postmix\" tab: There, you will be presented with your UTXOsFinal StepsClick: Code:Ctrl-A Ctrl-Dthis will get you out of the Sparrow app and it will leave it running on the background.Whenever you decide, you can enter Code:screen -rSparrow will be presented to you exactly where you left it and you can enjoy your free mixes.",

I was pretty taken aback when I first installed Sparrow at just how easy it was to connect to my own node on the same device. Literally one click on the button which says \"Bitcoin Core\" in Sparrow and it was done. It's a little bit more involve to connect it to your Electrum server or a node/server on a different machine, but I've still gone through those processes several times with different machines and OSs without ever having too much trouble.",

Or do you just use Dojo for Sentinel?Currently my mobile experience with Bitcoin is: Sentinel  I have some addresses in Sentinel and I use them to receive funds (on the go). Those are addresses from my cold storage wallet. I could also monitor the XPUB of course, but I didn't want to. I only have 10 - 20 addresses ready to be deployed in case I need to receive funds.Zeus I use Zeus to connect to LND node (CLN is also available of course). I like Zeus because it is mandatory to connect to own node in order to use it, so it helped me privacy-wise. Also the main dev is very approachable and we had a small conversation once (not too technical). The main reason why I use it is for LN transactions. I don't manage my channels with it. I have tried Samourai and I have used it for a while (connected to my Dojo). I liked it very much, but for several reasons I don't want to have an on-chain bitcoin wallet on my phone.In general, when \"on the go\", I need to have super minimal functionalities. I try to minimalise most of my everyday clutter (I hope this word makes sense here). I only need to pay fast or receive fast. I can pay fast with LN and receive fast both on-chain and on LN. So my set-up is very convenient so far. Of course being connected to my node is a must for me.",

I created a hot wallet in Samourai with the Whirlpool Accounts enabled. I sent some sats and it made some coinjoins. So, I had 3 UTXOs in my Postmix account with some mixing rounds each (3, 5, 6 respectively).Then I created a hot wallet in Sparrow with the same seed phrase. Indeed there were 3 UTXOs in Postmix, so I pressed \"Start Mixing\" and it started all over again. Now, my UTXOs have more mixes (4,5,7 respectively).So, this workaround worked, but the original approach you mentioned didn't work for me.",

The exact same thing can happen with Wasabi mixes (which you are obviously here to shill) without proper coin control practices. I followed all of the txs you mentioned and you're right. They are linked to each other via a peeling chain but that doesn't mean that the common ownership heuristic doesn't apply to Wasabi txs after they get mixed. Not using adequate coin control practices can absolutely result in txs being linked together but that has nothing to do with Whirlpool specifically. I am not spreading FUD, address clusters from common input ownership and peeling chains from leftover change ARE unique to Whirlpool coinjoins.  You are spreading FUD about Wasabi's coinjoins because common input ownership is not revealed, and peeling chains are not produced (unless you are a whale with more coins than all the other participants), and there is no coin control necessary.  Anyone can verify this is FUD by simply looking at the Bitcoin blockchain:Quote from: Kruw on October 15, 2023, 05:49:01 PMZoom out to see Wasabi's coinjoin of the week!  This behemoth transaction contains 23 BTC - https://mempool.space/tx/927a4d5f3e17faae611f623eaf06206b966b30ba1bacbec49d7ab35afa50dbcaBitcoin is divisible.
