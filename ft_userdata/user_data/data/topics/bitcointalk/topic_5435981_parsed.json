Em get why you You talk well, oyah see this Forum now as example. When it comes to quality contributions you dey see say Nigerians are among the top users and that's why we're heavily been merited and easily get accepted into campaign. Visit Bitcoin discussion board and you see our brothers over there doing the best they can, in giving Nigerian the best image to the extent e dey pepper some people. Niggas are hustling day in day out just to put bread on the table at the same time trying to get some knowledge about this new heaven (Bitcoin) saving many life.I see no reason why you go dey bad belle wetin mehn dey try put in place. Always spread good things about the country. I know say na bad news dey sell pass but be different, it does pay off. Everybody get their own struggle no be our own bad pass so make we dey go easy on the country. One day we go celebrate good governance as others dey celebrate and then we go come realize the beauti I'd this country called Nigeria.",

Yes naija Dey bad in terms of many things most importantly good governance but this one no mean say we go Dey bad mouth everything about we country. The worst one be say once outside ask anything we Dey very quick to spoil Nigeria name and this don affect how other country people Dey take look us. You see this Lagos wey u say nothing dem am, visit some African and South American cities you go know say haven to some people be this. For health matter I still think say dem get some good health facilities but na lack of maintenance na be the main issue. You come talk again say nothing concern common man with good road, make I ask you question which way common man go follow go sell or buy him produce or even go hospital wey u Dey talk about.  See we all know say things no soft like the way we want am but damaging naija image no fit ever solve the issue.",

They were used to the suffering, they were born in it and understood whips and grain as punishment and reward. I can say the same is for us, if there is 24hr power supply for two days straight in some parts right now, I guarantee there will be a level of unrest among its residents because they do not understand or experienced having electricity for over 10 hours in a day.",

The mata tires me, the only thing some Nigerians see about this great country is the bad side of the coin, I too love this country to the point that, any time am discussing with some people they believe I have linked to the government simply because of the way I take my time to analyze every government steps and policy with a positive mindset on how the policy could be beneficial to the citizens. Even though others may be criticizing the policy I will try to make them understand the importance of such government policy. This country is a great country and I am proud to be a Nigerian anytime any where supporting the government in the best possible way to make the country become the better country I dream of,  make we dey try to promote our own because another person no ggoesdo ammm for us.",

No citizen in his right sound mind would want to speak bad of his/her country so when a citizen's does so, check well, there's a reason propelling such act.",
