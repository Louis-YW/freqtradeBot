I have 2000 euros to spend in GPU and 3Kw free energy from home photovoltaic. Thanks in advance to whom would like to propose some solutions =)",

After the end of ethereum mining, the profit of RX 470 4 GB and 6600 will be the same on many algorithms, so he better not take new video cards now.

I can pay less for a GPU and use the free electricity on other algorithms getting paid in satoshi on nicehash...it is a way to stack sats with free energy and sounds me not bad...",

And then look for sellers who sell them for a cheap price.I hope that this is your daily free power source.",
