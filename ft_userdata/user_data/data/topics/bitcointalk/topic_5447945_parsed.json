Like I use exchanges, I don't open account and make deposit if my account does not have KYC successful verification. If I deposit and KYC fails, I will feel panic as I can lose my coins if my second, third KYCs and after all fail.It is common when casino requests KYC after a player wins big and submit a withdrawal request.Why did your friend KYC fail? Your friend can resubmit it with photo taken under better light, natural day light and best to avoid taking photo for your KYC at night.",

Regarding this last point, if they are not able to confirm KYC it should be clearly stated why and what is wrong just to fix the issue... however I will pay attention to provide documents, if you're not really sure of their reputation.  Most of the times casino's are using a third party vendor so it's something possible the issue is not linked directly to them.",

Can you consider such a casino a scam?It’s customary to read the casino ToS and head over the AML policy to determine whether they will ask KYC at some point or not but mostly casino that have an e-gaming license such as Curacao will surely require you to undergo KYC for that amount of profit.I try to passed KYC before on Duelbits and they keep rejecting my documents for 10ths times despite I’m passing a clear picture. I contact the support and they suggest me to submit other ID that works. You should try different ID or ask directly the support on the reason for the rejection of the ID because there might be a problem on the documents you are submitting while your judgement is being blocked by your suspicions towards the casino.Casino is scam if they didn’t provide the reason for rejecting your ID or if they are not willing to cooperate for solving the issue.",

There are some times the scanned documents are not clear for the casino to see. Or network break down, so if any of those things are occurred then it is not a scam, you just have to resend them back. But if those things are alright and the casino refused to pay or blocked you then it is a scam.

Check for the terms which you have agreed when you engage into their platform. It should be on the TOS; if KYC is rewuired on their platform to do function, then you have no other choice but to comply. But if changes on their policies were implemented in the middle of that casino's service to their players, and without any formal indtroduction and explanationof the changes, then I guess you can already acuse them as fraud especially if they refuse to release your funds because of the changes made. Problem is, tagging them red would do what? If a platform is unregistered, then youd worry nothing if anything happen with your fund because you guys may sue them. But if not, then it will just be a \"lesson learned\" @the end of the day.",

Can you consider such a casino a scam?Actually, before using the casino you can read the Tos that is already in the casino whether they require KYC or not while you are playing there.If indeed in the Tos there is no previous KYC information then this action is not a fraud because after you send KYC they will pay and approve your withdrawal.From this problem I have the conclusion that a casino can be considered fraudulent if after providing KYC they don't pay you or don't approve the withdrawal you made.I have heard of cases like this happening in casinos and many gamblers either regret it or are a bit disappointed with them.",

And you now manage to process with the verification and they failed to pass you? Can you consider such a casino a scam?First we have many instances to consider before we call the scam if they failed to verify your account after providing them with all the necessary KYC documents such instances are as follow. 1: when the information on your account is same with your documents such as Name and country of residents and the casino deliberately deny you Success in the verification processes. 2: if you provide your kyc information and documents but the casino failed to respond to them and there after ban your account, that way also you can call the casino scam Quote from: KiaKia on April 07, 2023, 02:38:54 PMAlso, magine you get attracted to an online casino because of the bonuses they offer and you open an account and make your first deposit then you didn't receive the promised bonus, is this an act of scam or not?

If you follow all the bonus rules and yet are denied a bonus, you may call them a scam but then most casinos already have a clus included in their bonus terms and conditions that they have the sole right to deny anyone the bonus without any legal implication for them, so with that, the casino already got themselves covered (and may win over the player if such claims arise.  So it all balls down to one fact which is, to make sure to read terms and conditions very well before you try to claim bonuses and on the KYC issues always try to read the case terms of operations before subscribing to play them.",

There are no options here:1 - if you want to receive money, you will have to fulfill the conditions of the casino.2 - if you want to keep your privacy - you will have to give up money.All power over the situation at the moment is in the hands of the casino. As they want to do, so be it. Therefore, they may not give you prize money under one pretext or another. For some reason, everyone considers the casino a good friend who will gladly share a deposit with you. This is absolutely not true. On the contrary, the casino is the worst enemy, ready to extract money from you in any way.They promise a bonus and don't accrue - this is an act of deception. You should immediately run away from such a casino. If they cheat even on such trifles, then you will never see the prize money.You can only sympathize with your friend. Let him try to discuss his problem with the support of the casino. If they don't go to meet him, then he will probably not receive the prize money.",

And you now manage to process with the verification and they failed to pass you? Can you consider such a casino a scam?KYC is not something wrong to be asked. Sometime the casino needs to comply with the regulation too. You should not think that any casino must be fully anonymous. There will be a need to double-check why your KYC failed. It's not good to judge it just because your KYC failed for the first time. If you have been doing verification a few times but it keeps being rejected by casino and there must be something that needs to worry about the casino. Quote from: https://sumsub.com/gambling/Under Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, gambling companies must conduct KYC to ensure that their customers are trusted individuals with a verified identity. The KYC format varies from country to country. Some regulators may consider automated biometric checks of online gamblers, as is done in the UK.Quote from: KiaKia on April 07, 2023, 02:38:54 PMAlso, imagine you get attracted to an online casino because of the bonuses they offer and you open an account and make your first deposit then you didn't receive the promised bonus, is this an act of scam or not?

The problem is people must not even read the requirements to be able to withdraw the bonus.",

Well, I would very well much expect a casino to KYC me after trying to withdraw a large amount of money. They obviously do not do this for every single account because checking KYC documents take time, personnel and money. And they have to adhere to the regulation laws if they have a legitimate license. Any other casino that does not do this would seem shady to me.As far as to your question of a failed KYC, either it was a human error and you should try to talk things out with them or the KYC you gave them is faulty/wrong in some other way. The best thing to do is to read the terms and conditions of that casino before putting your funds in their wallet.",
