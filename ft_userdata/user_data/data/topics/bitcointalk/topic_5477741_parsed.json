Which wallet is the best to safeguard my funds and ward off con artists and hackers?1. Bitcoin transaction itself is irreversible so you can consider a transaction with 1 confirmation as funds received.2. Bitcoin transactions and their fees are based on the weight not on the value of your transaction which depends on the number of inputs/UTXO and number of outputs and what kind of address like legacy, Segwit, Taproot. You may get better understanding if you read the reply I quoted.Quote from: Charles-Tim on October 16, 2023, 11:11:42 AMLegacy addresses starts from 1Nested segwit starts from 3 (although not only nested segwit starts from 3)Segwit version 0 starts from bc1qSegwit version 1 starts from bc1p (pay-to-taproot)This is the formula necessary for the calculation:Formula:For legacy address: vbyte= Input*148 + output*34 + 10 plus or minus inputFor nested segwit: vbyte= Input*93 + output*32 + 10 plus or minus inputFor segwit version 0: vbyte= Input*68 + output*31 + 10 plus or minus inputFor pay-to-taproot: vbyte= Input*57.5 + output*43 + 10 plus or minus inputTo know more about the input and output virtual size: https://bitcoinops.org/en/tools/calc-size/To know more about the transaction virtual size: https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-transaction-size-calculator/For mempool (beginners): https://mempool.space/Mempool for advanced users: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),24h,weight3.

Which wallet is the best to safeguard my funds and ward off con artists and hackers?There are hardware and software wallets that can provide you with the level of security that you require to safeguard your bitcoins. Its usage will come down to personal preferences. Because I am a big fan of convenience and how easily a wallet can be used by anyone, I favor software wallets. And then, if you want a bit of extra security, you can set up a multisig wallet despite its initial complexity in setting up. Other things to ensure extra measures of security include regular software wallet updates, the use of strong passwords, and backing up your seed phrase.",

Which wallet is the best to safeguard my funds and ward off con artists and hackers?You've been been generously informed about how to access the Bitcoin Blockchain and preferable wallet to use, so it's left for you to open the links that have been shared and increase your knowledge. I'll just tell you that  Bitcoin, is an alternative means of payment and your clients needs to have Bitcoin, wallets too, before you can comence transactions. You have to consider Bitcoin, transaction fees, it sometimes gets very high, like we experienced lately, this is because of the congestion in the mempool. So who bears the high fees, is it you or your clients? There's alternative of lightening network, but you'll have to master it's complexities. Also transactions can delay sometimes, and what if you need to confirm payment on time? This are some of the things that you also need to consider before fully adopting Bitcoin, as a means of payment. Bitcoin, payment however guarantees privacy between you and your clients, no third parties involved, because it is a decentralized digital currency.",

But, for your security, I would like to elaborate on what you should not do as a Bitcoin user. 1. Never store your Bitcoin on online accounts. No matter what platform it is. It could be exchanges, casinos, or whatever. They do not give you a private key to your Bitcoin. There is a famous quote. Not your keys, not your coins. 2. Never share your private key with anyone; never store it online. Most new Bitcoin users keep their private keys online in storage, such as Google Drive. 3. Never install any wallet software without a verification. Always download the wallet software from the official source. For the Electrum wallet, manually type the address on your browser address bar. The website is electrum.org 4. Do not fall for phishing websites. Always double-check the URL before you input any credentials.",

This is  best place for providing services with Bitcoin as a payment option. it's fantastic to hear  that you are considering Bitcoin as a payment option for your services. Here are some tips to optimize your Bitcoin transactions and ensure security:As you already given reply that minimum one confirmation is enough for verification of payment and you can provide services without delay once you found that one confirmation showing in btc explorer.  transaction confirmation time, transaction fees and status of blockchain network congestion are  are generally used for measuring Bitcoin transactions. Keep an eye on confirmation times to know about transaction speed.You ask about wallet so if you intend to provide service for long term then don't believe on software wallet as you can loss because your private key stores online. Use a hardware wallet for the highest level of security. Popular choices include Ledger and Trezor. These wallets store your private keys offline which minimize the hacking risk.

Once you make a transaction from your bitcoin Wallet its irreversible, you need to make sure that you are sending to the right receiver, check the address very well before pushing the send tab in your wallet.2. Saying measuring transaction I am guessing transaction fee? Is this is correct then you can use mempool.space to check the minimum transaction fee you can use and if you want the faster speed you need to use the highest transaction fee on mempool.3. I still believe that hardware wallet is the most secured crypto wallet, go with hardware wallets that are fully open-source and also air gapped, no internet connection means they are completely offline which is exactly what anyone should need.",

Which wallet is the best to safeguard my funds and ward off con artists and hackers?This is already a good idea since for announcing that you are open to receive bitcoin as payment method of your service then you can attract a lot of clients which is using cryptocurrency. For sure there's a lot more benefits you can get with it especially if you increase up your knowledge and understanding regarding on bitcoin investment.Also you don't need any technical tools to use since simply sending the funds on your personal wallet is really enough to make our transaction successful but make sure you check your receiving address before dealing with client so that no issue will happen.Use Mempool or Coingecko also you can try to check blockchair or other blockchain tools.The safest thing you could do to make your wallet safe from hackers and scammers is always check anything people sent to you and if they say download this because it has something then don't do it especially if you are not familiar with the link since this is how phising attack will happen or worse they stole your wallet credentials. Also don't find those to good to true offers as interesting matter since it always a scam so avoid any large return offer since its totally not true.",

How can the transaction process be optimized for maximum security?Never share your seed phrase or recovery key with the client, ask the client to send funds directly to your wallet address, because many clients try to oversmart and will say give me your seed phrase so I can top up directly in it. That's why don't listen to this excuse and if you think they might scam you, then you can use smart contract feature which will make your trade more smooth.Quote from: Omahabit on December 13, 2023, 04:01:27 PM2. What metrics are available for measuring transactions?You can measure a transaction by transaction fee, the confirmation remains, and confirmation completed, and how much time remaining confirmations will take, etc. are some measurements that you can use to measure the transaction but these data can be seen using the respective explorer, and to for better understanding you must have a little idea about explorers. For BTC you can use meme. space but there are many other platforms that you can also use just type BTC explorers. Quote from: Omahabit on December 13, 2023, 04:01:27 PM3.

And if you are hodling large amounts of bitcoin, it is recommended you buy hardware wallets for storage. Always make sure to buy direct from the official website or company. Lastly, store your seed phrases properly and keep them offline. Writing your seed phrase on paper and backing it up in different locations is one way to secure your coins.
