If you try and withdraw these funds and give me 700 dollars and 300 dollars will be yours.*And than I tried and his wallet had more than 1000 dollars and I was very happy let's try and withdraw. And when I tried to withdraw USDT. And they were in Trc20. And I deposited trc of almaot 50 and these trx were gone. And when I checked where my TRX. there were many transactions and he was making a lot of Money Multisig. And that was not a big scam but some users were sending almost 20 to 30 dollars worth of trx and Their Tron coins were gone.",

The more times you have to sign, the more it should make you question who is going to receive those funds, in exchange for what.You should not be using multisig addresses when you are the only person who is going to sign from them. That's not what multisig is designed for.And this should go without saying, that you should not reply to random strangers on Telegram (or any other platform) who ask you for money.",

He then messages random people claiming he can't withdraw the USDT and offers to share the spoilts if they help him withdraw.They will then share the private key with the victims. Victim imports the address, checks the balance and gets so excited but can't send out the USDT minus some TRON tokens. As soon as the victim deposits the TRON tokens, they get spent immediately by the scammer.So the scammers keeps collecting TRON from different victims",

Never trust strangers, crypto investors are targeted by hackers daily in various ways to scam them, and the way the hacker did with you is to send recovery phrases or the private key of the wallet until you open it and when you find a lot of USDT on it, you deposit TRX fees so that you can withdraw that money, and in the end, you cannot withdraw that USDT and lose all fees that are transferred to the scammerâ€™s wallet. This is indeed an old deception method, but there are many who do not know it, so we have to be more careful.",

      "body": "Oh, wow . it's definitely not a good idea to trust someone who randomly messages you with an offer like that, especially when it involves giving them access to your funds. That is mean possible that the person was telling the truth about having $1000 in their wallet, but it's also possible that it was all a setup to scam you out of your own money.Important to be really careful when dealing with cryptocurrency, and to thoroughly research any opportunities before getting involved. I think ,it's also a good idea to be cautious about who you trust in online groups and communities, since there are unfortunately a lot of scammers out there who are looking for easy targets.",

      "body": "Important, scammers often use this tactic to trick people into sending them money or revealing sensitive information. If I look in your case, the scammer made you believe that you could withdraw the funds by depositing some TRX (Tron) tokens first right?. However, once you sent the TRX, the scammer used multisig transactions to move the funds to other addresses, essentially stealing your tokens. I have some point to you. If someone contacts you with an offer that seems too good to be true, it probably is. Always be skeptical of unsolicited offers, especially those involving money. Before engaging with anyone on Telegram or other messaging platforms, try to verify their identity and reputation. If you're unsure about a particular offer, do some research online. Look for reviews, testimonials, or news articles that might provide more information about the situation.",
