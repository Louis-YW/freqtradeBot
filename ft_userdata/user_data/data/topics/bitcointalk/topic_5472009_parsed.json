XRP is a dead shitcoin and will stay dead… This coin was supposed to change banking and it did nothing but being another vehicle for the pump and dumpers. If you are looking for a coin that really delivered its promise, don’t look further, btc has been here for years. Xrp is not even a crypto. It is a premined security. I can’t believe why the SEC haven’t shut it down yet. “Investing” in xrp is like throwing your money away. Only the xrp founders benefit because their initial cost for their shares is zero.

I guess its safe to say xrp has their own style. Its keeping tabs on the active community for each coins. Most users prefer the eth community tokens which under their erc20 tokens but some also like the flexibility of xrp airdrops. Not an xrp fan but most tokens there related got some good profits too. This is as per my friend who are fond of xrp ecosystem.",

Thanks!It is a good thing to hear but unfortunately, my country is not eligible for the said airdrop. However, it was a good idea for the team/developers to compensate the people who stayed and kept supporting them despite the long battling issue with the SEC. I believe this will change the views of many individuals who thought that XRP was useless and nothing. It is a great step for XRP but I'm not sure if this will help to grow their price or remain of being controlled and kept low.",

A raffle should not be construed as an airdrop. Anyway, even it is just a raffle, we should welcome it with open arms. Sadly, those who are not in USA are not eligible for the said promotion. Maybe one should tell Uphold to also include those in countries they are doing business outside of the continental USA. I am a good believer in the future of XRP and that they will eventually win the case they are fighting in court.",

Thanks!If for Uphold users and US citizens I think it is not fair for me who is in Southeast Asia, I am one of the holders of the old XRP but has no opportunity where they hold events like this.I am quite sad with a policy that seems to be specializing in certain areas to receive the prize, I think the developer is unfair with the very large US outside community, if that is true I am very disappointed with this policy.I only hope that XRP developers can provide opportunities to other holders outside the US to get the opportunity to attend events like this.",

Thanks!Frankly, I'm nonchalant about XRP; even from its days of Ripple. I feel that XRP is hyped for nothing. As far back in 2017, the way it got do many backings from various institutions one would think it would fly over the roof by now. So disappointing. I know many will argue that the court cases with SEC delayed its growth but I don't think so. What happened after it got a favourable judgment? Did it fly? No.Come to think of it, what's the worth of 20,000 XRP in dollar? Almost nothing, that it should even trigger interest.",

Sometimes when investing in altcoins you don't need to prolong the investment, because of how the market we turn, its obvious and its understanding that cryptocurrency market have to with time factor during its investment, so I believe that we have to take our time very well to looked at the coins that can overcome bearish season before we purchase, having in mind that they will soon be a bullish in 2025, we are not really sure of it, it maybe that this October and November increment in market might be the bullrun we shall experience ahead 2025, because information is what triggers the market accelerations.",

Some of these could be the kind of exchange they will list and their listing prices always get them attractive were they will easily fall so quickly, to be at the safer side I am always stick to those coin with good reputation than jumping into shitcoin I knows nothing about them.",

You know airdrops right now. They have changed. They are not really the airdrop that we used to know in the past who are completely free and easy to participate with. About the catch, there is really. You already said it in-fact. That was the trading part. It only allurs existing users (not the new one's) to trade XRP more evenly.",

Most airdrops do actually waste our time and resources and at the end of the day, there's particularly no solid profits that's generated, rather we become more terrified by the crypto projects that we've planned for and achieving nothing when its time to reap our profits.
