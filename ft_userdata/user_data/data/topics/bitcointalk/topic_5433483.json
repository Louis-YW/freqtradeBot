Its founder, Craig Wright (referred to as Faketoshi by many because he claims he is Satoshi but cannot provide evidence for this -and yet he wishes to patent Bitcoin for himself) has also been accused of multiple wrongdoings. He has gone to court over this issue and is now not taken seriously by the crypto community. I would avoid Bitcoin SV and buy the real Bitcoin instead.You really should be extensively careful of where you decide to put your money. You can ask around in the community and you will not find many people who understand or endorse Bitcoin SV.It is rumored that the Bitcoin SV blockchain has neferious back-doors to freeze/steal your money from you out of your own wallet.If you ask me, Faketoshi definitely deserves his title of fraudster.",

BSV have been very public in their release of software which allows CSW and his buddies to simply confiscate and take control of any coins they wish from any address in existence. There is a good summary of it here: https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoin-sv-hardfork-significant-security-risks/If you spend any money on BSV, expect to lose it all through either price collapse or outright theft. You should also exercise extreme caution when using any centralized exchange or service which also supports BSV. If CSW suddenly decides to confiscate all the BSV in an exchange's wallet, then that exchange could very quickly run in to liquidity issues and end up insolvent, taking all your deposits of other coins with them.",

The dude is a scammer who claims to be satoshi nakamoto but obviously he is a liar. That's because if he was satoshi nakamoto, he would have posted a signed message from a satoshi block/address.Since he can't do that, he isn't satoshi nakamoto.The coin itself is useless too. Nobody uses it, nobody trades it. It died long time ago and nobody cares.",

I don't know if it's done by him purposefully or he is being carried away by his claim to be Satoshi. He contradicted Satoshi whom he claims to be so many times. In some cases it leads to him deleting his posts when he discovers he deed so bad in imitating Satoshi. What surprises me most is how he manages to have debatable cases about bitcoin ownership and why he is still so relevant and being Satoshi to some people.",
