      "body": "It seems sportsbet io is trying out a new way of catering bets. I personally haven't really tried telegram betting since I enjoyed the website based betting where I can see more information and can be done by just mouse clicks. Maybe people who will use this are the one who really like the given features like copy bets and comments. I just hope that this announcement thread is improved, I doubled check the one who posted and I thought is a copy cat because of the format of the thread. A ANN thread that has images would look better in my own opinion. Quote from: sportsbet.io on December 08, 2022, 01:20:06 PM> Take part in exclusive promotions and competitions you won’t get anywhere else  Does this means there will be a match that is exclusive on telegram betting and will not appear on the casino website?",

Probably going to use this in future when on my phone so I don't need to login to Sportsbet.Linking the account went smooth, didn't even need to leave the bot page. Only issue now is seems the betting currency's just in USDT, which I'm just about all out of. Wen BTC?Any way to share bets already made/settled for some bragging action?",

Shows up as normal to me.Might want to send @sportsbet.io a screenshot of what the issue is so he can check it out so to have the right staff to resolve it for you since it is a new system they had setup within the first 24 hours of operation.I am sure he will be glad to help you out as it assists with it's progress for any updates needed.Liking the idea of using a betting bot as I had used one with a giftcard exchange service for cryptocurrencies and it made everything so seemless and fast to get things done exactly as one would want it to be.Will be definitely be using it for my first use later on today for the World Cup match between Argentina vs Netherlands.Thank you Sportsbet.io for offering another option so we can place bets on a huge messaging platform such as telegram.",
