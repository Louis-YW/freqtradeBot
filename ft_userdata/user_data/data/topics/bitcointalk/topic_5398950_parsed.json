The algorithms bitcoin uses are not exclusive to bitcoin, you can search elliptic curve encryption and even the documentation for the encryption system bitcoin uses and have them presented to you in your preferred format (the same can also be said for hashing algorithms).In case it gets mentioned here or stems from this topic, the problem with Luna was always going to be around and will persist for some time as there are issues with doing things like maintaining a peg to the dollar while being decentralised - because how do you get your price for what a dollar is worth (to match your stablecoin) without adding some level of centralisation.",

You can't force non-technical people/users have to comprehend fully the technical aspect of Bitcoin. Each are having a speciality in its own way, although the foundation of Bitcoin within its code, we know that Bitcoin doesn't merely exist without other specializations like the economy, game theory, etc.And I don't see there is any urgency that the Bitcoin ecosystem has a lack of developers. If you see the Bitcoin source code contributions graph[1], I don't think there is a significant decline in that. Bear in mind that this is just the Bitcoin repository, there are also a ton of other developers that help to build the ecosystem(Wallet, Payment system/gateway, LN, one-click-node, etc).Regarding the technical support, you can see here that the technical support/discussion board are still actively being discussed. And there is the Bitcoin Stack Exchange. And Other people do discuss bitcoin on social media like Twitter. Some people don't require an in-depth technical comprehension to offer help, some can offer solutions along the way from their own experiences.

You can't expect everyone to start coding wallets for themselves, just like you can't expect everyone to code game, code messaging app, code operating systems, etc. Majority of the people will always be the consumers and it is perfectly okay. In fact, it is good for Bitcoin. Bigger the consumer base, more align the developers will be to do innovation in Bitcoin and create new apps. Also, the technical knowledge about Bitcoin is widely available on the internet. You can easily understand Bitcoin from core-to-top with the online resources free of cost. The main reason why I think people aren't very interested in Bitcoin development these days is the relative benefit in altcoins. Learning to develop dApps on alternate blockchains is relatively easier and people are making millions developing shitty protocols and projects. Money drives the folk after all.",

You can explain to them in simple theoretical and philosophical terms that it is very important to self-custody coins or that running your own full node provides you self-sufficiency, independence, and sovereignty and brings up positive emotions, but the technical, a low-level, aspect of these things might still be very challenging for them to understand, let alone to master skills necessary for day-to-day usage. Possessing no technical skills, common people still keep finding bitcoin an interesting technology because it has many faces and related non-technical disciplines, which in itself allows people of any occupations and specialties to join and find a place where these people can speak on their level.",

I agree, banks actually do serve somewhat of a purpose. I do believe they could be implemented better, and shouldn't be offering interest rates or gambling your money away. Although, I will openly admit that managing a large amount of money comes with massive amounts of responsibility. Banks have the manpower, experts, and money to be able to invest into that, and therefore provide a simple way of managing your money. When you are your bank, that changes. Ultimately, as much as I don't like third parties managing my money, and I would prefer to do it myself. Quite simply, that is never going to be for everyone. Some people like the safety net that banks provide.

However, and I do believe this is one of the issues we must overcome. Bitcoin in its current state is too complex for these types of people who don't want to learn about it. The fact is; with Bitcoin you're usually in control of your keys, therefore you're responsible for them. To be able to do that you not only need to know how Bitcoin works, but you should have a decent grasp of security practices. Otherwise, you could be unknowingly be putting yourself at risk. This is exactly why Bitcoin currently isn't for everyone, and that's okay. I don't know if we are ever going to get to the stage where it'll be simple enough. However, we've come along way with documentation, software, and hardware wallets propelled us further even further into achieving it.",

Bitcoin is another modern internet currency that many people have never used before, and as a first-time user, you may encounter challenges.So apart from the options you've listed above, they actually require a techy person to handle them, but if you're a fast learner, I don't see anything stopping you from learning them. If you try to explain the UTXO model to a newbie, they may find it difficult at first, but did you know that your bank account also runs its own model based on the balance model, but banks won't tell you this because they manage things for you, whereas in bitcoin, you manage it your self.",

Arithmetic and coding technical people, please correct me if I am wrong here, but my point is simply that laymen can actually do away with deep technicalities. Leave the technicalities to the technical people. It is sufficient for us to know what they mean, what they stand for. This does not mean to say that we should be contented with what's theoretical as opposed to what's technical. As a matter of fact, what laymen know is not really theoretical; they're factual. They're interpretations of the codes and mathematical formulae. What this means is that people don't have to read codes and understand complex mathematical formulae in order to understand Bitcoin.",
