If the game ends at full time/90 minutes or in extra time I receive zero points. If the correct score at full time was not 6-6 I receive zero points. If there were 2 yellow cards at full time / 90 minutes I receive 2 points. If there were zero red cards at  full time / 90 minutes I receive 1 point. With all the points counted, I am on 3 points.At the end of the count, if you have more points than any other entrant you will win $25 courtesy of Utopia.
