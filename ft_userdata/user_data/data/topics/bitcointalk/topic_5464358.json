  "content": "This piece is more academic than popular, but worth sharing as it is the first formal mathematical rebuttal to the implicit criticism of Bitcoin made in the well-known 2011/2012 paper \"On Bitcoin and Red Balloons\". For those who haven't read that paper, it basically argued for the formal impossibility of creating a sybil-proof L1 routing network.Worth noting for the that this question is about whether you can get nodes to share transactions without adding unnecessary hops (i.e. disincentivize \"private mempools\") and is a fundamentally different topic from the more-commonly discussed topic of whether block production is sybil-resistant and whether POW and POS have the same kinds of sybil-resistance, etc. The focus here is on whether it is possible to add payouts to P2P network nodes to incentivize the volunteers that run the network without creating a massive security problem that eats the network.https://github.com/SaitoTech/papers/blob/main/sybil/A_Simple_Proof_of_Sybil_Proof_Lancashire-Parris_2023.pdfBitcoin does not currently have cryptographic routing signatures so it would need to be modified or upgraded, but it is an interesting approach. Thoughts and discussion very welcome.",
