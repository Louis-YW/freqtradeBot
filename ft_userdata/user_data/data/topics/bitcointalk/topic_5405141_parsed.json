For example in both of the first two cases there was tens of thousands of percentage of rise before the big crash happened but in the third case there was a tiny rise in comparison to the other two cases.In other words you can not compare this crash with previous ones because it is completely different with completely different reasons (bubble burst vs. economy burst!).QuoteWhy do you think BTC bottom is in despite the market being at risk of recession & high inflation around the world? Think wisely.I don't think that, I think it is impossible to predict the market these days because it is not just high inflation that is being faced, it is economy falling apart. During inflation people buy more bitcoin but when economy is falling apart (industries are shutting down, food prices soar, gas price is rising and there is a risk of having no electricity or heat soon) people are forced to sell their bitcoins.So the real question is how many more bitcoiners (I'd say mostly in US and EU) are left who have to choose between filling their belly or paying their bills and holding bitcoin. After they've all sold, we start seeing price going back up again.",

An 82% down is I think still possible as that didn't crossed the previous 4yr down yet which is 84%.
