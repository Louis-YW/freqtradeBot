If you are lucky and pay the miners in BTC than you can even buy back the BTC with fiat in a few days/weeks for a discount.Actually, no one knows if the price of Bitcoin will stay stable at $20k or if it will recover in the long term but there is a strong support at $20k so there is a big possibility after a few months it will increase. About the discount deal maybe November is a good time to buy(BlackFriday and CyberMonday)?Canaan also has many discounts their units are very cheap nowadays look here https://shop.canaan.io/products/ It would be also a good deal.",
