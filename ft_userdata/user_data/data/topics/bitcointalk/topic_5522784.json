  "content": "As we grow up it seems that our main goal is the pressure of making money that is taking away a lot of our external and internal mental thoughts. You are living your life in mental anguish all the time. In the morning you have to go to the office in the evening you come home and live with your family and in the morning you are back to the office. In fact almost everyone's work pattern is the same and you may have a hard time finding time to give yourself some leisure time.When you start thinking positively about saving Bitcoin as a new saver the first thing you need to think about is a safe source of disposable income and for most low-income people saving Bitcoin in the long term can be a lot of imagination. If you are confident in investing it is possible to save any amount from low income to long-term strategies.From this you have to earn money and save money for the future so some people save in the bank or insurance. I think if you are a low-income entrepreneur holding bitcoin then you should focus on your strategy and try to reduce your extra expenses by setting aside 4-10 years for yourself and at the same time apply pressure on yourself to follow the DCA strategy. As soon as you get salary at the end of the month set aside a fund to meet the daily needs of the family and set aside a % for savings and another % for a backup fund.If you can force yourself to save Bitcoin, it will put you in a much stronger financial position in the future and in retirement. Starting from a low income or from poverty saving can become a decision for you to enjoy a comfortable time in retirement while you are still working (holding) and ending your life (death) in a wealthy situation.What is your opinion?",

Anyone saving in bitcoin is actually investing because the value of bitcoin is not fixed, and can increase with time. It is not very easy to stay committed to investing when you have serious economic problems with not enough source of income, but investing in whatever amount you can spare is still advised. Little investments in bitcoin regularly is better than not investing at all.",

Imo If he wants to succeed so much and it motivates him to just save a little money to buy BTC, it's not so impossible to make $200 BTC to go 5x or more when the market keeps the steady bull market.Hearing the advice of the finance guys these days will make you wanna save and invest in Gold and Bitcoin actually if you want to survive what's coming in 2025.  They say the inflation could be the most unbearable for someone who just has a 9-5 job.

The wrong thing about other people is that they've been really that believing that Bitcoin could move them up out of poverty on which this is really that very wrong mindset. This isnt how crypto investment works and thats why it is really that a wrong idea on believing into something because it will really be that resulting into bad investment decision because you are expecting on something which cant be possible and that what makes you desperate. Investment decisions does need up that proper approach and analysis but if you do find yourself having that blind kind of belief then you do know that it results into negative.",

Because Bitcoin is an asset anybody can invest in, of which the sweetest part of it is that it has no minimum investment amount. Which is why must times when people claim their lack of funds is the reason why they fail to invest in Bitcoin, I seldom smile, knowing fully well that even with the least $2 to $5, you can confidently be an investor.

Even before the creation of Bitcoin, many adhered to putting aside ten percent of their earnings; this is how the \"American dream\" of becoming a millionaire was voiced. In our time, Bitcoin appeared, which created a lot of motivation for investing in it, adding to its profitability over time. Only lazy or stupid people will not take advantage of this opportunity, being young, to invest part of their earnings. We must always consider that everything we sow today, tomorrow will show us by the fruits. If we do not care very much and spend everything we earn, then very soon, the demand may disappear, and a need will appear.

I think that it's best to invest some part of the money in Bitcoin and lock your funds. Then, invest some part of your money in Bitcoin, which you'll sell if you have an emergency case. It's very tough for an average person to invest their money in Bitcoin and not touch it during emergencies because sometimes there are moments when you really need it. So, if you invest some part in locked investment and some part in flexible investment, I think that in the long term, you'll be better this way.Over the years, I built a good discipline to not rush or become a victim of FOMO but despite that, I have one wallet for long-term Bitcoin investment and I use a Bitcoin TimeLock feature, which means that for a specific amount of time, I won't be able to sell my coins, doesn't matter how much I wish but I also have another wallet which I can always use to sell my coins in emergency cases. I do this because I invest a significant portion of my income in Bitcoin, i.e. I risk more than I can afford but gladly I didn't have an emergency case and I haven't touched this wallet yet.",

It’s important to follow some basic rules as part of risk management, allocate only a certain percentage of your income, definitely not more than 50%, and approach it as a long-term investment using the DCA method.At first, it might not seem attractive, but over time, as you see your portfolio grow, it becomes inspiring. And in the future, you could cash out with a decent profit.Keep in mind that the current market situation might change as market corrections are inevitable. When the market enters a correction phase, prices often become undervalued due to some investors selling under the pressure of FUD. That’s when you might consider being more aggressive to take advantage of the lower prices.",
