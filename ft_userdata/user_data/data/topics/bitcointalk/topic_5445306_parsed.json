The name of this project is POKT, Pocket Network. I agree with you, that usually projects that have a token that is deflationary is way more attractive to investors because if you buy now and more and more tokens get burnt over time than the tokens that you have are getting more and more valuable automatically. That is not always true in reality though obviously because if a project is bad and is not delivering then it also won't matter if their token is deflationary or not. It's price will still go down.I recently bought some Cosmos even though their supply is also inflationary, but the project itself is just so attractive, at least to me, that i still bought some tokens. So far the price performance of Cosmos is pretty good, even though the token supply is inflationary.",

The name of this project is POKT, Pocket Network. Only you can answer it if the risk is gonna be worth it. I don't invest in altcoins that have infinite max for its supply. That's why I can't tell if it's worth the shot. Since you've mentioned that it's a turn of to you then why you're asking if it's worth for anyone to invest on that type of altcoins?Then, from the beginning you should avoid such projects if you think that they're a big turn off.",

I used to be as skeptical as OP, but I put the problem to other products if they have no value then people will not naturally accept to trade them, of course many risks can not be guaranteed. And with OP's suggestion then I think you can read about ETH again, that will help you to see the difference and chance to get better position.",

The name of this project is POKT, Pocket Network. Annual inflation must be justified by the development of the project or the growth of the ecosystem. If inflation is high and the ecosystem is not growing, then this is bad for the project. Ethereum has an infinite supply of coins, but a lot of coins are burned, so inflation is very low. Up to 10% inflation can be considered normal, but the project must develop. Otherwise, the price of tokens will fall.",

Don't jump to the conclusion that an infinite supply is not good or unattractive, don't forget that ETH is also designed to have an infinite supply. So far, ETH is still the top altcoin, and not a single coin can replace it even though it has changed the mechanism and is burning a lot of ETH every day. I don't know about the project you are referring to, you need to do careful research when making an investment decision, and supply is not the only factor in evaluating a coin.",

It's going to be turmoil.Infinite supply is a serious problem for any coin in eyes of investors who feel more risk and less chance of growth for such coin.However, risk is less and chance is bigger with Proof of Work algorithm. Example is Dogecoin.Risk is bigger and chance is smaller with smart contract token. Investors feel fearful that new massive circulating supply will be minted by developers or hackers within few seconds. If anyone doesn't know about such effects, see Terra $LUNA now is Terra Classic $LUNC as an example. After massive minting from Do Kwon team, that token fell to hell.Coinmarketcap marked tokens with mintable Mint function in smart contract on their website. It is a good warning for investors.",

If it was controlled, and the influence of said infinite max supply was only for certain economy-breaking situations then it may be okay, at least until everything goes wrong (which in most altcoins is always the case anw). Still, just the fact that they use an infinite supply model is already a red flag in most cases, wouldn't generally recommend it as an investment really.",

Before you invest in an altcoin, make sure you have researched everything about the project, I mean, don't be a stupid investor who only believes in the vision of the project. BTW, Ethereum also has an unlimited supply, just like the Pocket Network, but Ethereum as the L-1 network acts as the parent of all transactions on that network, besides that, the ecosystem on Ethereum is also very large, so the supply is unlimited no longer a problem for people. I suggest you to read Pocket Network Tokenomics first, before investing.",
