  "content": "Subject kind of says it all. I used to really care about getting a physical debit card for exchanging some of my crypto.Now for online purchases I can get a Visa or MC or Amex virtual gift card and for in store purchases I can use it in Google / Apple / Samsung / whatever pay app.Yes at times having a physical card is needed, but I really see it becoming less and less. Or is it just me and the way I do things.Also, being US based may give me a different perspective then in other parts of the world.-Dave",

      "body": "Location also really matters a lot. Even for the virtual giftcards. When you have moved out of places like the US or some EU countries, you will discover that they are limited to Citizens of a specific Country or location. At least this is what I have experienced in the past. I prefer virtual credit cards, especially if they allow me to top up using crypto and this is what I have been using for most of my online purchases.For physical Debit cards, I have them from a couple of my local banks, but I don't even ever think of using them for online purchases as long as crypto and virtual cards still exist.",

      "body": "For now, a virtual card suits my needs for online transactions better. It's easy to create, and it functions just like a regular card, except it doesn't have a physical form. Easy reloading, even with crypto, would make me happy, but at least reloading the card with FIAT is still acceptable. Since my country doesn't allow transactions using crypto replacing FIAT yet, I have to create such cards with foreign companies for cryptocurrency top ups.If I decide to go for it, I've already bookmarked a card creation service that supports crypto: [V2] Big List of Crypto Debit Cards As long as the card supports MC and Visa payments and can be used for international transactions, I'm satisfied.",

      "body": "although Physical debit card gives ease in carrying out transactions from your Bitcoin balance, but it requires high fees and sharing your data with third parties who often misuse it. Gift cards provide the same features, with good prices and various payment options, especially when you want to make an non  ID purchase then these cards will usually work.",

I like gift cards for privacy reasons",

The physical card is better in the wider arguments, however not necessary. If the virtual cards can serve the purpose you need them for, you might not be concerned with the physical ones, but location matters.The US and many top world countries have made a lot of things easy for the residents, but this is yet to go round in many other countries. That's just the difference (accessibility like yours). Like me, I can't imagine myself having virtual cards all through, all I could do with it in most cases is to steer at my money and my money steering back at me. Unless for online transactions, and not even all since you can't pay with virtue cards for everything.",

      "body": "It does not just happen in the US, Here in Indonesia there is a dozen e-wallets from a different provider, and there are also a dozen of the bank. So back then all the transactions were using either cash or physical card. After the boom of e-wallet, most of the merchandise in malls started adopting QR Payment method but the QR is only specified to one app. and now the government has the solution to adopt one QR System and all bank app and e-wallet app can use that qr for payment so today, a transaction using a card and cash is becoming less and less. small merchants started to adopt it too and just yesterday there is a caffe that only accept qr payment no cash. If CBDC implement by the government the cash might hard to find.",
