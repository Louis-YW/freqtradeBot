All the username pattern looks the same. Their entry submission timing is also weird. It looks like one group was working together or all those ids belong to one person. I haven't looked at their trust score and didn't further investigate. If anyone wants can investigate these ids. Here is the spreadsheet link. Those are from the article section.",

I checked a few usernames from the spreadsheet, it seems that all of them created their forum accounts on the same day, either May 7 or May 16. And judging by their bounty campaign applications, that can not be a coincidence.It would be helpful if you could gather all the UIDs that follow this pattern and publish it so we can tag them all.",

Isn't that what most bounty hunters do in bounty campaigns, not that i bother too much about that since they are more often than not newbies with no merits, and they really do not have anything to lose with their accounts, if they are caught cheating and tagged, they will still continue with the account most times because some of the bounty managers do not care, OR they would just create another account and continue till they are caught again.The only problem i have with bounty hunters is when they post their spam outside of the bounty section, as long as it is in there, i really do not care. OP can try and find out more about all this and if they were actually cheating, and report to the manager, if he is a manager who is strict with the rules, then they will be removed and some users might tag them, but sooner or later they will create another account or join another campaign with another manager who does not check negative feedbacks and the rest. I guess that is why LoyceV thinks ignoring them is somewhat the best option here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5399966.0",

It is likely that all accounts are made exclusively for farming campaigns. Just look at the timestamps of their POA posts, just a few seconds difference between participants in each group.There is at least one campaign in which they cheated or tried to cheat, Kleks Academy, as they are all in the spreadsheet. The campaign policy clearly prohibits the use of alt accounts:Quote from: BountyDetective6. Using multiple accounts, cheating and spamming are not allowed. You will be disqualified from the bounty programimmediately and all your accounts will be banned permanently.Although the campaign is now over, I think the negative tags are still justified in this case.",

When someone is managing 10 to 20 accounts and the same amount of social media accounts at the same time there is a high chance some track will be left behind unintentionally. But the problem is red tag is not demotivating them to create a new one.Update:Some bunch of ALT farmers. All of their username patterns is the same. All are brand-new and all of them are joining the Article campaign. So suddenly some newbie becomes a professional blog writer!!!

The thing is, its not in altcoin bounty managers interest to notice altcoin farms operating in their campaigns because if they remove those, there won't be more than couple of dozens of genuine users doing them and how will they sell their service to potential clients then? They need numbers, and the only way to get that is to allow army of newbie accounts to join.

Merit can be bought. So, managers apply the jr member rule and then there will be 500 new jr members the next week. Even if they don't buy the merit, users can start meriting their alts.

They may even make a post that gets them 1 merit.While introduction of rank requirement wouldn't stop altcoin farms entirely, I still think that it would make their life much harder. And I don't think that it would be so easy to buy merit at such a larger scale without any of the forum detectives figuring out what's going on. Yes, but it still make it more difficult for some bounty spamming to participate in some bounty.Quote from: Rikafip on June 13, 2022, 01:30:30 PMQuote from: yahoo62278 on June 13, 2022, 01:15:27 PMA solution has to go further then rank.What's your take on solution for altcoin farms abusing bounty campaigns?The only solution I could think of is, a bounty manager, hiring a special police team, or offering a special reward for an account farming detector who will do a thorough search on every participant of their bounty and also implement the only Jr or Member rank participation in their bounty.Quote from: DVlog on June 13, 2022, 01:50:31 PMA special badge can be provided for bounty hunters. New members must pay 10$ to the forum to get that badge to join the campaign. This will never work.1) This forum was said to be free as much as possible.2) Bounty spammer will easily pay for the badge",

New members must pay 10$ to the forum to get that badge to join the campaign. Already existing members and users above full member will get that badge as an airdrop. It is easy to get member rank by buying merits but for full member rank, it won't be profitable. When an alt farmer gets red-flagged to 10 of his account he or she will think twice before doing the same because it will cost him money this time. ~How is this different from copper membership?  Why introduce something that, basically, provides the same functionality as an existing feature?But the big question is, who will force bounty managers to accept only copper or Member and higher ranks?Actually, the problem is bounty managers are looking for mass workers, not quality workers. If only quality work is accepted I can bet 80% of participants will leave this work after a few campaigns. Also recently some low-rank bounty manager appears who doesn't care about their reputation and ready to promote scam project if they got money for them. I also think we should leave that matters for now.",
