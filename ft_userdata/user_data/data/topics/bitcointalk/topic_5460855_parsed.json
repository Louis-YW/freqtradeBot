  "content": "There is a wallet which allows running a public LN node on an Android smartphone. The wallet is called OBWallet (OBAndroid), and here is a guide of how to use it: https://medium.com/@h823654649/how-to-use-obwallet-a-step-by-step-guide-54f1c204ecd6The APK file is in their Github: https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OBAndroid/releases I downloaded it and tried to open some channels. But when I press “Create” (to create a channel), I always get an error: “Sorry, the program encountered an exception and is about to exit”.I tried two versions: 0.1.5 and 0.1.3. I used them on two smartphones: Pixel 5a and Honor 9. I tested both mainnet and testnet.There is the same issue in all the cases. But I don’t see any report on this issue in their Github. Maybe, the wallet works well, and I do something wrong?Has anyone a successful experience of using this wallet?",

They stated that the app should support Android 8+ 64 bits but I wouldn't be surprised if there are other limitations. It's really hard to tell why either since the error doesn't mention any reasons. Maybe you can try to log the error manually and see why it crashes?There is no publicity either so it's not surprising that nobody knows or uses it. I'd rather wait until they release it publicly before trying to use them.",

In Google search, there are also no results when I enter the keyword name of the wallet you mean.I don't dare to test on android with apk files like this because some kind of walware can happen.",

Yes, it’s really weird idea for a wallet to manage phone calls.The same thing happened when I refused to grant the app permissions to manage phone calls. It would crash upon starting it up. And then they have some weird Chinese prompt that would come up, and I didn't even understand it.The reason for the huge space it occupies is there is some data it downloads into the device.

As it is still in development stage so they haven't listed it in play store yet.If it's a new wallet and requires a large amount of storage space, I won't necessarily try to use it because there are still many wallet choices that have proven good ratings.",

Initially, it was awesome. But for the last months, it cannot found a route for any transfer of more than 10K sats. I don’t know why. Previously, I sent even 10M sats from it, and everything ran smoothly.The same case with Phoenix.So I am looking for a wallet where I could with one or two clicks have two channels opened to two different nodes, for better routing. All other wallets require quite complicated actions for such a configuration. OBWallet looks most promising. But it does not work as planned, yet.",

But it does not work as planned, yet.I guess you can make a new thread asking for suggestions if you still don't find them in the near future. I'd suggest you avoid experimental wallets even if offers features that you need since it is very risky to use them. But I guess that's not a problem if you know what you're doing. Btw, if two wallets or more have some trouble with rerouting nodes, maybe it was caused by the network condition and not the wallet itself? Unless both of them use the same source code with little to no changes.",
