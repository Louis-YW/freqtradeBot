Have you tried refreshing your balance page to see if the balance is still unchanged or if it has been reduced more than the amount you try to wager. Try to refresh it and see if your balance is still their then you will know that you will have to contact the support as it could be a technical error, if the balance have reduce then you will no that the issue is from your end trying to use an invalid balance.",

Do you ask the support about it because contacting will make this issue solve quickly since they can double check your total bet and compute your PnL to determine your updated balance.If ever, Are you using Martingale strategy because there’s a chance that you consecutive losses while your next bet is already not sufficient for your balance to cover.",

I used to have that problems with price tickers on some sites where they would not refresh until I reloaded the whole page.Sometimes they'd keep refreshing for a while and then get stuck up until I've refreshed.Try to compare your betting history with your account balance and you'll see if you actually had money on your account at the time it said \"not enough funds.\"I suspect the counter got stuck somehow, but the bet history continued to go live.",

So you have to first check on your history to see if it was recorded and if you see it there as recorded while you didn't trigger it by yourself then it might be you need to let CS know about it, it could be the automatic betting so either you deactivate it or they help you with resolving it. Well if you don't understand what is happening you can still get to support. Hope you get it resolved before playing again.",

If you were rolling $1 bets and the bet rate was 3 bets per second that means you can bet those 1000 in less than 2 minutes. So, please give us more information to have an idea about what the hell happened there. We know plinko can be a balance sucker, maybe you get a long run in that x0.2.",

I don't think automatically your fund reduce in stake from $1389 to $1000 and maybe you have used automatically game play in your last betting game play. Its huge amount when automatically you loss more than $389 and seems not easily how that amount loss immediately. Contact support and ask about your amount reduce, seems there will explain if any mistake you make why have your fund loss and they will give your betting history, maybe you forget which kinds of game you playing as automatically or manual betting because Stake have good reputation and most experienced as betting platform.",

Because usually it happens when you send cryptos to the deposit address of your account but your transaction doesn't confirm immediately and stay stuck for a while. It can also happen if you are using a VPN but usually it comes back normal by just refreshing the page. The last possible reason could be a lock of your funds by the casino. AFAIK they don't notify users neither warn them before doing it, when this casino lock people funds. It usually happens if you have a positive PnL for a while.",

I think that isn't he vest possible thing to be responsible for this,  I have experienced some browser malfunctioning on stake a couple of time but I have not experienced such as ops reported,  although in similar manner. So if the situation persists after refreshing the browser then ops could check his bets history and if he found any possible glitches he can then proceed to reach out to support to report the situation.",

Looks like he's on automatic betting while doing something and didn't realize that he lose some bets but since he is on another tab or other application on his desktop or phone, the screen froze while the bets are still on-going. The same thing happened to me on multiple platforms when automatic betting.If I'm correct, OP can just verify the bets made and he'll realize why it says insufficient balance or funds and a simple refresh can fix the balance shown. If not, OP should definitely contact support asap to fix the issue.",
