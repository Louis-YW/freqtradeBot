Is there like a membership or can you rent out the house? Is it like a clubhouse? What amenities and services are offered in the house if any? It would really be great to see fellow bitcoiners in one place.",

Seeing that this probably went through the required documents and government approval then we can assume that Bitcoin is generally accepted by the government in Indonesia?

Seems you guys already have systems that are working too well for you already and that's just a perfect way to go about this. Create a good social media page that's going to be very active and functional and from the reviews and responses you will get from followers that are engaging in those handles, it's going to be easier to create a good feedback on the level of Bitcoin adoption you're experiencing in your region.",

Bitcoin is generally accepted but with clear rules, no one will raid your house even if you own Bitcoin.

The hot and humid climate will indeed bother you, but that will not happen, they have also designed it to be as comfortable as possible.

Risk is big and my caution will keep my staying outside of such places. I can be an outsider and feel happy with this adoption but I am not a kind of person who will join it.No one forces you to tell you that you are a bitcoin investor, they don't ask how many bitcoins you are.It's just a community created for all sorts of reasons about Bitcoin education, not crime, so you don't have to be skeptical about the negatives. Just a choice of wanting to join or not, if you are not in line then skip it. Quote from: tranthidung on June 01, 2024, 01:57:40 PMPrivacy is important and inform many people that you are a Bitcoin investor is so risky.I'm also aware of that, so don't tell your portfolio, and like I said this is a choice, your privacy is in those communities not public, you can probably come as anonymous if you want, just an option.Quote from: tranthidung on June 01, 2024, 01:57:40 PMPhysical Bitcoin attacks with some old attack stories and some links are dead now.Many months ago, I read some articles that locals don't feel comfortable with Bitcoin/ cryptocurrency foreign freelancers who visit or live in Bali.In relation to the attack you are referring to, even it happened not only in Bali but in other countries as well it happened maybe even more brutal. People don't have a problem with crypto or bitcoin, but maybe with the individual or the tourists themselves. As you may know, some tourists can't appreciate where they live and don't respect the rules here.Quote from: Yucky on June 01, 2024, 03:12:13 PMThis isn't a bad idea most expecially in a society that has adopted Bitcoin fully as this can go a long way to create more publicity and aid local Bitcoin adoption to a very extent.Exactly, that's the goal, we won't know how Bitcoin adoption will develop in the future, we can only strive from this simple thing.And for everyone, the purpose of creating this Bitcoin house is for education and not only my foreign tourists attend, but many local tourists can also join. Bitcoin house has a mission to make Bitcoin accessible and understandable to Indonesians. focuses on easy and free access to reliable information and the creation of local educational networks, ensuring that everyone can learn about Bitcoin.",

At the same time, it's also a co-working space so everyone is free to go and if you're a remote worker which typically is the setup of many folks today. It's a great timing for someone who likes to visit there to be in that coworking space and see how many btc enthusiasts are gathering there to share more about the market sentiment, technical discussions and stuff. It's very interesting if I'm close there and I'd drop by but maybe as a tourist soon since many have been telling me that beaches there are great place to have a vacation.",

However, the purpose of this community is good as the OP has mentioned to learn and share ideas regarding Bitcoin. Moreover, knowledge like anggita [great poster] who has been active and involved with this forum discussion for a long time is above average so that unique ideas can be shared with the community.",

I'm not against any gather but practically I'm not an extrovert so prefer staying indoors all day so even if I'm be Bali or any where close to the bitcoin house I would visit especially if there's any party related stuffs around.
