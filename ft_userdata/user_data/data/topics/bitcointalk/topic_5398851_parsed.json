  "content": "I was of the idea that the information from bitnodes is reliable. But that changed when I looked closely into the information I get from running my node.There are IP addresses in the addr field for outbound connections appear in the list of nodes they crawl every 6 min, but there are IP addresses in the addr field of inbound connections that do not appear on bitnodes. Does anyone have an idea what these entities are? (if they are not nodes?)Additionally, some peers have the addrlocal field set to 127.0.0.1, while most have my IP address. Any reason why?",

      "body": "The list of IPs in the bitnodes site is not exhaustive. Bitnodes cannot crawl and index all of the nodes that are running Bitcoin clients because there are so many and certain nodes might explicitly block their crawlers or just not accept incoming connections. As such, it is perfectly normal to see nodes that were not indexed on the site.Addrlocal contains your IP and the port as seen by your peer. It can be any arbitrary values because it isn't strictly enforced and certain nodes have it set at 127.0.0.1. If you're interested, the IP address is communicated with the version message in the addr_recv.",

      "body": "Just a note: Bitnodes shows the number reachable nodes on their main page, which means those that allow incoming connections. They have a page for all the nodes (outgoing and incoming). So, back to your topic. Due to decentralization, it's possible for few nodes to not be crawled by bitnodes, but can you point out which one allows incoming connections and isn't shown there?Quote from: vinshet on May 16, 2022, 09:43:59 AMAdditionally, some peers have the addrlocal field set to 127.0.0.1, while most have my IP address. Any reason why?The addrlocal should be a local IP, according to bitcoindeveloper, so it's reasonable to be 127.0.0.1. This is yours locally, and same is to everybody else.",
