  "content": "After reading the 100 XRM Lealana coin post with its faded private key I got to thinking‚Ä¶. Are all private keys subject to this ‚Äúfading / deterioration‚Äù over time? Would a private key be better off printed as a QR code or as an alpha-numeric sequence? Does it make a difference if the üîë is printed on water proof paper or if it‚Äôs ink jet or laser jet printed? So many variables at play that I think a truly controlled, long term study would be needed with multiple variables and a control group would be needed. Has anybody done anything like this or have experience? Any tips for making private keys?¬† Thanks guys looking forward to the responses",

      "body": "Personally I have long been a proponent of vellum paper & laser printer for any and all paper wallet functions. This combination is not an ink printing process susceptible to degradation at the same rate of an inkjet on semi gloss which is what many makers used for paper source early on for some reason I cannot understand. Vellum + laser. Vellum paper is water proof & tear resistant. I can't tear a sheet with bare hands. It also has a semi porous surface. A toner based laser printer prints by melting plastic particulate onto the print medium. This combination should make for long lasting adherence without the risk of ink fade. Directly out of the printer, I cannot even smudge or scratch the ink with a coin. I have left privkeys printed like this in a glass of water for over a week resulting in zero state change. I did not test further as I felt this was adequate for personal use.I am not in support of printing on any gloss or semi gloss paper surfaces including waterproof variants as adhesion to a gloss surface is inherently more difficult to achieve. Just my .02",

      "body": "I've never peeled anything except one Moonbits.Since I was in direct contact with the creator I got some insight on the quality of private key production. They are almost-anything resistant (scratch, heat, water, acid, any kind of light spectrum) and the laser print has similar properties.I was also a little shocked to read up on the Lealana private key issue and then did some research regarding some of the other big player coins. To me, unless you are a super-niche \"just for friends and as a hobby\" producer, it baffles me, that it is not common practice to use better, more resistant and more durable materials for the most valuable aspect of these collectibles.Just my 50 satoshis.Quote from: JanEmil on September 22, 2022, 03:11:26 PMIn generel I see the BTC as burned. They are part of an artwork/collectible.Resell. Don‚Äôt claim.I get the idea, but see it totally different. One aspect I love about crypto collectibles is the amazing mix of traditional collectible (maybe including some rare metals) and crypto. This creates a situation where you would always hesitate to \"destroy\" this rare collectible to access the funds. And thus just make it an amazing way to long-term safe some cryptocurrency.If this feature is in danger, it loses a lot of its charm to me personally.",
