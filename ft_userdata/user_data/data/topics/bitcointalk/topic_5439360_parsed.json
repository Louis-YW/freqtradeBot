  "content": "This is more of a tech information but why I brought it here it's because I feel this info would be valuable to our local board because of the country we find ourselves in, the ban on cryptocurrency and it's a better way to protect ourselves from law enforcement agencies.How I got to know about this feature?Actually I got to know about it from a friend. Sometime ago, we were having a conversation on yahoo boys and he told me how second space saved him from been arrested by EFCC. He said he went to phone village at Tetlow road in Owerri to format his laptop. Few minutes later, EFCC operatives stormed the area with their buses, bundled all of them and asked them to unlock their phones while they go through it. If they see something like crypto wallet or exchange app, they would ask you to enter the bus. When he saw what was happening he quickly logged into second space and when it got to his turn, they checked and nothing implicating was found on his phone and that's how they left him. What is second space?I know there are other cool stuffs like antifreeze apps that one could use to hide apps but this is completely different. Think of the second space as another screen on your phone. It's like having coins (apps) on your palm(first space) and you can easily turn the back of your palm(second space) to reveal another set of coins. Apps can be arranged according to your preference on either the first space or second space and you can log into either of the spaces using a password or fingerprint. The shared files between both spaces is not limited to only apps, other files can be shared as well. This cool feature is available mostly on android phones running on snapdragon such as Xaomi, Redmi etc. To know more about second space you can google it.",

But if I should ask, when did a crypto app or an exchange app become something implicating for God's sake? Because it's quite a pity living in a country where everybody sees a young man living a comfortable life as a product of yahoo, which is ought not to be like that. But however, thanks O.P for this vital update, because with this now, many will tend to avoid the harass of most of these EFCC guys looking for who to arrest and charge huge bill.",

Â Prevention is better than cure they say and they aren't lying, it's better you prevent all the wahala then to enter and start explaining to people dat also sees you as their clients and want to use every means they have to exploit you. Another thing you have to understand be say, most offenders this guys have caught started by claiming to be forex or crypto traders demselves before they got caught with other incriminating evidence and they confess so with you they'll be thinking the same even though your own fit be your pure hustle.Also make we no think say this men never wise up and dem no know wetin be second spaces for fone dem but sha e dey help to avoid initial wahala as if dem dey in a rush, you be free man as dem no go see anything at all. The same wey wey dressing decently dey reduced the chances of been police harass but doesn't guarantee the elimination of it so will this idea the OP is passing across do. With all this strategy dem maybe man fit dey safe small lol. Also most Samsung get dis features too and na very correct features.",

He said one of the ways through which yahoo boys receive their proceeds is through cryptocurrencies, and that's why they are clamping on crypto enthusiasts. Since govt don give them power by banning cryptocurrency, nothing wey the legit hustlers like you and I fit do than to protect ourselves.Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on February 10, 2023, 11:59:04 PMAlso most Samsung get dis features too and na very correct features.Yeah... I think it is called multiuser.",
