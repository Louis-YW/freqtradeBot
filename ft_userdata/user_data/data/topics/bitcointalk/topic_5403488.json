      "body": "I actually don't like self-moderated topics. But unfortunately it has been necessary to update topics like this because of the increase in the number of low-quality posts on gambling board.The teams that are joining the Champions League qualifiers have to start the season very early and this is making things really difficult for these teams. Actually I think that UEFA need to update this format a little. For example, the schedule can be tightened like the World Cup play-offs.Fenerbahce team which I'm a fan of have got a draw against Dynamo Kiev. I think that Dynamo Kiev aren't going to be able to focus on their matches completely because of the war in Ukraine. Fenerbahce can be a few steps ahead of their opponent about qualifying for next round if they have a good coherence with their new manager Jorge Jesus.",

Now Estonia vs Iceland at least should be sterner stuff.To note, this is actually a preliminary round semifinal before the 1st qualifying round! Then they play the final, and then progress to the 1st round qualifying in July. I'm actually a little confused but anyway =)I know most including myself look at qualifying rounds with disdain, but there was once upon a time Liverpool had to play all the qualifying rounds as holders of the 2004 edition... the first time a team that didn't qualify from the league played the competition (and after that, the exemption became the norm). So I do see the value in these games too  Incidentally, in that edition, Levadia Talinn was also in the same round as Liverpool in the 1st qualifying round",

As with every year, I still think that City will play for the finals and there is a good chance they could win. Looking at how fired up Klopp was during this year's finals and the result, I feel like a result where LFC and City plays for the UCL finals would be amazing and insane.I know that there is a good chance they could face each other before that happens, but if they don't, and face on the finals that would be awesome. Imagine a season where City and LFC decide the EPL winner on the last game, play FA finals against each other, and UCL as well. That would be dream of all EPL fan.",

I know it is harder to do with EL and ECL but here is easier and it can be updated every period if necessary. The poll can look like :- the winner will be a club from : EPL, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1...Or- the winner will be : Real Madrid, City, Barcelona, Liverpool, Bayern, PSG, Chelsea, Juve...Edit: First one to vote and I picked City. I think they could do it this time with Guardiola and Haaland!",

I find it funny to see Real Madrid odds like that although they are the champions of this version! BTW is this odds correct?I have only a problem about Real place in this list, I prefer to put them after City and before Bayern with close odds between these clubs.",

However, PSG is not like that, they lost to the same team so I cannot really blame them, but they have tied a lot of money into the team they have, so it is making their job harder to keep it going, you could remove one player from City and add another, doesn't matter who that player is, but if you remove some players from PSG, then they become horribly worse.It would take a great manager, and I mean like a world star levels of manager to bring that team to its success, great roster, but definitely a ton of talking heads, a manager could set them straight.",

I also appreciate people playing really aggressively and players of both teams getting red-carded multiple times in a single match but that's another story.",

Regardless of who reaches the final then I'm very sure one of them will definitely be there. Doubtful about Real Madrid, that's fine but they have a chance when underestimated.",

Manchester City still continue to strengthen their squad and they are close to signing Kalvin Phillips from Leeds. Guardiola wants to win this title to reach the biggest goal of the team but we will find out what happens. While they were doing that Liverpool signed a great player like Darwin Nunez also.
