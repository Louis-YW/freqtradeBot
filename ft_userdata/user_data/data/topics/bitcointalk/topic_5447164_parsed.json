  "content": "The community has rallied around after the original team gave airdrops to some influencers who unfortunately dumped. We assume the original team also dumped a lot of tokens. Otherwise, this project would have been at least $1 million market cap by now. So what next? The community is now in control. The aim is to restrategize and reorganize and then continue building this project. The narrative is still as strong as ever. Still zero tax, Lp burned and contract has been renounced.

      "body": "A hacker that stole $8.9 million of BNB from Safemoon is going to return 80%. He will be keeping 20%. This hack is from March 28 when 27,000 BNB was stolen. I am wondering why this hacker has decided to return the stolen funds. He might be getting caught this way but something better then not giving any of the BNB back. https://cointelegraph.com/news/safemoon-hacker-agrees-to-return-80-of-stolen-funds-says-development-team",
