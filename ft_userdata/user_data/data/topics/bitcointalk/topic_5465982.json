When ever there is any post online relating to Bitcoin and Satoshi, you see the picture next to the name or topic of discussion.  We all know based on what we have heard, that Satoshi Nakamoto is anonymous and till date nobody knows who the real Satoshi looks like or resemble. Quite a long time this image have been on air depicting the real Satoshi which I believe is not real. Possibly there must have been a reason why that picture was used to make reference to Satoshi Nakamoto and since then till now it's been used and I was wondering if the identity of that picture is still alive because he should have long surfaced to clear the doubt surrounding the use of his image whenever Bitcoin is mentioned. I believe if he should be this popular, then he must have made a statement or comment with respect to Bitcoin existence hence his image was taken to always be seen when ever the name Bitcoin is mentioned.If you are opportuned to have come across any thing relating to the  above, maybe video or picture because this is the only picture I basically see too often about him.  Please do well to drop the link or the video here so we could see for ourselves as to get proper knowledge and understanding how this picture emanated and the person behind this identity used.I pray there are members who could be able to give us insight of how this picture came about to be attached to the Satoshi identity.",

For the above reason, he was accused to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto, but then, he later refuted the accusation stating that he is not Satoshi and not related to who ever Satoshi is, that his surname was just a coincidence..I will update this with the link to his official post where he debunked the believe that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, this is if no one else find it and post before I do ..EDIT....So here is the link as promised, in this YouTube video, Dorian clearly said he has nothing to do with Bitcoin and who ever Satoshi Nakamoto is ..please watch and listen - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrrtA6IoR_EI also made a post about this here - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5403956.msg60435611#msg60435611",

Dorian is in secret defense projects and his name is Japanese and he has similar economic ideas. You can read the report, which unfortunately contains a picture of his house, which exposed him to a lot of harassment.",

He was accused of being the real Satoshi Nakamoto while his real name is Dorian Nakamoto. Although he refuted the claims not being the real Satoshi Nakamoto as it was a thing of similar names So therefore it was a case of mistaken identity.buy however, just as it was said earlier by a poster his image was still used by the media to attach to Bitcoin whenever it is mentioned. I presume he must have had a lot of tough time battling with this issue which has led to him being on government watch list if possible.",

But since BTC was created and became popular, there have been debates on who exactly is Satoshi, and because of that we get:1) People who tell lies and claim that they are Satoshi, like Craig Wright.2) People who are falsely accused of being Satoshi, and they have denied it, like Dorian Nakamoto.Unfortunately for Dorian Nakamoto, he fell under the second category and really went through a lot, because his privacy was exposed and he was harassed constantly with questions and interviews, even after he had denied being the creator of BTC. Because of this, in 2014 Andreas Antonopoulos organized a fundraiser to say 'sorry' to Dorian for all he went through, and the BTC community donated a lot of money to him.",

The creator of bitcoins has to be a genius, and the man in picture fits the profile on first glance. Not like it is a must that every genius is nerd looking, but it is suspected that every nerd looking individual is highly intelligent (it is not true always).The name \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" sounds Asian, the man in the picture is Asian.The name \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" sounds like a man's name, that is why a man and not a woman is being suspected.The man in picture has been suspected to be Satoshi Nakamoto by many people, so that is what search engines on the internet will show you as the most suspected picture.",

Yeah, I actually get what you are saying, but people should actually stop using real people's images and only use images with no real facial look to depict Satoshi, no body in the world can or has ever come out to tell how Satoshi Nakamoto looks, so personally, I feel that using real people's images to reference Satoshi is actually an invade in the privacy of who ever is used ..People can actually use images like the one I share below to reference Satoshi Nakamoto in articles and post, instead of using images of real people who we all know if not Satoshi ..",

Until the real person or group of people who are called Satoshi are really up and there is some kind of prove that they are, this image will still appears to be valid and refers to as Satoshi, I believe this will be almost impossible for the media to change the mindset and start using a ghost image other than this suspected person.",

It's just that there are still many people who think that he is Satoshi Nakamoto and things like that cannot be controlled so that when in a search engine or image there will definitely be a juxtaposition of Dorian's photo with bitcoin.",
