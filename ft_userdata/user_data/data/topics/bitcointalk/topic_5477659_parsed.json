I don't think recommended with atomic wallet for saving BSV coin have hacked cases last several months on Augustus and over 100 million dollar crypto hacked. After hacking cases not update yet about that wallet are recovery and can use again for saving assets or not?I checked at google have six wallet recommended for BSV and seems its update last several months will available for holding BSV coin there or not. Electrum SV (Desktop Wallet)Exodus (Desktop & Mobile)Coinomi (Mobile & Desktop Wallet)CentBee (Mobile Wallet)Edge Wallet (Mobile)Guarda Wallet (Multiple Devices)For OP you can read details here about 6 recommended BSV wallet and check which one wallet more recommended and easily operated with your mobile phone or your computer.Best Bitcoin SV Wallets: Top 6 Safest Places to Store BSV",
