  "content": "Hello again everyone!Â  Â Another week another rollover. $150 equivalent of BTC is up for grabs this week.A quick recap on how to play:- I will post 5 games below. All you have to do is decide the result of each game and post it here. So for each Game you need to choose either a Home Win (1), a Draw (X), or an Away Win (2). If you make it to the end of Game 5, you win. You will win either the full prizepool, or shared with however many winners there are. If nobody wins, the prize pool rolls over to the next week.For speed, an example selection for the 5 games could be: 1X221good luck !Â  Â IMPORTANT- Entries close 1 hour before Game 1 starts.(All fixture times are BST)Game 1 - Wednesday 26th April,Â  @ 19:45, West Ham v Liverpool (Premier League)Game 2 - Thursday 27th April @ 20:15, Tottenham v Manchester United (Premier League)Game 3 - Friday 28th April @ 17:00, Lecce v Udinese (Serie A)Game 4 - Saturday29th April @ 15:00, Brentford v Nottingham Forest (Premier League)Game 5 - Sunday 30th April @ 14:00, Fulham v Manchester City (Premier League)Game rules & eligibility- Prize funds will be paid out in BTC to your betkudos.com username, 100% rollover requirement applies unless already done so.- Must have 20 minimum Bitcointalk forum posts for your entry to be eligible- Pick either Home (1), Draw (X), or Away (2) for each game. 90 Minutes only counts, NOT Extra time or Penalties - Must be remaining after Game 5 to win.- If multiple winners, prize split between all winners- If no winners, prize pool rolls over to the next week- In the event that a game is cancelled/void, all players still in the tournament will progress to the next Game.-- All management decisions are final, collusion / cheating will not be tolerated",
