Easier said than done. Timing a dip is not that easy as you think. When BTC broke through the 29K Support all the way toward 20K. Many though 25K would hold, but it went past it like it was nothing.Well let's look at a scenario when BTC dropped or the way to 13K, Would buying from 19K still look like a good idea according to your strategy? I doubt it would.I know of instances where someone blew up an account that had 40K worth of BTC when Bitcoin was trading at 50K during the drop trying to buy dips, and now they have only 9K left.",

If a trader knows the perfect time to buy since he already know the trend in the market, he read charts and volume, making TA's then it will be beneficial to him that it is bear market. Saving usdt for future use is good, for example you always chooses a trading pair with usdt then it is kinda good since usdt ain't go low too much. I am using this simple strategy as well, but timing is really hard.",

No wonder why buying and holding Bitcoin is the most ideal portion of the option. unless the OP does it on an altcoin it won't be too much of a problem. Unfortunately selling Bitcoin only takes for a little bit can't bring back the same situation in the future.",

Trading works and it can be more profitable if you do it perfectly, though its really unpredictable but if you have strategies to counter that, there’s still a higher chance for you to get the profit. If you have more funds to catch the bottom, that’s better.",

During the bear market, you can also buy crypto assets little by little, for example when there is a new bottom price, purchase a little and hold it, time will come those you purchase will become expensive in the market like what happened to BTC.",

It seems to me that this is quite the right choice.You can use any platform that you want, but still the result of your trading will depend on your strategy so its always good to trade with the right mindset and strategies. Bear market gives opportunity to get good coins at a cheaper price, if you are trader you can short with those good coins since we know, they tend to bounce back and they are more active for a pump and dump trend.",

I think sometimes setting a pending order and instead of jumping in at any little sign that looks like it (whilst it is a trap) can safe a calamity or bad trade experience for you. Imagine you set an order around $18k for further sell and the price didn't get down there at $18k but got to $18,500 and bounce off to buying mood, this would safe you from losses if you had jumped in for sell and the price is buying mood.

See what you are saying is common sense and no major secret. If you have to make money you have to buy during the dip and sell when the price goes up but this is what is basically very difficult. From what I have understood your strategy is that during this bear time one should wait for a dip and buy it and then wait for the recovery to sell it. But the problem here is when do you call that there is a dip? chances are that dip might immediately recover without giving you a chance to enter or even worse it might lead to further dump without any correction in this situation you get a really hard time because even the correction might be lesser than your token price.",

If you do really have the funds then you could really always able to utilize and able to jump into any opportunity that you could really think off with but the main challenge here is on determining on what would be the possible bottom price. No one had really anticipated on whats the bottom price of this decline.Good for you that you do able to get in 19k but be dont really that confident considering that we arent too far off with the recent price as of this moment on which there might be still tendency that we might go down again.Therefore, if you do go for short trades then its not really bad to sell out with 30% gain and since you do have some USDT reserves then accumulating as much as you could will really be that ideal but of course it would be depending on your intent whether you would go for short or long term holds towards btc.",
