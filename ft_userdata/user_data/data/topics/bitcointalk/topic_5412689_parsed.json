  "content": "When the Bitcoin price was below $20k, there was an information banning Bitcoin and advertising related to crypto by Netflix. Spontaneously I was surprised and the question arises \"what's with all this?\"Suddenly a notification appeared on my Android that the Chairman of the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Bambang Soesatyo said the establishment of a crypto exchange helped Indonesia's economic growth. Reportedly, at the end of this year the crypto exchange was officially launched in Indonesia. This is really encouraging news for me as a citizen from Indonesia because the efforts that will be realized by the government have been long awaited by investors.When Netflix banned Bitcoin, the Human Rights Foundation donated $325,000 in BTC towards the development of Bitcoin.Source1. https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/15670703213914030082. https://news.tokocrypto.com/2022/09/07/ketua-mpr-bursa-kripto-bantu-tumbuhkan-ekonomi-indonesia/3. https://news.bitcoin.com/indonesian-government-to-launch-crypto-bourse-this-year/4. https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/human-rights-foundation-makes-q3-bitcoin-donations",

The another reason might be it's high risk investment and every countries still not accept Bitcoin, of course if there's a country didn't ban Neflix and ban Bitcoin, it will be a problem.",

But this is a forum, and the OP unlike to earn anything spreading FUD. I guess OP himself didn't read the news and covered the Headlines. If you merit such posts, others will be motivated to do the same trick (Clickbait). So, I would recommend others discourage people from spreading FUD and spend their merit on such a topic.",

No harm is expected on cryptos due to such movement. Crypto will eventually find its place among the mass. I believe Google had taken similar kind of decision last year in crypto ads. It didn't impact crypto 5o any major level. So it's all fine!",

I'm not sure why such judgments are made, though it could be for a license to operate in a certain location where cryptocurrency is not recognized as legal tender by the authorities. They have all seen that, so far, bitcoin has continued to develop despite the black harsh attached to its name.",

Something similar to what YT has, if ads annoy you, buy a premium service and enjoy without distractions. In addition, the competition is getting bigger and bigger in the world of streaming services, so Netflix is no longer what it was 5-6 years ago.",

However, it seems that they are really late because bitcoin is growing by the numbers and never be affected by this so called bans from any companies, much more to social media giants like Facebook. Sooner or later they will realized that they made a big mistakes and maybe make a U-turn in the future and allow it.",

Secondly, it seems that the first source is an article by the Sydney Morning Herald (I've never been on their website before this story), and it refers to \"local sources\" when making the claims about crypto and gambling ads being rejected, also along with political ads and ads of any products to children. So we'll see how this actually goes, and if restrictions are so generic, it's okay that cryptos are a part of it. After all, crypto ads in general are not Bitcoin ads: they are ads of centralized services (wallets, exchanges) or shady projects like ICOs.On the other note, I am happy for the op that Indonesia made a pro-crypto move.",

I think BitcoinArchive which has over 1 Million followers on twitter is unlikely to share FUD news against Bitcoin.In my opinion, this prohibition is their strategy of utilizing Bitcoin which has attracted the attention of all investors around the world because based on data, Bitcoin searches on Google are very high in several countries as reported by Bitcoin Documenting, Aug 31.I once said in a post that developing countries should follow what African countries are doing with regards to Bitcoin and today the Bitcoin Archive shared that information.I continue to read each response as my learning material in understanding about Bitcoin.Sorry, my English is not like normal conversation.",

So FBI agents keep wandering and tracking down the so called crypto criminal because of whom drugs keep moving here and there. All the way back big ang theory also mentions bitcoin in one entire episode where the friends used to mine the bitcoin but loose it due to lost laptop and shit.
