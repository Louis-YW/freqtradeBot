  "content": "What you will read below is the real story of a Romanian citizen which happens to live a nightmare everyday, after his identity was stolen. It didn't happen after using a centralized exchange, yet he lives the same thing as one which had his identity stolen by hackers from a centralized exchange or from any other source. This article is a cautionary tale. All those using centralized exchanges must be aware that at any time the exchange can be hacked and risk not just their funds but also face the risk that hackers steal also their personal information and use it against them. Or, even worst, hackers sell their personal information on dark web where criminals buy it with 1-5$ and they can always make a visit to those people...A recent article from Romanian newspaper Adevărul tells the story of C.T. (36 years old), living in Germany for the last 8 years.While his main job is to be a driver in Mannheim, C.T. also acted as a vlogger and it seems that thieves of personal information became interested about his name.The nightmare started in 2018 when he was driving home (towards his home from Romania) and he was arrested in Hungary after he stopped for a Police casual check, being informed that he was part of a network of thieves which were stealing cars. Apparently, his name appeared in Police database with a theft of a 22.000 EUR car. Obviously, the man protested and tried to explain he is innocent. He was told to contact the Tribunal of a city where he was never before.Months later, while being in Germany, Romanian Police contacted him for informing him that his personal information was stolen. They said they knew the guy but they needed C.T. to come to them for some declarations. The man went to Romanian Police and, excepting the paperwork, they also got his fingerprints, took photos of him, measured him and had him go through a lie-detector test.Since then, somehow, his problem became worst. Each time he was driving to Romania he was stopped at Customs Office. Each time he felt humiliated as they were looking at him like at a criminal. Each time he had to repeat the entire story, because he appeared as international fugitive.After a while Austrian Police informed him that the thief which stole his personal information was finally caught and convicted.Yet in February this year he had another incident with German Police. One day, at 6am, when he was at work, a neighbor told him that Police is at his door, looking to arrest him, because he stole a 38.000 EUR boat. C.T. believed that his personal information was now used by another thief. This new criminal investigation was conducted by Augsburg Police. He went there and he observed they had a dossier with all his data, but with a photo of someone else. They asked him where he was during a certain day of 2022 and he proved them with his phone, with his Google account, by accessing his location history.Lawyers suggested him to change his name, yet the man does not want to make this move. At the end of article he describes how afraid he is of finding out that a bank loan was made on his name or of getting arrested wherever he goes.All of the above is an impressive story. It does not really matter how those thieves managed to obtain this individual's personal information. What matters is that such theft can always occur if you are using centralized exchanges. Hackers may steal your data. Even the exchanges may sell your data, as it was the case of Coinbase. So we're not talking about a shady exchange from a third world country, but about one of biggest exchanges worldwide. Yet this exchange was caught selling customers' data.So are you still willing to use CEXs?Topic is self-moderated for avoiding spam.Translations (in chronological order):Română: Ce se întâmplă când îți este furată identitatea – caz real || Evitați CEX-urile!, translation by GazetaBitcoinGerman: Was passiert wenn die Identität gestohlen wird, wahre Geschichte | Vermeide CEX!, translation by AHOYBRAUSEFilipino: Ano ang mangyayari kapag ang iyong pagkakakilanlan ay ninakaw -- totoong kwento, translation by jeraldskie11Russian: Чтo бyдeт,кoгдa вaшa \"личнocть yкpaдeнa\"?, translation by FP91GPidgin: Real Stori--Watin you go see wen person theft ur identity ||Comot hand from CEXs oh, translation by MeCscPolish: Co stanie się, gdy Twoja tożsamość zostanie skradziona - historia prawdziwa ..., translation by cyganBengali: কি ঘটে যখন আপনার ব্যক্তিগত পরিচয় চুরি হয়?, translation by DYING_S0ULFrench: Que se passe-t-il lorsque votre identité est volée ? || Évitez les CEX, translation by iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2Urdu:  جب آپ کی شناخت چوری ہو جاتی ہے تو کیا ہوتا ہے۔, translation by ThemePenIndonesian: Apa yang terjadi jika identitasmu dicuri -- kisah nyata || Hindari CEX!, translation by PandorakUkrainian: Щo тpaпляєтьcя, кoли вaшy ocoбиcтicть кpaдyть -- peaльнa icтopiя || Унl, translation by DrBeer",

But this does not matter to hackers at all and anyone can be a victim.To put it into perspective, when asked to prove our identity on an exchange we present certain documents, those documents if in the hands of the wrong person can be used to represent us as well and we would panic if an important physical ID is lost and hurry to get it repaced, neither would we leave it in possession of anyone, but can freely give out the digital version.- Jay -",

There are some phishing sites that most individuals log on to that get their personal data compromised, and some uncommon mistakes could also lead to identity compromise. Similarly to the story of this Romanian, a guy in my country got caught on CCTV while he stole a paper from the trash can in the bank. The paper he stole contained the bank verification numbers of that bank's customers. I can't remember the whole story, but this guy was arrested by the police, and he confessed that he usually goes to different banks and tries to steal people's BVN, then sells it to a guy who has a site that enables them to get every piece of information about the person who has the bank verification number, and they use the information to carry out fraudulent activities.",

As bitcoiners we can easily point centralized exchanges as the problem but also note in the story our character used his google tracker as alibi. It shows how centralized the world today really is. You do not own your data in today’s world, it’s always in the control of a third party whom you have shared that data with. The banks, big tech and government agencies own your data and can do with it as they please. I hope people can learn from this sorry and be more concerned about data ownership and data protection.",

Most often, it's about to save costs. Shady, insecure and often fraudulent verification processes are offered. Computer science experts have warned about it multiple times but nobody listens...In Germany, many banks are even deliberately ignoring BaFin (German SEC) standards and are getting away with it...And, as you've said, some centralized exchanged are deliberately selling data to make more profits. Such exchanges engaging in such criminal busines, endangering customers, should face massive legal consequences.

I would like to ask everyone here who doesn't have a bank account, who doesn't have a citizen ID?...and many services in daily life we have to use citizen ID. If we all did it, it means our identity was exposed or sold before we used the centralized exchange. Don't blame CEX when our identity is sold, but many other cases. Apart from bitcoin, everything in this world is centralized, and we are using them every day, from our place of residence, school, and work... they all hold our identity. Our identities have long since ceased to be private.",

And I hope that my story will help many users to understand how it really feels to live such drama. I also suggest reading a topic written by 1miau, which is complementary to mine: Why KYC is extremely dangerous – and useless (I believe that Sarah Azhari, quoted below, will be very interested in reading 1miau's topic.)Quote from: Sarah Azhari on March 12, 2023, 12:22:47 AMyour story worries me, if I already have KYC, what can I do now?Well, first of all you should inform the ones having your personal information that they do not have your consent anymore for processing your personal information. And according to GDPR, they should agree to delete the information they have about you. However, GDPR is recognized only in Europe, therefore if you will address to a company from the rest of the world, GDPR will be useless. If they won't agree, you will have to sue them.Quote from: Sarah Azhari on March 12, 2023, 12:22:47 AMdo they really clean up my database KYC if I did cancel my membership or delete my account?It mostly depends on who is \"they\". If \"they\" are a honest business, they should delete your personal information upon your request. The problem is that you may never know for sure if they did it... Furthermore, in case you gave your personal information for something which has a financial connection, then your data will be deleted in 3-5 years (if they will ever delete it)...Quote from: Sarah Azhari on March 12, 2023, 12:22:47 AMI also do not know how to sue them, because like my experience in past, where the Facebook case \"Cambridge Analytic\", give my KYC on a third party to a consultant company.

I don't know your country laws, nor who you want to sue... But best advice is this: (1) contact the ones having your personal information and let them know that you don't consent to have your data anymore; (2) wait for their answer; (3) if the answer is positive, you can only hope they will actually delete your data; (4) if their answer is negative or if they don't answer at all, then contact a lawyer. You may never know what may happen with your data. And, as you saw in the story from OP, an identity theft is a living hell...If you wish, you can keep us posted with what progress you made.",
