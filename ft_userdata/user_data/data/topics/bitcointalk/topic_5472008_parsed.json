Â since it will still be resent again and a miner will definitely Â mine it or is it just to ease the stress of Sender client from worrying about his sent Btc.The default minimum time for transaction to been sent back to the sender address or Wallet is 14 days which also varies because of some factors like the wallet having in an in built rebroadcast feature or base one the Time each node picks the transaction into their individual pool. The resending will depend on the fee, if the miner drops it and probably other miners have it and later the fee gets lower or mempool gets less congested then the miner will pick it again. Not that it is a default thing that he will re pick it again. Use a wallet with transaction feeÂ  bumping features so that when this things happen you bump your transaction fee.",

The common setting by many mempools result in drop of too low fee rate pending transactions but as pooya87 wrote, not all mempools are the same and if only one mempool does not drop your pending transaction, it can be confirmed.Memory pool.QuoteIn Bitcoin Core there is a memory pool limiter which can be configured with -maxmempool=<n>, where <n> is the size in MB (1000). The default value is 300.The minimum value for -maxmempool is 5.Bitcoin Core Config Generator (Jameson Lopp). It uses a default value (300) too.",

It doesn't seem logical to pick the TXs with lowers fees by miners unless they really want to. So the only way to make possible your proposal is to set up a pool and only include the TX with a low fee.Quote from: promise444c5 on October 28, 2023, 12:41:20 PMis it just to ease the stress of Sender client from worrying about his sent Btc.The TX status will remain the same as long as they are sent with the same fee so it's the responsibility of the sender to increase the TX fee if they want their TX to get confirmed faster.They can increase the fee using Replace-By-Fee (RBF) or Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) even if they transacted with a low fee accidentally.",

Am I right?Okay, it has more pros than cons. If you send transaction without enabling RBF and can't do CPFP, then you will be able to get your coins back when nodes forget your transaction and you'll be able to resend them. Otherwise, if it was rebroadcasted frequently, then your transaction could probably be stuck for months and even more or forever if fees are going to remain permanently higher than what you paid. But there we have FULL RBF feature that will give everyone possibility to increase their transaction fee and get rid of waiting for confirmations forever.",
