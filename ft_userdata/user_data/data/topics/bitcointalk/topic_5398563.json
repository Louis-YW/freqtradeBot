      "body": "Looking at the whole situation in the world, I also began to think about buying an electric car. This is convenient, but you need to consider the risks associated with traveling long distances. I live in an apartment, so I need to know how far it is from me to the charging point, what will be the cost. But if many people switch to EV, then everyone will begin to refuse gas, and all companies will switch to supporting this idea. In general, the question is as relevant as ever.",

      "body": "I absolutely recommend installing a home charger for your electric vehicle for several reasons. First, my friends is surprisingly fast at charging his car and he does not have a rapid charger. In my opinion it seems to be faster than many of the chargers at his office. Second, it is so convenient and easy to use. Plug in your car everytime you come home and it really is a seamless process. No need to stress out a bit about not letting the battery get too low before you come home but instead don't even think about it anymore. Lastly, it's significantly cheaper. My friend says he was spending a ton on rapid charging and rarely does that anymore. On the other hand, it's probably slower at home but with my other costs going up, try to save as much as I can.",

I charge it from a standard 120 outlet. I don't  drive very far so charging overnight at home is sufficient.",

I feel it's something that will eventually happen because we are slowly emerging into an era where EV is the new best thing as it will help save us from the stress of panicking when there is fuel price hike.",
