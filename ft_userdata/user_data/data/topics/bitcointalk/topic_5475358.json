I have got plans when I should sell and that must be after the halving and when it has pumped a lot. I have some numbers on my mind but whether they're reached or not, I'll have to decide whether to sell or not. But even so, I am likely to sell no matter what happens because I have got some plans to buy something big for myself.",

DCA is not only limited for bitcoin but for potential altcoins as well.We are all sharing up on the same motive and plans/goals for this upcoming bull run on which we are really that minding about being rich or become successful when it comes to financial aspect on which it would really be just that so normal that we would really be that focusing on bagging up on the coins on which we do seem that it would really be that could make those dreams come true. This is why if possible then we are still on accumulation period even though the price is already climbing up high or becomes that expensive gradually then there would really be still corrections on which we could still have the chance to accumulate cheaper but of course the best time that you should have done that is on the time that people are into those extreme fear and doubts on which i do believe that it was 1-2 years ago where the price is almost on the floor. These are the moments or the times on which it is really that something that would really be the wisest idea to enter into the market but somehow on the current market price it isnt really still that a bad entry either. It all matters on what are the coins you would really be holding and what are the stepsthat you would be making on which it would really be able to determine your success but of course it would really be needing to have some luck either.",

As attractive as altcoins can be to gamble on considering how cheap many of them are, thy have a higher failure rate than success, making them a huge risk.My plan for the halving is to accumulate more Bitcoin, ride the waves of the bullrun and hopefully cone oug the other side with more bitcoins than I started with.",

Just stick to bitcoin accumulation while doing DCA. For me, that is the best option that I can rely to than to diversify my investment with some too good to be true altcoins but later on, they gradually lose their value and become shitcoins. That happens to me before and it only make me lose a lot so I'm not repeating the same mistake again and lose that huge amount.But Im open to the idea that your investment will be a lot profitable if you can mix it with some potential altcoins, so you need to find the right coins to invest to avoid unnecessary losses.",

The price is also higher now a days but we should keep silent during this time because halving will create more positive circumstances in 2024.I think that time (2024) will be the best time to sell our all altcoins and other coins.  Setting a target can help the holder to reap the benefit on time because if the price surge then people will not greed for more but will accept the target value for selling their asset.",

I doubt I'd stop since I'm planning to see first what happens a year after the halving itself. No big plans really with regards to Bitcoin itself, might look at some decent altcoins that could possibly pump though if possible. I don't have much extra to invest in others but could go pretty well if I manage to snag some good coins. Pretty sure that's what most people are planning to do anyway since most are expecting a jump at the halving point onwards.",

If it ever comes to that, I would be comfortable enough to sell at the price that I've set to sell my bitcoins since I have a decent amount already and then get about 30% of the profit when I finally sell to use the money to buy some stuff that I need to buy for my house and then the other 70% would be staying my wallet because I plan to buy back into bitcoin because I know that it's not going to be going up forever and with that knowledge I will be waiting for when the price goes half of the next ATH or maybe even lower than that to get in again.",

Just accumulate as much as possible while the price is still below ATH because it will surely break once holder becomes hype on the halving. My usual plan is sold every altcoin that I’m holding when last 2 months before halving while continuously DCA every week.I’m currently trading on Altcoin to increase my fiat that I will use to buy more Bitcoin aside from my regular DCA using some of my profit from business. Cut expenses to save more fiat then buy more Bitcoin is the best plan for halving.",

We do believe that it will go above the ATH price, 70k+ is not impossible and that means we could make so much more money from it.",

What are your plans for the upcoming halving?The plan I have is almost the same as the plan you have. Namely continuing to do DCA and maximizing the capital I have to invest in bitcoin. I think as the Bitcoin Halving cycle and bull market approach, this method is the most important to continue implementing. Moreover, buying altcoins is also reliable. The reason is, the bull run market is always the peak of the increase in bitcoin and altcoin prices. Therefore, we must not waste this opportunity which only comes once every four years. So we should keep buying bitcoin, and there's no harm in owning altcoins either. However, the most important thing is to carry out a thorough analysis first, so that we can reduce the existing risks. Because there are lots of altcoins, and we don't know which altcoins will experience price increases. For this reason, a good analysis must be carried out.",

What are your plans for the upcoming halving?There is this cognitive aspect of the market psychology I'm trying to understand very well. In every bull run, there use to come sharp sell off 1 months before the halving because everyone believes that after the halving, it's expected of the market to crash. So I as I experienced last year, the market did collapse pre halving and regain confidence after the halving. My fear now is that since people know much about the market, what we are expecting might not be what will be happening, u hope you are ready for the worse if your plans don't come as expected.You know the market usually make a parabolic movement and all of sudden crash, everybody is tired of this mental challenge and I think people are going to be careful henceforth as they have lost many funds in those previous coins, many things might happen and we need to be prepared for any call that comes after the halving just incase plans didn't work as expected.",

My goal is to secure a good amount of bitcoin in my portfolio before bitcoin halving comes so doing DCA will definitely help me to achieve that. And while looking into some potential altcoins is also a good idea, but for me I'm more optimistic about bitcoin so I'll just focus on it and do diversifying probably after I have gained decent profits from bitcoin.However, if you have bigger amount of hard-earned money, then its not bad actually to consider altcoins in your portfolio but only trust ethereum the most because it has no signs that it will fall the hardest way.",
