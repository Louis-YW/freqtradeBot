Checking the whois database, the site is only 319 days old, which is enough to gain some kind of reputation, but not enough to be considered reliable. but in a short search, I didn't find any significant experiences about this site. I would not give them any personal data, document ID or whatever.What you need to know, Bitcoin is not considered yours until you have complete control over it. To have your own BTC address, you need a wallet (again under your control) with a private key.By checking your address on the blockchain explorer, you can see if you really have any amount on it and the mentioned transaction.Code:Whois Record for GetCoinsMarket.comDates 319 days oldCreated on 2022-06-09Expires on 2024-06-09Updated on 2022-06-09You need to give a little more information in order to get better instructions on what to do.",

But from what I know, all a user needs to send or receive bitcoin is just to send his wallet address and have his fund deposited into his wallet in few minute, which has nothing to do with someone registering an account on a new strange website, as I just checked and couldn't find any reliable info about this on the internet.",

For you to receive Bitcoin to a wallet you need to have created it and gotten a seedphrase which you can store, this generates public keys and then addresses you can send to someone and they send bitcoins to you there.Do not submit your personal details.",

      "body": "I've heard of this scam scheme before with job offers and selling stuff. Instead of asking for your bitcoin address, the buyer/employer will redirect you to some no-name exchange which they secretly own and type-in some 'numbers' on your account. In some cases these scammers will not stop with just getting you personal documents, they would ask for money as well e.g. you need to pay taxes to us.The website seems to be inaccessible for some time, see: https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/getcoinsmarket.comI suggest staying away but if you're not convinced yet, a good middle ground approach is to: ask them if you could just give a bitcoin address for them to send the money to. Absolutely avoid signing up to some no-name exchange.Here's a website for bitcoin wallets: https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet - I recommend electrum.EDIT: Nvm the middle ground approach. On a second thought, I worry you could expose yourself to further mind tricks from the scammers if you engage in a conversation with them again.",

Why would someone will require you to visit a website when you've just made a transaction? What's done is done and there's no need for anyone to reach out to you or asking you to login some info. From that part, as you've said that it doesn't really make sense at all. I don't know the website but if that customer of yours has shown you some receipt then you better verify the transaction from looking at the network by entering that address of yours and see if there's really a transaction that has been made. It may be simple as it is but you've said that you're still new and everyone is going to be patient to you. Actually, how did your customer know that it's your bitcoin wallet address? Is it posted in your store somewhere or there's the qr code? Do you mind posting your bitcoin wallet address for us to check the transaction?",

Every time someone on the network demands personal information from you, it should serve as a red flag, and you should immediately stop contact, as gullible people can be very well manipulated by scammers.

If you were expecting the bitcoin from someone you don’t know and only met online, then maybe you’ve been interrogated secretly without your knowledge for them to know that you’re new into bitcoin and so they want to take advantage and leverage on your lack of knowledge on bitcoin to dupe you. Security and privacy is one of the most important factors you should always consider in bitcoin and you should not trade it for anything else because the repercussions is always disastrous.",

You do not need to subscribe to a site given to you by a customer to receive the bitcoin he claimed to have sent to you. It is most probably a scam. Even relying on a receipt from an ATM is not a guarantee that it was sent. You can ask him to show you the transaction on the blockchain, not an ATM receipt. Another red light is the site asking you to release your private documents and data. The getcoinsmarket.com site you mentioned, it is my first hearing it. Am advising you to avoid doing anything with such an unknown site asking you for your private information.",
