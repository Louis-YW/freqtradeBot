I say this as I believe others may pinpoint on this very political statement and turn it into a bigger issue than it needs to be. I hope you understand that I am not saying whatever you believe is wrong, rather is unnecessary to hint at our current politics into this matter.   Besides that, I believe that this thesis isn't some random \"gibberish\" being thrown around to make the author look smart. The words the author use is regular and normal terms when working on thesis' and may be understood fully by people who have actually studied them. So I also do disagree with your statement that this has nothing to do with bitcoin.I do not know if you have ever wrote a thesis before but it requires a lot of background information laid out and then go into the nitty gritty of the main point the author is trying to make. Now, you're wondering \"I've already read 80 out of the 400 pages it has and sounds like it has nothing to do with Bitcoin,\" only because you are focusing on Bitcoin and Bitcoin only.I haven't read 80 pages but just by reading the executive summary, the author is wanting to emphasize that the PoW that Bitcoin uses could also be used to help advance national security's technology. The author is bringing in Bitcoin as an example of how we may already have an in-the-works technology that can be used for more uses than just cryptocurrency.The thesis may not be mentioning anything new about Bitcoin and it's functionality, it is used to mention the possibilities Bitcoin's functionalities have for government uses.This is as far my perception of this thesis as a 18-yr-old so if there is anyone else out there who want to correct me or clarify something I may have perceived wrong, I am very open to that and do not see myself as entirely correct as I, as everyone else, am still a human being and make mistakes and still striving to grow.With that, I wish everyone a very good rest of your weekend!",

So to further clarify my previous reply regarding this, there were several several different ways to convey the message you were trying to convey without mentioning political figures. Just a mention of a political figure or anything politic-related can spark unnecessary flames so I hope you understand that. Back to the actual topic of this thread, like I have mentioned before, a thesis is written in that format in order to fully help the readers understand what the writer was trying to point out: this is the nature of writing a thesis. Of course, the author could've entirely wrote every necessary information needed to back up his claim beforehand and later refer to that but that would be far more irritating to read as you would have to flip (or scroll in this case of it being a pdf) back and forth to reread that certain referenced info.This now piqued my curiosity of if you even know what a thesis is for and how it is written. Furthermore, thesis aren't just randomly published without an approval of people who are credible enough to approve such paper, meaning scholars and professors who have much extensive knowledge on the topic of the thesis'.I asked the above question not to belittle you, if that was how you interpreted (as most people who mostly conclude to), but rather to see how much you really know about it so that I can try not to sound rude when explaining (I automatically assume that if someone makes a claim about something, that they have a certain amount of background or experience in said claim).",

Right now it doesn’t seem too likely to be effective most governments would probably just laugh at it. Physically conquering a land is also a show of power and dominance.

Okay, I would like to apologize for using the wrong term of \"thesis\". I have meant to say research paper (as it seems to be one now that I look at it once again).That, I will acknowledge.However, I want to ask you, do you believe MIT, the number one nationally acknowledged institution for leading technology (as a university of course), will approve some random person's paper that you accuse \"not being a thesis. its a babble of content 5x the norm to show the author has lots of random opinions/thoughts on lots of topics but never concludes them quickly\"? If that was the case, I believe this would have been a very very hot topic amongst scientist and cryptographers and countless the science world that MIT would approve a paper to just get approved like this.Quote from: franky1 on April 13, 2024, 10:58:08 PMafter 80 pages it felt like he was still at the intro and al i learned was that he sounded like trump would sound if trump wrote it, its all over the place I have no idea what beef you have with Trump (and I don't care since politics is not my interest) but you need to stop with it honestly. You sound to be decades older than I am but still childish enough to be mentioning political figures as a way to convey a message that could have been said in plenty other ways. I don't know why you would also choose to argue with a 18 yr old over a topic that you sound like you don't have much clue about as much as I lol.Quote from: franky1 on April 13, 2024, 10:58:08 PMhe name drops and adds quotes but some of the quotes show he has not fully understood even those things.he mentions Einstein about energy and mass. but doesnt understand that mass IS energy in a form... he went down a lengthy path of saying converting mass into energy as a way for him to suggest turning gun fights into digital competitionhe talked about colonisation as being a form of co-operation of self interest to defend landno colonisation is an invasion attack where the invader wins and takes over the landeven the bacteria evolution stuff he gets wrongI don't know what the author had failed to understand and interpret (as I didn't read 80 pages of this paper), but I don't believe that MIT would let this person's paper get approved to be published like this if they didn't understand what they were even talking about which makes me jump to conclusions that you yourself don't know how the content ties to idea the author is trying to explain XD.In conclusion, please do back your claim with evidence and your thoughts about it since clearly you are trying to argue with hallow statements and vague accusations with no backing of your own knowledge.I must remind you once again, I am only 18 and still learning, so I hope that you would not rudely scrutinize me as if I should have known everything you know and instead explain what I'm saying that you believe is wrong. I believe that's how people should interact on this forum.Thanks for understanding!",
