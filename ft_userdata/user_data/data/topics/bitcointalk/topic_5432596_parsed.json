It is always advised to buy what you can afford to lose.

My suggestion is Electrum. These exchanges have disappointed many people in recent times. Many people have lost money they kept in these exchanges. So to make your investment safe and protected ensure you transfer your funds to a decentralized exchange. I am also hoping to buy mine in a few months if I can be able to earn extra money from my job because currently, the cost of leaving is very high that I can hardly save a penny. I would heed the advice of Rikafip to store my funds in an Electrum wallet, so I have decided to download and study the wallet. Nevertheless, congratulations friend.",

I hope you're also taking the necessary security measures so that your coins that you intend to HODL will be safe. On a side note, though, I wish you would find a better place to trade P2P. Binance, of course, is popular. It offers P2P. But you have to be aware that P2P means peer to peer, meaning, the transaction doesn't have a third party in between. I'm afraid this isn't the case with Binance. Instead of P2P, Binance's version is like P2B2P because Binance (B) is in the middle and it can do a lot things from there. The bottom line is that the very essence of P2P is defeated. You might want to raise this with your mentor. Meanwhile, you might want to browse the list provided at https://kycnot.me/.",

Take the advice of people to take that BTC out of Binance, and I urge you to find other means of getting your stash of satoshi (Bisq or even Localbitcoins is safer I would say).

So as you accumulate more bitcoin, you should make sure to send them to your personal wallet if possible cold wallets. Haven't decided to use your monetary gifts to buy bitcoin am sure you are in for a long-term base and at that, you should have the mentality of steel hands to hold for the long-term base.",

Love you GUYS.HAPPY NEW YEAR HODLINGLet me just quote so that everyone could see the image.Make sure you are the only one knows about the private key of your wallet and never share it to other people if you don't trust them 100%. Your Bitcoin wallet is like your real life wallet, once someone knew about the private key of your wallet it's like you are sharing your wallet to them. It should be your personal or treat it like that as it should since you are now your own bank if you keep collecting BTC you will one day earn a good profit from it.Now, you have to learn more about the market if you want to make a profit about of your investment since I assume you don't know yet how the market works. But if your mentor helps you a lot to understand the market then that's better but try to read and do some research too. You might discover some interesting topic and as well as to avoid scam if you know how they tried to scam people.",

I believe it must have been a tough decision for you to make forgoing your possible satisfaction from your pleasure or having fun this festive season. It is a good decision you have made to have purchased bitcoin to hodle for the time being until you deemed it fit collecting profit. Looking at the market trend, you would see it is bearish which should tell you that it is time you take advantage of the market buying more bitcoin as the price is currently down while waiting for bullrun. If you can, purchase more as you have said your mentor encouraged you to buy more when you have spare cash doing so will give you a edge over the market but do not forget \" not your keys not your coin\" so therefore do well to always transfer your assets to your private wallet in which you have custody of the private key phrase.",
