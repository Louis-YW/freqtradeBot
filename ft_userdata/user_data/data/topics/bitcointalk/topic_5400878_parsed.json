The problem with drug use in my country is government's failure to decriminalization some recreational drugs like Indian hemp. I have interviewed some youths and I discovered that because of the smell from smoking Indian which can attract drug enforcement agencies they decide to use other drugs. This has led to the use of different kind of dangerous drugs that have led to increase in the rate of mental problems and crime. Currently, my country is now a big market for drug traffickers and drug companies.

Does the government not serve the purpose to maintain a healthy and drug free society for the common good?I'm okay with less potent and deadly drugs being legalized as long as they aren't detrimental to the health and safety of the general population. Marijuana, LSD, shrooms are some particulars. Legalizing everything just means poison in the blood of the youth. It won't solve anything.",

Many children grow up to become problems to themself and the society at large because of parents negligence. There is little the government can do at a point in an individual's life when the unit responsibility for its foundation building fails (apart from locking the person on in a correctional facility or something). Parents should be more responsible and accountable for their wards. I believe this would be by far a better solution instead on waiting on the government to do everything.",

Alot of youths are exposed to social media and they learn fast from what others are doing and then begin to practice it at home. That is the way these things spread across to countries which were not used to it. Homosexuality, substance abuse and internet fraud were all not a thing in Africa until the internet came. To control these things it will be better for parents to monitor what their children are exposed to online. I see alot of children owning mobile phones they should not be holding at that age. Parents should be careful. The blame on exposure to drugs is on parents, not government.",

Make broccoli illegal, and the youth will start using it more.Am I getting this just right?Sorry but I don't buy into your idea of legalising drugs. In fact, the very danger that emerges from not legalising drugs is the killing it attracts at the cartel levels mostly and the extreme caution that is taken by the various groups to cut the trails that follows in a drug burst compromise.Another effect is in the case of price. Banning drugs creates a scarcity and with increase demand, I becomes the more expensive but trust me, its got little or nothing to do with its consumption.Most of those involved in drug abuse is actually for the feeling thy tend to get out of its intake or the pressure they hope to escape from life. Others might be for the purposes of perpetuating other crimes not limited to abduction. I dont know but, I don't see legalisation of drugs to be a solution to this.",

Their are punishment that can be better than wasting people life. Instead of killing offenders it is better to jail offenders for 5=10 years, this will make them to stay away from drugs for some years, than terminating peoples life .",
