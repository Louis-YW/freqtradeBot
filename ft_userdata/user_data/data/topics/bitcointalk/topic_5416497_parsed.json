That's why coldcard allows you to disable the USB data, so you are 100% air-gapped.

I know about ColdCard hardware, but i just found found out existence of \"Seed XOR\" feature. Also, could you explain why \"From USB Data\" under \"Firmware Upgrade\" has red color while \"From Bluetooth/microSD\" has green color? Personally i don't see much difference from security perspective.",

Probably Bluetooth is something in the middle between USB Data & microSD and should be with orange color in the spreadsheet.USB connection with hardware wallets is not the same as regular USB connection, but it's true that this can't be considered as air-gapped device, unless USB is used only for charging.However I don't see big advantage for microSD cards, and I much more prefer QR codes for air-gapped devices, like Passport and Keystone are using.I don't like Bluetooth at all, and I am not a fan of NFC that is just antenna with shorter range, but for everything there are pros and cons.",

But at least it uses images for transferring information.I also have kinda dilemma about things like SatoChip. NFC doesn't have a big range and the credit cards have shown that NFC is not so badly insecure (I guess that some could counter me badly for this) and it's clearly doesn't need (nor support) updates. So on one side it could be seen as good. Just I can't go over the thing that I feel safe only if I see the transaction on the HW screen. All in all it's somewhere between \"very nice\" and \"no, thank you\".",

Without visual confirmation on the hardware wallet itself, you cannot know whether your clipboard has been tampered with.And clipboard attacks are definitely one of the easier ones to pull off, due to relatively simple access to it by applications. Think of all the websites that let you 'copy to clipboard' e.g. when sharing a video link. That's their code that puts something in your clipboard. The same way, it could replace an address on your clipboard with a different one and you'll send the funds to them, unknowingly.",

I also believe it's possible to do the 'trivial clipboard attack' and at the same time overlay the original address in the software wallet, such that the user can't notice.Quote from: NeuroticFish on October 13, 2022, 09:42:02 AMand even to handle (display or input) the seed. I find this approach quite bad and unnecessary, since if one can use that safely indeed, then he can already use a cold storage, and the vast majority will setup the HW unsafely.Displaying the seed on screen is definitely a big no. I know of a screenless hardware wallet that circumvents this by allowing you to insert a microSD, onto which it writes the seed phrase. That way it is never sent to the host computer over USB.",
