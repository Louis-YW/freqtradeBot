But yeah, if you decided to use it, make sure to take everything with a grain of salt.",

THANKSWe know too well free signals are never 100% free, It's either they plan on cheating their subscribers or they plan on building their channels then start implementing payment plans once they hit their expected target, not that the alone free signals are never accurate most of their speculations are lucky guesses. My question is how come you have trusted a signal service you only met two days ago, and it is already on your profile. This should be a strategized advert for your personal signal service.",

I'm not sure if you are here just to spread that website OP, I hope you will not cause you will just fail to get our trust. If I were, stop looking for trading signals but instead, continue mining and enjoy it or/ do trading by having your own signals and analysis. In fact, you are right many people give their crypto signals and they all are wrong. You can never expect something will change as it even go worse now.",

If there is a group signal that can provide a \"perfect\" and \"accurate\" result, damn they might have an effective crystal ball predictor that is able to know what will happen in the future and they can withstand the heavy volatility on the crypto market lol.Disregarding OP's intention and advertising the posted shared link, newbies should realize that almost (close to zero) trading group signals offering free signals should not be entertained as aside from it doesn't really can predict what will be the flow of the market (as that was tough to do even for professionals) later on, these groups will offer a paid subscription which doesn't make sense to be purchased at.Remember that real professional traders are too busy with their respective trading works and don't have time to offer such a signal provider.",

It is better to study and develop the strategy that we will use to become a trading strategy. I'm worried that when we start trading relying on free signals, it will make us dependent. Even more worrying when by relying on signals we will be more lazy to study. There are no signals that will give us an advantage, and I'd rather say it's luck if the guess is right.I'm wondering if the OP has any other reasons when questioning this sort of thing, like promoting something?",

So advertising like this does more harm than good to your site. Please look for a better way and stop using click bait.",

After reviewing the site of the signal that you mentioned, I did not find any information about the team of analysts who work on this site. I never recommend Telegram channels and unknown sites such as these that offer free signals. You cannot trust them because you do not know Any information about their experience in the field, even if they publish paid signals. As for me, I cannot trust them and pay them because they do not guarantee that I will achieve investment returns from their analysis and signals.",

This forum also provides services like this and it's fine when carrying out activities with honesty as priority, after all it's the community that can judge.So OP, don't be offended by the many who say that OP ended up being a fraud, because it was his own actions that made us here speculate like that.Actually, this modus operandi has been carried out by many fraudsters, so it's the wrong place here.",

We can't say that they will just get their signals from other sources because they still can't identify it if it was a good signal or not.There might be a big number of groups but they are mostly fake. They are only trying their luck to fool newbie traders. Good thing that messaging group such as telegram are now doing an action to to ban those scam groups in their platform.
