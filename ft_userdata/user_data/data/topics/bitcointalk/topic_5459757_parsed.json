Not sure if they will appeal to it, but I doubt that they will do that.So congrats to bag holders, it paid off the time that you keep on holding XRP for years now.Time to celebrate and maybe sell some of your stash and get some profits.",

The classification depends on who it is sold to. The token per se isn't a security but it becomes one if it's sold to institutional investors. It's only a utility token if it's bought by the public or traded by regular investors.",

Care to explainDid you read everything carefully before stating your opinion here? the NY court ruled that Ripple did not violate federal securities laws by selling XRP on exchanges.That is the main reason why the price of XRP as well as some cryptocurrencies related to the SEC controversy has a significant increase in price within the past 24 hours. Although it is not a complete victory, the price reaction as well as this news is very positive for the current market.",

This is a big victory for Ripple. We have now heard of announcements coming from exchanges starting with Coinbase that XRP will now be relisted for trading. Following the decision of the court, the price of XRP has leaped more than 64% in just a matter of hours. On the other hand the decision also specified that XRP sold to institutional investors are unregistered securities.",

Like they are correct somehow that it's not with securities unless they are sold to a specific set of people/market like the institutional companies versus the individuals. As long as it's going to be good for everyone, I think it's going to be okay. With the rise in recent price of XRP, it's definitely safe to say that news has definitely reached those people who are hesitating to buy it in the first place because of this. Now that it has ended, a lot of people probably bought XRP instead of dumping it.",

I wish the Ripple team all the way in this legal struggleI agree with you. The case of XRP can lead future projects into right path and not bumping into SEC because of the flaw that involves them in a law that XRP did. Basically, new project and existing project is guided in avoiding suit cases like this. They won partially on their case but I believe that this will be a long process for them as SEC won't stop until they proved that XRP shouldn't be offered in public.",

This is a bad thing, not a good thing and the fact that it's 65%+ higher because it is ruled a security is insane. People should be selling all the XRP they have instead of keep it, and the fact that it has gone up and passed beyond BNB is just not normal. I understand some people may like it, but the fact that this many people put in this many billions of dollars into it is just a proof that people don't know what they are buying. XRP literally has right to print 100+ million more of it and sell it at market, that's the type of power owners have and you still want to invest into it? That doesn't make sense at all and never did, I think it's a big mistake.",
