To be honest, we can't tell how far it can go deeper but it's certain that we may back up again, this drop was more likely to punish the paper hands or shook them off from the market.",

So there is no way one can guarantee that crypto will be firm at its position above 80% or so. As you have stated your projects went down to 80% window then obviously they can loose value even further and become zero. The only way to secure your funds is to convert them to stable coin. However that also has timeline which we have already lost. I mean you can save up 20% loss but not more than that at this point. It’s better to wait for the crypto to go bullish and then think about next strategy.",

In this long horizontal period, accumulation is observed in the graphs. It may be a good option to wait for such a period before the bull market... Apart from that, I think Bitcoin and Ethereum can be bought gradually at any time and at any price. I see every big market crash as a buying opportunity. I wish you good luck.",

It is different if some of these projects cannot develop during bear market conditions, so that the price will not experience a high increase when the market returns to the bull market.",

Layer zero6. 0x7. Woo NetworkBut looking for good entry per dollar When you have learned from the mistakes of entering with the highest entry and losing almost more than 75% then all you need to do is take a break and evaluate the trades and buys that have been made. Correction until you find the answer to the reason why the minus can be so big. Instead, take a bigger risk by listing projects that obviously didn't do very well during a bull market. So stop expecting to spend more of your money on altcoins, because you will only see a decrease after a decrease in the balance in the portfolio.",

      "body": "80 or 90% loss of value for altcoins is an average result. The best result is a 95-98% loss in value from ATH or a return to the ICO price that was available to venture investors. That's exactly the point of a bearish trend for smart investors, they start buying during just such periods and this is just one of those times.But I would like to point out that not every loss of value means a profitable investment. Also pay attention to the unlock table, whether there were unlocks in large funds, it all affects whether there will be a price increase in the future or not. Also pay attention to the development of the project, if everything goes as indicated in the roadmap, the loss of value does not mean the death of the project.",

In altcoins, it will only earn you more less if you choose the wrong one. Trust must also be accompanied by the progress of the project itself. Wouldn't it be safer to shift focus to Bitcoin and leave the big risk on altcoins that will end up somewhere?Or try to give a choice of altcoins that will continue to be used as a transaction tool and the network is actively used.",

I have these projects in mind If you look at past bear markets or \"crypto winters\" you can see that some projects lost 99% and more and never recovered again. Best is to wait a while until the prices stabilize and form a \"bottom\" in the chart for a couple of months before jumping in and throwing \"good money\" into the market. Until then stick with the big coins mainly BTC, ETH, BNB. I doubt that the downtrend is already over, I expect another -50% in BTC in the next months, which can mean up to another -90% for some Alts, but this is just guessing and not investing advice",

So I don't think they have chance to survive in this volatile market.Maybe, I can go with ETH, BNB, SOL, MATIC, AVAX and other top alts. Even if we say, you will invest small, at least you have the chance that you can still get your money later on.With not so familiar projects, the chance of losing all is very high.Also, don't forget to include BTC in your portfolio, even if you have small amount of satoshis, you know it may have the chance to be valuable in the future.",
