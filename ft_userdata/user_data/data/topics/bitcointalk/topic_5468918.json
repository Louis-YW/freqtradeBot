  "content": "Greeting, bitcoiners sincerely speaking, I have no idea when it comes to understanding the technical aspect of bitcoin. And I deemed it very important in the life of every bitcoiner so, he or she will not be led to falling victim into the hands of scammer, to gain broader knowledge of how the system works and to understand basics of bitcoin wallet. But my exposure to its relative search topics for learning purpose isn't broad for a fresher like me.I've come to request for any content, be it book, video, post etc that can help me in understanding the technical part of bitcoin. So can also be a contributor in the technical board and physical life situations",
