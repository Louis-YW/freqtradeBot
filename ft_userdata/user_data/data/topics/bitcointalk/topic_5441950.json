There is nothing better than joining a mining pool with his miners but which are expensive and consuming electricity too. If his mining research is not about getting miners and to join a mining pool, he should not try to mine bitcoin, he can just buy bitcoin and hold it for long instead.",

There have been a ton of scams and Ponzi schemes in the cloud mining space, so a lot of platforms that seem like they'd be profitable are actually just trying to scam you. It's important to be super careful and do your research before investing any money into one of these platforms.",

I don't know if there are other cloud mining sites out there legit but those two are known as cloud mining that sells hash rate but still, there is a risk involved and I can't guarantee that they won't cheat(fraud).Why not encourage your friend to buy an ASIC unit than invest in Cloud mining buying then mine with your own is way more safer than finding a legit cloud mining sites.",

Do you think that someone will bear all these losses and then give you profits from bitcoin mining?The only logical thing is to invest in shares of mining companies, but then those companies will be legal and need to verify identity, and then you will be an investor in shares, not bitcoin.Or you buy directly from the platforms, but cloud mining is a scam.",

I find it extremely amazing that people are still searching for mining sites, which were once common Ponzi schemes.If my observation is not wrong, most of these guys are newbies who are new to crypto, and just heard about it from here and there. Not really surprising if you think about it, especially if what they hear is just about profit and how fast and easy is it to join crypto. That being said, social media perception about crypto is mostly negative, so I wonder where OP's friends hear crypto from. OP should give him better websites/books if he wanted to learn more about crypto so that he doesn't equate crypto to instant profit.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on March 05, 2023, 12:53:52 PMI don't expect Binance going bankrupt anytime soon, so you could check Binance Cloud Mining for your friend.Just in case OP is trying to try it, make sure you don't use the money you can't afford to lose. There are many fuds around Binance lately so you should consider that too. Who knows maybe they will close some services that can be considered shady to avoid being slandered further, including their cloud mining.",

That means, youtube influencers do their job well. What attracts beginners about crypto is actually a quick profit scheme with some light tasks, passive deposit income which is higher than bank interest. Tracking cookies also help them get similar information, so they never realize that everything the influencer is showing is the dark side of the crypto space.",

I would love to start bitcoin mining but I checked the profitability of GPUs at WhatToMine and with 0.1 $/kWh NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 that costs between $1600 and $3000 generates $0.84 in 24 hour.Cloud mining is definitely something that you have to immediately ignore. No one is so insane to buy mining equipment, pay for colocation, pay for labor and offer you profitable cloud mining. Beautiful words aren't always backed by beautiful results.I think that ASIC miners are the only way to go: Asic Profitability.",

All these influencers are trying to earn something, so even though not all of them have bad intentions, the fact is that they lead many astray. Bitcoin mining used to be possible on personal computers, and it is possible today - the difference, of course, is that it is no longer profitable at all. This message should be clearly conveyed to people, with a note that cloud mining is only one form of deception that will only generate losses in 99% of cases, and in only 1% of cases will they return the invested amount or earn minimally.As strange as it may seem, even with the use of faucets in a smart way, someone can earn $1 a day, which is of course a small amount, but still you have $30 at the end of the month.",

Many scam platforms and pyramid schemes are promoted on YouTube as reliable cloud platforms that promise huge profits, and this is not true. Because the cloud mining feature is intangible, which does not require you to own or see mining devices, many scammers have exploited it to inflict their victims; also, if the site has been hacked, and with an increase in the complexity of cryptocurrencies, you may find an interruption of the cloud mining service forever, as there are no guarantees that you will recover your investment capital or your gains, so staying away from these scam platforms is the solution.",
