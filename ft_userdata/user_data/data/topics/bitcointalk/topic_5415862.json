We need more open-minded Senators like this, but we know statements like this are hardly honored when they come into power. (Just look what happened in the Trump elections, when many Pro-Bitcoin politicians faded into the shadows when Trump got into power)  They might not be able to stop Bitcoin, but they can slow it down with strict regulations or they can ban it..... to make it impossible to use it legally within their countries.",

Much of the people in the cryptospace have it stored personally in the custody of their own and have stored their seed words and private keys safely. The hacks and thefts that were being reported were mostly from exploits and bugs that were taken advantage by hackers in the code of Defi protocols and centralized exchanges.If we are talking about personal wallets containing more than 1 bitcoin, how much of them were hacked? It might not be more than 5% of them.",
