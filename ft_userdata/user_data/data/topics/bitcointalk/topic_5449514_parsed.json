  "content": "Welcome To The Dawn of The Decentralized Finance RevolutionWe are thrilled to announce the upcoming launch of the Invtron DAO presale, offering early access to our revolutionary investment platform that connects investors with promising startups and SMEs, all powered by blockchain technology.Our democratic approach to decision-making and profit-sharing model provides a more efficient and transparent investment approach, allowing even small investors to participate in opportunities that were previously out of reach.By participating in the Invtron DAO presale, you will be one of the first to experience this groundbreaking platform and potentially benefit from its future success.With our profit-sharing model and blockchain-based transparency, we offer a new and innovative approach to investing that benefits both investors and startups alike.Holding INVTRON DAO tokens offers a range of benefits beyond just buying them.As a token holder, investors have access to the platform's investment opportunities and can participate in the decision-making process through voting power.With the profit-sharing mechanism, successful projects on the platform translate to financial rewards for token holders.In addition to investment benefits, the blockchain-based nature of INVTRON DAO ensures transparency and accountability for all stakeholders.This means that token holders can trust in the platform's decision-making process and the allocation of funds.But the benefits of holding INVTRON DAO tokens don't stop there.With the platform's dynamic voting incentive, token holders can earn commissions for their participation in the decision-making process.Depending on the direction of their vote and the project's success in reaching its soft cap, token holders can earn rewards for their voting power allocation value.Overall, holding INVTRON DAO tokens not only grants access to investment opportunities but also provides a unique opportunity to be a part of a democratic investment platform that rewards engagement and participation.Invtron DAO have a unique dynamic voting incentive, to make sure that it remains active since the whole business model relies on the voting itself.In this dynamic voting system, participants receive commissions for their engagement in the decision-making process for various projects.The incentives provided to voters depend on the direction of their vote—upvote or downvote—and the project's success in reaching its soft cap.Upvoting incentives:For those who upvote a project, the first 10% of the total voting power allocated will earn a reward equivalent to 10% of their voting power allocation value, provided the project secures its soft cap.The subsequent 90% of upvoters will receive a 5% reward based on their voting power allocation value. However, downvoters will not be eligible for any rewards in this scenario.For instance, if John possesses 100,000 tokens and casts an upvote, the smart contract will allocate 1,000 tokens to the project.If the project attains its soft cap, John will receive a reward corresponding to 10% of his voting power allocation value, resulting in an addition of 100 tokens to his wallet.Downvoting incentives:Conversely, if a participant downvotes a project and it fails to reach its soft cap, the initial 10% of the total voting power allocated will be rewarded with 10% of their voting power allocation value.The remaining 90% of downvoters will receive 5% of their voting power allocation value.In this case, upvoters will not be eligible for any rewards.For example, if John holds 100,000 tokens and casts a downvote, the smart contract will allocate 1,000 tokens away from the project.If the project falls short of securing its soft cap, John will receive a reward equivalent to 10% of his voting power allocation value, amounting to an additional 100 tokens in his wallet.In conclusion, this unique voting system offers varying rewards to participants based on their voting direction (upvote or downvote) and the project's success in achieving its soft cap.Early voters benefit from higher rewards, creating an incentive for timely participation in the voting process.Key points:Access to promising startups and SMEs seeking funding through the platform.Democratized decision-making process through voting.Profit-sharing mechanism built into the platform.Transparent blockchain-based platform ensures accountability for all stakeholders involved.Token Allocation:  * 10% allocated to marketing efforts.  * 5% allocated to presale.  * 5% allocated to liquidity.  * 5% allocated to advisors (vested for 2 years).  * 10% allocated to the team (vested for 2 years).  * 15% allocated to the team (vested for 5 years).  * 50% allocated to the public token sale.Follow us on social media for updates and news:Twitter: https://twitter.com/invtrondaoTelegram: https://t.me/InvtrondaogroupYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@invtronLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/invtron-daoWebsite: https://invtron.comemail: info@invtron.comInvtron DAO is Represented by INVTRON AG, about to be incorporated in Canton Zug, Switzerland",
