The token price is almost stable since gamblers that earn casino tokens through gambling sold there tokens to get back part of there losses. The only time this kind of tokens will pump is when it has a major listing or when the emission rate for token minting is already low so that the total circulating supply will not be flooded.I forgot to mention that casino tokens usually have token burn so it pumps even the market is bearish once the casino commence buy back for there token burn. I would say that casino token behaviour is far different from Bitcoin but it's still same profitable in the long run.",

Maybe you can read around the forum I suggest much discussion have taken place already.But investment, bitcoin will be more preferable since all altcoin depends on the movement and can easily bounce back within short period of time.",

Before the crash which has defined the end of the bull run, FUN price was 30 satoshis, but now FUN price is at 38 satoshis. So it was definitely a good investment against btc. Everyone who bought FUN back then, can sell now for 7 satoshis profit per token (1 satoshi cut for fee). It's about 26% profit made swaping FUN and bitcoin. Not bad at all...And there are many other gambling tokens disponible on crypto market, although I can't say anything consistent about them, because I'm not an adopter.",

And another important point to focus is the token volatility is bigger than the Altcoins, so, in the moment that you purchase the token you are already gambling.That's why i prefer the Altcoins gambling than the tokens gambling.",

So if you compare casino tokens let's say with btc, more than likely, a crypto user will choose btc no doubt.And with other alts, like top alts, most likely, they will choose top alts. It means, casino tokens have specific uses for gamblers.But when it comes to the large population of crypto users, they won't choose casino token for investments. As for performance, you've seen that even popular casinos having their own tokens (freebitco, betfury), just to name a few, they are also having challenging times marketing their token and so the price is not all the while increasing.",

Their prices are affected by other factors.Most of those tokens have a small marketcap and it's the team or owners who decide whether to move the price up or down.When the prices go up too high, they increase the supply by minting as many new tokens as needed to reduce the prices. When the prices start falling, they limit the supply by burning some tokens or through buyback.But all of this wouldn't be possible if there is no demand on the token in first place.",

In my personal opinion, investing in casino tokens is somehow on the borderline.  There had been some projects before but they seemed to fail.   It really depends on the Casino's performance since some casino do really have a good marketing strategy and some casinos that are performing so-so.   I think the speculation isn't different from those ordinary tokens but the advantage of gambling tokens is that they have utility on the gambling casino they are integrated with.  So better to do your own research and see it yourself if the gambling token is worth investing.Quote from: Z390 on October 10, 2022, 04:50:08 PMAlso how is the performance compared to other coins and BTC?

I have held casino tokens but I choose a casino that has a good reputation and I know it is unlikely to scam its users. The token casino is very risky, it is not advisable to hold it for a long time. I am still in favor of BTC and a few established altcoins to hold while gambling, it makes me comfortable that I know I am in a safe zone when it comes to price volatility.",

Some site choose not to create their token though, because they know investors are not all gamblers. It's not advisable and not mandatory for a new gambling site, it's better to have more options when depositing than to focus on one token only.",

It's hard to see them being used outside of their casinos. People mainly invest in them is just for the rewards and price appreciation, nothing else.",

If we look at the performance of each casino coin or token and compare it with other coins or BTC, it is very different because each coin or token will provide different benefits. But for the possibility of increasing, all coins and tokens on the market can increase, especially if a big pump is coming to the market, including casino tokens or sports club tokens. So before you decide, you better find out more about the projects so you can find out if it's worth doing or if it is better to choose another coin or token.",
