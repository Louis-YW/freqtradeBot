      "body": "Why not follow the guide from the blue wallet they do have some guides on how to use it.Creating a lightning wallet on blue wallet is easy check the guide from this link below- https://bluewallet.io/docs/create-lightning-wallet/Or watch this video https://youtu.be/Cfc3JGb3a4g?t=506About separate blockchain no all lightning transaction happens off-chain outside the blockchain network, unlike on-chain transaction.And take note lightning network doesn't need miners to confirm a transaction all transactions made with lightning are almost instant, unlike an on-chain network that requires confirmation.Regarding to your 3rd question the value of BTC doesn't matter whether on-chain or off-chain network. Your BTC in your lightning wallet should be worth the same as what the current BTC value from the market.To learn more about lightning I suggest read this The Lightning Network Faqs",

This request will include an invoice or a payment request that you can share with others to receive funds.- The Lightning Network operates as a second layer solution on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It doesn't create a separate blockchain but rather uses smart contracts to enable faster and cheaper transactions.- The Lightning Network does not rely on the usual six confirmations that Bitcoin transactions require. Instead, it provides instant transactions by leveraging the payment channels established between participants.- 0.00028190 BTC = 0.00028190 BTC the fiat value is determined by the exchange value at the time of conversion so if you want to make $40 transaction then use any site like preev to get the BTC value and then make transactions.",
