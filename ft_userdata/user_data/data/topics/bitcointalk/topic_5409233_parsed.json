Which one do you believe will have an incredible future in 2025.I will prefer to buy the token with same potential but less marketcap. As far as i know PYR has not yet added into various big exchange sites like FTX, binance, upbit and many more. You can try to imagine once this token can be listed on coinbase and so many major exchange site. If you are buying tokens with huge marketcap and you must know that if the potential to growth will be less compared with PYR. This is my reason why i was picking PYR over those tokens.",

This is not correct, PYR is listed on binance exchange, kucoin, crypto.com, gate io and many more, you can go through coinmarketcap to check things out but I believe that Gala games makes more sense because it's like Steam of block chain games where many games will be available on the platform, failure of a game won't backfire on the project, though buying PYR for 4$ and Gala games at 0.06$ is not bad at all, they are way down from their ATH.",

Which one do you believe will have an incredible future in 2025.I think PYR is more suitable to be used as a long-term investment than GALA, we all know that GALA is already in the top 100 rank, of course if GALA goes up, Bitcoin must also go up, because if it reaches the top 100 the marketcap must also exceed the other top 100, such as Enjin Coin. yes it's all up to you, but if you want to invest long term choose PYR.",

For now, both of them will be preferred by those real life gamers because the games are actually entertaining thus, you really are earning.2025 isn't far as well and we don't know which among of them will have a better state by that year.",

Which one do you believe will have an incredible future in 2025.alit reason that indicated why we should by token. On supply side, PYR only has 50millions supply which is will locked on chain with certain mechanism. With this kibd tokenomic, supply shock could happen soon when all developted games completed. With more 10 games being developt now , i am believe it could be trigger for next movement.",

I will prefer to hodl it rather than another token like GALA or even SAND. The utilities of tokens are very clear to me like you can use PYR to participate in the upcoming IGO, (still under development). You can also earn passive income from trading lava or even earned it through played the game. Staking was also available along with farming NFT",
