  "content": "The British Museum has formed a partnership with The Sandbox, a meta-universe platform, to convert its artefacts into digital collectibles. This collaboration aims to offer users immersive experiences, allowing people worldwide to view the museum's collection virtually. The Sandbox will work with La Collection, the British Museum's licensed partner NFT platform, to develop digital collections and experiences showcasing the museum's history.The British Museum had already ventured into NFTs two years ago, collaborating with the French NFT platform La Collection to sell more than 200 pieces of Hokusai's works, including famous pieces from the \"Tomiake Thirty-Six Scenes\" series, such as \"Kanagawa Surfri\" and \"Kaifeng Kaiqing.\" The NFT of \"Kanagawa Surf Inside\" was eventually sold for $45,000 (10.6ETH).In 2022, the British Museum teamed up with The Sandbox again to launch the second wave of NFT collections, this time featuring JMW Turner's works. The cheapest painting NFT from this collection was priced at 799 (RMB 5,720).Similarly, Russia's Hermitage Museum joined the NFT trend in 2021, selling iconic masterpieces from its collection at the Binance NFT market, including pieces by Leonarda Vinci, Van Gogh, Vasily Kandinsky, and Claude Monet.Not only the top museums but also the Uffizi Gallery in Italy adopted NFTs to sell artworks, such as Michelangelo's Doni Todo, which sold for $170,000 as an NFT.The NFT trend extends beyond museums, with artists and collectors embracing this emerging art market. The United States' \"Boston Museum of Fine Arts\" and \"British National Gallery\" collaborated with the \"magic core\" to launch digital collections of Van Gogh and Monet series. However, due to the withdrawal of the magic core, most users received refunds for their collections.NFT digital collections offer advantages to museums, including raising funds, reaching wider audiences, and resolving copyright issues. Although the market for NFT digital collections is currently small, it is expected to become an integral part of the museum and art world over time.Digital collections not only serve as a means of preserving art but also allow more people to access and engage with these artworks, overcoming geographical restrictions and tourism costs faced by physical museums. Users who acquire digital collections show strong interest in both the collection and the museum, often sharing their experience of interacting with digital and physical collections.",

They are not trying to save them in the digital world, they just want a cash grab. And I'm not buying that.Obviously, they will gonna say that the artifacts will gonna have unique codes in order for them to stay unique and that will gonna be the best thing they can do if they wanted to make some NFT out of each artifact but the prices are not gonna be cheap because they probably pay more money in order to make it looks like unique and have rare designs. Honestly, I'm not interested in buying it but I just probably wanted to see some copies because right now, they can just make some beautiful designs since the NFT market already improved since its first introduction to the public.",

Perhaps they are raiding the NFT space to plunderer more money from clueless newbies who are still falling for the NFT madness.Sorry folks, I had no kind words for the British Museum",
