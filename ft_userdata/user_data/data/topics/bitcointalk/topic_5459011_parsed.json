Even to update the firmware, you have to use an SD card, and you can't do it via cable. So, even if some stupid executive at the top of the company hierarchy decided at some point to follow the Ledger route, they wouldn't be able to do it with the current hardware.They have developed an open QR code standard for interacting with wallet and signing transactions, which is starting to be accepted by almost all software wallet developers. I like their \"sign only what you see\" attitude and using QR codes is exactly what we need for a cold wallet. Of course, this has its drawbacks because the wallet must have a camera and a screen with a sufficiently high resolution, but I think it's a good compromise between security and usability.",

It utilizes encrypted flash storage for safeguarding a user’s fingerprint data, with the verification process being executed securely within the MCU (only available in the Keystone 3 Pro).Additionally, Keystone 3 incorporates a PCI-grade anti-tampering feature, with an intricate ‘security house’ of circuitry encompassing the core IC and SE chips.

Source video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2igVmmRvdn0The main difference I see here is much smaller battery that can't be removed/replaced without destroying the device, there is pros and cons with this, but I am personally not a fan of integrated batteries.Size of Keystone3 is a bit smaller than in older Keystone wallets (103.9 x 62.44 x 12.08 mm vs 112 x 65 x 18 mm) and it has smoother edges, but size of the screen appears to be the same size.Keystone will be adding USB and Bluetooth connection with PC in this model, and I think they are second hardware wallet after Cypherock X1 to add support for multiple seed phrases.Overall it looks like interesting device but there are few things I don't like (integrated battery, bluetooth) and I will have to see the final price to say if this is worth or not.",

Well, it did make sense to increase phone size when people started browsing the web and watching movies on them. Hardware wallets will not need a bigger screen for anything, because their function will not substantially change. Therefore, I see no reason for huge hardware wallets.I do enjoy devices that have a proper keypad or keyboard, since that allows me to quickly enter longer passphrases and passwords. So a certain minimum size would be needed, but not for a huge screen.Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on July 07, 2023, 08:51:00 PMAlso:  You said you don't endorse the Keystone 3, dkbit98, and this time around I don't even need to heed your disclaimer.  After Ledger's little lie, I consider all hardware wallets to be collectibles only.  Fool me once, shame on me (in this case, because I was warned).  Fool me twice....ain't gonna happen.Personally, I believe we should keep in mind that Ledger was always a full-stack closed-source product. It's easy to 'fool' people when you keep them in the dark.If a device is fully open and verifiable, e.g. following some of what https://betrusted.io/ are doing, it puts these little things miles ahead in terms of trust and 'reduced fooling potential' compared to something like a Ledger.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on July 12, 2023, 09:54:28 PMQuoteThe Keystone 3 is currently the ONLY hardware wallet that incorporates the use of three distinct secure elements: the Microchip ATECC608B, Maxim DS28S60, and Maxim MAX32520, offering a level of security that is unmatched.Microchip ATECC608B and Maxim DS28S60 are specifically engineered to safeguard seed phrases.

They're not the first ones to try a multi-secure element design, but others combined it e.g. with the secure element of their NFC IC (with the obvious drawbacks that come with this design decision..).I'm excited to see the source files of this device and maybe also buy one for review.Quote from: dkbit98 on July 25, 2023, 08:11:00 AMThe main difference I see here is much smaller battery that can't be removed/replaced without destroying the device, there is pros and cons with this, but I am personally not a fan of integrated batteries.Unfortunately, this makes it quite unsuited as a long-term / semi-cold-storage option.
