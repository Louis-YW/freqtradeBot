  "content": "Hey guys,We soft launched our crypto casino and I was thinking of employing a few forum members to help me test it out. The user would get $100 in BTC through CoinsPaid upfront, from which $20 would be to gamble, and $80 for your service. The list for troubleshooting includes several things, but will mostly cover:- The registration flow and your comments on it- The deposit flow and your comments on it- Testing out the providers with one game- Testing out the customer support via live chat or e-mailImportant: Once you register, your account will be marked as a test account, you'll not be able to withdraw your winnings. I'm of course open for suggestions on how to work this out  We would most probably start this week, latest Friday GMT+1. Thank you.",

Also, you may make a proper ANN thread atleast in the gambling board or is there one already? And promote it more through sig. campaign  Will register an account upon confirmation.",

I just want to network with some forum members and get some feedback on the product (and pay them for that time), that's all.  I'll check with the payments team if we can work out just direct BTC transfers, but basically you would get $100 in to your wallet, and then out of those test the deposit flow and the games with the $20 out of it.",

Maybe you don't require KYC at your site, but they seem to ask for it judging by previous comments. So, I would prefer getting the $80 deposited into my own wallet, and we can use the $20 test amount in any way you want.How many games need to be tested? You mentioned \"Testing out the providers with one game\" Does this mean one game for each provider (multiple games) or just one game in total?",
