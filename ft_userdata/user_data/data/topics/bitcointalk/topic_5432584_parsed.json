  "content": "About a week ago arbitrum based project called Dictum exchange announced an airdrop. Eligibility form was open then and claim was supposed to start on 30th December until 3rd of January. With 77% supply to be airdropped. However, things turned out to be sour when devs rugged the LPs. The usual yield farming scam, lock your eth/usdc/etc and get our token. What's surprising in this? They fooled reputed eth staking platform, Lido. Lido was announced as a \"partner\" and they agreed to incentivize the stETH pool in Dictum with 4000 LDO.What can we learn? - Be careful with airdrops, so many airdrop hunters have entered the field, so have scammers. - Don't blindly trust the partnerships. - Be careful with wallets you have connected to platform(s) and especially if you have given approve permission(s), use revoke.cash to revoke such permissions. - New discord account, new website. who.is record shows dictum.exchange was registered 39 days ago. Ofc, not all recently registered projects are scam but it's one of things to note. - It was a solidly exchange fork. If there is nothing original in project, one should be cautious of such ones. - Ethereum address that deployed the contracts was funded by other address which was funded by tornado cash (popular ethereum mixer).",

Where the participants put some money to obtain the advantages of the contracts, and then the money was stolen even though the token completely devalued and everyone lost the money.",

One year and now they rug pulled already.QuoteWith 77% supply to be airdropped. The distribution of their token, the part for marketing, for airdrop is weirdly high, 77%. Is that too good to be true airdrop offer?They don't have fair launch and use majority of tokens for airdrop (as they announced but it's not a good plan for any project)More details for this rug pull, here",
