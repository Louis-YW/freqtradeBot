I run simple miner os.Any one have some good settings I can try.Better yet is team red the best miner for and kawpow.tiathey are poorly clocked and doing 26+26= 52 mhsand 200+200 watts",

The thermal paste on a warranty video card is changed when without replacing it is impossible to mine without overheating, as was the case on video cards 3080 and 3090. The 6800xt video card is not very hot, so if there is a warranty and the temperature is low, then it is better not to open the seals.",
