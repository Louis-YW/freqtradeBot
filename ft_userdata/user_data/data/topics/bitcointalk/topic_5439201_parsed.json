  "content": "There is much discussion in both the print and electronic media regarding the probability of global recession as a consequence of ongoing war in Ukraine, but I think unlikely to happen any time soon, even if it does, it is expected to be less severe than recession in 2007, as global GDP is still growing albeit at a slow rate. The real challenges for policy makers are growing debt, climate change and increasing frequency of natural disasters, such as earthquake, hurricanes and floods, which pose significant risk to world economy. These need to be addressed by global community urgently, in order to ensure a stable and thriving economy.",

Too much growth on GDP can give a bad effect if left unchecked.Doesn't a drop in inflation normally cause a recession under some of the criteria (ie gdp could drop if domestic spending falls - that could be a particular problem for the larger and more exposed economies like the US and China but I imagine it'd go further than that and cause something more global).I wouldn't bet on it but there's been a lot of speculation governments have become better at handling recessions for the people that experience it the most (generally by giving cash or resource handouts - though they seem to be more Conservative/right wing overall now and there's a chance that's stunting growth like it normally does).",

Our survival and prosperity will depend upon us doing so. The only question is what form our adaptation will take. I think there are always people doing crazy things we would not expect, taking things to extremes that are both shocking and surprising. When it comes to topics like climate change and global recessions, I think it will be no different. There will be many who will address these topics in ways we would not expect, using any loophole or advantage they can find to do things that are unexpected.Our culture and society will adapt and shift to meet these challenges head on. To some degree, I think these changes are already manifesting. They say the best way to predict the future is to invent it. And undoubtedly there are many who are taking this to heart.",

Two years of the pandemic hit the economy hard as well, and recessions just happen from time to time because I don't think constant growth without setbacks is even possible.Maybe it won't hit as hard as the previous one initially did, but perhaps it will be a longer period of a milder stagnation. Also, not all countries and areas of life will be hit equally. Those that seem likely to be hit harder are the energy sector and food sector. Last time it was stocks, debt bonds.",

So this leads me to think it won't happen and this \"soft landing\" by the fed might be actually possible. What is preventing a recession right now is the tight job market. Even though inflation is high, people are still working and looking for higher paying jobs and that's why everything is still functional. If the job market doesn't crash then we might get a soft landing.However the way it looks right now, with next week CPI, it might indicate that the fed needs to raise interest rates even higher. And doing so will create even more problems for the job market. So its impossible to say whether or not we will get a recession.",

When majority of the people anticipate a negative event, such as recession, they will adjust their behavior accordingly, which can mitigate the impact of event. However, sometimes it doesn't work, the reality of negative event can still be much worse than what was expected. This can be true when other factors are at play, such as, sudden and unexpected shock to the economy.You are correct that political changes can also create instability and disrupt the economy.",

Inflation has started to come down gradually. No one is interested in driving the economy into a real recession.Well if you read what the fed wants is they want lower inflation basically at 2%. And they also want a good economy. Pretty much a soft landing. However there is a feedback loop.If there is a tight labor market then inflation will always be at risk. Because to find workers employers need to pay them more which comes at a cost to the customer. So inflation increases.So if the fed wants to fight inflation then they need higher unemployment , how do you do that without causing a recession ? It’s very difficult.",
