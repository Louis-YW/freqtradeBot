  "content": "It is a big question for myself as well as for the Chancellor, why I have bought Bitcoin ?  The truth is actually I am living on Bitcoin for the last six month on Bitcoin. Some one donated some Bitcoin to me and as I have no income because I am a Monk, so I have spent about $5000 dollars worth of Bitcoin to buy foods and pay for the bills. This is a real story in my life. Now I have learn about how the Bitcoin can be useful for daily living. I am really thanking to the unknown man who donated a tiny amount of Bitcoin that really helped me over the last 6 months. I have now decided to become a member of this forum and contribute my experience to encourage others to invest in Bitcoin.I am glad to know the benefits of Bitcoin, I wish, I could have join this forum much earlier. I run a Charity. I am a Monk. I need some help from the Bitcoin community. I am thankful to all those peoples who thought me about Bitcoin for the last few days. I have story to tell, how I have come to know the Bitcoin and finally join this community ?",

I am glad to have meet you here and you being involved with charitable work can be a way for some of us to also extend some help to people who needs some lift. I am then looking forward to your inspiring post, sir.",

Nowadays more charities have started to accept donations in the form of cryptocurrencies. This doesn't mean they accept bitcoin alone, altcoins were also accepted. Already with the help of forum members there were more charity programs being run by individual members who have dedicated themselves for the social service.",

      "body": "I am Monk, I have dedicated my life to do charity work. I doing the charity work for 30 years. When I heard about Bitcoin I created a BTC Address and  posted it in my twitter account. Some donated, about $200 dollars worth of Bitcoin. When the price went high, I had to sold my charity Bitcoin to a friend who is a Bitcoin investor. I got $5000 dollars. It helped me greatly over the last 6 months. Bitcoin is brilliant. It works. I am learning about how to manage Bitcoin transaction. I will publish my life experience what Bitcoin has done for me ?  It is an amazing story. I am sure many people will like to read my story and soon they will understand the truth about \"Bitcoin and Me\". Bitcoin is the catalyst, a liberator. Satoshi Nakamoto is a time traveller. I myself is just a Monk, Digital Monk. I like decentralisation. The monetary system should be decentralised. Bank should not mess around with people's money and lend it to generate huge amounts of usury. I have got over $4000 dollars bank debts with Amex. They are collecting high interest from me. I had to use my credit card to borrow money to keep running my charity work Six months ago I ran out of funds. I have no income. So I have used the charity Bitcoin to buy foods only. I live a simple life, one bread and one bottle of water. I tried to raise money by taking a further loan of $20000 dollars from my banks but the banks have refused to lend me money because of, I am a Monk. I cannot go back to labour market to earn wages by working for some corporation as a slave labour. I cannot work and earn money as a worker. It does not mean that I am a lazy person. I do charity work 18 hours daily. This is my life. I do not like to earn money and pay 30 percentage income tax. I was not born to pay tax any tax collector. Collecting taxes from citizen is illegal. Governments and central banks together print money out of thin air and deceve the 99% peoples. Why then the workers, the wage slave has to pay income tax ? I want to know how to import my \"Bitcoin Charity Address\" in Electrum or in Bitcoin Core. I have downloaded Bitcoin Core and Electrum but I cannot run a full Node as I have no funds to down load the whole 500 GB data for lack of funds. I am stacked downloading upto 2018. So I have turned off my PC. [moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

So I have turned off my PC. Use Electrum then, it is \"light\" so you don't need to download the whole blockchain, just the block headers which is about 56 MB and syncs fast. All you have to do is to create a new wallet and in the wizard window select \"Import bitcoin address or private keys\" option and in the next window enter your private key to import it in your Electrum wallet.As a prerquirement you must educate yourself about security, even cold storage and if you can you should buy a hardware wallet to make things easier and safer with little effort.",

DO NOT use this forum to ask for donations... because it is against the rules. You can post some pictures of your charity work to add some credibility to your post.

Any body can make up stories and publish it to attract customers to invest in their Ponzi scheme to scam honest investors. 1. I am here to learn about how to manage BTC address and how to use the Blockchain and Bitcoin QT. 2. Yes, you are right, monks are usually live in the mountain and they have long white beard and hear. Ofcourse, you are sound intelligent. I am a Monk, Digital Monk. I am a old Monk.I do live in the Mountain of many trees and flowers. All my hairs and beard are purely white. 3. I had a big personal loan I could not pay in full. So I had to sell my first Bitcoin Thythe which I sold $5000 dollars. I spend $1200 to buy Laptop $200 buying mobile phone. About $1500 I spents to help others, homeless people. Rest of the money I spent on myself buying foods and waters and fruits over the last 6 months. I am not making up story but telling the true story. I keept the proof of work and evidences cryptographically in my personal digital diary because it is bit of true history of \"Bitcoin and Me\". * I am not here to beg money or asking for donation. Those who in this forum asking for donation or begging for Bitcoin have their Bitcoin wallet in their account. Please do not misunderstand me. I have some personal loan from Credit card which I have mention does not mean I am asking money to any members. I have mention it because the Citi Bank is charging too much interest, and I want the Angel of Heaven to return back to the earth and closedown all the banks and establish the Bitcoin Bank through out the world and liberate mankind from evil of Bretton Wood Economic Policy. My title of the Thread is \" Why I have bought Bitcoin? \" but not why I have sold Bitcoin that I have received as thythe from one of my devoted follower, who has made a good amounts of money by trading Bitcoin. Please know and remember this, those who come to this forum may be young people, old people, poor people or rich people. Also honest people or scammers. Unless you know their true identity it is unwise to thing that every one is here to scam or decieve others. Commenting on this wise to some is unwise. I am not here to convince any to believe in my story and donate Bitcoin to my charity. Some body is a Monk and running a charity does not mean they all are poor and vagabond. Therefore, please keep a note that I am here to learn about the new Protocol which has been implemented in Bitcoin QT. Thank you all to visit my thread. I wish you a good luck and become rich in Bitcoin. Heaven bless you. HH Digital MonkBitcoin ValleyBlockchain MountainDecentralised Digital World.",

I don't believe about your story since my friend isn't lying, I hope someone who also a Buddhism could confirm this. This is what I’m actually thinking. A monk usually focus on prayer on temple and other things related in the temple. Having a charity as monk sounds a bit strange. The act of helping other people is good but being a monk should have other priorities than this. Besides having a charity means you are spending a lot of time on doing things what monk is not doing especially your interest on joining the forum. His statement sounds like he is not really a monk because he has a lot of free time to spend online.",
