I would have provided the links but I already see it is given by another forum member and there's no point in posting the link again so, I'll just point out where to start first. First is to read the forum rules which is very important for everyone especially newbies that there are consequences when someone broke the forum rules or simply not following it like getting banned which is worse or like getting red tag or negative trust. After that, you can start learning about posting etiquette before reading about forum ranks and related informations. Good luck cheers!.",
