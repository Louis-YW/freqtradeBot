  "content": "Today I came across this article in Variety and started wondering, what bitcointalk members would say about potential success of this project.In my personal opinion, it's going to flop big time. Not only because it was directered by Jimmy Giannopoulos who previously made only one film, a below the average crime thriller, The Birthday Cake (2021), but because very few people would pay $263 to see a new film by Christopher Nolan or David Fincher, let alone someone totally unknown.But those are my thoughts. What do you guys think. Am I missing something?",

If it were such a question I would post it in the Off-topic section. Sorry if it looked like that.My question is, do you think bringing NFT into a project can boost it?I personally think it can, but you have to engage in cooperation with, say, Yuga Labs, creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, or someone of their level. Then there would be a chance of those NFTs worth something in the future. Just creating 10,000 random NTFs and associating them with a project is not enough.Again, what are your thoughts, guys?",
