Hopeful he gets caught soon, wherever he is, so can be punished. Also, it would be helpful if you also edited your post to include the news or source you got this information from, the reasons are obvious: in these times where people purposely send misinformation around and go as far as using artificially generated images and audios, we cannot trust whatever we read, in the slightest, without cross examination.",

The Swedish society is very tolerant, to the point that they avoid confrontation. There are videos on youtube showing it where people start fight or harassment in front of random strangers and they run away, even when it's a woman that's being attacked and they're a group of men. Eventually the Swedes will have to say no to migrants and do what Hungary and Poland are doing. Have you seen any terrorist attacks there?",

Have you seen any terrorist attacks there?Perhaps instead of generalizing a whole group of people because their origin and religion, it would just better for them and also for the swedish society to impose standards on how migrants are supposed to behave while living in Sweden and other European countries. I would myself try to learn the language and know what to do and not to do in order to get along with my new co citizens. When one leaves for a new home, one is supposed to adapt and blend in, not seek for violence or harass those who openly offered you shelter, that is just being a ungrateful prick and monster (in case one inflicts death and pain on others for no logical reason)",

Such dangerous times we are living through... It seems like anyone could be killed at any moment just because the religious role they have taken in their communities...",
