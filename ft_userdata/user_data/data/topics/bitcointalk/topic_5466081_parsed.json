You have created three threads and some of them are very complicated. You didn't include any link to prove that your assumptions are factual and consistent with some findings. Your predictions are based on speculation and personal views. I think you have to learn more and write less. Anyway, many countries are experimenting and some are embracing CBDCs because blockchain technology is becoming popular and it can be designed to be less expensive and more efficient. It also facilitated international trade between nations making payments less cumbersome. I don't also see how currencies like USDC and USDT support freedom. These coins or currencies are centralized and controlled by individuals. Your coin can be frozen without your permission. You are putting your trust in politicians, that's not appropriate. Donald Trump is not a fan of cryptocurrencies and I doubt if he has changed his view towards the sector. He has always criticized Bitcoin, so even if he wins we might not see a more friendly United States.",

Yup, it must be a good thing for those who don't want to work for they still get some amount of money every month. But of course, this is printed money which will drive also inflation in the coming years. This is going to be scarier by the month. I think we will be seeing it very soon since Biden is already scaring people with the new covid variant and mandates the mask again and lockdowns.\\",

Anyone with crypto can trade with it, but the current issues lies with the SEC trying to regulate along with other ETF projects and lawsuits that needs sorting and understanding before using CBDC and acceptance of crypto as legal tender. Still it will be taxed. It's clear how taxing is one major source of economic security for the U.S.",

CBDC's are not even good for crypto, in fact, they are no good for nobody. They suck. I hate FIAT as much as the next guy but CBDC's are worse than FIAT. FIAT at least has a physical form which you can store way and it is anonymous too. CBDC's have none of these features. This freak of nature gives all the control over your finances to the governments. Crypto gives you freedom, this is the exact opposite. We must stand and fight. FIAT and Crypto are the different sides of the same coin. One cannot exist without the other. Fight for FIAT.  Fight for crypto. We are together in this war. What is Batman without the Joker?

It won't be any different when CBDC's get introduced either, I'd expect even higher regulations when the central banks start issuing out CBDC's. Trump is not going to change any of this. He is pro-free markets, but he's also anti-Bitcoin. He's gone on the record calling it a scam and a threat to USD. He'll easily be influenced into curbing Bitcoin growth by regulating it, and that's under the presumption he wins in 2024 which isn't guaranteed.",

There is a lot of talk about CBDC, but so far there are no real realizations, and it is not clear when they will be. And there are a lot of objective reasons - we need to restructure the financial system and the banking system of the country.2. \"Good for freedom\" - diametrically opposite opinion to reality. CBDC is just a mechanism of total control over the movement of money. And just anonymity and freedoms will lose a lot when CBDC is launched. I repeat 100500 times - CBDC is a transition from incompletely controlled financial systems, to fully, totally controlled and managed financial traffic",

CBDC is just an improved cashless payment system that is completely managed by states and their governments. The level of confidentiality in them will be as much as the states themselves want. But states and their authorized bodies will have complete information about everyone who will use CBDC. There is no death to privacy, property or money from CBDCs because they themselves are non-cash government money.At the same time, paper money will decrease in the volume of its circulation, but I do not think that in the foreseeable future it will disappear completely. There are many categories of people who will not have access to CBDC for various reasons.",

      "body": "OP here's the information about USDT, USDC, DAI based on Wikipedia. USDT: Tether (cryptocurrency)USDC: USD CoinDAI: Dai (cryptocurrency)These are not the property of the United States government. Those companies are owned by different individuals. The government can not seize those properties from them(maybe they can if they want to, but this will create conflicts amongst users and many will not use it). Thus they will have no control over them. If you don't know about this then let me tell you, the US government will never allow the use of something that they can't control. That is the reason why they are creating CBDC. It follows the same fundamentals of cryptocurrency which is blockchain technology but it will be more controlled and the government will be able to do whatever they want with it. With other stable coins or cryptocurrencies, they can't do that. So there's no reason for them to allow its usage. So how does your post make sense? The SEC will soon come after stablecoins. It's just a matter of time.",

They get themselves censored in one way or another. It's either they learn their lessons or they let history repeat itself. I'm sure the huge majority will embrace whatever currency governments order them to use. CBDCs will be adopted as soon as they're enforced. Those who \"are only thinking about profit and don't care about privacy\" might not mind using CBDCs. It's not a problem. But to those who seek an alternative, or when those who are apathetic suddenly realize and begin to shudder at the thought or experience of censorship, Bitcoin will always be there.",
