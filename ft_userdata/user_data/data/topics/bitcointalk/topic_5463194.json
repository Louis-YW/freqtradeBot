Till the 75 th Independence day we had a lot of traffic on our local board and we were happy because crypto tax wasn't rolled out. Now my question is what do you except would happen whn we celebrate the 78th Independence day? Do keep in mind that we have Bitcoin halving and central election next year. I would like to propose that we as a community should have some kind of competition to celebrate this occasion. I would request active board members to have share some suggestions regarding it.",

I would like to propose that we as a community should have some kind of competition to celebrate this occasion. I would request active board members to have share some suggestions regarding it. Nothing would happen as the central government election would happen in the month of November. Some of us do know which political party would again come into power. I feel that the upcoming government won't have a single majority as in the political party and there would be some amendments regarding crypto afterwards.What an incredible idea as I have not seen anyone creating a topic about Independence on the local board. I did saw Pakistani and Indonesians organizing different events for their local community. They are getting those events sponsored by those members who have been active for a long time. I would ask our merit source, Heisenberg_Hunter to rethink the next raffle and use the left over amount for a competition. There are a lot of religious events upcoming such as Diwali wherein we as a community can get our local board more action.",

Do keep in mind that we have Bitcoin halving and central election next year. Since you mentioned the election is coming next year so until that the government won't be really concentrating on anything especially crypto is not anywhere in their priority list, so there will be no further harm meanwhile we can expect huge attention towards at the time which may bring more new people into the crypto community.Quote from: elevates on August 14, 2023, 07:14:53 AMI would like to propose that we as a community should have some kind of competition to celebrate this occasion. I would request active board members to have share some suggestions regarding it. Cryptocurrency Trivia Quiz maybe the best possible option since we only have very less time so can create questions regarding cryptocurrency technology, history, names and for the right answers we can share some merits as rewards.Tagging @Heisenberg_Hunter in case if he wants to say something about that.",

I was so happy to participate in the trivia quiz and was surprised to see that he was prepared for it. The reason for my surprise was that I wrote on this topic yesterday and he created the topic yesterday itself. We need users like him on our board. I am out of sMerits and therefore tagging @pakhitheboss & @pawanjain to look into this topic.",
