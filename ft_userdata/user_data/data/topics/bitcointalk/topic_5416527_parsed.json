  "content": "There's the saying that givers never lack, so as such you give because of two things; 1: you have the means to, and 2: it's more blessed to give than to receive. While these factors are being considered, it's still important to note that there are different types of givers who have different motives. Now, I have observed that there are different types of givers and y'all are free to add your findings, but I'd like to talk about 3 peculiar types.  1. The Grudge givers These types always find a reason to complain about everything and nothing when it comes to giving. Whether it's their time, money or what have you. It's not like they won't help out, but it's after a long while, and some end up not doing it. But funny enough, when these kinds are in need, they expect that you should always come through for them.   2.The Duty Givers  These category fall under the \"if I don't do it, who will?\" group. Now, I'm not saying that the idea of being dependable is bad, but they sometimes give just because they feel it's an obligation and as such miss out the true meaning of the act of giving.  And then we have the third group, which is the   3. Givers With Intent Now it's not a bad idea to have a purposes for doing something especially if it's a noble one. But what I've come to understand that people do what they do when it comes to giving, for ulterior motives. We hear of benefit giving; where give A so later on he will do something for you, or you give so people will think highly of you. It's quite sad that these days people have lost the true meaning of giving and replaced it with something else.  What is your reason for giving?",

The Grudge givers    2.The Duty Givers    3. Givers With Intent What is your reason for giving?Many religions believe that you have a reward when you give to people or society. But this must be done must willingly and not grudgingly. it is better you don't give than to give with anger or an unwilling heart. Sometimes when you look around and observe that you are the best person to offer help to someone because others don't have the capacity to assist, then you have to help. It might not be convenient or willing but it becomes a duty. The worst form of giving is giving with the intention of getting something in return. Such a kind of giving is propelled by greed and selfishness. I have seen very poor people giving to the rich because they feel they would get favor in return. Others offer assistance to people because of sex or other benefits.But the best kind of giving is a selfless one. Selfless giving is when you give to that person that lacks the capacity to repay you. When you give to that orphan, poor widow, beggar, the homeless, etc. And you must not announce or show your donations. Giving secretly is another ideal way of giving. According to some religious teaching, you are rewarded when you give without announcing it. it would also save you from criminals, who might feel that you are wealthy because of your giving life.",

      "body": "I think the greatest thought when it comes to giving something beneficial whether it's money, food or talent, or time, is to let it all be absolutely for the sake of God. Without asking them for the same treatment you gave them or the same amount of gifts or even not asking \"thanks\" from them. Because you will be surprised how quickly most people changed after you've done well for them. Some people don't want to recognize you anymore intentionally and some of them will hurt you emotionally. They just don't care because you don't have the same mindset.When you don't intend anything from them, you won't be hurt by any means of changes they will do in the future because you only want to make them happy for the sake of God. I find this helpful and I don't feel annoyed or have any bad feelings whenever this thing happened to me because, in the first place, I only seek the reward from my Lord.",

      "body": "The reality of giving is that you should contribute while hoping for blessings. The common phrase is \"If I have more, I'll donate more.\" You put the horse before the cart, not good. The degree to which you give will decide the degree to which you get. After experiencing the giving spirit, you won't want to leave another life. As a Christian, Jesus urged us to contribute and promised that if we do, it will be returned to us. with the knowledge that giver won't be without.To put it another way, you must be kind to people who are suffering and giving to those who are unable to take care of themselves. According to the Bible, giving to the needy is equivalent to lending to God",

So this alone has been my drive when I see my fellow man pass through pains and not be able to ask for help. Most times I just give without reasons",

I give without a grudge and I believe in the doctrine of the love of Christ for mankind which says In Acts 20:35 It is more blessed to give than to receive. I think giving doesn't reduce what I have it only helps to create more room for more to come my way and it opens doors to another blessing that I may not understand as a human being, My reason for giving is love for mankind because seeing another man in pains gives me much concern so the best I can do is to give whatever that is within my powers in other to help such person.",

If you give everything now, tomorrow may not bring you any help. People who desire to give always consider your capacity to return the favor in the future. If you don't give back when you can, you'll be seen as unappreciative, thus those who are wary of such hurtful statements will usually give back of their own volition.
