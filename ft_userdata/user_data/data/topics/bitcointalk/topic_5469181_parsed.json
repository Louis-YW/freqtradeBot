I've been in the sector for a while now and having carefully followed the weekly trends for the past 2 years or so, it's hard to say the dude was lying. Nowadays, most DeFi projects popping up are without actual use cases and solve no specific problems. I'd like to think my keen eyes don't miss anything but maybe I'm wrong. I want your thoughts on the subject though: what are your favourite defi projects atm and what features make you believe they stand a chance of pumping again this coming bull market?",
