According to the graph, there are 14 states proposed, 2 states are still considering and one state rejected the idea.Quote from: ericckc on January 18, 2025, 03:37:35 AMhttps://bitcoinreservemonitor.com/Quote from: PrivacyG on January 18, 2025, 04:26:59 AMGreat initiative.  I barely ever use codes on the Forum but this sounds like a perfect time to create a table for this Thread with a check for each State that passed a bill with a source next to it and maybe even the amount of Bitcoin or Dollars worth of Bitcoin each State purchases.The site I mentioned above do give the source and amount of Bitcoin each state can purchases.",

We will be looking at how it will go if it can be approved and passed into a bill, and they can start accumulating, which is where the rest of the good news comes in. If the proposal is unable to be approved, it will just remain a mere proposal, but in whichever case it is, it's a good step to start, and let's hope for the best.",

      "body": "It makes sense to start on a smaller scale, at the city and state level. The federal government giving a head start to city and states to accumulate at lower prices, before announcing a bitcoin reserve at the national level makes sense to me.You can add Kentucky and South Dakota to the list. It looks like the number of states with proposals is up to 15 and counting. Even Massachusetts has a proposal for a bitcoin reserve, Elizabeth Warren's state, one of the biggest bitcoin haters there is.I would like to see the look on her face if and when the proposal passes in her state.",

Coinjoins, Mixers and Dex operators will be hunted down and put behind bars. Bitcoin thrives in the hands of common people. Corporate and government money will end up ruining the entire ecosystem.

There is also a lot of discussion about how many states in the United States have already accepted Bitcoin, maybe that will be helpful for him.With all these, they are good indication for US to have more take on bitcoin and this is part of the reasons why many are now still on the claim that we have not reached for the bitcoin last all time high yet, that being said, the more we have the most support from the US over the adoption of bitcoin, then things will go more considerable in other countries because most of them already have set US as their modest standard in taking any decision, with the current president, i thing we should expect for  more than just a reserve of bitcoin in US, not only that, but seeing that its becoming a bitcoin friendly zone the way some others are.",
