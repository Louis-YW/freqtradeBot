  "content": "This has been a hot topic recently but I think it's not necessary to ban mixers because their existence is not actually the problem today. Mixers are legal, they aren't illegal, so, it's no problem for this forum to allow mixers to create ANN thread and have discussion or even promote themselves via forum ads or signature campaign. Google allows you to search bitcoin mixers, right? There are even articles on Yahoo where bitcoin mixers are listed too.To my mind, the problem is that forum doesn't ban mixers until they are officially seized. For example, it was known that Sanctioned mixer Blender.io relaunched as Sinbad.io. There are many proofs in this article against Sinbad.io, i.e. how many millions of dollars were laundered through Blender at first and then through Sinbad. The moment this article was published, forum administrators should have banned Sinbad and closed its ANN, promotion and other related threads. Media and government attention together are enough proof to consider service as illegal to promote on this forum to get rid of further headache.Before Sinbad, Chipmixer was seized and forum could get away without getting named in justice.gov files if administrators banned it in 2019 because there were evidences that Chipmixer was used for money laundering: Binance Hackers Bombard Chipmixer to Launder at Least 4,836 BTC.Yes, believe it or not, the problem starts when you ignore what is publishes about certain mixers. There were mixers earlier, like, [banned mixer] (since 2018) and [banned mixer] (since 2016). I did a research and these mixers have never been mentioned by any media, these mixers haven't been seized and this forum didn't get any problem from these mixers. Are they honeypot? I don't know but at the moment it looks like it's perfectly safe to discuss about them and to it's not harmful from them to promote themselves here. They haven't officially caught any attention from governments.The reason why this attitude is better for this forum is that what would theymos do if tomorrow there comes a casino with ANN thread, runs signature campaign and helps people to launder money? Imagine you read articles that Lazarus laundered money through CasinoX, then another article comes up with title: Russian hackers launder money through CasinoX. If theymos won't ban this CasinoX immediately and wait for its seize, then this forum will be included in another PDF uploaded by justice.gov. Will theymos block discussion about crypto casinos? Will he ban casino signature campaigns? Doesn't make sense, right?I know and understand that it's some kind of censorship but it's better than absolutely banning particular categories. I think that it's not necessary for theymos to ban discussion and promotion of mixers. If forum administration and moderation will react when there is an article about particular mixer or casino or another scam crypto project and ban ANN/promotional threads of these particular projects, they won't be included in justice.gov's pdfs and won't be mentioned anywhere. I think this is a safe and better option.",

So you'd need the majority to come up and agree with reasonable debate as to why it's not necessary to ban them. But I do agree that what you said is a good solution. But remember this: governments and medias also believe Bitcoin is used for the wrong reason, should we ban Bitcoin too?

These are the real reasons!Quote from: digaran on December 16, 2023, 09:17:11 PMgovernments and medias also believe Bitcoin is used for the wrong reason, should we ban Bitcoin too? Then there would be no USA based coinbase and USA based bitcoin mining pool called Foundry USA. Both of these companies are one of the biggest companies in bitcoin industry. I think there is a difference between regular sentence government doesn't like bitcoin and money was laundered through Sinbad.io. Governments don't ban bitcoin, even blackrock got involved into it.Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on December 16, 2023, 09:21:49 PMWe'll survive without mixer campaigns or even threads about mixers; the forum did just fine before they came along, right?I don't care as much about mixer campaigns as their availability and discussion on this forum. This forum has a good trust system, it's easier to pick right mixer on this forum and solve any issue with the help of forum members. Without this forum, it will be super hard to find a good mixer or solve any issue. Any mixer will be able to scam you and there will be nowhere to report them, they'll not have to worry about their trust either.Quote from: yahoo62278 on December 16, 2023, 09:30:15 PMBetter safe than sorry right? Why would you want to risk the forum for a few bucks in a signature campaign? Legal or not, why take the risk? Not sure where there is any reason to think twice about it honestly. Me? Risking forum for a few bucks from sig campaign? You are wrong, thanks god I am from western world. Point of this thread is not really to run signature campaign, it doesn't matter for me if he lets mixers to run signature campaigns or any other kind of promotion. My point is that we shouldn't block mixers from creating ANN thread and from discussion in their threads because it helps people to choose good, trustworthy mixer and since it's not illegal, there is nothing wrong with it. The problem in this case was that theymos didn't ban certain mixers that were laundering money. If new casinos create ANN threads tomorrow and start laundering money and get seized and Interpol metions bitcointalk again in their PDF, casinos will be blocked on this forum, right? So, you know, the problem will easily be solved if we block companies and services on this forum that do something illegal. It's easier to know they do something illegal once they get media's attention. Then, simply ban them on this forum and there won't be any mention of bitcointalk in justice.gov PDF documents.",

Also, I don't seem to see so much wisdom in the analogy you link between m!xers and casinos, they are just two different business models. One is riskier than the other and one is a threat to the world than the other. If the government clamps down on a particular casino, the case will be different, especially when the casino is duly registered. This is not the first time that businesses have paid fines for money laundry and the bosses involved going to jail without affecting their business's operations. The recent case of Binance is an example, have governments dealt with their promoters? That's impossible, it's a different business model, not such that is advertising anonymity. They will deal decisively with the management if found wanting and will get to come up with an ideal punishment. This is because they would of course know the people behind the casino to deal with them. Do they know the people behind m!xers? Common!!! There are some high-level illegality that m!xers are involved in, I don't think it's wise for the forum administration to still allow them.Most of you look at the money, not the integrity and the humanitarian side, but the forum and its management look beyond that.

Itâ€™s bad enough that cryptoâ€™s seen as a hacker and scammerâ€™s safe haven, with mixers being the primary weapon for this. The thing is that in the advent of mixers getting banned and shamed in social media, bitcointalk couldnâ€™t risk the same ridicule and flak, so they have no choice but to actually ban them and prevent such thing from happening.

However, without mixer signature campaigns, there are other campaigns for forum members too so this big call is not the end of forum member to find jobs and get income from campaigns.Quote from: Husires on December 17, 2023, 02:05:23 AMYes, it is possible, and I see that some mixer campaigns have changed their marketing method, but the final blow will be to ban casinos, as this industry, in addition to mixers, represents about 90% of signature campaigns, and then most visits to the forum will be severely reduced, and we may see a very limited number of signature campaigns.I don't see that risk for casinos that accept cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency accepted casinos have their licenses and they are similar to centralized exchanges and they can follow laws, regulations. Mixers are different, they don't want to register license or follow laws but I honestly don't know any guide from government to register a mixer service to get a license.",
