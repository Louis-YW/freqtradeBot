Out of the 7,316 companies, crypto assets, precious metals, and exchange-traded funds worth more than $82 trillion in value, bitcoin is the 12th largest asset worldwide by valuation.Bitcoin's Market Capitalization Compared to Other Top Assets: Leading Crypto Climbs Above Visa, But Lags Behind MetaCrypto assets, specifically bitcoin (BTC), have increased in value this week following the collapse of three major U.S. banks. Over the past 24 hours, bitcoin (BTC) has dropped 6.5% against the U.S. dollar. However, weekly metrics indicate that BTC is up 9.6% week over week. Most of BTC's increase occurred on March 14, when it jumped above the $26K zone to precisely $26,533 at around 9 a.m. (ET) on Tuesday. As of 2:35 p.m. on March 15, bitcoin is exchanging hands for $24,357 per unit....",

I didn't mean a strict comparison with gold and silver regarding volatility.Chip-coins could be set with any value locked in. Anybody could get a blank chip-coin and add original value to it, but once it was there, it would be like a locked wallet that you traded. It's value could be checked by plugging it into a reader to compare it with the blockchain.Nobody could enter bitcoins into the chip-coin in its blank state, except that he owned them in  the blockchain already. But once he 'sent' them to the chip-coin, a hash would be made in the chip-coin and blockchain that didn't have any address to take them out again. Of course, since this is only an idea so far, it might be better to have a method built right into the chip-coin so that a reader could remove the bitcoins therein. We need real Devs to think about all this.Would it be advisable to give the chip-coins an internal destruct mechanism to protect against people who wanted to physically alter them? This, and losing chip-coins, would be like burning them... like the Genesis blocks, until Satoshi moves them.If enough bitcoins were lost or burned, the rest would naturally increase in value, so that the population of the world might have a substantial amount of them by using satoshi's rather than bitcoins. Wallets could be made that could split satoshi's into any number of smaller bits. Of course, the blockchain might need to be adjusted for this.The most important understanding in this whole thing might be, we would be trading wallets rather than bitcoins directly. We could do this right now if we started a whole new kind of blockchain along with the original... an encrypted wallet transfer blockchain, that could both, check the value of the wallet, and be totally encrypted as the current blockchain... perhaps with a hash as the new wallet password every time it changed hands, so the old owner could no longer use it once he gave it up.Just some thoughts.EDIT: Trading wallets rather than trading bitcoins might bring the whole thing out of the domain of government regulations. At least, they would have to start a whole new train of thought to make regulations that would fit wallets.",

      "body": "Good news, goes to show that bitcoin is becoming recognized more than ever, and people are really seeing the viability of bitcoin in the common day scenario, maybe even lead to its global adoption. however, what it boasts in valuation, it lacks in stability. It can't hold a candle in the presence of much more tried and tested assets like gold and silver who have been in the relatively same spot for thousands of years, and have consistently proven themselves a worthy asset to invest and protect the wealth of billions of people in the planet. Although I think that's asking too much from a store of value that hasn't even been in the industry for more than 20 years, especially comparing it to gold and silver who has been directly tied to humanity ever since we started to realize we can mix metals to make shiny, sturdy things.",

If you own a majority stake in a company you still don't get anything that represents that (maybe a piece of paper that'll take you 4 months to a year to sell if the company is valuable enough).Gold and most metals are hard to divide too in the same way, divisibility trumps physical representation imo and likely will for a long time. A newer version of a Casascius coin could resolve the \"no physical representation\" part but I don't know if the technology to make them fully tamper proof is complete (the hologram for a cas coin was suggested to come off without a trace if it was mixed with a solution).",
