      "body": "When I saw the news about the tragedy that took place in South Korea at the Halloween Festival, at first, I really did not understand what was going on. But witnesses and survivors were being interviewed by the news reporter and began explaining how the tragedy took place. I could not believe that more than 150 died and hundreds more were injured in a crowd rush. It is still unclear what may have caused the incident, although local media reported it may have begun when people started filing a narrow alley in one of the city’s prominent party spots the Hamilton Hotel. People began crowding a nearby bar after a celebrity unexpectedly showed up.",

He’s clearly just posting tragedies that have unfortunately occurred around the recent Halloween holidays.Most deaths are tragic & so sad. The deaths highlighted by the OP are no different. May the all rest in peace & God be with their grief stricken families.",
