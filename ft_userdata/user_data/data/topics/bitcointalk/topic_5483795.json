What are large and small transaction in your post?If large and small are their sizes, it means all already.If large and small are values of those transactions, it is different and it seems you misunderstand how Bitcoin blockchain works.Transaction fee is paid by users to Bitcoin miners, who confirm transactions but they don't care how big or small value of that transaction. They only care about transaction size, fee rate and at the end transaction fee they receive.Transaction fee = Transaction size * fee rate.With same transaction size and same fee rate, transaction fee will be the same but transaction value can be either 1 btc or 1,000 btc or even more.https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/transaction-fee",

      "body": "I hope that by large bitcoin transactions taking more space you don’t mean the quantity or amount because that would not be entirely true. The size of a bitcoin transaction is mostly dependent on the number of inputs or outputs used. The input is the number of utxo you combine to send. Bitcoin network treats one utxo as an input, so if there are many UTXOs used in that particular transaction then you will have much inputs which will take a lot of space and will incur more transaction fees. For example if you receive 1 bitcoin in like three separate transactions then you have three UTXO and when trying to spend them bitcoin network protocol will treat it as three inputs which means you will pay higher than sending it if the 1 bitcoin was received in just one transaction. So amount doesn’t really count as size but the utxo actually does with some datas",

      "body": "Every time you make a bitcoin transaction, you broadcast some data. For example, for each input you add to your transaction, you should have a TXID, an index and an unlocking script in the transaction data. Also, for each output you add to your transaction, you should have a value and a locking script. The more inputs or outputs you have in your transaction, the larger data you have to broadcast to the network and the larger data the miner has to include in the blockchain. (The raw transaction should include some other data and what I mentioned above are just some of them.)",

      "body": "I'm not too aquatinted with technical knowledge but from my little understanding naturally anything that is large should require a larger space too. You don't expect a small input to take a large space in the Blockchain. The higher the input the higher the space it takes in the Blockchain and also the higher the tx fee. So, size of input = size of tx fees = transaction space in the Blockchain.Additionally, from what I perceived from the above statement is if 1BTC is spent in an input it takes only a small space because it's just a single input but if spent in different inputs it takes more space. Like; 1 bitcoin to be spent on 5 different addresses will take much space than when it's sent to a single address. Although I may be wrong but that's what I understand from the Bitcoin transactions.",

Thanks!PSI do know that hasing is used, e.g. to verify the integrity of a file.Ok... You've asked an interesting question. You should have just searched it though cause the answers I'm about to give and others have given are all the same with what Google and other search engines would give you.But regardless, Large transactions consume more space on the Blockchain cause it has more inputs and outputs than a small Bitcoin transaction. These inputs and outputs are simply the records of where Bitcoin comes from and where it is going. So, the more these records are, the more the data that needs to be stored on the Blockchain.And then for transaction fees, it is simply the amount of Bitcoin paid as a fee for a transaction. Always from the sender to the miner confirming the transaction. It is calculated like this;Transaction fees = Bitcoin/byte of data.The higher the transaction size, of course, the higher the transaction  fee",
