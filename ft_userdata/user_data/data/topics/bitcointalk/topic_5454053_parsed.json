  "content": "Though Garcia and Lara cannot be considered popular boxers in the boxing community this fight promises a lot of action, both fighters are hungry for recognition and this is the fight that could give that recognition and they have the same style of aggressive and moving forward style.QuoteLara, 40, was elevated as champion after Gennadiy Golovkin relinquished his title. A former 154-pound champion, Lara's impressive résumé includes a controversial decision loss to Paul Williams, a split decision defeat to Canelo Alvarez and a victory over Austin Trout.Garcia (37-3, 21 KOs) is a former unified 140-pound champion and 147-pound titleholder. He rose to prominence with an upset fourth-round TKO victory over Amir Khan in 2012 and followed up with an impressive victory over Lucas Matthysse the following year.They say style makes a fight so we are going to expect a lot of action and less running because both fighters always come to fight so who you got in this fighthttps://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/37443325/erislandy-lara-defend-middleweight-title-vs-danny-garcia-august-5IMAGES FROM box.live",

I don't know who either of these fighters have beaten to be fighting for a world title at middleweight but I guess that is the privilege of being an Al Haymon fighter. I favor Garcia slightly due to being not as old and less washed up but I expect it to be a competitive match.",

The guy is too good at fights and has no fear of any kind of combat and that's why I think the odds are in the favor of him. But, still the competition is going to be a tough one and the winner will be praised for the victory.I know that the odds are in favor of Garcia this time but man the Lara is also a monster in the game and when he fights then he forgets everything about past and performs to his best against the opponent. The fighter is little bit aged and that's a con for him, but still old is gold and who knows if he has a better strategy to own the Garcia. The fight will be really entertaining and the audience will love the match.",

I favor Garcia slightly due to being not as old and less washed up but I expect it to be a competitive match.Yeah, I would say Lara has a clear disadvantage when it comes to age. I mean a 5 years gap from age 35 to age 40 is quite a leap- from a physically strong to a physically weaker body. 35 is no spring chicken as 18 but considering the official \"physical prime\" age for professional boxxing is from 28 years to 35 years old... That puts Garcia at the advantage in this fight.My money is obviously not going to be on Lara. I see Garcia coming out strong. No comparison, really.Not sure if I used the term spring chicken correctly but it'll play.",

So it's a good chance for Danny Garcia to become a world champion again if he beat Lara here. One thing that Lara has advantage is the experience and he is southpaw that might give Garcia a problem.",

I favor Garcia slightly due to being not as old and less washed up but I expect it to be a competitive match.I wouldn't say though that he is a boring fighter, he is one of those Cubans who invade boxing during that that time, including Rigo. And so that is their style of fighting, it's more of a defensive first, to hit their opponents and then not to get him.Quote from: coin-investor on May 26, 2023, 10:33:47 PMLara is one of the fighters that have given Canelo its toughest fights and he could have beaten Canelo if only the judges were not biased, Lara obviously won the fight, but this was 9 years ago checking Lara's last five fights he still has that move and power, but against Garcia who we now is a very aggressive fighter, Lara will be challenged I hope he is still good at his age to stand toe to toe against Garcia who can take the fight even in the final rounds like a fresh boxer.I have Garcia winning by a small margin, but there's a possibility of knockout because both fighters will go toe to toe and all out because this is a championship fight.Right, he is one boxer who schooled Canelo during their fight, unfortunately, the judges are now willing to deter the cash cow that time and so they awarded the fight to Canelo. But after that we haven't heard of Lara, I thought that he has retired after that, but it seems he has been fighting out of the limelight and winning fights as well. But this fight he is fighting a prime Garcia, who has a potent left hook that I think will be his weapon against Lara's defense.",

We do know it; they have trainings and such but our body has limitations as we grow older. On the other hand, Danny has the advantage with experience especially fighting opponents' with the ssme boxing style as Lara. Danny also has more powerful punch over the other which could be another edge for him. But we are talking about pros and championship so we may expect Lara to prepare with such factor in order for him to bag the belt. Would be a good fight but won't be as excited with other title matches. We've seen fights of such and I guess fight would yield to a decision rather than a KO.",

Erislandy is a south paw, so this might give problems to Garcia as well just like in his fight against Spence wherein Spence shift and uses southpaw stance and he had a hard time hitting him with his favorite left hook.But I do agree that one big advantage of Danny Garcia is his youth here. And another interesting fact is that Danny's father is also is as loud mouth as Teo Sr. So we might see him a lot during the hype and marketing of this fight throwing trash talk too.",
