Do you have a plan, for example, to buy and sell real estate using Bitcoin?Second: Investing a group of people in the real estate trade requires the presence of these people in one place so that they can see the properties, examine them, and examine the legal documents related to the properties, so you need partners residing in the same country as you. I do not think that anyone will participate in your investment in real estate while he is in one country and you are in another country.Thirdly, and most importantly, how can people you do not know and who do not know you trust you? Trust is the foundation of the success of any project, basically you don't have anything yet on the ground, so what would make anyone put their money in your hands?",

If the OP is to be transparent in this, it will be a good idea to own a property in UK. Although for reselling purposes. I am not sure how friendly this will be for non UK residents. I have done a business that relates UK from my country and I was frustrated, in the end I lost. Sometimes you would be asked to come over to UK.

If you can refine your idea and make it workable, you may find investors.I remember a project called Max Property or something, don't know if they changed their name by now. They buy real estate and show the ownership of each member based on the token they own. The idea is similar, the members give them money to buy and then they will buy the real estate and manage it. Blockchain and tokens don't give them much edge though, since they request KYC with details that is no different than traditional real estate crowdfunding. At the very least, OP should build an MVP first before he ask for money if he's serious about this.",
