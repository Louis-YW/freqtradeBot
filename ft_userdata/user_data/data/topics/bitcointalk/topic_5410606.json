  "content": "I just found out that some user still got merited after he was banned. Though we know that merit was based on quality post shared to this forum, but I believe that the merit should be sent to another qualified member with good quality posts than being sent it to banned account. I have no problem about being merited if that account is banned because of his/her quality posts, its just like we are throwing merit away to banned account where it can never be sent to anyone.For example : This user feeling sound was reported due to Plagiarism last Aug 4 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1926895.msg60685684#msg60685684 and got 7 merit after he was banned last Aug 5, 2022. See below images.So, I would like to suggest if possible, we can disable this \"merit +\" sign beside \"quote\" button after user was banned to avoid getting merited? I believe that in anyway somehow this can maintain the good flow of merits? What do you think?",

Further, it is unreasonable to expect merit sources to check the status of every user they want to merit using third party tools.The amount of merit being sent to banned accounts and therefore not recirculated is minuscule and not worth worrying about. Most merit sources are sitting with significantly more than this in their stash, not mentioning all the merit sent to inactive accounts (like the 4.5k to Satoshi) or other users who simply don't hand it all back out again.If you think there are good posts going unmerited, then link to them in this thread: [self-moderated] Report unmerited good posts to Merit Source",

Therefore, just get used to the fact that not all people see plagiarism and rush to check it. Because of this, such posts are marked with merit. But you don't have to worry that your posts will be invaluable at a time when such bad guys, just by copying, earn merit faster than everyone else. Enough merits for everyone.As you can see, this account regrets its actions.

I wouldn’t mind being able to decide after seeing a visual cue within the forum itself, but alas, that is not the case (I know there are useful extension to that effect, which I’m not inclined to use). My remeriting sprees are more picky though, and they don’t remerit posts for banned users to the extend it can avoid doing so. Thus the post I merited on the sixth was not remerited on the fifteenth.Note (messing around with data): There is a forum stat that shows Merits sent to permanently banned members in the last 180 days (this one). Whilst the list is incomplete, showing only top senders to permanently banned users, it accounts for 729 sMerits sent to them. Of course this is also a superset of the case depicted in the OP, since it accounts (I believe) for merits sent both before and after the affected accounts were banned.Even so, and using this therefore subset/superset and incomplete stat as a deliberately exaggerated worst case scenario, that would give an average of around 4,05 sMerits per day given to banned accounts, which is pretty small forumwide. Bearing in mind that we’ve sent around 151K sMerits in the last 6 months, the figure in this worst case scenario would be of around 0,48% of all sent sMerits in a 180 day window. Small enough for it to not be statistically significant.",

Merited posts are sign of high quality post. So, there's nothing wrong if a banned user gets a merit if the post is high quality.Quote from: theymos on January 24, 2018, 11:00:11 PM - Highlighting good posts with the \"Merited by\" line.The only problem with meriting a banned user's post is the circulation of merits. It's going to be decreased if shared with banned user but the ratio is too small as shared above.",

Arguably, you could say the same for inactive users like Satoshi and users that have left us permanently like Lauda and there are a host of them out there.They might have left us but there posts didn't and could still offer directives to some users still in the forum.Of course yes, merit helps users grow in ranks but it's also an encouraging factor for good/quality posters and shit/spam posters alike.Meriting a post is also a directive unto others on the type of posts that could be seen as quality. It doesn't matter either a user is banned or not. We don't have any clear definition of quality on the forum and one way to show quality is by meriting it and that would give other low ranked users an insight to what could be seen as a quality post.",

An inactive account as a result of death isn't likely to come back online but that shouldn't stop anyone meriting constructive posts from  deceased members. I tend to see posts merited by reputable members in this forum as simply saying thumbs up. This is why these members won't dare merit posts they feel are substandard because they're to protect their reputation.In a related development, do we also say posts from banned members should be deleted?

So, a banned account's name will definitely fade off and the forum would forget about it.It's rare to get merit for old posts that have sunk into our dozens of post history pages, it really made me think that people wouldn't bother checking a number of banned account profiles just to send them merit. A user who consistently posts daily has a better chance of getting merit especially if the posts are of high quality. This will obviously leave the banned user not having a better chance of getting merit because he or she is no longer actively posting.I can confirm that I rarely get merit due to my ability to post gambling as this is a board that is ignored a lot.
