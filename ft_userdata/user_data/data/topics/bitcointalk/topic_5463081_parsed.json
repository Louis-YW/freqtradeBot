  "content": "Hello all! I wanted to make a thread documenting my journey in real time and let you guys know of my story.I’m a big NFT collector and have a rather large following. One of my community members reached out to me letting me know that I was sent a VIP NFT from “bitcasino.io” I typically don’t pay no attention to these as most are scams but someone from my community told me it’s legit. So I checked out the NFT and it was this:https://i.imgur.com/muTizlY.pngI then did a few quick google searches just to make sure the site was legit and wasn't some wallet draining website. Everything looked good!I then sign up using the wallet that the NFT was sent too and was pleasently suprised how easy it was. I signed up, clicked claim reward and boom $5,000 in my account. I checked the \"Rewards\" area and they had a nifty bar showing me how far along I was until I completed my \"Rollover\" and could withdraw whatever balance I had.So I started gambling with the $5,000 bonus I received from the NFT... I went to Wanted Dead or Alive slot...Was up and down after about 15 minutes was down around $300, then suddenly I hit a DUEL DUEL DUEL BONUS!Here is a replay of my Bonus:https://replay.hacksawgaming.com/?roundid=6620858616&partner=132&language=enI HIT FOR $120,000 !!!!So after being in complete aw for a few moments, I just thought to myself there is no way this is real. I still needed to wager $40,000 to complete my wager requirement to be able to withdraw.. But since I had $120,000 in balance this was rather easy.. I did 4 $10,000 sweet bonanza buys lost around $20,000. So I completed the wager and submited a withdraw for $99,000!!!!Here are a few screenshots:The site telling me how much I needed to wager:https://i.imgur.com/jk5O6xD.pngWhat Appeared after completing the wager (the money was instantly moved to my \"real\" balance:https://i.imgur.com/hX4Sgvs.pngEdit:Here is a link to their promotion I took part of:https://bitcasino.io/info/join-bitcasino-io-now-and-become-a-vip?ref=stnftdropTLDR:- Received NFT sent from Bitcasino to become a VIP and receive $5,000 FREE with a 10x Rollover.- Was gambling with the $5,000 and hit a slot win for $120,000.- Completed rollover put in withdraw.- Now waiting for payout. UPDATE:- I was paid in full by bitcasino.io- Withdrawl took 3 days but I hit on a Friday and it was the weekend the following days!- Have nothing bad or negative to say about the casino at all. They could have tried to find a reason not to pay me but never did. Big vouch!",

I will keep this thread updated with how they respond, and if I receive my winnings or not!!I am so excited but my gut is telling me this is too good to be true but we shall see! Thank you guys for taking time to read!any update? another 12 hours(almost) have passed since you posted, would be nice to hear if there is an update. I have a feeling that you'd be asked to do a KYC verification(I am not certain though), $99k is a huge amount of money and they would probably want to verify that the gambler didn't break any of their rules. congrats on your EPIC WIN, I hope everything goes well.",

I'm not sure if there is a max payout or whatnot, ~Judging from the provided evidence, it is a true story. The support hasn't asked him to pass the KYC verification yet. The security check up for his pending withdrawal may take a bit long time as it is the weekend. There is no max payout limit rules in the terms of the promo in which OP has participated. And the terms say this:Quote from: https://bitcasino.io/info/join-bitcasino-io-now-and-become-a-vip5. You can keep track of your wagering requirement on the Rewards page. Once you complete the wagering requirement, your remaining funds in the bonus are automatically transferred to your account cash balance.@OP, You will receive your withdrawal if you haven't violated the promo terms and general terms and conditions. You may send a PM to Bitcasino.io Support if the waiting time become very longer. Otherwise, post the link of this thread in Bitcasino.io ANN thread as Little Mouse has suggested above.",

Please get yourself out of this kind of thought. A lot of casinos have a good habit of selective scamming and we have seen this a lot of times here, even with reputed casinos. The thing is they bring some stupid/weird excuse not to pay the winnings. They will find some shit terms and conditions when they will see a huge winner. So, don't always trust the casinos.However, I believe Bitcasino will act on its reputation and payout the honest winning. Will have an eye here to check what happens. OP please make sure to update the thread.",

You're really a lucky gambler you are comfortable that there is no issue with your withdrawal so I don't see any reason why you're not going to receive your withdrawal, this is the main reason why I advise and recommend people to only play in a reputable casino, you really don't know if you're going to have a massive hit and win a huge amount of money, I'm sure you're going to get it and you can celebrate with your friend and post and even recommend BITCASINO.IO.",

They have their owwn reason but as long as you are not violating any rule under their uthority, then there should be nothing to worry about. There are times wherein freezing is being implied to avoid money laundering especially if a huge amount of noney will be withdrawn from their platform. KYC on the other hand would be to limit eaasily getting your money from their platforms under the concept of hacked accounts. If there are delays then just be consistent to your follow ups. They'd pay you for sure and also, with reputable one's they won't be pushed into an edge where they would scam a single win in exchange for long term development as long as hope is there.",

Congrats on your big win.Exactly.Big casinos can pay whatever amount you win as long as you have nothing to hide which from what you are describing here it appears to be so.The big casinos do not care for that amount,for us gambler near 100.000 dollars may be a very big amount but for the big casinos that amount is completely irrelevant compared to what they profit in the long run.So congrats for your win,be patient and do the KYC which most likely will need to be done an happily receive the payout.Do not keep playing while you wait for your payout as this may result in losing all the money and is a technique most casinos do to delay the payment so the gamblers can keep playing risking to lose it all.",
