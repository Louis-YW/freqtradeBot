I looked to see if D'cent has an official ANN thread on this forum to suggest that you post your offer there. Maybe someone interested in buying it could see your post in their ANN thread. But it looks like they don't have an announcement thread on Bitcointalk.If you are still giving it away, you can always try to find someone on their social media channels.Facebookhttps://www.facebook.com/DcentWalletGlobalTwitterhttps://twitter.com/DCENTwalletsYouTubehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKnYqiM3g3iaaAKcRZf-kbA",

Rather than using a traditional mnemonic code, the private key is backed up using state-of-the-art encryption technology, which securely transfers the private key to a spare Backup Card. This method is both easy to use and highly secure, giving users peace of mind that their assets are protected.The Backup Card is a hardware wallet with no data inside the secure chipset and it is used for creating the exact same clone of your All-in-One Wallet.   https://userguide.dcentwallet.com/card-wallet/dcent-backup-card-wallet-recoveryQuote from: NotATether on June 27, 2023, 12:12:52 PM considering that they're probably using cheaper parts than the kind of stuff found in smartphones.The information mentioned is Biometrics Fingerprint Sensor Resolution160 x 160 Pixels With 8 bit Depth, which looks traditional and may help in recognizing the fingerprint just like on your phone.",

It is a very central method in case the device is lost or damaged, and with it being closed source, no one will risk using it. Whoever uses this hardware wallet or considers purchasing it, should probably think of getting and setting up a backup card as well. That's the way to protect your wallet in case something happens to the main card. I wonder if users ever get to see their private keys somewhere in the client or if they remain in the dark forever and have to completely rely on D'cent when it comes to their crypto.",

Somehow I doubt that on this wallet it will work much better.And closed source is big disadvantage, especially when it's not well known wallet with good reputation.",

You're safe, they're protecting you. I appreciate the irony and sarcasm. But if some newbies are reading this and think to themselves that it's a great opportunity to get a good hardware wallet for a fraction of the price, they ought to think again. If they have no way to access their keys, they must know that their ability to transact with their coins depends on whether D'cent and the entire ecosystem built around it still works. If it stops working, you lose access to your coins. Closed-source has many drawbacks, but closed-source and centralized is significantly more dangerous.",

If you're interested, post here or PM.Since many people who visit this board have some security awareness or being skeptical, i doubt they would waste their money on this hardware wallet. In addition, looking at critical review at their Amazon page[1] would make people re-consider their choice. But few days ago i saw announcement about a website[1] where they review many service and some hardware wallet. If you'd rather not see that discount code wasted, you could offer them your code.[1] https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07P3XZKWV?filterByStar=critical&reviewerType=avp_only_reviews[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5458268.0",
