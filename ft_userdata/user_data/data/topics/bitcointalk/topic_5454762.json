  "content": "Hi everyone!I'm writing to know your opinion about the LTC halving. I'm currently holding about 90% in bitcoin, 5% in Solana and 5% in USDC.During the last days I've found this article: https://cointelegraph.com/news/litecoin-price-poised-for-700-gains-vs-bitcoin-says-charlie-lee where Charlie Lee says it could could do 700% vs. Bitcoin.So I've been thinking in swapping all my BTC into LTC and wait for the halving... I wouldn't expect it to do 700% but if it does 200% I would happily sell back for Bitcoin.I was waiting for the Bitcoin halving to be honest, but if I can grab this halving, duplicate my bitcoin and then grab the bitcoin halving it would be great.What are your thoughts on this?Thanks a lot in advance!Kind regards;Chris",

So you don't expect the LTC vs BTC price to increase during or after the LTC halving? Shall I keep my savings in BTC?The LTC price seems to be still low considering the incomming halving... 1 LTC = 0.0035 BTC right now...Thank you!",

There is also a lot of distribution volume between 0.004 and 0.005 BTC right now that I don't see Litecoin breaking through very easily, even with a halving on the horizon. I do acknowledge that in 2019 Litecoin doubled in price against BTC during the halving period, so it clearly remains possible to outperform Bitcoin in the short-term, but otherwise let's not forget that Litecoin is still around 80% from the previous halving, so go figrure...TL:DR: LTC/BTC is only ever a short-term trade opportunity, potentially around the halving, but never a good long-term investment",

Increase your LTC halving while lowering your BTC holding at least to 60% which I think is already an ideal holdings.

So if I'm the OP, maybe just invest a couple to Litecoin but you have to be very careful to monitor the price right after the halving so that you can at least time the market and sell at the right time in order to make the profit.Still for us the majority here will rather have put their money on Bitcoin for long term.",

The transaction fees in there is most used in business transaction since it has it's own blockchain and the transaction fee is very low compare to btc or eth. Halving a coin would be a good consideration but for me it is still te usage and its fundamentals. You can stack on both LTC and BTC. If the timing it is that you were asking, you must consider technical analysis.",
