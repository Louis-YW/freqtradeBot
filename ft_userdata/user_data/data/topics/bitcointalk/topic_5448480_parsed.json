Now, if the NFT is about Elon Musk and your aim to just get only his attention, Who's gonna buy them?",

Furthermore , before creating any type of NFTs, you have to explore this field and check successful projects  then set a strategy, roadmap  work on it. Also, it is essential to cooperate with a marketing agency, you need to build attention (HYPE) to attract buyers In fact, the marketplace is full of NFTs and unfortunately only minority are successful due to a plenty of causes, most of them are looking for quick cash,  they don’t even have a roadmap neither an active community and added value.  The repetition is the main common point between all the projects. In my opinion, this field is no longer profitable. It would be perilous if you start an NFT project or metaverse and invest a large amount of money on unguaranteed earnings.",

That is the modus operandi used by several celebrities when launching NFTs. One of the most recent ones was Donald Trump. And to say the truth, that is the only reasonable way to launch NFTs.

Honestly, even if he's too damn rich and has got a lot of money and stocks of his companies, I doubt it that he's willing to spend some money with these avatar NFTs for which he can just use the avatars and icons of Dogecoin or Shiba dog. And if you're going to sell him his own image, do you think that's reasonable if he can just take a selfie of himself and he's the one to sell it to you, I guess that's more likely to happen than you try to sell him his own images. NFT these days are almost out of league because of the bear market. Even if some still remaining to be relevant and still quite popular, it's leading likely the same where ICOs have went.",

Elon Musk is very well known businessman and he's not into good thing on sight since what matter him the most is to multiply his money. I don't see him get an interest about NFT and maybe he didn't find it worthy to spend he's millions there. Also he can just hire some people to make a avatar for him at more cheaper price rather than paying for a pic worth thousands or even million.",

The value of an NFT is determined by various factors such as the uniqueness of the collection, the quality of the images, the demand for the collection, and the current market conditions. It is also important to note that the value of NFTs can be highly volatile and subject to change over time. Ultimately, the price that Elon Musk would be willing to pay for an NFT collection of his images would depend on his personal interest and perception of the collection's value.",

Most of the NFTs are just a piece of art, and millions of such art pieces are available on stock photography sites.

Truth is bitter but we must have to swallow it either willingly or unwillingly. He is a business minded person who works day and night to earn more and more money so he can work on those amazing projects that very few people can even think of.

If you want elon musk to notice you then, you have to make those nft in forms of meme with twitter theme and his recent obsession which is twitter blue.I have seen elon musk sharing memes in regards to him not caring about what people's opinion are but they have to pay the $8 fee to get the verification sticker so making an nft in that regards might get his attention. elon musk is a very funny guy and he might just tweet one of those nft if he finds them funny.But as the nft market is concerned at the moment, there isn't much hype and you won't be getting attention creating a collection at the moment. Maybe the op should wait until the hype of nft returns before he can adventure into that market.",

But maybe if there's collaboration coming from famous guys around we can see this Nft interest might happen.
