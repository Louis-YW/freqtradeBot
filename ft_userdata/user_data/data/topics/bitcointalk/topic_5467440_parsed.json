As we all know, the crypto space is a large eco system, filled with different types of cryptocurrency and Blockchain related. At first, one would be confused where to start from because they are numerous things you have to learn. The best way I blended into Bitcoin world was my agility to learn and understand various factors that were relevant before attempting to start investment. Alot of people learn from the wrong source, which of course leaves them with a wrong idea of how everything works. So far I have had the best experience with Bitcoin compare to when I was newbie and at such I would advice all newbies to who are ready to gasp hold of the Bitcoin technology to be open minded and ready to learn. These no knowledge wasted the more you read, the more knowledge you aquire. I always had this belief that in life, nothing good comes without adding any effort. The major cause of this idea of get rich scheme are people who goes around finding potential newbies to steal from. They teach Bitcoin investment in a wrong way telling others that they can make thousand of dollars within couple of hours or a day which is not how Bitcoin works. I have experienced this alot of times before now, but even with the little knowledge I had back then, I always ignore anything that sounded too good to be true. Bitcoin investment takes a gradual process in acquiring profits and without proper knowledge, this will not be possible.",

The more I understood about how the protocol works, its incentive structure, main value proposition, and its Ethos, the more I understood that it's something that we need to own as a back up/fall back in case the current financial system collapses.Plus it probably slowed down the learning process, but it was not to a great extent.",

Did you also have the \"get rich quick\" mindset. I bet it slowed down your learning process.We have been sharing experience here even before you join but since you want to take us back and talk about it again, let discuss something about newbies still trying to figure things out. Unfortunately, you didn't specify in your thread as to whether you are talking about the forum or the crypto entirely. By the way, it has never been easy for any upcoming individual which we normally refer to as newbies. As a newbie who's still trying to figure out things, you're advice to keep calm, observe and learn before you begin to take any action. If it's in this forum, as a newbie, you should read about the forum rules and as well as asking questions when necessary. On the other hand, if it's about crypto currency entirely, you are to learn from the experts, do personal research before any investment.No one is born as an expert, we were all once a newbie before progressing from one level to another and that's one more reason you should not feel discouraged being a newbie but rather focus on achieving your goals.",

In my opinion, because the volatility of cryptocurrency is huge and if we can make the best use of it, it will help us shorten the path to wealth somewhat. But everything has its price, we can shorten the path to getting rich but in return we will take more risks than others, sonot everyone will choose this path.",

I bet it slowed down your learning process.I want to make this clear that, many newbies have these doubts often regarding the same. They think that they will become rich overnight by investing in Bitcoins. It we see then practically this is possible but you need to understand that, in order to get maximum profits in shorter period of time, you need to take high level of risks. These type of risk can make you poor also in overnight. So the amount of money you will make completely depends on you. If your risk intake is high, you will make good money else learn things properly and go for slow yet steady profits.",

To answer your question. I have no other option left, I started looking for money online and I have joined several Hyip networks, I have tried every other ways to make money online and crypto is the only one that works and it actually caught my attention more. My advice to all crypto beginners is to take their time to learn about crypto and blockchain, it's not something they can learn within a week, there are just so many things to know about, and there are many easy mistakes they can make. Everyone have the get rich quick mindset these days, but that does not always work, the only way to get rich quickly is by getting involved in illicit activities, and such people don't believe in investments.",

With the correct knowledge you can be a day trader or also a miner. It is also possible to earn in bitcoin while rendering services like article writing, whitepaper writing, crypto programming and lots more. In a nutshell, there are alot of opportunities in the cryptocurrency industry but you need to learn first before you can earn. That is my surest advice to newcomers in the industry.

Engaging myself in discussions where I can share my own knowledge and learn from others at the same time has helped me adjust and blend into this space. However, I also needed to take each post and statement given by others with a grain of salt and do my own research to see if what they have stated is true and can be relied on as it is easier to survive in this space if we know how to assess the reliableness and credibility of an idea, statement, or news before making a decision or action regarding it.

I recommend such newbies to be active on this forum and read as many threads as possible and whenever he/she wants to know about something then he/she should not hesitate to create his/her own threads and ask about those things. Another advice to such newbie is to read some good books about Bitcoin and its history and also learn about personal wallets and their security before investing in Bitcoin.Quote from: Hewlet on September 20, 2023, 10:33:08 AM4.

I think everyone want to have financial freedom and that's what I consider as get rich mindset, and such mindset won't be a burden for you in learning process. But if someone is having that \"get rich quick\" mindset then that person will never pay much attention to anything and would try his/her best to find ways to get rich as soon as possible. Those people will consider Bitcoin as a money tree and they really don't understand the real purpose of Bitcoin.",

Did you also have the \"get rich quick\" mindset. I bet it slowed down your learning process.Telling the journey explicitly and explicitly to describe yourself in crypto I don't think it's too important because in the end answer number 2 can be connected to the first answer, especially the reason why we mingle in this forum then it is clear that the answer is the same pleasure for bitcoin so that it makes us more comfortable in interaction and sharing experiences and knowledge in order to find a new thing and convince ourselves that we are not on the wrong track.As for advice for beginners who are looking further into crypto, especially bitcoin, this is a forum that I think is worthy of being a reference especially in this forum we can discuss well what we don't understand so that it can be straightened out rather than just looking for references from one direction such as google, although that is good but I think it would be more comfortable if new knowledge was carried out in 2 directions where we can ask freely anything about crypto and bitcoin as long as the question is directed.On the other hand, when we really want to be serious about crypto then it is certain that learning and confidence must be fertilised from the start so that we are really sure that this is the right step to take.",
