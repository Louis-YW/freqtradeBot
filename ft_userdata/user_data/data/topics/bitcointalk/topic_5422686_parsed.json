  "content": "hi all, since my SPX36 had some units that tended to overheat I thought I'd open it and replace the thermal paste which by now had become dry and faulty. I used 0.5mm thermal pads as what was left of the old ones didn't seem to have any thicker. Today I put it into operation and not with a little surprise I notice that all the units go beyond 90° as if I had made the situation worse.Di seguito le foto:Do you think I have the wrong thickness? Or did I use the wrong material? I bought some generic pads from amazon.Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me.",

I used 0.5mm thermal pads as what was left of the old ones didn't seem to have any thicker. Today I put it into operation and not with a little surprise I notice that all the units go beyond 90° as if I had made the situation worse.Have you decided to use thermal pads instead of thermal paste?What is the thermal conductivity of your thermal pads?If there was thermal paste with thermal pads, then you need to do the same, but if there were thermal pads, then you need to use the same thickness. I usually measure it from the edge of the thermal pad that is not under pressure.",

Now since the pads haven't worked I'm starting to think it's actually either thermal paste so aged it's become solid.By now I've already disassembled everything in a rage, I'll try the thermal paste which is much more hasty to apply.Will update.There is very little about the SPX on the net",

For longer distances, probably thermal pads will be better. Dried thermal paste and thermal pads are different when viewed from the outside. I measure the thickness at the edge of the thermal pad, because the thermal pad is generally always larger than the chip size.",

For non-hot graphics cards, miners usually use the Chinese equivalent of the GD 900, but if you have achieved good results with the MX4, and you are satisfied with its price, then everything is in order.https://www.wepc.com/reviews/best-thermal-paste/",

The oc is automatic and changes frequencies automatically. Some asics are hotter than others, probably due to layout.A couple of those bad boys are getting pretty hot.  If you're happy with it that's fine, but making sure that a good connection with the heatsinks is occurring might be a good idea.  I've never used thermal pads and have always been a paste (pasta?) guy.  It just seems to work better.  I'm glad you've come to the same conclusion (seemingly) and that you were able to get this running.  I would be a little concerned about a couple of those ASIC temps, but they seem to be in the minority so hopefully even if they do burn out you'll still be able to operate the miner fine.  Good luck!",
