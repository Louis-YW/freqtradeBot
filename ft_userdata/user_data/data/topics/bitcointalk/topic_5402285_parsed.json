I suggest you explore some of the popular staking platforms if you are searching for coins for passive earnings. You have to be careful, though, because there are a lot of scam tokens out there that promise 100% APY just to lure people into their pool.",

During this drastic downward trend, it's best not to be too tempted by altcoins. Because the market is still going to make corrections. You could say the bear market is in a confusing zone. If you intend to take a position, I wouldn't be too sure of a guaranteed profit in the short term.",

Everything constant always turns into floating, because projects can't pay out rewards all the time regardless of their market condition. You can try looking for conditionally constant ways to make money, like staking long-established projects that give a real APY of around 5-7%, for example. This is better in the long run than projects which give e.g. 1000% APY at the start and then start cutting rates after a while. This is normal practice for attracting liquidity providers.",

For example, there goes the beacon chain of Ethereum 2.0 on Binance. The reward is very low but it's up to you whether you trust it or not.There are many choices if it's about staking and honestly, I'm going to hit a few of them when my portfolio is enough. I want to get some decent passive income through it but not yet for now. I still have to save as much as I can to at least have a better return rate with their APYs. It's just a low APY but I like what I'm doing and I have researched it so, I guess I'm ready for it and if I fail, not a problem as it's part of the risk.",

I agree with your point, but if you do not want to stake unstable coins which are very risky in this time of bear market, you can still stake coins like USDT, USDC or DIA which are stable coins and you will get your reward for making your coin active in a pool. During bull market you can also stake unstable coins like Ether.",

During bull market you can also stake unstable coins like Ether.The staking rewards for stablecoins are not that high, considering that they are usually not printed to pay you, that means that people you gave that money to, needs to find a way to make you money, either via trading fee, or some other method, but they need to find a way to pay you nonetheless.So, I do not see that type of staking as riskless. Things like Cake for example, have a staking feature which means that you will stake, and more will be printed to pay towards people who stake it, and the dex is working towards making sure that people who stake or LP end up getting paid based on how much they stake. That's a bit more sustainable to me.",

The most dominant trend in the crypto currency space is that you should do your own research always (dyor). I call is the most dominant trend because you have zero excuses not to do so, and no matter how you avoid doing it, you will learn good lessons on crypto and go back to basics which is (dyor). On the other hand, any token that promises you excess reward for holding them (auto stake) would not give you desired profits.

Do you mean contact rewards when you are buying the altcoins and then you will get the constant rewards? If this, it means no because the rewards or profits to get will depend on the price rate when we bought and price rate when we sell. So it will depend on the return that we take. But if you mean that when we are buying altcoins and they are offering like farming or staking, some of platforms give us the constant rewards, but sometimes, the rewards may not be high. On the other hand, if you mean likely the property investment, just forget it, because crypto investment is very different.Quote from: JeromeTash on June 12, 2022, 08:51:26 PMLooks like you are looking for ponzi coins or shitcoins that offer staking rewards.
