(is that official store?)Yes.Quote from: Mistx on November 15, 2022, 04:40:28 PM1.We are generating Seedphrase to Ledger not for Bitcoin,ethereum,bnb etc for example (Dosent that mean they have to store our btc/eth seeds somehow?)No, the seed should not leave the device (and you should not enter it anywhere else than physical backups safely stored - paper, steel, whatever)However, there are being discussed theoretical ways a malicious hardware wallet could steal your money, but those are theoretical discussions.Ledger doesn't have the best reputation because of hardware problems (especially battery issues on Nano X) and sloppy handling of user data (to be overly nice in explaining that), but I do have a Nano S and it's working very good for years (and never lost a penny).Quote from: Mistx on November 15, 2022, 04:40:28 PM2.What if they went bankrupt and software will be abadoned dosent that mean we wont have access to our funds?As long as your hardware wallet works, you can use it. It's not only their wallet you can use the HW with (I use my Nano S with Electrum for Bitcoin).Even more, the seed is pretty much universal and you can put it into another hardware wallet or software wallet (although the second option is less safe).Quote from: Mistx on November 15, 2022, 04:40:28 PM3.Lets says i have keylogger or anything related to it on my Phone (And connect nano x with bluetooth) and i would like to send from ledger to exchange some BTCs dosent that mean \"Virus\" will be able to swap my sending address or generate new transaction to the hackers address?The Ledger device's screen will show the addresses and you (really) should check them carefully. And then you'll be fine/you'll detect if there are surprises.Quote from: Mistx on November 15, 2022, 04:40:28 PM4.And how can i verify thats while Ledger nano X During production didnt get any thing \"additional\"(by it workers not the company while compiling Ledger)This part you can't. You have to trust them. This is why theoretical exploits are being discussed; trust is a bitch.Edit: And this is especially true in case of hardware wallets with closed source (like Ledger). There are open source options though. See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5416497.0",

Storing seeds and private keys digitally is not recommended. You should write it down on paper and store it in 3 separate geographical locations if possible. It's much easier to make backups of seeds than it is of private keys. Maybe it's worth considering using Electrum for your Bitcoin because with that app, you get a 12-word seed to back up. That's unless you are insisting on having a full-node client. If you have to use USB drives for sensitive data (again, not recommended), at least encrypt and/or password-protect the files. Your wallets are not offline if your computers are connected to the internet and you use them to sync and download the latest blocks. Did I understand correctly that you are planning to use 4 different PCs for each of your wallet or are we talking about 4 SSDs on the same computer? And will those computers be used for any other activities besides holding your software wallets and syncing with the blockchain? Are they clean with freshly installed OSs or have you use them in the past for other stuff?Quote from: Mistx on November 15, 2022, 04:40:28 PM1.We are generating Seedphrase to Ledger not for Bitcoin,ethereum,bnb etc for example (Dosent that mean they have to store our btc/eth seeds somehow?) Seeds and private keys remain on the device all all times. Ledger uses secure element chips in their hardware wallets, and sensitive data doesn't leave those chips. The seed is only shown to you once during the setup process. Once that is done and you have made a backup of it, you can't see it ever again. You can't see the seed in the native Ledger Live app.Quote from: Mistx on November 15, 2022, 04:40:28 PM2.What if they went bankrupt and software will be abadoned dosent that mean we wont have access to our funds? No. Wallets that generate BIP-39 compatible seeds (like Ledger in this case) can be recovered in other software or hardware wallets. If your device breaks, Ledger ceases to exist as a company, or your computer where the software/hardware is used malfunctions, you have your seed backups to rely on. The Ledger is just a hardware device that keeps your private keys in the secure element and signs transactions for you.  Quote from: Mistx on November 15, 2022, 04:40:28 PM3.Lets says i have keylogger or anything related to it on my Phone (And connect nano x with bluetooth) and i would like to send from ledger to exchange some BTCs dosent that mean \"Virus\" will be able to swap my sending address or generate new transaction to the hackers address? Keyloggers don't swap addresses. They record and log your activities, like the things you write on your keyboard, they can take screenshots of what is on your screen, etc. This data gets stolen and sent to a malicious party. But like I mentioned above, your recovery phrase is never visible in a software environment, it never leaves the safety of the device, which means there is nothing for the keylogger to log. You also can't view or copy your private keys because they are also always on the secure element. So again, the keylogger has nothing to steal.Clipboard malware is a different threat though. In theory, they can swap your legit address for one that belongs to a hacker. But that happens on a software level. When you make a transaction with a hardware wallet, all the information has to be checked and verified on the screen of that hardware device. Your malware can infect your computer, but I have never heard of a clipboard malware that can infect and modify the transaction details that are shown on the screen of your hardware wallet. Always confirm that the information is identical to what the Ledger shows. If you need to send a transaction to someone and you receive an address to pay to, a clipboard malware can replace that address when you copy it. When it's pasted into a software it can be a different address. It's your job to check that the pasted address (that will receive the coins) as well as the amounts and fees match with the one the other party gave you. If they don't, don't make the transaction. A hardware wallet can't protect you in this particular situation. If the other party makes a similar mistake and sends you the wrong BTC address, it's their fault.  Quote from: Mistx on November 15, 2022, 04:40:28 PM4.And how can i verify thats while Ledger nano X During production didnt get any thing \"additional\"(by it workers not the company while compiling Ledger) When we are talking about Ledger hardware wallets, you can't.

The easiest and cheapest way is to flash https://tails.boum.org/ to a USB drive, boot your laptop or PC off that disk. The computer should start without internet access (still, if you prefer, remove the WiFi card and unplug Ethernet) and have Electrum wallet preinstalled.You can then create a fresh wallet in Electrum, while fully offline, write down your seed phrase (12 or 24 words) multiple times as well as a few addresses from your 'Addresses' tab.It is advised to check your backups, i.e. maybe the next day, boot your PC off that Tails USB again, open Electrum and restore your seed phrase. Then check that the addresses it displays match what you had written down previously.When that's done, you can format the USB drive. Now, whenever you buy BTC, send it to one of those addresses. To spend them in the future, you will need to use 2 PCs; one online (with internet access) to create a spending transaction and broadcast it, and the other one booted off Tails OS on a USB drive, where you import the seed phrase, the prepared transaction and sign it. The signed transaction is then transferred to the online PC for broadcast to the network.Alternatively, this can be done with a single machine, rebooting into Tails OS on USB and your main OS on your hard drive; storing the partially signed PSBT on a second USB drive.TL;DR: If you don't want to pay for and trust (though trust can be minimized) a hardware wallet for larger sums of BTC, you need to boot an offline Linux distro like Tails OS with a light Bitcoin wallet preinstalled that suffices to create a seed and receiving addresses.If you do trust a hardware wallet and this process sounds too complicated, you probably want to look at https://trezor.io/ Model T or https://keyst.one/ Keystone. I'd recommend Passport Batch 2, but it's Bitcoin-only.These devices make it incredibly easy to get set up and running securely.",
