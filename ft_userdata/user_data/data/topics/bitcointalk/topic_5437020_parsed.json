      "body": "as many people should know99.99% of NFT are not worth what they are marketted atits simple as previous over priced marketted things:selling a UK 50p coin for £50 on ebay, where, emphasis: the seller and buyer are the same person. to set a fake over priced amount and fake demand. then find a sucker to pay similar price for something worth only 50pwhen you look at a NFT find a compatible real world example to price discover real valueEG a college guy doing street art cartoons using ink on canvas in tourist locations. where they draw unique pieces for each paying tourist (milkshake amount or restaurant 'meal for 2' sort of amount)that said NFT do have some real good functionality. for when NFT are used properly. but dont be blinded by the silly market prices silly people promote",

And listen to investment advices from someone without ANY proof?Please show the transactions and prove they are your wallets and we can talk.Also most of the BAYCs and OG NFT holders hang around with others in twitter, so what's your twitter handle?You know i can make those claims too. In fact, without proof anyone can. You can also dm me your proof in twitter -> I am @nftcollector in there",
