  "content": "Subject covers it.Over the years I have had many issues scanning QR codes, but recently (say 4 years) it seems to have gotten better.Now, it seems to be getting worse again for certain wallets.I have a few wallets on my phone, I use different ones for different reasons. But at times, with the same QR code on the same screen one wallet will scan it with no problems and another will not unless I crank the brightness to 11 and get it at the perfect angle. Just wondering if after a year it's time to buy my next phone or are there other people seeing this issue too?-Dave",

Check if your phone has an option to adjust brightness to a setting though - mine did without me knowing it would so I don't know if it's standard now or not. I find it strange that a lot of exchanges crank up your brightness for you but wallet apps don't - it might be something to suggest to them as an improvement for the apps you use.I normally assume it's the thing scanning the qr code that's the problem rather than the thing displaying it. If you're using a scanner that's meaning your phone is facing a screen then it's going to have glare issues from that - and that's not an issue with your phone unless your brightness is too low.I'm kinda surprised nfc or other sharing tools aren't in higher demand than qr codes now - they're already quite an old technology imo. It's generally easier to scan a qr code on your phone and input something on a website than it is to try to get something to scan your phone.",

With NFC (or anything that can transmit) there is some form or greater risk according to some people. But, it's a hot wallet on a phone so there is that too.What I just can't fathom the fact that when I wanted to pay someone for 1/2 of breakfast, blue wallet would not scan the QR, Zeus would not scan it, but Wallet Of Satoshi and poof done. But, at other times WoS won't scan but blue wallet will. And so on. Just trying to figure out if it's my phone, or if other people see it too. I can't see me be the only one. I know other people who only have 1 wallet on their phone have said that at times they can't scan some QR codes. But was looking to see if anyone like me with multiple wallets find some work and some don't.-Dave",

As I said some apps would flat out not scan it but WoS did in under a second. Earlier in the week I was trying to pay a regular BTCPay invoice but no matter what I did my phone would not scan it on my daily use laptop. I took a screenshot and emailed it to myself and opened it on my home desktop and it worked. And my laptop screen is a newer and better then these ancient monitors I have here.A couple of hours later I loaned someone here some BTC, he posted an address I copied it to mempool.space so I could get a QR code. And on that very same laptop with that very same phone that would not scan the other QR it worked. But, using a different app. Going back to blue wallet it would not scan. Went back to the 1st app and it worked. Tried to scan a different address in blue wallet and it worked??So, we have 3 votes it's me / my phone. And 1 vote of yeah it happens to me too.Lets see what others say.The phone is a OnePlus Nord N10 5G about 15 months old. Not the best, not the worst. -Dave",

      "body": "Great topic idea! I personally noticed (and experimented a bit) that multiple fast-switching QR codes are generally picked up better than fewer, higher density QR codes.If a wallet works better, it's probably because it uses QR codes with fewer pixels. Even if you increase the on-screen size of a 'large' QR code, devices have a harder time recognizing it than a tiny, low-density code.My theory is that it's partly due to scanning monitors instead of printed QR codes (as in a restaurant or on a wall). Not only do you usually have less light indoors; maybe try taking a picture of your PC screen with your phone and vice-versa to see how terrible they turn out. The shutter speed and screen refresh rate are out of sync, you could get glare based on the screen's surface finish and reflections from light sources. Add to that a potentially too bright backlight and you end up with a whole bunch of potential for issues.The solution which works beautifully for me, is using 'smaller' QR codes. On both of my Passports, I always set the QR codes to the smallest size and PCs pick them up super fast, even in the worst conditions.In its latest release, Sparrow added the ability to change the QR code size as well, which I found improved detection by Passport, too.TL;DR: Photographing another screen can be challenging and the best solution is using multiple 'smaller' QR codes (less information per code).",

I peeled the one off my old pixel 4 and EVERY code scanned. Some took a bit of getting a good shot but in the end they all did scan.Put on a new screen protector, and I could not read the bitrefill one or the bluewallet QR. Took it off and they all scanned. That was just with 1 wallet scanning. Will do more over the weekend. But I think the issue does come down a bunch of things:1) Camera2) Screen3) Code itselfSome phones / cameras are probably more forgiving then others, and what looks fine to our eyes, or at least mine in terms of screens and screen protectors may be giving some cameras more stress then they can deal with.-Dave",

I bet that the pictures won't turn out well.There are even web articles about this (though in the context of getting people to learn doing actual screenshots and not in the context of QR codes on screens).Quote from: https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/why-taking-a-photo-of-a-screen-sucks-and-how-to-take-screenshots--cms-27448Digital cameras don’t work anything like the human eye; screens are completely different to pieces of paper. Although this might seem obvious in theory, it’s at the root of why cameras and screens don’t play nicely together. In this example, they show how the 'screen photo' has curves and dots on it (moiré effect). You also see how the brightness is not uniform from the bottom left to the top right corner, and in other circumstances it would probably also have some reflections.Anyhow; QR codes are actually made for working in bad conditions like this; the artifacts in the picture should just not be too bad for the resolution / amount of data per code chosen by the creator.",

I'm *guessing* it's 1/3 what n0nce talked about just taking pictures of screens does not always work perfectly, 1/3 screen protectors in general make it worse by adding a layer of distortion and 1/3 with phone makers trying to do all sorts of error correction and fancy tricks to make pictures look better is adding a bit of a difference to the picture coming into the app so it just sits there and goes 'duh'\\IMO this is going to get worse in the future as people are more likely to be sending funds using crypto apps on their phones to each other.And, as lightning gets more use the amount of data in a QR is going to make it worse.vs-Dave",

I did some experiments about this and if a code is 'small' enough (in terms of data), it gets recognized immediately.

Sure, but you can imagine how small that userbase is. We (as in all crypto users) are still quite a small part of the global financial economy. Then you have to take into account how many of those crypto users use crypto on a regular basis, which I consider at least once or twice a week, if not more. When you have gotten that far, it comes down to how many people own hardware wallets, and then an even smaller group who owns airgapped hardware wallets or airgapped computers. Lastly, how do those who use airgapped systems interact with their wallets. QR codes is one way of doing it. The other one is via USB drives.",
