You don't send it last month, you will still have a same number of sMerit this month, not double, not +50% more.",

As OP has 103 merit in total, he has received 10 airdropped merit and was \"member\" when merit system was launched. Here is the formula theymos used for determining airdropped merits. Quote from: theymos on April 20, 2018, 12:37:52 AMThe exact formula was:Code:yearActivity = activity in the last ~year, max 378freeMerit = the merit (not sMerit) you started withmodifier =  0.1 if member  0.2 if full member  0.25 if sr member  0.35 if hero  0.4 if legendaryreturn (yearActivity/378) * modifier * freeMeritAccording to the formula, the maximum number of airdropped smerit a user with member rank could receive was 1. OP started with 0 or 1 smerit.",

There is no way to know that how many spendable merits are going to expire because your merits don't expire and you can keep them forever. The merits will stay in your profile if you don't send those to someone else, and if you send someone 2 merits then he/she will get one spendable or sendable merits the other one will not be deposited in his/her sendable merits. So far no-one merits have been expired and I'm sure that theymos isn't going to add a feature where someone's merits will be expired. Still, I would encourage you to send those sendable merits to deserving posts because keeping those sendable merits won't help you in anyway.",

Do not mind my words please. But that's an obvious thing that if someone had lost access to the account then he or she can not send merits, even can not make any type of activity on their accounts. But still, it is a reason and can not be ignored. Quote from: SmartGold01 on September 13, 2023, 04:06:19 PMIf op keep asking this question and haven being here for so long then I don't mind saying that this is not the real owner of the account.Just being curios here, that many members have doubt the fact that, OP might have some smerits airdropped to him according to this formula. And he is active after a long period of time, so he might not understood the merit system yet. And maybe that's why he is asking around for it. I don't think he is looking for unwanted attention. Maybe some simple answers. And the thing which I don't understand here is, how can you say for sure or conclude that this is not the real owner, maybe I am not thinking straight or got the point here. But it will be a great help with you will shed some light on it.",

So you can still use your sMerit at any time regardless of whether you got it from an airdrop or from another user. You can find out how much sMerit you can spend, but it will probably be the same if theymos start implementing sMerit expiration limits.krishnaverma, can I know why it is good to add?",
