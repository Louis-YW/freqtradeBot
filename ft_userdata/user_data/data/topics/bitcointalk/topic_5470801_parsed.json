I just want it to be known I did not make the keys for this coin, and I do not know who assembled it that holo is specifically for DIY coins. Also Lot #2 Is not a DIY coin but, it looks like someone placed, or glued the addy QR code on the hologram that is not my doing. The hologram normally looks like the one on the COA with no QR code on it like pictured above.",

I was going to ask why they look different, but this seems almost like a scam attampt That QR code could very well be there to cover up the cut-out holo, so both coins can be redeemed after the sale. Somewhat unlikely with such low loading value, but still...Good to have you here mate!EDIT: I don't mean by minerjones of course.Quote from: MrMojoRising26 on October 19, 2023, 12:41:49 AMLot #1 is a DIY coin!
