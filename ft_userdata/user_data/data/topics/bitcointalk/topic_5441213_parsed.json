You can add too self interest of different politicians and people the supporting each side.There’s no perfect government that will exist because people will always find a hole on any government especially if they want power and insist their own ideology. This is what makes human unique.",

We all know that government varies in the manner of how they present things to yeh public. There some government that would not mind to make life hard for citizens making people to have good reasons for change of government. I could remember during president Trump's tenure, there were surplus money and funds.  Americans were living with a better economy compared to now that looks like the country is going into recession. Every government has there benefits.",

This election is not really helping especially when you further look at the situation of the countries where they do this kind of practice, most of them don't improve except for a few. Unlike the monarchy where they really focus on fixing their country because they really care for their citizen and most of their works are intended to promote goodness and improvement for their citizens.",

That would be some way to destroy all that the nation is built on as each government would fabricate the laws and policies in ways that suits them to not be of any harm should they stray to corrupt practices.What a new government would do is to come up with an agenda for the time they will spend in office, try to follow it out and properly manage the resources existing in the nation. Creating of laws doesn't solve any issue if the previous laws and policies aren't working.",

One Government can't be in power forever, no matter how hard you try we humans can never be satisfied, and when a government is not working there is need for change in power to see what the next government can do and the way it can make impacts in the lives of the his citizens.

There are new government that are specialists in looting, corruption, disrespect for human right,etc. It is better for one good ruler to rule for life than to have a bad new government. New government something discontinue some good projects of the past government which leads to waste of resources. Some new government want to start their own project which leads to the abandonment of some viable projects by the past administration. It is okay to have a change of government in a democratic society but a change of government might not lead to better standard of living",

This is why I support change of government because within the few months of the new government, they will try their best to implement good things for the Citizens to enjoy. Another thing is that government is not made up of one family. They are different consistencies and different, if Government changes, development and other things rotate among the constituencies and the states that make up a government.",

Countries that are led by the same leader for a long time suffer more losses and usually the leader can continue to be a leader because of a dictator, all countries must have laws on limiting a person to become president otherwise he will only build his own empire in the country and take a lot of profit by doing a lot of corruption and the world is always developing that is very good if a country is led by people who change because new people always have fresh ideas and are more in line with the times.",
