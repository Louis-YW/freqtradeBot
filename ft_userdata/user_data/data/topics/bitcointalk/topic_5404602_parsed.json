When it's guerilla warfare against guerilla warfare, something deeper has to be done to make a winning action.In the USA, there are only a handful of elected leaders in government. These people can't do any of the real work of governing; all they do is the think up the direction they think government should go, and then they delegate the operations to thousands of little people who do the actual work. These little people can be \"bought\" by outside influences to do their work in ways different than the elected people wanted.Often, however, it's the leaders in government who manipulate their own workers in government. These leaders tell the general public one thing, and behind the scenes manipulate their workers into implementing things in a different way.The Invisible Power Controlling the US GovernmentQuote from: https://rwmalonemd.substack.com/p/the-invisible-power-controlling-theI have written extensively on inverted totalitarianism, that being the once nascent, now entrenched form of government that truly controls the levers of federal power in the United States. This behemoth has turned the USA into a \"managed democracy\"; a bureaucracy which cannot be held accountable by the elected representatives of the people. Sometimes called the 4th estate, this monster is also referred to as the \"deep state\" the civil service, or the administrative state.Inverted totalitarianism does not have an authoritarian leader, but instead is run by a non-transparent group of bureaucrats. This unelected, invisible ruling class runs the country from within. They are easily influenced by corporate interests due to both the lure of powerful jobs after federal employment and the capture of our legislative bodies by the lobbyists serving concealed corporate interests.One element of inverted totalitarianism is that the administrative state typically inserts stricter and stricter rules and regulations to control the populace. Not at the behest of Congress or the President, but rather by and for the interests of the administrative state itself. Power begets power. We the people are forced into compliance by an unknown and unknowable invisible ruling class, with no way to even understand who, what, or how they are forcing this compliance upon us. As if that is not bad enough, in these modern times, the globalist corporations and financial groups have come to play a larger and larger role in controlling this administrative state....",

This could slow them down buying valuable time or at the very least not allow them to get away free and clear in their commission of evil. If the country falls into the hands of terrorists, we will lose all our rights, you have to be scared all the time, there will be no law in the country.Â And these terrorists will never think of the public, they will be constantly thinking of looting and thus the country's economy will be hit hard, and the country will be destroyed.For example, we can talk about the Taliban of Afghanistan.The Taliban has been the target of terrorism in Afghanistan for the past 17 years. They have been fighting against the Afghan government and NATO forces. The terrorist group is known for their use of suicide bombings, improvised explosive devices, and targeted assassinations. The group's goal is to install an Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan, which would be a strict Islamic state with sharia law and no foreign interference.The Taliban has been active in Afghanistan since 1994 when they were first founded by Mullah Mohammed Omar. They are believed to have between 25-30 thousand fighters today, with a majority of them being from rural areas of Afghanistan. The Taliban is also supported by Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency who provides weapons and training to the terrorist group in order to destabilize Afghanistan and create an Islamic state there.",

As a smart man would say, modern times require modern solutions, and with thta all of the mentioned might just be outdated.",
