  "content": "Today, the MineOnlium team would like to announce plans for the evolution of our chain, and would like to invite community members to give us their thoughts so we can solidify plans.As it stands right now, we have decided that the best course of action is remain on EthHash. We want to provide added features on top of the chain and build an ecosystem that is fair for all and promotes solo mining. We have some ideas that will prevent one person with a lot of hashrate from dominating the network that we will propose to the community in due time. Please remember that this is a coin powered by our community, if you see anything in these plans that you don't like, please let your voice be heard! We are open to any and all criticism and thoughts. We want to build a chain that anyone can be proud to be a part of. We want to do something different here and we would be nothing without our community. P2P Exchange   * In active developmentPOW&S    * Proof of Work & StakeSolo Mining Priority    * GUI / EZ Mine Application for Windows    * Provide an easy way to set-up nodes to begin network validation.Validator Timeout    * We are proposing a system that encourages solo mining.Node Reward    * A Reward system will be constructed for Node operators. Community Voting Protocol     * Stake MO into the Community Voting Contract to receive voting tokens that can be used to vote on future upgrades. Built-in Staking Contracts    * Stake MO into the chain’s built in staking contract to receive variable APY.Developer Fee    * This was a tough one for us, we have not solidified the plans on this one yet. Please join the conversation! Join our discord and let us know about your thoughts on these plans.Twitter: https://twitter.com/MineOnliumDiscord: https://discord.gg/nahJYz7e",

None of these assets are tradable yet to outside bridges, and therefore have no value. We are working on a Polygon bridge to start trading for other currencies and stables. Thank you all for your continued patience as we grow and your support. If you are interested in joining the team as a developer please join discord and message one of the admins!",
