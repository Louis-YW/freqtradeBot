There will be two more options on another section which will be something like-Â°Trade FeedbackÂ°Non Trade FeedbackAnd the output will be visible by score with a different color.Do you think it will be a good idea to force this when user will leave a feedback?",

The numbers are now \"distinct positive raters / distinct neutral raters / distinct negative raters\". You should give these ratings for anything which you think would impact someone's willingness to trade with the person, but you should not use trust ratings to attack a person's opinions or otherwise talk about things which would not be relevant to reasonable prospective traders.Use case #1 above, was 'getting a general idea of someone's trade history and trustworthiness\".Imo, trade doesn't have to be a exchange of goods or currency, purchasing a service and getting it delivered on time and as expected, great communication during the process is also added in.A non trade option doesn't quite fit into the feedback system.",

And sadly you can't get out of them. If I have to ~ them, I believe I will be left with nuetral trust score for everyone (maybe little more).",

Let me be honest, I checked your sent feedbacks and they were quite satisfactory but a lot of DT members don't practice this at all.My issue with this is I think it'd be very easy for a scammer to do trades just to get their trader trust higher - we've seen that before around here a lot too. Since the new trust system was introduced, it's more encouraged to read through others' trust histories first before doing any trading with them - perhaps we need more emphasis on this (/due diligence) in the marketplace section than we do different trust depending on whether a trade was done or not.",

And the reason that the \"OP\" inclusion suggestion was promptly approved is because the code was written.About OP's suggestion of differentiating between a trade and non trade related feedback. I think is not needed because something is already serving the purpose. That is the feedback description itself. Check these two feedbacks below and see if you will have difficulty in identifying the one that is trade related and non trade related. If you find it difficult to differentiate, it means Op's suggestions could be considered, otherwise it shouldn't. QuoteThe Pharmacist is an important figure in the forum.
