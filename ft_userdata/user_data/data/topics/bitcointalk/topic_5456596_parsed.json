After all, bitcointalk is the largest forum in the crypto money world and keeps the pulse of the crypto money world. More importantly, our managers could have created such a cryptocurrency, and I think it would produce really good results. Most likely, the forum did not approach because it is a large platform, and they may not have approached because they did not know where the results could lead.",

Well, most of the token nowadays have a weird name and they are following the trend to get more attention from investors, having a Merit name is not that attractive I think. If you’re planning to use this name on a new project, then make it more interesting.",

Why would that name make sense over any other name? You don't create a currency because you think you have a clever name for it. It wouldn't have any fundamentals other than that and no real reason to exist.Also there is a crypto called Merit in coinmarketcap, not only that, there's Merit Circle and Meritcoins. Most likely there has been several tokens that didn't live up to be in coinmarketcap.So to answer to your question, it isn't a good idea to create a crypto just because you have name for it.",

The total supply of that Merit currency is infinite as each month, theymos will dump more sourced merit to merit sources and keep the supply rising more.Merit currency has its public ledger and we can see merit transactions from senders to receivers.The forum does not call it as a currency by in my view, it is a native currency of Bitcointalk. It is not tradable on any cryptocurrency market, exchanges but it is locally transacted in this forum, natively.",

It's not exactly something people would need, or even if we consider it's use case, it's only described in this forum. Outside? It's just a vague word. I doubt as well that someone reputable here would waste the time in actually making one, especially if you consider how it's an empty use case in the long run and is just running on the fact that the forum uses \"Merits\" to award people if they're ideas were helpful/creative. And tbf, \"Merit\" in of itself seems pretty vague. A lot of coins use pretty descriptive words of what the coins they have are themed after, or even creating an entirely new word to describe it (such as using company name, like BNB, for Binance).",

Investors are there and most of them will like something that could make a trend. But if you do insist you can make one and test it out. Who knows? It might become a popular coin that would topple Ethereum and BNB. I do know it will require a lot of money and you have to pay a team that will do the work from marketing to development, websites, and other stuff that would actually be expensive in the long run. Perhaps an ICO will help. What the project will be about is something I will look forward to.",

Because Merit is not a cryptocurrency, but rather a database system inside the forum code, which makes it difficult to upgrade without obtaining certain points, and therefore the user must create high-quality posts that have no material value outside the forum and it is wrong to sell them, so it is not his currency that is traded, but rather just code in a base evidence.If it was a currency, I can make more than 10k sMerits annually, and then I may not be inclined to send it.",

Merit on bitcointalk is a gesture that people like what you are posting and your contributions are valued.Merit can be tokenised but that would need a big implementation in bitcointalk source code and also it would need a secondary market where it can be traded.Currently, the value of a merit is the value of a user's post but if tokenized then the value will be decided by demand and supply based on the secondary market.Such a system is already implemented in Reddit where the \"Cryptocurrency\" channel users give each other \"moons\".Moons can be traded in secondary market and it's current price is 339 satoshis = $0.09https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moon",

There are merit named coin and tokens if you search it using the search bar of coinmatketcap, but there's no data yet regarding on those crypto's. So maybe they are not been listed yet on exchange or maybe rather they are listed on small exchange but didn't get any decent value. Also its easy to create a coin the problem is how they can sustain it. And its not all about in the name but rather its technology used or rather its utility since if you create it randomly then it will just be another shitcoin created.",
