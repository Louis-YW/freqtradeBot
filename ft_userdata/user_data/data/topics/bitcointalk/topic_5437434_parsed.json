Just recently came across one news about it, but I totally forget which company it was though.But in any case, anything that's hype in crypto, scammers are going to take advantage of it. How? creating fake websites and phish crypto investors for their password. So the moral in this case it that we really need to be very careful and vigilant specially with the huge project in the AI industry/sector.",

It is widely known, perhaps, by experienced cryptocurrency users that a worthless token is always incorporated into what is currently happening. In fact, that is how they make a buzz.It seems truly lucrative for them since there will always be a new newbie target within this space, and due to the pseudonymity nature of cryptocurrency, it makes them flexible to do their scam method. We know that there is various method of scams in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.",

We are knowledgable about such scams and thus we try to advice newbies not to go for them but very few users actually pay heed.Besides a lot of the victims who get scammed feel for their greed and they are the ones to blame for their own losses.Gradually you will see that the previous buzzword-driven coins are going to a stagnancy while their investors go to the slow pain zone.",

With the recent boom of ChatGPT and other AI-related stuff, I don't doubt they already were making preparations for some random project that uses the tech-savvy term \"AI\" to bait some new investors out there. Even NFT's haven't stopped, so I reckon AI stuff would continue for a pretty sizeable amount of time. I honestly just avoid any investment that has buzzwords but no solid result. Even if I consider that they're just making me a sort of start-up investment, there's way too many projects like them that are pretty much empty words only after all.",

Although there are real AI projects but due to the cause of scammers people are now skeptical about put their resources especially me. I am hardly being moved with the AI hype and happenings, I would rather look down to those trusted and reliable projects. I don't think there's nothing scammers won't try to fake, during ico, crowdfunding, IEO, IDO and more, scammer used that medium to victimized those with little or no knowledge in the crypto race.",

It is not just that scammers are following these trends like you mentioned (AI and stuffs).

Kind of a lazy business.NFTs arrived and there were low effort NFT images and even a dick picture that sold millions and millions. Like you said in the last sentence, it is all just money race. Outside crypto, there were unsolicited emails back then when people were communicating almost always via email, but now that we got Facebook and Twitter, shit just went through the roof all over the place.",

I think that there are some requirements before you can put your token on CMC and I believe that it is much harder than coingecko where most DeFi token is listed there. Coin market cap won't make their coin listing website a trash by asking money from other just to list them despite of a scetchy background. As far as I know tthere are certain requirements like daily trading volume, being listed on a public exchange as I've did a simple search in this forum. I don't know if it was updated or changed since it came from 2018. There are many scammers that are really smart and dedicated to scam you people that's why they are doing there best to pretend trusted and utilizing any trend that will encourage you to put your money into them. Quote from: agustina2 on February 22, 2018, 07:29:38 PMIt was listed on the FAQ:What is the criteria for a cryptocurrency to be listed on CoinMarketCap?The criteria for a cryptocurrency to be listed is the following:- Must be a cryptocurrency or a crypto token.- Must be on a public exchange with an API that reports the last traded price and the last 24 hour trading volume.- Must have a non-zero trading volume on at least one supported exchange so a price can be determined.- For market cap ranking, an accurate circulating supply figure is required.If you'd like to have a cryptocurrency listed and it meets all of the criteria, please fill out the request form.https://coinmarketcap.com/faq/",
