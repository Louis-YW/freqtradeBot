I wonder why among those on the delist there are projects that I think are quite promising, such as TomoChain (TOMO), Tokocrypto (TKO), Aavegotchi (GHST), Augur (REP), Bancor (BNT), Alpaca Finance (ALPACA) and Mobox (MBOX).Even though this is old information, this information is still very relevant to share, a little additional information from the original source that the last withdrawal can be made for the assets you mentioned above is June 28, 2023 (UTC). - Source",

On of my friends who want to make quick profits recently bought some altcoin instead of Bitcoin as advised, and surprise to us two of the coin he invested in can't be fund on any exchange,  as there doesn't have a trading volume on the only exchange their claim to be listed on.",

Being delisted will result into a negative impact on that project, they should have prevented this from happening but maybe its already beyond their control.

Too bad the team where too greedy in my opinion. Thanks for the head-up. It seems like none of the small-cap projects that i am holding is affected this time. KuCoin has always been the big exchange that was listing the most small coins in my opinion and i also think this helped KuCoin to become one of the biggest exchanges today, because i would guess a lot of those holders of those small project only had KuCoin as a reliable exchange to trade and afterwards they have sticked around and kept on using Kucoin.Obviously from time to time you have to make a checkup and if a project has almost no trading volume anymore, then the exchange will delist it, because otherwise it is just lost money for them because they have to keep supporting it even though they are not making money from trading fees with it.",

Knowing the reasons could help some holders of the coin to continue holding in some other exchange or sell the token/coin outright.  According to the Special Treatment Rules of KuCoin, the following projects have been disqualified. Special treatment means, in short, that a currency is placed under observation for a specific period to monitor the volume of trading and the volume of liquidity. And as soon as that period expires without progress being noticed, that currency is removed from the list of available pairs. Of course, this has nothing to do with the reputation of the currency, because as we can see, there are currencies for promising projects, but they may not have found enough popularity among Kucoin users:QuoteOnce designated as “Special Treatment” by the Exchange, as a warning, there will be a special designation on the Project’s ticker symbol during a specific observation period. Special Treatment is a warning of potential delisting. The ST Project shall be subject to close observation and scrutiny during the observation period.（2）The Exchange may delist the ST Project if the Project fails to meet the basic liquidity requirements by the end of the observation period.Source",

Since they are an exchange their business relies on transaction fees, and if those project cant have a solid transaction of buying and selling then that means that they arent helping their business. Of course there are terms or extent to that like, durations or warning if they didnt hit trading volume of like this.
