If you are using a casino that requires KYC verification, complete it before making your first deposit or playing at the casino in any way. This makes you seem legit in every possible way. A lot of people have experienced this issue before and I believe it will continue to happen as long as they are not following this method.Keep in mind that casinos are always looking for a way to hold your money, no matter how little it is. So, don't give them any reason to do so.",

We are working with our lawyers to improve our terms and policies to minimize as much as possible required information's if any.  You are quoting an old post from 2020 for your defense. A lot of things can happen in three years, especially when it comes to terms of service for a crypto related serviceAlways refer to the actual terms of service of a casino and read them extensively before using itScrutinizing their current terms of service. This is what I saw in regard to KYCQuoteBetnomi may, at its sole discretion, request you to provide additional information (e.g., residence address, country of residence) or documents (s.a. ID, passport, driver's license). This is important for the ‘Know Your Client’ process imposed by the anti-money laundering regulations.QuoteYou are hereby notified that Betnomi may carry out verification procedures, whether itself or through third parties. You may be requested to provide Betnomi with documents at the deposit stage, withdrawal stage (or both), or any other stage at the sole discretion of Betnomi, such as a copy of your passport or other identification documentation as part of the Betnomi KYC procedures.Betnomi may also request any documentation previously provided which would have expired or would no longer be valid for any reason or to ask for any additional KYC documentation for any reason and at any time. Your Member Account may be blocked or closed if you do not provide requested information or documents or if such information or documents you supply is/are found false or misleading. Betnomi reserves the right to close your Member Account and withhold any funds held in your Member Account until the Betnomi verification process is complete.Betnomi may request additional information for the performance of KYC, such as your age, identity, address, and additional contact details, including your place of residence, your place from where you intend to access the Website if other than your place of residence, relevant payment information, all of which must be true and correct.We shall have the right to make a phone call to the number provided by you during registration of your Member Account, which at Our discretion may be a necessary part of the KYC procedure.

The withdrawal delays are a common thing at Betnomi.com. I have faced the delays on 70% withdrawals of mine when I was playing there in 2020. They have been running their business in this way for years.About the KYC, Betnomi has updated their KYC related terms a long time ago. You won't be able to find out any recent posts of Betnomi where they mentioned KYC isn't required. Just wait until they fixed the issues on their site, then see whether the KYC verification works or not. They will pay you if you haven't done anything wrong.",

If Betnomi wants you to complete KYC, why disable the button leading to KYC? I thought it could be a general issue from the backend.Meanwhile, having issues with KYC is somthing that isn't complicated, so support must have given you a tangible reply but you didn't include it here. I would like to see the screenshot of the chat between you and betnomi support. However, I know the feelings when you are hindered from withdrawing when the deposit was seamless. But I'll advice you to calm as your account isn't locked, it could be the delay as attested by some forum members.Have you tried writing on their Ann thread about this?",

If Betnomi wants you to complete KYC, why disable the button leading to KYC?If you upload your documents multiple times and every time they get rejected, then the service may disable this option for you to avoid any attempt to abuse it.However, if the service rejects your documents and don't let you pass their kyc verification, they must explain why they did so and explain what you are supposed to do to fix the problem. Rejecting your documents just like that without no explanation is a shady behavior. Just my opinion, though!",

I know customers can be annoying sometimes, but it could have been handled in a better way. They are human beings as well. Sometimes they had to respond to more than ten users in a minute. They have some pre-written responses that they use when a global issue arises. For example, They have an issue with KYC verifications. If ten users ask similar questions, there is nothing wrong with answering them with exact text. You have to note that they are just customer support and don't decide what to do. They forward the information to the administration and suggest what they should do. Let's say users saying why didn't you guys write a notification that you have issues with KYC verifications? Well, Support doesn't have the power to do it. All they can do is suggest the admin panel to do it.Moreover, sometimes Support can take time to respond because they might have connected with several users simultaneously. Sometimes customers behave rudely, and it's easy for a human to lose their temper. They are not Chat Bots who will respond politely all the time. If you talk with them well, they won't be rude.",
