  "content": "Following my previous guide about how to solo mine testnet bitcoins with an ASIC and cgminer I'm now presenting a guide on how to do the same but without the need of an ASIC. That means that you'll be able to mine testnet bitcoins with any computer that has a CPU and/or a GPU. This should work on pretty much any laptop or desktop, even those with the new M1 chips from Apple. Of course the faster the CPU/GPU, the better chances you'll have to hit some blocks.You might be wondering how is this even possible. The answer is that the difficulty in testnet3 reverts to 1 after 20 minutes have passed with no one finding a block. A difficulty of 1 is so low that any CPU or GPU is capable of hitting a block. Note that this was the difficulty of Bitcoin in the beginning(2009). More details about this can be read here: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18554/how-can-i-find-the-real-difficulty-on-testnetOK, so let's make it happen. First, you need to setup Bitcoin Core in the same way as with the other guide. Here's a copy of it for simplicity:Step 1: Install and run Bitcoin CoreWe're going to use the folder ~/bitcoin_testnet to save everything so that it's easy to remove once you're done and to keep things simple. You can of course use a different path if you want.Inside ~/bitcoin_testnet create a folder called data:Code:mkdir -p ~/bitcoin_testnet/dataDownload the Bitcoin Core for your platform into ~/bitcoin_testnet/ and extract it there.Now let's prepare the configuration file. Create a text file named bitcoin_testnet.conf in ~/bitcoin_testnet/ and put these content in it:Code:testnet=1txindex=1server=1[test]rpcport=5000rpcallowip=YOUR_MINER_IPrpcuser=YOUR_RPC_USERrpcpassword=YOUR_RPC_PASSWORDrpcbind=0.0.0.0The thing that you need to understand here is that you're setting up the Bitcoin node to run in testnet, and you're defining an RPC port(5000 in this case, can be anything), user and password, and whitelisting a specific IP to connect to your node(YOUR_MINER_IP). You'll need these details and your Bitcoin node IP later when connecting from bfgminer.You can now start running your Bitcoin node by doing the following(make sure to change user to your actual user):Code:/home/user/bitcoin_testnet/bitcoin-23.0/bin/bitcoind -conf=/home/user/bitcoin_testnet/bitcoin_testnet.conf -datadir=/home/user/bitcoin_testnet/dataIf you want, you can keep this running in the background with screen:Code:screen -dm -S bitcoin_testnet /home/user/bitcoin_testnet/bitcoin-23.0/bin/bitcoind -conf=/home/user/bitcoin_testnet/bitcoin_testnet.conf -datadir=/home/user/bitcoin_testnet/dataYou can then see what's happening with:Code:screen -r bitcoin_testnetTo detach the screen, simply press Ctrl-A and then Ctrl-D. You'll be back in the console, and the command will continue running in the background.Step 2: Install and run bfgminerSince cgminer removed the CPU/GPU functionality a long time ago, we're going to use bfgminer. You need to compile it from source code to activate these features, so that's what we're going to do. First let's install some dependencies:Code:sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config libcurl4-gnutls-dev libjansson-dev uthash-dev libncursesw5-dev libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libevent-dev libmicrohttpd-dev libhidapi-dev libsensors-devNow we're ready to get, configure, and make bfgminer with support for CPU and GPU mining. Also note that we need to update the git: sources to https: in the .gitmodules file, otherwise it won't work. I'm using sed here to do this, but you can of course do it manually if you prefer.Code:cd ~/bitcoin_testnet/git clone https://github.com/luke-jr/bfgminercd bfgminersed -i 's/git:/https:/g' .gitmodules./autogen.sh./configure --enable-opencl --enable-cpuminingmakeAfter it finished the build, you can now simply start mining your testnet bitcoins:Code:~/bitcoin_testnet/bfgminer/bfgminer -S opencl:auto -S cpu:auto -o http://YOUR_BITCOIN_CORE_IP:5000 -u YOUR_RPC_USER -p YOUR_RPC_PASSWORD --generate-to YOUR_TESTNET_BTC_ADDRESS --coinbase-sig \"Whatever you want to write\"And that's it. Your computer should now be mining with the CPU and the GPU using OpenCL. Leave it overnight and you'll probably see some testnet bitcoins in your address.Some questions you might have:Q: Can I use only the GPU?A: You can use one or the other instead of both by simply not adding it to the command (i.e. just use -S opencl:auto for GPU only or just use -S cpu:auto for CPU only). Q: Why are there two(or more) pools in the dashboard?A: If you are running another instance of Bitcoin Core in the local machine bfgminer will try to mine there as well. If you don't want that to happen, simply add --no-local-bitcoin to the command.Q: Can I use a Raspberry Pi?A: Actually yes, it should work with CPU mining, but extremely slow. You might get lucky though.",

You can read about it in createwallet. Then you should be able to getnewaddress. Make sure to use the legacy format as that's what cgminer is expecting. You address should start with n or m.Good luck hitting some blocks with a CPU/GPU!, it worked for me but it's noticeably less frequent than using an ASIC, even a tiny USB one like the Compac F.",

It's basically for people that don't want to depend on faucets to test their projects. Once you know how to do it you can mine some testnet bitcoin for yourself overnight, even if there's no faucets available.But you're right, it might be worth noting it for people that come here from the outside through a search or a link. Yes, testnet bitcoins are only useful for testing, they don't have any other value, and they can even disappear at any time. That's also why I didn't mention any kind of security for the wallet, because it doesn't matter.",

Overall it's good experience and i got about ~0.05 tBTC, which probably will be used to try few different OPCODES on scripting or simply donate it to tBTC faucet.On a side note, on 3rd day i tried to mine only with 1 thread CPU since the goal to mine block with difficulty 1. But when i shutdown my PC, i got this error message with >100K occurrence. Quick search on google shows it's due continuous CPU usage for long time, although i'm not 100% sure it's due to bfgminer.

Network latency to other nodes will probably be in the single to double-digit ms range. For reference: 1ms (which is a really good network latency) are a million ns.There is a chance that your CPU is overloaded with all cores mining and no core ready to push that packet out to the network asap. Another idea would be making sure that this old CPU miner code doesn't wait for e.g. a whole set of nonce values before returning a valid block or something silly like that. It should return as soon as a block meets the difficulty, but I wouldn't rule out that it waits longer for whatever (legacy?) reason. I will definitely have a look at your bfgminer config and the bfgminer code, too.",

Is this different in testnet?I checked a few of the latest testnet blocks, and found times between blocks of:2418404 > 2418405: 20 minutes and 3 seconds.2418410 > 2418411: 20 minutes and 5 seconds.2418407 > 2418408: 20 minutes and 8 seconds.I checked the last 2 days, and to my surprise only 115 blocks per day get mined. I'm surprised because the total block height is much higher than for Bitcoin. I'm also surprised that several people here have mined several blocks per day at difficulty 1, which means that only a few dozen people can do that per day. I'd expect much more people to be mining testnet.",

But afterwards i found out Gavin Andresen propose this[2] and create pull request some time later[3].Quote from: LoyceV on January 31, 2023, 09:34:34 AMI checked the last 2 days, and to my surprise only 115 blocks per day get mined.Mining difficulty on testnet keep rising which discourage some people to perform mining, where people with CPU/GPU only expect to earn tBTC from 1 difficulty after 20 minutes.Quote from: LoyceV on January 31, 2023, 09:34:34 AMI'm surprised because the total block height is much higher than for Bitcoin.Probably because now we have separate testing network dedicated for newer Bitcoin feature (e.g. signet and segnet) and in past people attempt to attack/stress Bitcoin testnet by mining with tons of ASIC.[1] https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Testnet&oldid=35502[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50223.msg627957#msg627957[3] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/686",

Overall it's good experience and i got about ~0.05 tBTC, which probably will be used to try few different OPCODES on scripting or simply donate it to tBTC faucet.On a side note, on 3rd day i tried to mine only with 1 thread CPU since the goal to mine block with difficulty 1. But when i shutdown my PC, i got this error message with >100K occurrence. Quick search on google shows it's due continuous CPU usage for long time, although i'm not 100% sure it's due to bfgminer. Code:kernel: rcu: INFO: rcu_preempt detected expedited stalls on CPUs/tasks: { P93622 } 116803 jiffies s: 7173 root: 0x1/.kernel: rcu: blocking rcu_node structures (internal RCU debug): l=1:0-15:0x0/TDid you monitor your CPU miner a bit? I just catched an instance where the last block was 20 minutes ago and bfgminer never adjusted the difficulty setting from its '125M' value. Does it take a bit longer to adjust or what is the cause? Or is it just not reflected in the user interface? I expected it to drop to 1 as soon as the 20 minute mark passed, even if it may not end up being first at submitting something to the network. But it simply didn't budge.This is Loyce's machine with 7 threads hashing and 1 core free to submit a block quickly.One thing I just realized is that in the screenshot, the I value (BTC per hour) is set to a question mark. So maybe it did quickly submit a block candidate and was waiting to see if it got accepted by the network? Can you post a log screenshot of what it looks like when bfgminer finds a valid block (whether it is accepted by the network or not - you mention 2 stale blocks)?",

Can you post a log screenshot of what it looks like when bfgminer finds a valid block (whether it is accepted by the network or not - you mention 2 stale blocks)?What exactly do you mean by log? I checked my Bitcoin Core log and found out older log was wiped. After quick search, Bitcoin Core has config called shrinkdebugfile which enabled by default with 10MB limit. And few days ago i perform reindex which wipe everything from last years.With log, I mean the bfgminer log output as shown here.I am wondering whether it logs / shows whether it found a block at diff 1 here.Trying to work out whether the software even realizes that 20 minutes have passed, reduces the difficulty to 1, hashes a block candidate and tries to submit it or whether this all doesn't even happen.Even just seeing how a successfully mined block is shown in this log, would help, since I can only reference my experience with cgminer whose output looks very different.",
