  "content": "At some point most of us have interacted or discussed the pump that Meme coins had over the last bull cycle, even some of us held some and got some profits on the way. The thing is that nowadays there are thousands of meme coins and shitty projects that try to grab a bag, but, even most newbies at the market are aware of it. That being said, this week I have seen multiple sources covering the uptrend from DOGE and SHIB, I find it interesting how these projects may have a possibility to surge again and claim a space as a 'useful' token for the future projects. What are your thoughts about this?Source as reference: https://twitter.com/thetokenist/status/1559870966406283266?s=20&t=IGqgM-6b02VXcq80uTS8UQ",

What are your thoughts about this?Useful?  I dont think so.  Maybe for dogecoin can be used as Elon frequently shill it and who knows might other firm thinking of accepting dogecoin too as form of payment aside from Tesla. But the memecoin defies the essence of a utility since we have a lot of other choices which have more potential than simply a meme coin right? A lot of L1 and gaming tokens are out there which have an ecosystem to choose from.  But of course a hype tokens like them arent gonna be sure of success.",

I believe there are also meme coins out there that are just not being mentioned quite often and they could either be dead or just not worth being talked about.Dogecoin has been here for quite a long time and even though I do not like meme coins, I am sure that Dogecoin will just be there always. Worth mentioning that back in 2017, I was even thinking about investing into that coin when I got my first few Bitcoins in those years.",

      "body": "I would not be surprised to see some more of the old-school coins make it this time around. The market is changing, and along with that, people are getting smarter about which projects to fund. I suspect a few will still fail, but the good ones will survive, and the projects that do make it through the next bull run will be more legitimate than ever before. The conclusion I would draw is that you should always be skeptical of hyped-up coins and tokens, like the many there are in the crypto scene. I think you need to approach these coins with caution, and only do so if you have a clear plan for what to do with them. Even if some meme coins surge at times, most of them are worthless once the pump is over.",

There is no real life utility for this meme coins, except maybe for Doge, being used to deposit for gambling because it's quick. But other than that, I don't see good reasons to hold on it, except you are really a big fan and hoping that in the next bull run, it will make a huge jump in the price. But for me, it's better to used that money on other investment right now instead of holding it for meme coins.",

That is why we need certain market conditions with very big news to rise up meme coins as previously.

What are your thoughts about this?. ..This is always what the investors of meme coins talking about. They will always tell how useful meme coins are, moreover this always is related to one of the richest people in the world, Elon Musk. Many people invest in meme coins because of the hype and also promotions by so many people in the world. Then, they are commonly falling down to the earth after reaching the highest rate quickly.  Just invest wisely in certain coins with lower risks moreover if we are new to this.

The next bull market will be big for sure, if there’s another set of hype for SHIB and DOGE, you can expect them to pump as well.",

Shiba, I think it will also be the next candidate that will continue to appear in the market with doge. Shiba is said to be the first meme coin that is building its own blockchain ecosystem and NFTs, metaverse... will be implemented in the future.
