  "content": "February Community UpdateUnderstatement: Last month was a big deal.The launch of our first Jackpot Lottery marked an official entrance as a web3 gaming platform. While the launch was very public, we also made important strides behind the scenes.Product DevelopmentJackpot Lottery: In the lead-up to the Lottery launch on March 3rd, we opted for a lean, mean, and highly streamlined marketing campaign. We took a four-pronged approach.1. Organic Multichannel with emphasis on blog and social media content. The thinking was we give you, the community, awesome content and trust you to blast it across the internet. As always, you didn’t disappoint!2. Crypto Publications that specialize in gaming and blockchain ecosystems. With reaches like BSC News (828k,) these outlets provide an incredibly effective method to gin up excitement in key niches.3. Targeted Ads on Twitter and Youtube. Effective keywords and demographic targeting helped us reach nearly 500k crypto enthusiasts across the globe. Specific hot zones included countries in North America, Europe, and Asia.Candy Shop Slot Machine: Today, we tease a world that’ll transport you to simpler times, to the days of childhood when all we ever wanted was candy. Games like Candy Shop will display a diverse set of design aesthetics, animations, and themes. With each new release, we want to push the boundaries of what you think is possible from a blockchain gaming company.Technical DevelopmentLottery Audit: Just before launch, we audited (both internally and externally) the Jackpot Lottery smart contracts. Solid Proof discovered 0 critical, high, and medium issues, giving us full confidence to move forward.Multichain Lottery Launch: In the weeks ahead of the BSC Launch, we cleared the path to expand the launch to Polygon and Arbitrum and meet diverse communities on their blockchains of choice. With the infrastructure now in place, we’ll soon create token bridges to facilitate asset transfer between networks.Arbitrum RNG: Before we launch on Arbitrum, we first need to finalize a global random number generator specific to the network, which will enable us to provide a verifiably fair and unbiased gaming experience.Play Platform: We are creating a dedicated web app that will house all Ridotto mini-game experiences. While the ridotto.io main page will remain dedicated to informational and logistic purposes like staking, farming, bridging, and more, the play platform will offer a streamlined gaming experience.Dune Dashboard: This awesome tool will allow us to create a dynamic on-chain data center that we’ll use to make data-driven decisions.Decentralization via IPFS: One month at a time, we continue the path to full decentralization. We’re currently integrating an IPFS (InterPlanatary File System) that will make the web app completely decentralized. The IPFS peer-to-peer network will allow us to store and share data through a distributed file system, opening the door to direct community contribution and governance.DAO Forum: Speaking of governance, we’re working on a forum platform that will allow you, our community, to create discussion threads and debate potential proposals.Keep in mind the above update only covers what we achieved in February. At the end of this month, expect the March update. It’ll fill you in on our immediate priorities following the V1 Jackpot Lottery Launch.Until then,Live Lucky and try your fortune with our weekly Lottery:Ridotto - Reinventing the gambling experienceThe home of decentralized crypto gaming delivers the best-in-class experience across blockchain.
