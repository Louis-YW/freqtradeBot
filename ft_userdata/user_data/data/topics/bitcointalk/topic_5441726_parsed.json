  "content": "https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/news/cross-platform-game-engine-unity-launches-decentralization-category-pageUnity, a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, has launched a new “Decentralization” category in its Unity Asset Store.In total, Unity is suggesting 13 verified solutions. The list includes services offered by companies like Algorand, Nefta, Immutable X, Pocketful of Quarters, and Dapper Labs. In particular, Dapper Labs will allow Unity developers to “integrate their games and applications with the Flow blockchain.”On top of that, Unity partnered with Tezos and Solana. Tezos software development kit (SDK) will allow developers to link “player accounts across games, minting and trading of in-game items and currencies, and more.” On the other hand, Solana’s SDK will let Unity game developers easily integrate “Solana-based NFTs, tokens, and on-chain programs.”The “Decentralization” category page includes several solutions offered by ConsenSys, such as Infura, MetaMask, and Truffle. Based on the announcement, ConsenSys’ Infura will provide creators with a set of tools helping “developers build and connect to any EVM-compatible blockchain.”_____Nice list of projects to watch.",

      "body": "I wonder why i haven't heard about this, as this is actually big news. They want to integrate nfts right to asset store. This would make it more easy to integrate actual nfts to games easily and i am guessing many game developers would want to use that as it's build in. However i still see big companies avoiding this as they would want to avoid any legal issues where people rob assets from each other or that at some point they would be defined as securities.",

      "body": "SDKs integrations with popular game engine like Unity would be prosperous if it can be utilized by the communities. Compared to its competitor, Unreal Engine, I don't think I ever heard they are welcoming cryptocurrency web3 integration as much as this one.For anyone interested to take a look directly at the Unity assets site, you can see it at: https://assetstore.unity.com/decentralization. Official support and partnership are truly beneficial for the developers since they have centralized assets to rely on, in laymen's terms, the developer can just focus develop the game, and then simply integrate/connect it with those tools. So it is likely to cut the development time processes.",
