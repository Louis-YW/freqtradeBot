They probably think they can time the market with all the opportunities it gives, and just dollar cost averaging bitcoin is a bad idea. That is just a short-term mindset; we need to be looking forward.If the holders had sold their positions, they wouldnâ€™t have probably been where they are now, enjoying the fruits of holding it.To make it easier, just do what you want, believe in, and don't care about what other people say.",

      "body": "Whether you hold investments for the long term or the short term, it depends on your point of view and how mentally prepared you are to begin investing. Both have benefits and drawbacks. As a long-term investor, you'll have a thorough grasp of the market and be able to avoid losses and gain profit when the time is right. Depending on how dedicated you are, these methods may take you longer for you to learn and begin reaping the benefits. Investors that invest for the short term should be willing to lose what they can afford; they don't risk their whole savings account in the hopes of making a quick, large profit. Let me suggest that it's a 50/50 chance for you, more like gambling. Investors in short-term investments don't require a thorough understanding of the market because they can sell their investments as soon as they have made a small profit.",

But i don't agree with that, since we believe btc will grow even moreI want to believe that this same set of people does not invest in bitcoin, but have you personally make some moves or attempts to find out the reality with choosing bitcoin, holding it and then the appropriate time to selling it, if you may need a good positioner to learning this then the bitcoin history right from 2009 price to 2022 current price will give you every solution and answers to counter those people saying what they don't know, Quote from: fennic on October 06, 2022, 07:55:01 AMIn my opinion that Both short term and long term have their own advantages and disadvantagesWe need to fish out the truth here, there's no magic in dealing with bitcoin, if you don't know how to trade don't start yet until you learn, if you want to invest as well, give it time to mature and during that process, seek to acquire more knowledge on bitcoin investment, if you do it the wrong way you will always loose and have bad result, so either long or short term investment needs adequate knowledge to when you need to buy, sell, hold and the strategies involved, your first security asset is your knowledge.",

Imagine people who bought Bitcoin in early 2009/2010 and are still holding today; if they are still holding, they would be multi-millionaires; some of them are still holding because they trust the process.There is no doubt that both short-term and long-term investors profit, but long-term investors benefit more.",

There needs to be a good balance between these two because the stupid thing to do here is to convert to day trading a few days after starting long term, which is commonly done by impatient newbies.Nothing is stupid as long as you are making money from it. If you are making it work, you are the boss. I found buyback and selling at the top in fractions of the entire portfolio worked and hence I am confident about it.",

Have you remember with LUNA? it's a coin which ever reach top 10 on CMC before, but after they suffered hack, now the coin price is worthless and drop to 33th position. Most of investors has no choice rather than hold it until the price can came back like the previous ATH.Don't get blinded with the position on CMC, it's useless. Just stick with Bitcoin.",

If it's an altcoin which suffered from an exit scam or something very similar, then it's best to cut the losses and pull out. The chances of it being fixed and recovering are low and losing more is making things worse. If it's Bitcoin and nothing truly devastating happened to it (which is so far the case), then the chance of recovery seems very high and thus hodling through the bear market gives a real prospect of making profit instead of cutting losses. As for dependence on a situation, I think a person should sell if the money is truly needed or if a person could use it now (not urgent, but still significant) and it's not at a big loss or is at some profit.",
