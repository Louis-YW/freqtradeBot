      "body": "I’ve read a lot of analyses as well predicting that Bitcoin might dump soon, probably after it reaches a new ATH. The reasoning is that there won’t be as much hype since almost everyone already knows what the upcoming big news now. not much to anticipate...Historically, every time Bitcoin hits an ATH, a correction usually follows. It’s something that could happen soon, and we really shouldn’t be surprised when it does. The key is to stay prepared and make the most of the opportunities during those corrections.from this analysis, it could dump as low as  $73,000.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-may-fall-20-to-73-000-if-it-breaks-below-this-key-support-level-a2242f1dQuoteBitcoin may face a downside potential to $73,000 if it breaks below its support level at around $90,680, according to Kim Kramer Larsson, an analyst at Saxo Bank.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization BTCUSD-0.60% has fallen 3.9% over the past five days while it is up 2.6% on Friday to trade at around $94,061, according to the Dow Jones Market Data.

Secondly, in bear market, people are more fearful with dips and they change their bottom price prediction lower and lower and lower, then price bottom out and they miss bottom price range.",

In my opinion, if the market is unable to break such support level and continues to bounce back with another bullish pump, tendency are that the bullish sentiment is still very strong and active and we may see a break out of the ATH this year and record a new all time high. Buying low and selling high is very risky during the bull season as it has already kicked off. Some retracement are for the market to gain momentum to break a resistance level, but some see it as a time for the bearish market and sell early. In whatever condition the market may be, make sure to stick to your take profits zone and partial profits zone in order not to miss out of profits accumulated because of the indecisive nature of the market.",

As long as the market remains volatile, what happened in the past can still happen again. The hype isn’t the same as when Bitcoin first hit its new ATH last year. As if this level of dump that's already in the market is not enough. You can't just be waiting for more dumping while you're not taking advantage of the dump that's already in the market presently. What if this is the level of dump that the market is going to experience before it picks up? You never can tell if there is going to be further dumping. You don't wait to buy, rather you buy and wait. There is big event coming up in the next few days, so I don't think many people will be selling their bitcoins. So if you are expecting further dumping below the $90k region it's going to take a little longer before that is going to happen. But within this month I don't think that's going to happen. The market was already recovering, before this dump happened. So expect the market to pick up from here instead of further dumping.",

They were hoping those shitcoins to be pumped. But they'll never do.The \"altcoin season\" has never meant some big shitcoins like ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, etc. be pumped big time. The altcoin season was always about unknown shitcoins with small market cap be pumped so much so that they enter the top altcoin lists. That is where the profit is.",

The hype may be different but in my opinion, the hype is still there even though it is not the same as before as you have said. If the price will decrease then many people will be happy about it since they can acquire more btc at much lower price.",

It's fine if anyone wants to sell their bitcoins in the current conditions but don't invite me in something like this because I will still stay and keep hodl because my plans are still not achieved now. Even though in the end the possibility of bitcoin going down for now is quite large, I will not let the assets I have disappear and that is precisely my momentum to buy so that in the end the choice is the most reasonable thing for me personally than I have to sell my bitcoin before my goals are carried out and realized.Not that I am naive and underestimate the decline but in the end the decline if it will eventually be at $50k-$70k like many speculators who say the decline in bitcoin for what I remove the assets I have now because indeed the profits I have are still very much there from previous purchases so there is no really strong reason for me to remove or sell the assets I have now.",

We should learn to get excited on whatever price mark we attain, the resistance is hard currently, whatever we see later might not be the usual we all expected to witness, dip and pump are sufficiently going to remain in the market.Don't get too anxious with the market, it is expected to see both dumb and pump in this year, in haste or in due time there will be Bitcoin price fall, just get your capital ready for investment or perhaps DCA your way until we begin touching the bear.",

Whhile many people are waiting for Bitcoin to dump so that they will leverage the opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin those that already held Bitcoin for long time for the purposing of making more profit when the price will appreciate will see the dump as disadvantage to them.Sincerely speaking, I will say that dumping of Bitcoin shouldn't be something we will celebrate because there is a level that it will dump many investors will start having double thought on Bitcoin and if that happens t automatically affect the whole process. However, Bitcoin is very volatile and as such there is the possibility of dumping and rising but that shouldn't be a negative signal to a potential investor in Bitcoin because it's certain that Bitcoin will take over the world economy in near future where most people and countries will make it a main stay of there exchange and fiscal reserve. So I think it will be better to invest now than waiting for it to dump below $90 or to the bench mark of $60 which may not possible be as you wish.",

If you are planning to invest, then just make use of the DCA strategy. In case it ends up dumping, you will still be able to accumulate at a cheaper price, but most of the people hoping bitcoin will dump won’t still invest in bitcoin, even if the price dumps, because no matter how low bitcoin price goes, they are still going to be predicting more dumps and won’t be investing till bitcoin price bounces back before they will start regretting why they didn’t invest when the price dumped.",
