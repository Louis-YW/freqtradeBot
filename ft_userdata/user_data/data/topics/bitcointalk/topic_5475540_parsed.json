In the wrong hands, even the most successful car breaks down in a short time. Do we need to come up with phones, hardware wallets, or anything else that is in daily demand—things that will withstand high and low temperatures or the onslaught of a tank or exposure to fire? Can you understand how much such things will cost? Hardware wallets do not cost a fortune, so those who find them very expensive should use them more carefully; in other cases, everything always belongs to a replacement.",

At the same time, people have no problem changing their smartphones, computers or other devices very often, and if this is already the case, does it make sense to save money on devices that store your cryptocurrencies?As it is the case with any device, technology is always advancing and you have to adapt to it, and what was considered good and safe 5+ years ago may not be anymore today. I have HW that are about 5 years old and still in perfect condition, but of course it depends on the person - some people just know how to store/handle their stuff much better than others.",

Your friend might actually have treated that hardware wallet too roughly. Hardware wallet most properly are kept in save places that you don’t necessarily need to look at them just everyday and so. You check them once in a while to see if they haven’t been tampered with and only need to bring them out when you need them to sign transaction. To track your wallet addresses or balance you just need to import the address into any software wallet which will make create a watch only wallet there to be able track incoming transactions and broadcast your signed transactions. So you don’t necessarily need to have your hardware wallet at hand everyday except you sign transactions everyday. Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on November 26, 2023, 12:43:15 PMSo in short your funds there got lose? I think it can still be recoverable right since it has a paraphrase keys? He should be able to recover those funds because almost all reputable hardware wallets have recovery seed phrases and private key that you can recover funds on it from either on another hardware wallet or even software wallets. The only way he can’t recover them is if he lost the seed phrase or forgot or also lost the passphrase if it was added. Damages or wear to hardware wallets is one of the reason why it is advise to back up recovery phrases offline and properly",

The way you handle your hardware wallet is what will determine its life span. Absolutely, taking care of your hardware wallet is most important for all wallet holders. Just like we take care of our smartphone by covering the screen with glass we should do the same thing to protect our hard wallet from screen scratching and button issue. If we take care properly I hope we can use it for a long time(more than 10 years). Your friend's experience shows the importance of proper maintenance of a hard wallet. when we  press buttons regularly and expose the hardware then it can really impact hardware longevity. we have to remember that when we save our hardware wallet, It is not just about protecting a device but it is about saving your assets(our future happiness). Thanks OP for sharing this reminder to handle hardware wallets with the care they deserve.I am using a Safepal wallet which is not a good wallet (not open source) but I purchased it for airdrop purposes. I am taking care of my wallet so much and always keep it in a small Leather wallet. I have been using it for more than two years but still it looks like it's been purchased a month. ago",

Why five years at most?  A Hardware Wallet should still be usable after even ten years.  Depending on how often you use it however, it may fail quicker than for the average user.  Or maybe it will last more if you use it less.But also remember it is just a very small piece of hardware we handle.  And they are not the most rugged build.  These buttons last more in theory if you press them more carefully.  If you push the hell out of them every time you need to click you will get them damaged very soon.Quote from: YellowSwap on November 26, 2023, 07:11:16 AMLooking at the hardware wallet, I don't like the sight of it, too many scratches, and I asked him why it looks so ugly, he claimed it fell few times before, like man, you can't be this careless with a hardware wallet. I agree about drop damage.  But there are some Hardware Wallets that were produced with very low quality.  Ledger had some very bad quality issues before.  And even if a LOT of users complained.  Ledger ignored the voice of the community and continued producing the same defective products.-----If some body purchases a piece of hardware it is their responsibility to take care of it.  No matter how cheap or expensive.It is hardware after all.  You can not slap a monitor every day and think it will work like new after years of slaps.  You either take care of the technology you buy or you will have to spend money out of your own carelessness.",
