  "content": "Before the Bitcoin Halving event of 2024 in 2023 we were happy and enthralled as we all were expecting a massive bull run like 2021 post halving. Before the halving, we saw a small but good bull run due to the Bitcoin ETF, which none of us might have anticipated as the demand for Bitcoin suddenly increased through ETFs. We did notice that Bitcoin broke its previous ATH and soared above $73K. Everything was going well and we expected to see another bull run but..Reality:The bull run will happen when it wants to but the miners are having a good time post halving as the transaction fees are now insanely high due to the network congestion. The block rewards have come down from BTC6.25 to BTC3.125, but that will not hamper them as the fees are hovering from 120 sat/vB to 800 sat/vB. Imagine someone who wants to transfer $20 worth of Bitcoin, will it be possible to make such a transaction at such high fees? What to do now?:I understand it is an ongoing issue but what is the solution to this issue? Will those spammers namely Ordinals stop spamming the network or it is a new thing that we as a community now need to adapt? The whole concept of Bitcoin adoption gets a big jolt due to the high transaction fees.

I'm conservative on what the function of bitcoin should be, but to be honest, rolling back inscriptions is no longer a viable solution. Addressing the issue like this would definitely result in a major hard fork of the network. For now, we live with it. Let's see what the future brings.Also, Runes might replace BRC-20s in the future, which utilizes UTXOs giving a less stressing solution to fungible tokens.",

The price of Bitcoin during post-halving is not triggered by transaction fees but by the reduction in the supply of Bitcoin caused by the halved block reward. The high transaction fees are beneficial to miners but it will not stop the increase of the price if demand exceeds supply.QuoteWhat to do now?:I understand it is an ongoing issue but what is the solution to this issue?

With these ordinal inscriptions/Runes clogging the mempool only the rich can afford the transaction fees and it will indeed make Bitcoin less attractive for small investors. Opening and closing the LN network is not also cheap and popular. For now, there is no solution in sight, so the best option is to learn how to live with these attacks. Small Bitcoin users would have to wait until the transaction fees drop before they carry out transactions.",

The answer to your question is this response that also asked that, have there not been mempool congestion right before the introduction of the bitcoin ordinals to the blocks space, how has it been dealt with ever since before now, maybe we should wait to see what more other things the developers may bring as a solution to increasing high fee, but will the miners go in support of that, we should also put ourself in such position, if something works in our favour, we may not care on it implications on others.",

This is not what I expected and envisioned about Bitcoin neither did Satoshi, do you think he/group thought that such a situation would happen in the future? The solution isn’t simple as you think because it requires community consensus. The first will be to increase the block size css this will allow more transactions per block and also increases the throughput. This solution has long ago be abolished as many think it will cause the network security reduction, that’s why we even got to the place of using Segwit addresses.The other solution is actually fixing the exploit in the protocol that allows ordinals transaction into the network. This solution is widely debated on because some people are of the opinion that it is share censorship and as such is going against the Bitcoin protocol, while Others are saying it is not. To me the reason why this is still a problem is because some set of users are definitely gaining from this exploit and a consensus will not be reached easily except it persists to an extremely unbearable degree",

Perhaps things will soon return to normal in the coming days but there is no guarantee that something similar to ORDI will not be created in the future. Those who are not in a hurry can delay the transaction and wait for the fee to decrease, but what about urgent transactions?

Not to mention, once the bull season arrives, the demand for bitcoin will increase even more and then we will see even crazier fees than now.",

You have to be patient is the right statement but it is not that easy in practice as the situation is not the same for everyone. The volatility of Bitcoin transaction fees and the way BRC20 has been spamming the network cannot be tolerated by everyone. I am glad that it has gone down and today it is at 29 sat/vB but next time they will spam the network and again we will be facing the same situation. There should be a conclusion to the transaction fee problem and I think it is high time that someone here in the forum comes up with another layer 2 solution which is far more practical and easy to use. If Bitcoin LN was that good then there would have been an increase in adoption but it is not and there are many issues.",
