Its initial aim was to address the issue of money transfers, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. However, we have also discovered that we can benefit from Bitcoin's volatility, leading it to become an investment asset, despite not being its original intention. The truth is that Bitcoin has provided us with more than what we initially anticipated.",

The fact of the matter is that they are portraying bitcoin as some sort of end-all-be-all solution that I'm positive they think Satoshi Nakamoto's the second coming of Jesus Christ or something. It's laughable at some point but at the same time this is something that people are genuinely believing in, so big yikers on that one. What's funny is that these things come from people of influence in the industry like content creators and vloggers or something. They paint bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on social media as if it's heaven-sent or something either for likes or impressions, but what they fail to realize is that they bait people into thinking that there's no risk involved in crypto when in fact the whole industry eats that stuff for breakfast.",

I do not think we can put a cap on how high Bitcoin can rise in the future with how much it has done with the little available to it so far. When it comes to its impact on the world, on economies, world poverty, it is no magic elixir. The world will not be fixed through Bitcoin but the more than a handful of people who are in it now, and will join later can improve their financial status through it.- Jay -",

      "body": "Recently, I just had some re-thinking, and I have mentioned somewhere that Bitcoin should not be forced on people to use it, although we can gladly try to tell someone about it. When they don't have that interest, you should not bother them. If most of them see that Bitcoin will keep advancing and with the price growth, even those who thought it was not something they should invest in will on their own learn about Bitcoin technology.I believe you see some of those newbies that come here to say that they were so sceptical about Bitcoin some years ago, but due to the great dominance of Bitcoin, they are now beginning to regret why they never invested some years back. That's always how it will be with some people in the future. I wouldn't say that I am an exception; there was a time when I was so sceptical cryptocurrency generally, but when the time came for me to learn, I was even the one looking for a real Bitcoiner to lecture me.Cheers ðŸ¥‚, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘º",

So the theoretical maximum potential is limitless, all people in the world can adopt Bitcoin.But you need to look at it from the perspective of an average person. And average person in this world lives from paycheck to paycheck and at best has a few hundred $$ in savings for an emergency. What would they win from switching to Bitcoin? They will just be exposed to volatility, which is quite stressful and risky. They will also need to become cybersecurity experts, because if Bitcoin is stolen from their wallet, it can not be returned. It's just a lot of extra effort and risks with no benefits. They don't need financial freedom, because average people don't have their bank accounts frozen for no good reason, like bitcoiners tend to believe. Inflation also doesn't affect them as much if they don't store their wealth in cash.",

I had a conversation on aforementioned topic too you can check for yourself. Well the point of the OP in that topic was difficult to understand but i did understand to some extent only like why adoption of BTC is necassary and how we should approach it. But here in this topic i understood your whole point.And it's a bitter reality which we have to accept that we might not be there to see the full acceptance and adoption of BTC as we all know the mining of BTC will end near 2140. And we might not be alive at that time (but who know who have the miracles of life).And you said we should accept the reality and accept how much potential BTC and i think thats what we are doing and thats why we are putting our time and efforts in its adoption even if we might not be able to see the final results. The whole point is, we must remain optimistic not by following someone like you followed or motivated by a YouTuber, instead we should motivate ourself with our own knowledge and interest. That's what will keep us driven and most of the people are not making its adoption streamline because they wanted to be rich they are doing it because they wants others to become rich too and thats generous.",
