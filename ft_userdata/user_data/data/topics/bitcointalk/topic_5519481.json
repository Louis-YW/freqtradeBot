They still wouldn’t have been able to sell, and that could’ve been money in the bank for them. Plus, they don’t really care much about that as they don’t have an investor’s mindset when it comes to those bitcoins since they were just seized back in January 2024. German police claim largest Bitcoin seizure ever — more than $2 billion recovered in ongoing video piracy investigationQuoteGerman police confiscated over $2 billion worth of Bitcoins (BTC) during investigations into the movie2k.to pirate movie streaming site, according to a report from Der Speigel. This is the largest-ever currency seizure by German law enforcement according to Germany’s State Criminal Police Office (LKA).According to the Der Speigel report, 50,000 Bitcoins were secured by police in Saxony during the investigation of two men (aged 40 and 37) suspected of running a German portal for movie2k.to through May 2013 and squirreling away their profits as cryptocurrency. Remember — at that time, 50,000 BTC wasn’t worth anywhere near the $2 billion+ it is now. In 2013 BTC started the year valued at $13 and ended at about $750. If we say the funds were converted to BTC at a value of around $500, the 50,000 Bitcoins would have represented about $25 million in hidden loot.",

If I am not wrong, I believe German government had confisticated those Bitcoins. So it was not an investment for the government. So I believe the y cannot hold it for longer period just to make profit out of this. That's why they had to sell of their holdings to recover the money. There was no speculation at all. That's how usually happens in such scenarios. The enforcement authorities are bound to sell of the criminal proceeds in a time bound manner as directed by the court. I think that is what happened here!",

If you are an investor or trader, you will try to find ATH, take profit with your bitcoin but government has many other things to do, and their government works by money from their citizens as tax payers. They don't work with money from seized bitcoin at any price of bitcoin on the market.How German government got these bitcoins defines how they treat these bitcoins. If they invest their national treasury in Bitcoin, like El Salvador or Bhutan, their action would be very different.",

Like you said earlier, that you are no one to judge their decision,  that is actually right. Even as we want to HODL bitcoin for long doesn't mean we will HODl for dear life. Each of us has our target, our selling point may not be profitable as we thought but do you also know that bitcoin ATH now is not the highest ATH that will ever exist? Definitely there will be ATH upon ATH continuously 100years from now. If we keep thinking about that, we would not be able to sell our HODLings because new ATH is endless. What if bitcoin hit $200k  now, you will also regret selling at $93k and when bitcoin hit $500k, people who sold @$200k will also regret. So sometimes there is no need to regret if the owner of bitcoin decided to sell in his final stage. It could be that Germany bought there bitcoin when it was way cheaper than now, so it's up to them since it's a collective idea and a public bitcoin reserve, opinion would have arise to selling it compeard to a single entity.",

There's a lot of deliberations. I read somewhere that some victims of the Silk Road hack will receive remunerated. I also read that the family will be able to keep proceeds that were gotten legally. My point is, it's not always black and white. From the outside, we can't know why the German government sold when they sold, but like I said it's a decision that has been properly deliberated and the dates have been predetermined. The same with the US. We can't know why they haven't sold off the bitcoin they got from seizures but I doubt profit is what they primarily look for.",

Do you think this amount is what they really care about?  On the other hand, those seized bitcoins that were sold out were not federal seized funds; it was a small state inside Germany, \"Saxony,\" that sold out their holdings, which were captured through the seizure process. They don't really care about the profit, like I stated  here  in my local board.",

People are still spinning the same story that Germany sold some Bitcoins, when in fact it was about the fact that these BTCs legally belonged to one of their provinces (Saxony) considering that they were confiscated in their territory. As far as I know, there wasn't much of a choice about whether to keep them or sell them, because by law they had to do so. It may seem to you that $1 or $2 billion is a lot, but Germany's budget for 2024 is approximately EUR 445 billion - it's not like waiting would help them much financially.",

German law requires seized assets in criminal cases to be sold to prevent heavy losses from market fluctuation, like what happened with Movie2K. At the time of their sale, Bitcoin was already up from $43k to $53k, raking in $2.86 billion, a good return on paper given the risk of holding a highly volatile asset.Timing the market is always tricky, but with Bitcoin's wild swings, it's a little like trying to time a roulette spin. Even less often do institutional investors sell at the very peak. Holding out for better prices also wasn't a straightforward option considering legal and procedural prerequisites surrounding such a sale. This lesson here is less about \"missing out\" and more about understanding trade offs involved with large, volatile holdings.",
