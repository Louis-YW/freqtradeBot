Unless someone has not achieved anything in life and has not finished any school and being a \"bitcoin investor\" is the only thing he can say about himself. Because it is much better to say about yourself that you are a civil engineer, or a master of mathematics, or a doctor of internal medicine, or even a father and husband. If 10 000$ invested in bitcoin is all you achived in your life ... you can call yourself a \"bitcoin investor\" because you have nothing better to say about yourself.",

I see your friend has made a bitcoin investment and it is quite a good amount.  And if he holds it for long term then he has the potential to earn a huge profit from it. Maybe because of this excitement your friend has said that he is now a Bitcoin investor. Besides having basic knowledge in Cryptocurrencies, I think being regularly informed about the current world news will help someone who wants to trade or invest on a regular basis.",

Once you have earned your Bitcoins, you can then store them in your digital wallet or trade them on an exchange for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies.If only by owning Bitcoin but not automatically making someone as an investor. As we all know, Investing in Bitcoin requires a deeper understanding of the cryptocurrency market, including its trends, risks, and potential growth opportunities. It is important to stay up to date with industry news and developments, and have a solid understanding of the technology behind Bitcoin and how it works.",

Even without any knowledge really as long as you own an amount you'd be considered as one. I reckon a lot of people who use fiat don't really understand how it works and yet they still use it and can be considered to own fiat as well.There's definitely some desire for bragging hence why he coined it like that but eh, whatever, glad for him though.",

But I think what's more important in being a bitcoin investor is when you educate yourself on how bitcoin works and the risks and potential rewards associated with investing in it. You can find many online resources, such as websites and forums, that provide information on bitcoin. Also, since bitcoin prices can be highly volatile we monitor our investment regularly and that's what a usual investor do.",

At this level of Bitcoin price is not everybody that can afford to get more BTC or even afford one.it was does early years of Bitcoin introduction that  many people can afford to get many Bitcoin because it was cheaper by them, just imagine that does that have Bitcoin worth $15k now that it is not even up to 1BTC and just imagine the portion of Bitcoin the person will could been holding by the early years the price was cheaper.

For one to be a proper investor of bitcoin although it was just a payment gateway according to satoshi, then one needs to learn lots like it’s security and also the trading abilities of it like when to buy and when to sell these coins. The kind of exchanges to deal with and also the kind of wallets to store them in.",
