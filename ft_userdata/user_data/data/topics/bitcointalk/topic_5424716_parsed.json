At theend of the day, there is a need and use case for both, and we welcome the recent innovationin the space. Decentralized exchanges have become a lot more efficient and user-friendly,while centralized exchanges have improved in terms of KYC and security.Looking at centralized exchanges, it is important that the industry becomes much moretransparent, in particular so the markets understand the levels of crypto held in custody arehigher than what the exchange owes to its clients. Furthermore, we should continue tosupport regulators around the world by engaging and sharing knowledge and expertise.Going forward, we expect increased adoption of decentralized exchanges and hope to seefurther innovation in the space. That being said, centralized exchanges are crucial buildingblocks of the current crypto infrastructure and are likely to stay.\"",
