  "content": "I have been curious about the $GDX token which was recently announced to be listing on www.d5.xyz. Let's try first is it Gridex Protocol? You can try checking on the website airdrop.gdx.orgGridex Protocol: Integrates First Completely On-chain Order Book For New Generation DEXThis news was quoted by Yahoo Finance:LONDON, Feb. 10, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Gridex Protocol, an advanced decentralized protocol built on top of the Ethereum mainnet, is pushing the boundaries of the possibilities in the DeFi space. Its advanced technology and innovative features are setting new standards for decentralized trading and driving the deconcentralization of the financial industry forward.Advanced Features of Gridex ProtocolGridex Protocol supports trading of ERC20 tokens using its own evolved Grid Order Maker Book (GMOB) model to provide safe and effective trading at instant speed. Anyone can extend the protocol without additional permissions or smart contracts required. Based on this model, the Grid Price Linear Movement (GPLM) algorithm handles transaction execution and settlement. GPLM is designed to reduce gas consumption running on Ethereum by achieving the same level of resource consumption as the Constant Function Market Maker (CFMM) algorithm.GMOB - Related to the DEX Order Book, usually the DEX doesn't have an order book so you can't set a certain price (limit order)GPLM - reduce gas consumption (fee), usually in ethereum gas prices are always expensivePhoto illustration of how Gridex workshttps://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1999274/image_5003628_27855018.htmlIf you look at the picture above, on the left it is a maker or something like a liquidity provider but it is very different from what you learned from pancakeswap. Here you only need to make Buy/Sell transactions and you will get a fee from the Taker. I will explain more later for this section.Well, maybe that's the question??? If the Gridex Protocol provides performance power to a DEX, where do the prices in the DEX itself come from? For example on the Pancakeswap DEX, we just have to provide a smart contract, put it in, the price is out if there is already liquidity or we can swap from ethereum to USDT because it is connected to the BSC network, so the price will appear. Or the simple question is: what determines the current price of ethereum, which is 1570 usd? To answer this:Gridex Protocol allocates these prices based on prices set by traders (sellers or buyers) and also prices set by sellers or buyers from other DEX2 such as Uniswap and Sushiswap. This is called GMOB which implements an algorithm to determine the most suitable Ethereum-like token price within seconds.Gridex Protocol provides exclusive features such as its Maker Orders protocol, which allows traders to place orders of any size and price without fear of slippage or MEV. This allows access to liquidity from other DEXs as well as liquidity pooled from users, providing users with a more seamless trading experience. In addition, Gridex Protocol plans to roll out its protocol on more public chains such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and BNB Chain for faster and affordable transactions.What program is currently being run by Gridex Protocol?Namely: The second airdrop program at airdrop.gdx.org https://kask.us/iOEn8 (I quote from Kaskus because someone already knows about the gridex airdrop)$GDX airdrop tutorial https://kask.us/iOI9wHow about the D5? What does the Gridex Protocol reveal?D5 is a DEX that uses the system from Gridex Prokol. Or the English language is D5 supported by Gridex Protocol. $GDX tokens will enter D5.xyz on March 15, 2023.If you want to know more, ask the D5 (DEX) team directly at the Binance Live eventThis news is quoted from: https://coingape.com/press-releases/participate-in-d5 -exchanges-binance-live/https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/06185216/unnamed-3.pngWhen you participate in D5 Exchange Binance Live, you have a chance to win 1000 dollars as well as 2 tickets to Paris Blockchain Week.D5 Exchange has announced that they will be hosting an online event on Binance Live on March 7th at 20:00 (UTC+8). This event will focus on the topic \"Order Book VS AMM: Which is more suitable for user needs on the DEX protocol?\" and will feature the core members of the blockchain project, the leader of the institution i",
