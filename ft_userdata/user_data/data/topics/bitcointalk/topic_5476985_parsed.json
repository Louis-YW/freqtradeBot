For individuals who are passionate about their work, retirement becomes a renaissance opportunity to turn professional passions into a tapestry of leisure. It's an encore performance of a lifelong symphony, an opportunity to write a song of fulfillment and inquiry. As one chapter closes, retirees become writers of a story in which work and joy effortlessly mix, providing an opportunity to appreciate the encore of a life well-lived.",

For fear of constant inflation, it could be harder for someone to comfortably retire as people presently are already on the hunt for second/side jobs in order to stay afloat to withstand the harsh and strong waves of inflation.I too believe that a lot of people would opt not to work a day in their life but now has little choice than to work if that person wants to provide for himself. For a comfortable retirement, you should have worked and earned a lot of money. Enough to take care of your personal and health needs and then some for whatever emergencies that may arise. That’s why people strive to get investments that could be bringing in income at regular intervals. That’s one sure way to comfortably safely retire without having to worry about inflation.",

I still remember when I got my first paycheck at age 18, wondering how long it would take before I stopped dedicating myself to a job, and when I came into contact with more older people than was typical of my best friend's father, he expressed the fact that his life would be unhappy if he didn't work. For freelance workers, they can be much more proactive in finding work, or as I understand it, it's just the way they approach what life will be like next when job limits appear. I also have a few friends who are very rich materially, and their goal is always freedom at work before the age of 30. They tend to make a lot of money and then enjoy life.",

So after retirement, they enjoy life most of the time.It cannot be generalized to all companies, because now things are starting to not work as you say. Companies now determine policies unilaterally, and this happens simultaneously. So new employees cannot reject the policy because all companies apply the same policy.The essence of this policy is to avoid pensions, where each worker will only be contracted for a short period, usually ranging from 3 months to 1 year. It is wise for companies to get fresh employees every year by maximizing their productive age, rather than signing long-term contracts with employees whose productivity levels decrease.By implementing short contract rules, companies now do not need to spend large amounts of money on their employee pension funds. It is a profitable option for those who have employment. As long as the level of employment in a particular area is low enough compared to the workforce, monopoly will easily occur there. Imbalance causes unhealthy rules to emerge. Including pension funds that will never exist.",

It's one thing if your job is a physical job with a certain level of risk and you're not passionate about it, like working in a mine or on an assembly line. But come retirement age, if you have some intellectual jobs that you enjoy doing, why not keep doing them? A clear example would be the signature campaigns on this forum. I don't think that if someone retires this year from their main job, they are going to stop doing signature campaigns because they have 'retired', when it is a fun activity that can be done comfortably from home with their pyjamas on and with free time. An example, I think, would be philipma1957, who already receives a pension and is on a forum's signature campaign.",

It's a situation where you usually don't have problems with money anymore, and you can do anything you want within your budget. People typically retire when they are older because no one works forever; our bodies and minds depreciate, and we cannot compete with the younger generation.However, there are also individuals who retire from their jobs and start a new business. This isn't easy because owning a business entails more pressure than working for an employer. However, with high risk comes the potential for big rewards. If the business succeeds, you'll likely retire early and enjoy the retirement life, where money works for you.",

And before you decide, let me tell you a little bit about what it means to retire on time and retire at the right time.What is meant by retiring on time, you will retire according to your age, and the average person retires at the age of 59 years to the age of 65 years. The average person retires at that age because their abilities and physical strength are no longer strong if they have to continue working. And plus at that age, it's very vulnerable for someone to get sick. And that's regardless of whether they have enough money to live on or not.Meanwhile, what is meant by retiring at the right time. When you have enough savings, an investment or a business that even without your presence the business is still running, because you have people who are trusted enough to be able to run the business that you have started from scratch. And if you have all or any of these three factors, then you can choose to retire at any age. Because you already have the assurance that without you working, your needs will still be met, without having to ask a child or ask someone else.",
