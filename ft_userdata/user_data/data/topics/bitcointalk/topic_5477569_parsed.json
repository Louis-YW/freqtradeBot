After bitcoin created it was then other alternative currency were formed and created, to make it clear to you altcoin are being copied from bitcoin but they can't function as bitcoin.",

Your understanding is flawed. Bitcoin is just a digital currency, it has not been introduced to fight the current economy or to phase out the Fiat currency system. So please come out of this mindset. Also Bitcoin is not capable of handling the transaction volume that happens worldwide. It is more often investment rather than a currency. There is no war to fight. Bitcoin will flourish alongside the mainstream economy and not by removing it.",

Or do we have our darling Bitcoin to be blamed unconciously with its flexibilities romances with the Fiats and the AltCoins? Firstly, I'm not a fan of being bias in nature, I like to call a spade a spade not to think of anything in my own favour. For the case of Bitcoin, puting Altcoins and fiat for one to be biased about any of them. what you should consider first is; is this biases negative or positive, one can be positively or negatively biased because both the Altcoins has negative effect on Bitcoin. for Altcoins they where all introduced for a selfish reason which we all know so being biased has to do with what effect does it have on Bitcoin, is it a negative or positive effect? Every stands for its own purpose not even the fiat is in competition with Bitcoin, fiats currency works Vice Viz with Bitcoin. Fiat tends to be a tool for the government to control its citizens but it doesn't stand against the welfareness of Bitcoin hence it has been in existence before Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not to be blamed neither Altcoins nor Fiat for anything that is going on or happening in the world now like I said before everything stands for its purpose Bitcoin is an evolution and fiat too was an evolution as of when it was introduced.",

It is true that there can be liquidity from DEXs, but good projects are easily listed.The only thing that will reduce the number of altcoin is investors not betting on them. altcoin developers aim for quick profits. Your failure to invest in these projects makes them either strive to develop them or stop, and in both cases it will reduce the number of altcoins.",

This is one reason I am grieved about with the government making restrictions on Bitcoin not acceptable in such respective societies without considering of its masses are interested about it.In my country, I don't know if it is for security reasons or the biased nature of the mindsets of the government not having any form of authoritative capacity in governing of Bitcoin since it has been a non-custodial decentralized digital currency.I came from a place where the government is selfish in the sense that they feeds fat and fills their personal pockets with the public funds and legally extorrtsy its citizens personal incomes as revenues where to generate their own income.As though since they don't have the governing power on Bitcoin, they situated Bitcoin and Crypto currencies as a whole on suspension mainly towards the governance levels of financial transactions while it is authorize acceptable at the private levels where individual is liable to decide if yes or no, I will accept or not accept Bitcoin.So if the above mentioned locations governmental system doesn't want to accept Bitcoin in its governments sectors, why depriving its citizens from it? Is their a negative tag in Bitcoin that those who are allowed to legally accept it doesn't know about? Or is it that the governments that permits it acceptable in it countries doesn't care about the financial securities of its citizens or what?This is just one of it I inhaled the grieves about the biases (obstacles) surrounded with Bitcoins",

As for fiat currencies, I used to believe that we'd see a major fiat crisis that would prompt the world to switch to cryptos, but I no longer consider it realistic in the near future. Fiat sometimes fails, but it can also be very stable, and there's a lot of global infrastructure around it, so I don't think we should expect it to become obsolete. So Bitcoin is just an alternative to fiat, not a way of replacing it completely. Building up partnerships with traditional institutions can be helpful to promote faster adoption, but being against traditional financial structures is reasonable as well.",

As BTC investors or traders, or enthusiasts we should not possess habitual baised issues or oppose anything even if it Alts. That's because most of the BTC adopters in the current era are here to earn money and they (including me) will prefer to avail as many opportunities as they can. Some will say having alts will decrease the risk involved in investing in crypto because we get to have a chance to diversify our capital and etc. etc.I will say, just don't ignore or oppose alts, keep an eye on them because not every alt is that bad, some are really good and solving real problems, I hope your swords will not turn to my side, I am not saying BTC is bad but I will say open mind is better than having a close mind. And this is something I also learned a few months back, before it I was also thought BTC was everything even though all of my earnings were in BTC but after seeing the potential of alts (not all, but of few) I was convinced to keep an eye on the alts too. But as a BTC enthusiast, we should oppose the fiat system and I am still against it because I have learned that they want us to remain their slaves and so dependent on them while there is no need for us to remain one. Everything is so clear and independent but they still made us live like this and even some banks went bankrupt results in the loss of many people. I know you might say, there are insurances, etc., etc. but in my country, the SBP has declared that if any bank goes bankrupt we will not be responsible for it. I mean, the main authority behind these banks saying this then where will people place their funds? I know BTC is here to solve the problem but who will teach those who don't want to and still want to use Banks?",

If I have to tell on the level of a scale then I will say 90% biased with fiat and governments and 10% with alts, because alts are under BTC and we know that, so we should not compete with our BTC swords against alt's plastic or fake knives. We should oppose fiat and governments not because they are against BTC. Because they are not providing us the financial freedom.I think you should make a correction that, now even though governments are not against BTC because of ETFs and adoption of it, we can see governments are also adopting BTC and want to make money out of it. And the last reason is we have our darling BTC and its features that make us unique from all and make us fall in love with her. As a BTC investor, I will say BTC is the best haven if compared with fiat, banking schemes, or alts, due to many reasons. We can't conqueror the global economic challenges with the current state of BTC because of its scalability issues, until they get resolved we should not say BTC can resolve economical challenges.",

The sector is not regulated, hence you will find many altcoins that are just copycats of Bitcoin. But you should understand that Bitcoin is not competing with any currency in the crypto space. It has developed over time to become the undisputed king of the crypto industry. It cannot be faked or counterfeited. Many people have tried to create something similar to it, but have all failed. The government don't want to lose control over the financial operations of the country, so it is doing all it can to make fiat currency the main legal tender. But Bitcoin is not here to destroy the current fiat financial system. But it exists to give people an alternative to fiat money. I think Bitcoin and Fiat will exist side by side for a long time. I don't understand your stance on Bitcoin romancing with fiat or altcoins. People need to convert money from fiat to Bitcoin to carry out financial activities. Don't lose sight that Bitcoin is not generally accepted in all the nations of the world, hence people will also swap BTC for fiat and vice versa.
