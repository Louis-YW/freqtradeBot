The illegal immigrants provide cheap labor, but I also don't think that they are really important for the US economy. I expect a new Bitcoin ATH in the first quarter of 2025, followed by a bear market that will continue for a long time frame.

What do you all think?Bitcoin is pretty much a toy for the rich, and Wall Street sees it as having the highest risk of all high risk investments. So in a sudden economic downturn the price would indubitably drop due to its eccentricity as an investment class. However, if economic problems are caused by a devaluing dollar, then we could actually see a \"flight to bitcoin\".",

But after that, in 2026, Bitcoin will have to rest and start all over again, meaning we will be in the bear market. So the price is going down, very hard, so most likely there will be investors who will shift to stocks and any other assets. But it doesn't mean that it will cause the downfall of the US economic other Trump, that's how Bitcoin works, we have a 4 year cycle.",

Currently, he has loads of money in his pocket, which he could use when the prices go down during economic turmoil. Some have painted that as a warning sign of recession, but certainly not a promise of recession, it is complicated and associated with a number of factors that influence the markets.The impact of this recession on Bitcoin could happen in some very odd ways, of course, out of work people may liquidate a portion of their assets, including Bitcoin, which could drive down the price of the cryptocurrency in the coming months. However, Bitcoin is increasingly being framed as a hedge against inflation and a financial meltdown. If there is less confidence in traditional markets, demand for decentralized assets could grow. The relation between crypto and economic downturns isn't directly proportional, instead, it's an idea of safety during turmoil. This is to say that while moves from Buffett and economic shifts will not go unnoticed, Bitcoin might actually be resilient or thrive in the face of global sentiment and adoption trends.",

Clearly the majority in the US feels these changes will be good for them. But Mr. Buffett clearly doesn't. For an average American citizen, massive deportations will be good in terms that they'll have higher pay rate, better working conditions and more available jobs because migrants work like slaves but at the same time, there is a high chance that their deportation will increase the price on everything, so maybe the life of an average American citizen won't change for better but it's debatable.Quote from: legiteum on November 14, 2024, 04:46:04 PMMy own assumption is that it will be very negative for the price.

In the middle of the year? Somewhere in May 2025? What will the price of Bitcoin be at that time? There are still six months until May 2025. During this time, the price of Bitcoin can double. From these levels, there can theoretically be a correction. At the same time, we cannot clearly answer whether a recession in the US will lead to an increase in the price of Bitcoin or to its fall. A recession in the US will definitely lead to a fall in oil prices and an economic catastrophe in countries such as Russia and other peripheral countries. The US will most likely suffer less than others. At the same time, the price of Bitcoin, as a rule, has an inverse correlation with the price of oil. Therefore, in the medium term, it may even grow (although short-term panic falls in the price of the first cryptocurrency are also possible).",

But that was not just US in recession, but most of the world was also in recession which meant the sell pressure was global and it caused the drops which is why bitcoin is still below $100k after all this time.In the future, more recession which they only would battle by increasing interest rates in the US, would similarly cause sell pressure and can affect the bull run.The only two other things to consider are:1) Will it be global? In your arguments, the recession is in US only and as long as it remains that way the impact on bitcoin is not going to be as big as it was before.2) Will there be inflation as well? All the deportation (firing bulk of US workforce) and the tariff war would create much higher inflation compared to the past couple of years in the US. We already know inflation positively affects bitcoin by increasing its price.On top of that we have dedollarisation going on and with Trump and his wars against their world (specially now that we have seen some of his cabinet members who are the biggest warmongers in America) we can be sure that dedollarisation will speed up which can lead to US dollar tanking hard.Obviously that means bitcoin price shooting up automatically.",
