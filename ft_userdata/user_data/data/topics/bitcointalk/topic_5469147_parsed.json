Slap one of them and let him just report you in a police station, you will know what I am talking about.Police will try their best to investigate but they can not find answers to all. In United States, 2 Pac was killed many years ago, but who killed him has not been known until recently that Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis was alleged to be the one. There are many unknown death in developed countries that no one know what actually happened, some later csn been known after many years gone.Quote from: Sexylizzy2813 on October 04, 2023, 07:03:21 AMIf nah to call on them to serve their contri when election reach them go call on them and these our brodas and sistas go answer the call.It is not mandatory but voluntary and they are paid for the job.

Insecurity is a major problem in many countries of the world, so it is not perculiar to Naija.As for the NYSC members being kidnapped, all hands must be on deck to rescue them. Police need all the support of the villages with information that can help them in the rescue. It's really unfortunate but I have the feeling they will be released soon.",

If nah to call on them to serve their contri when election reach them go call on them and these our brodas and sistas go answer the call.No be today this kind matter dey happen but wetin they vex me pass na why our government dey allow am happen, again and again. But the reason is not far fetched since you won't isolate all those issues from the plaquing insecurities in the country. Our country don suffer from bad leadership too much so tey we dey count trajectory and antecedents of past leaders and their scale of corruption. Any country that cannot secure it's citizens, especially those it has sent for such National assignment like the NYSC corpers. Haba, people wey get future, get plans, get ambition. Una go just allow make kidnappers carry dem go. Just like that? It doesn't make sense na. Those corpers are supposed to be the most secured citizens of the country, at the time, especially as they wear that uniform, like other workers under government assignments, would be protected.QuoteE dy pain me say we still dey go for all these things when government call on them, abi the NYSC no get right to say no all these government related things?

No work instead nah hustle wey no dey related to wetin these our brodas and sistas go school for, e make sense?Make I pause here, make una talk something for this matter...Since NYSC don become compulsory to dey eligible to get government work for Nigeria, plenty of us no get choice than to go for it. In the middle of attending the program, some us our young people wey get passion go wan take more assignments or go to PPAs that are somewhat closed to vulnerable areas and as such, prone to attacks. Na why if government wan follow my opinion, I go say make em ban this NYSC stuff since it has almost defeated it's purpose. Mainly of which is to promote national unity. How many of the Corpers they actually stay for their PPA, without relocation?Na wetin make me too go look for connect on how dem go carry me go place wey near home as I been dey serve back then. Because as we beem dey serve, issue of insecurity was still at its peak and I was ready to forfeit it if I didn't get what I wanted, which was a place near home. So, before we go mobilization, dem help me put me for where close home. Like that was actually better for me. But looking at it broadly, that has somehow defeated it's purpose since I could easily serve close to home, without having to travel to the other side of the country. Abeg, I support that legislative motion wey been suggest say make them Ban NYSC. Since it has lost its main purpose.",

In the search to rescue kidnapped NYSC members, it is the duty of the community which the member is serving to give right information that will aid in the rescue of the kidnapped member.Even as our security agencies are performing their duties, they're also careful of their lives too because they are human too they can't use because they are securing the citizens and lose their lives carelessly. They also have families to take care of, so cases of this nature requires intelligence to handle.",

Security issues in this country is a planned game. Police virtually knows where all bad boys stays and how they're operating. The problem is that these guys work for the politicians and they're using them for their dirty jobs. the police is aware of all these. They can't do their Job properly because their hands are tied by these politicians whom pretend to be working for us. If you think I'm lying, go and buy gun, license it properly and shoot three times in the neighborhood. You'll be amazed at the speed police will come and arrest you. This is the same neighborhood that crimes happen without trace. who is  fooling who??NYSC has long lost its value. Its no longer a that glorified scheme it once was and Corpers are no longer held to such esteem like the early days. If not for job hunt requirements, people wouldn't be going for it that much. I support its being scraped cos its now of little or no value.Being involved in election is not by force for corpers, I didn't get involved during my time and was not penalized. but you wouldn't blame them,  its an opportunity for extra cash.I wish and pray for their release. its sad that they are now used as a bait to extort from the government.",

Unless say you don pass or dey the age of about 31 and above or get some kind issues, before them go fit allow you exempt yourself from service. Egypt own national service na almost 3years naw. Our own na just 1. Even if say you no go fit do the whole 1year, that 3weeks for camp na another experience wey person no suppose miss as long as say na Nigerian university you finish from and you stay the country grow up. God go do am make Dem release the abducted corps members. Na just make every one wey dey go serve learn safety tips of being of plain cloths wen travelling to and fro place of service/posting, at least travel in a pair, stay online and keep communication and trackers open. Unless say you plan to branch go somewhere else, stay enroute, move in the day, stay awake and alert and pray.",
