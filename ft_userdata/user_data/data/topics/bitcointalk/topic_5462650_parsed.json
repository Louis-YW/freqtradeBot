  "content": "I owned thousands of ETH and nearly one hundred BTC in 2020. Due to the contract transaction, the huge position was targeted for forced liquidation, and the bull market started after my forced liquidation. In the past three years, in order to deal with debt and life, my investment style has been more aggressive, and the income has not been very stable , but luckily I've paid off most of my debt .The decision to invest with a small amount of your own funds is often radical and high-risk. In order to reduce the impact of investment on life and make a more correct investment strategy and expand my popularity in the social media .I need your funding.Now I plan to raise 10,000 usdt, through the Binance contract transaction, the raised funds will be doubled by 100 times within 5 to 8 months, and then returned to the backers with BTC or ETH. If you will still trust my judgment, I will suggest that you continue to hold them for a year or so, which will give you another 5 to 15 times the gains.Of course, this benefit is not certain, and the worst result is the loss of all the funds raised. Therefore, I hope that funders who are interested in this plan, you only need to fund tens or hundreds of USDT, because even if you lose all of them, it will not have any impact on your life. But this may make a celebrity in the cryptocurrency arena, and all the glory of this celebrity comes from your trust.If you are interested in this plan, you can transfer your USDT to the following address.USDT（TRC20）：TEBQQYTwurC45T5RTnUGoj3Dv8pQPqSqLWUSDT（ERC20）：0xd4542f09b4d0bee5b9db5e63185a72d7dab2c0c5（For easy contact, please add your Bittalk quickname or Twitter quickname in the transfer notes or contact me by posting below.Transfers of less than 50 USDT are considered free donations, but I will also give you some benefits.）Private Offered FundFund name: Redemption Fund 1Recruitment date: 2023.8.9-2023.9.9Fund size: 10000usdtMinimum funding amount: 50usdtFund lock-up period: 66 daysFund launch date: within one week after the end of fundraisingFund  redemption rules:1 times  Share Proportion * Aggregate Fund*80%1-5      times SP*AF*70%5-10    times SP*AF*60%10-20  times SP*AF*50%20-50  times SP*AF*40%50-75  times SP*AF*35%75-100 times SP*AF*30%      100 times SP*AF*25%When the fund is liquidated（more then 100 times）, 75% of the portion exceeding 100 times will be returned to the sponsor in proportion to the funding.（The Aggregate Fund is calculated net of operating expenses for each period.）Open for redemption every half month.Investment plan: 70% of the fund is used to open a Binance real contract trading account, and you can track the fund income in real time on Bitfrog. 30% of the fund is used to deal with the redemption of backers after the lock-up period expires. 2% of the fund is withdrawn every half month as the operating expenses of the fund. Once the Aggregate Fund is less than 20% of the funds raised, the plan fails. The NAV of the fund is published weekly.(The fund reaches 13,500 usdt before the deadline for fundraising, and the fundraising will end early. If the fundraising deadline does not reach 70% of the fundraising amount, the full amount will be returned to the sponsor. If you are unwilling to accept the refund, I will make a new plan.)If the plan is successful (the Aggregate Fund（Including exit funds） reaches 80 times the initial size within 8 months), the sponsors of RF1 have the priority to subscribe for the subsequent fund plan. If I am lucky enough to become a celebrity in the cryptocurrency arena, the funders of RF1 will receive a share in all cryptocurrency projects I develop.Cryptocurrencies have changed the world,  your trust will also！My Waterloo in 2020 and some screenshots of later transactions:https://postimg.cc/gallery/zXKnd1D",
