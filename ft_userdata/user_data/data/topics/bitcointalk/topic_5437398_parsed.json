  "content": "Ello Governor, I am curious to see if there is anything out there that is \"in the works\" that I am not aware of. I think I am most excited to see Frank's FTX scam coin, but also the limited \"Don't get Yogged\" card will also be sick! As far as other tokens and such i'm really not sure what other projects that really are interesting are in the works. I am hoping that one day something new is just going to pop up and get lucky enough to get the next super limited piece in time before they sell out! Lol. As an added bonus, if you reply to the top piece, would you also include what your favorite crypto coin is and why? Can't wait to see the posts, if you can also include pictures to make it more fun  (I will add some later)Cheers, TREAD",

I am a big fan of the slabs, particularly those Alpen 1,000,000 sats the gold one and the 500,000 silver series but of course the Kialara is classic and the creme de la creme of the bars. Also of course the Cass ones, i've seen the microsoul ones that look in credible. Speaking of rectangular crypto related objects those Cardsmith cards are so fun! I bought a bunch of packs off of MJ when they first came out and had a ball opening them, such beautiful art and holos. Was lucky enough to pull some numbered cards, and I love the chance at hitting a crypto redemption card. I ended up selling a large set of the common cards and just kept all the holos for myself in my card binder. I'll look forward to the series 2 as well. Need to get my hands on some more of series 1 before they sell out!!",
