Bitcoin was created to serve as an alternative currency. Government won’t want bitcoin to become the general currency world wide, what do you want them to do with fiat currency which they are in control of? they can easily manipulate fiat, they can easily print more money and send to circulation, and they can easily print more fiat currency and divert it to their own personal account. But when it comes to bitcoin it’s having a fixed total supply and the government can’t control it, so am sure the government will do everything possible to stop bitcoin from beginning a general currency and that was not even Satoshi’s plan.",

No matter the amount of adoption that Bitcoin will gain, I don't think it will ever be enough for it to gain such acceptance. There will always be one or two governments that are against it and, as such, won't want to accept it as their international payment option. So I guess it's a big no. This is just like asking if Bitcoin is going to replace a country's world currency, which I recently elaborated on in a recent thread.",

As for me my opinion is same as the other replies up. Bitcoin was create to be an alternative and can’t be general currency. Although it has all the features that would solve the problems faced by traditional currencies the issue of volatility is still a concern for some people to accept it as general currency most especially the Arabs that see this a gambling thing. The government also has shown in all aspect that they are against something that they can’t have authority on and the anonymity associated with bitcoin will certainly make it add for them to get their ways like the fiat currency. Also in the past there have never been a central or general currency, the only one that came close was the dollars and with the way USA is using it get more political power so will others want there currency to be.",

It's just the question of will governments allow it to be a dominant currency of their respective countries.I support this one where Bitcoin does have a chance but in my own opinion, the chance is low as of now because some countries banned the use of cryptocurrency but there's a country that legalized the use of Bitcoin. Op, if you think that the chance of Bitcoin becoming the general currency is high in the future but we don't know when that would be. Not because El Salvador supported the use of Bitcoin doesn't mean it will become the general currency because of what I just explained and if you did a research about the countries that banned from crypto and countries that doesn't ban crypto then you will know.  The only thing I can say is the same as the quote above.",

I think we need a new standard world currency and it must be neutral, not under the control of any government and Bitcoin fits perfectly into this role. I hope it happens.",

Bitcoin was already used as a payment for many countries and how much even more being used a store of value and being held as an investment by the majority. So going to legally speaking, it's highly volatile and if a government makes the use of it then there could be some precautionary measures on their end to be implemented.",

Not every country will want to utilize it and make it a global currency. Country leaders like to have influence over the currencies that are used in their countries. There's a chance it'll happen, but there's a much better chance it won't.",

The answer is rather (NO) because countries around the world will not allow a decentralized currency to become the dominant currency and if you want to base your argument on the evolution and transformation of money,  to say bitcoin will gain global adoption then it may lead to a lot of frustrations since most countries are already developing their own CBDC to compete with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just fine playing the role of an alternative currency,  and only a small percentage of people know about Bitcoin.",

One of the reasons is that Bitcoin's decentralized nature makes it difficult for any government to exert control over it, which can raise concerns for regulatory authorities.",

The inconstant nature of its price will discourage people from using it for buying and selling. If the price becomes less volatile in the future people might consider using it more. Another problem will be the technological barrier. Most people don't have access to the internet or Android phones in some developing countries. They might not have access to the Bitcoin network without these technological tools. Unfavorable government policy will also hamper the spread of the use of Bitcoin as a currency. More countries are getting friendlier with bitcoin but most developed nations are totally against the coin. Some have gone to the extent of banning it because it will limit thier economic control. A high rate of illiteracy and religious belief will impede Bitcoin acceptance and use. Most people will never stop using fiat because it is easier to use. Others might not use it because they feel their religion forbids it. I conclude by saying that Bitcoin and fiat will always exist together for now until the world gets matures for the use of Bitcoin.",

Banking systems with third parties have no privacy, and once your money is in the bank, you are no longer in control of it, and bankers will use our money to make high-interest loans while paying us no or little interest, which is terribly wrong. That is why Bitcoin was created to give us financial freedom because there are no third parties involved, and we can also profit if we hold them for a long period.As a result, we believe that Bitcoin will gain global recognition and be accepted globally for the benefit of our society.",
