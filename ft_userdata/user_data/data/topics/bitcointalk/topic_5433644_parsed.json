  "content": "Consider inflation, what it actually is when you get to the meat and bone of the matter. It's a system which ultimately punishes people for saving and rewards them for consuming things in the here and now. This isn't a conspiracy or a hot take, the establishment says this themselves constantly and explicitly that inflation \"stimulates the economy\" which means they are creating a reward structure for consumers and punishment for savers.This is a SYSTEMIC way of getting people to consume what they don't need. This should be the absolute number one concern of an environmentalist, yet you never hear a peep about inflation from environmentalists since they never really cared to begin with, it was all virtue signalling.",

      "body": "The other side is that inflation rewards the wise and enslaves the foolish.In the past, homes and land were a good example of this. If your house payments are $1,000 per month, and you are earning $2,000 a month income, half your income goes towards house payment.Your wages will go up with inflation, as will your house value. When your wages get to $4,000 a month, your house payments will only be one-fourth of your income. In addition, the value of your house will have doubled, because its real value goes up with inflation.So, the wise person is benefited because of inflation.",
