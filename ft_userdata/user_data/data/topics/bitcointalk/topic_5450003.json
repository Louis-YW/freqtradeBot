This series has been known to predict major global events. Considering their prediction being correct for all significant events happening globally. I felt I should share the below image. I know some of you would say it is just a FOMO created by someone. I have no comment regarding that! What do you think? Will the next Bitcoin happen in 2025? I feel it won't happen in 2025. If history repeats itself then it would be in 2026. It is a possibility that it can happens in 2024.",

Bitcoin is the number one coin in the cryptocurrency market and appreciate in value as long people keep demand Bitcoin and supply get less, which the scarcity of Bitcoin will skyrocket and seeing as Bull run. Therefore Bitcoin still in good position for entry point to buy, while waiting for right time to come.",

      "body": "Acting on predictions seems to me like following other people's decisions. That's why I don't like it much. It doesn't matter to me whether the next bull comes in 1 year or 2 years. The only thing I'm sure of is that bull season will come again. That's why I think it's best to invest. Taurus will come, of course, but it's important to be ready, too. Otherwise, we are always waiting for a new bull season.Many other useful things can be followed instead of predictions. If the steps to be taken are taken according to the developments, a more effective way can be followed. It can be more useful to follow many different factors such as news, desired developments and actual developments. Everyone is guessing, of course someone will keep it. Therefore, you should not worry too much about the forecasts.",

The next bull run is already in preparation and it will most probably start before halving. And, after halving the magnitude of the bull run will go way higher than our imagination. During this coming bull run the price of Bitcoin will definitely cross $100k mark.We should have already reached to the point of bull run before 2025. And in 2025 the bear run might start after first 6 months. That has always been happening, and history will repeat itself once again after that bull run. The market may crash and the lowest dip might be around ATH of previous bull run. That is just speculation, and things might be different after the next bull run.",

This shows that 2024 will be bitcoin halving,and this halving is what makes the price to move to the moon,because the number of bitcoin to be mined will reduce into halve. Making miners to be able to mine less numbers of bitcoin.This is where the concept of demand and supply plays its own role in bitcoin price. Check out from 2009 till date,after every halving bitcoin price with hit ATH the next year,higher than the previous ATH price. This is because the number of bitcoin keeps on reducing in supply. To summarize it all,bitcoin price will keep on pumping till bitcoin halving in 2024,after that we will enter the bull run,when bitcoin price will hit ATH in 2025. No one knows the exact time but the year is certain.",

And this is what makes bitcoin prices inseparable from fluctuations that occur very drastically.and I think an accurate prediction is to assess the development of bitcoin even if the price goes down because this will ensure that the price of bitcoin will rise in the long term. And this revolutionary technology has fueled an entire industry aimed at disrupting the traditional financial market system, and bitcoin is well on its way to being widely adopted and regularly used by the mainstream public. So for the long term the price of bitcoin will definitely go up and keep going up even though it will come back down, but in the end it will go up again.",

I'm not sure where you got 2026 from, that year to me already sounds like a bear market. A quick review of Bitcoin's history based on it's 4-year cycle2012-2013: Bull market2016-2017: Bull market (+4 years)2020-2021: Bull market (+4 years)So if the 4-year cycles are to continue, based on Bitcoin's halving that occurs every four years, the assumption would be a bull market between 2024-2025.Likewise if we look at the major 1 year long bear markets:2014: Bear market2018: Bear market (+4 years)2022: Bear market (+4 years)This is therefore either an enormous coincidence, or otherwise based on Bitcoin's inflationary policy that is reduced by 50% every year that effectively reduces selling pressure by 50%.Therefore it's highly likely that 2026 will be a bear market based on previous history. For sure this could change, but so far after a decade the cycles remain unchanged.",

I'm sure it was just made by someone on purpose so every event that happens is the same as the Simpson cartoon.regarding the bull market that will happen before the Halving in 2024, it will certainly be the peak of the Bullrun. If the last ATH touched $60k, then when the Halving will occur the ATH will probably be reached again and form a new ATH. Whether we are sure or not, we only need to look at the history that continues to occur every Halving is done. This Bullrun will be highly anticipated by all long-term crypto holders.",

The cycle of halving will always happen as BTC will always be bought by big investors from retail to institutional investors. If the bull run will not happen, it's possible that CBDC is really working and people may not be interested anymore in crypto. And it's not gonna be good for all. I will still wait though.",
