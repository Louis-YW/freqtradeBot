Is it caused by miners or that is how bitcoin technology was designed ?If bitcoin halves, the supply will reduce. It started with 50 BTC as the mining reward before the 2012 halving. Bitcoin halved in November 2012 and the reward earned by miner in each block mined was reduced to 25 BTC, half of previous reward.Another halving in 2016 and the reward halved to 12.5 BTCAnother halving in 2020 and the reward halved to 6.25 BTC Halving in 2024 and the reward will halve to 3.125 BTC The supply is reducing. In economics and in reality, the higher the demand and if the supply is reducing, the higher the price. Bitcoin demand is increasing during and after halving because many people are associating it to buying period when more new, retail and institutional investors will buy more bitcoin and the price will increase than reduce.",

This slowly spreads to the service providers of the miners, and their providers, and so on, until it reaches the exchanges and their users, up to which point the price acts perfectly normal and doesn't give any indication of a bull run.",

After all, every BTC that are mined are the new BTC that will be added to the total amount circulated in the market. Maybe that's what Charles-Tim meant about the decreasing supply of BTC. Well, BTC supply may decrease if more and more BTC are lost due to losing the wallet seed phrase just like what happened to other people losing the wallet and unable to recover the wallet.",

      "body": "QuoteWhat is the significant of bitcoin halvingRegardless of the other questions asked by the OP, I think that what he is most interested in is still contained in the title. What we know is that the halving happens every 210 000 blocks, which is approximately every 4 years, and that the reward for miners is halved by 50% at that moment. We also know from a short (but meaningful Bitcoin history) that the price of Bitcoin has increased significantly after each halving, and it is possible that this will happen even after the halving in 2024.That event therefore, in my opinion, has a certain psychological dimension, because investors expect a large profit, while on the other hand, miners have less and less influence on the market, considering that they \"produce\" less and less new BTC. The current calculation says that about 900 BTC is mined daily (on average 1 block every 10 minutes - 144 blocks x 6.25 = 900 BTC x 30 days = 27 000 per month), which is not an amount that can significantly influence the market, where there are already 19+ million BTC. In about ten years, halving will no longer be so important because 99% of all BTC will have already been mined, and the 1% will remain for the next 100+ years.",

Maybe I didn't explain it more clearly though I am right about the production of BTC is decreasing since the BTC reward from mining is decreasing every halving but the total amount of BTC in circulation have change. Maybe I should have explained it this way where the NEW COINS I said will be added to the current amount of BTC in circulation instead I should have explained that new batch of BTC will be added rather than new coins. It is not my intention to say that new mined BTC is different from the old ones though there's difference between the two which is the mined BTC is a reward for miners that haven't been circulation where the old ones have been in circulation already. My point is about the decrease of supply and not between the old and new mined BTC.",

Given this, it is wrong to say that such coins have been removed from the supply. They could all be moved at any time (and that includes all of Satoshi's coins).The current number of bitcoin which have been provably lost, burned, unclaimed, or are otherwise unspendable and can therefore be removed from supply numbers only (at present) 2,828.654 BTC.",
