I would see Bitcoin trading as like another field to be invested. I would compare it to how I studied programming back in the days and I was like sort of stuck in \"tutorial hell\". This goes for my experience when I traded here in crypto. Stuck in tutorial hell on how in the heck would I do my first trade in Binance. Turns out I just needed to experience it and do it myself and learn from there. Reading books and watching tutorials alone wouldn't help.In terms of commitment to it, it's a meh for me. I am not really looking for success in crypto anyway.",

You want to be quick to dive into another crypto-currency investment after just loosing out on one. And I am certain it's still with the same ideology.I don't think crypto-currency is as risky as we make it (don't get me wrong) yes crypto-currency is risky but we add to it by the way we expose ourselves to losing out, scammers and fraudsters, low initiative project.",

It will help you to think realistically and know how to plan for \"entry\" and \"exit\" properly. Crypto investment doesn't only requires patience, it also requires smartness and carefulness. You only risk your money if you invest blindly, ignore flexibility, and never learn the development of the coins + current crypto trends. Don't only be a patient investor, but to be a smart investor!!Quote from: Crypt0Gore on October 06, 2022, 03:27:28 PMLastly, treat coins as an investment not as your wife. It is too exaggerated if you treat a coin like you treat a wife.I don't think it is the right behavior of a true investor, but it is a dumb investor.",
