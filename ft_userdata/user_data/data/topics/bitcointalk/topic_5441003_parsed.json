  "content": "Simon Ekpa I have been inciting the people of Southeast Nigeria through his Twitter space, commanding his fractional ESN members to enforce the sit-at-home order issued by him. IPB has repeatedly distanced itself from him and his activities.Some months ago, many Nigerians signed a petition against him on Twitter following his comments about the insecurities going on in the south. He was also forcing Southeast residents to boycott the election by remaining at home on election day, threatening to enforce the order if anyone attempted to vote.He was arrested at his home today, February 23, by the criminal police department of Finland. His arrest is good news for our democracy, and with the upcoming election on February 25th, I urge all Nigerians, particularly those in south-eastern Nigeria, to vote for their preferred candidate. https://www.google.com/amp/s/punchng.com/breaking-finland-authorities-arrest-simon-ekpa/%3famp",

I wonder if some people do sit down and have a reflection of their actions and how it affects them. If they really do, I do not think they would give a listening ear to some people in any way. This guy sits at his convenience from Finland giving our ogbo brothers to sit at home on Monday, you can imagine and now again telling them to boycott the general election, how did our eastern brothers get there of being controlled by by some one who is not even within the seashores of the nation.",

IPB has repeatedly distanced itself from him and his activities.Dem dun released (Finnish police release Simon Ekpa, give reasons for arrest) and from wetin I understand, belike the arrest no get anything to do with the Nigeria election or his comments on them. Belike him get another case for him head wey the government been dey investigate and dem been need his presence because if na this election, why dem go release am when them know say him go be a nuisance to the election.I never believe say foreign law enforcement agency get our interest at anytime unless e go benefit them as well. Like even the presidency dem no get our genuine interest and all those their messages na bobo juice. If dem get their way self dem go allow us kill ourselves and jump in to rescue while stealing our natural resources in the process which is why na we need to behave ourselves for this election and conduct a free and fair one or na we go still lose. If truely dem care, why dem go release a man causing violence through his statement (enforcing an illegal law of sit at home) when people supposed come out come carryout their human right.",

No Igbo man is happy with this nonsense sit-at-home order, if you remember, when these sit-at-home nonsense start people no they obey am, but the people wey they sponsor Ekpa go recruit many boys, give them better guns, na those people come they enforce the lockdowns, they shoot people, so basically the only reason why people they stay indoors na because them they fear. If Nigerian government can guarantee security of lives and property, no cap na, people go fall out 2 seconds.Quote from: Broadanbig on February 24, 2023, 04:49:10 PMThis guy sits at his convenience from Finland giving our ogbo brothers to sit at home on Monday, you can imagine and now again telling them to boycott the general election, how did our eastern brothers get there of being controlled by by some one who is not even within the seashores of the nation. The matter they sad, but i don tell you the cause of all these problems, if people can feel secure them go fall out. As for elections today, there was massive turnout in the South East, no mind people like Ekpa, soon people like him would be forgotten, Nigeria would be great again.",

So from wetin me i understand, them been arrest am for interrogation, and thay gats release am afterwards. Another thing be say Finland no get jurisdiction on this matter, so the only thing wey them fit do na to extradite am back to Nigeria, but that one no be small process because Nigeria go gats prove to Finland say Ekpa's crimes don reach to extradite am back home.Quote from: Silver005 on February 27, 2023, 06:36:42 PMBut if he was released because he was found not guilty,The Finnish government no get jurisdiction to decide that, as the matter be now we just hope say them go fit extradite am come Naija, that is when a legal process would begin based on his offenses.",

Imagine say Ekpa dey Finland dey control boiz for naija and them dey carry out him instruction, shey I don suffer for this country. Sorry to say this but from my observation, I see say na Igbo man cause division and tribalism for Nigeria. The major problem for Nigeria from 1960 till now na dem cause am. Imagine say 1960 Nigeria become country and 1963 Republic, which Nnamdi Azikwe dey in charge. After six years this igbos come up with division instead of to think of unity and progress of the nation,this war come bring setback for the country for 3 years before peace come dey,what of all the lives and properties wey follow the war go.",
