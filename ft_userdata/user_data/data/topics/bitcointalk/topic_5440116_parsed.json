      "body": "Welcome to the forum mate. The site’s design is good and unique. I haven’t seen this type of game in the past few years. But I can see that, No Players is active on the site. The site seems to me as dead. Moreover you said 12 months passed since you have launched the casino, but till now, no user is active or regularly playing here? The Announcement thread here also looks boring. It seems like you don’t care about any traffic that you need from the forum. Nevertheless nothing I can say more. Just wishing you best of luck for your future.",

If I should try with metamask or trust wallet will it connect?Metamask is a wallet for Ethereum-based blockchains and it is not compatible with Solana blockchain so you can not use it.It is not good to use one wallet for everything, every site and store all your fund in that wallet. Have you ever thought that what will happen if that wallet is hacked?Do you want to lose all your fund by only one accident?If I only want to use Metamask, I will create different wallets to use on different sites.",

You only have three options to login and those are with different wallets that can be connected to biteclub. Looking at the website, you seem don't accept bitcoin yet. At the same time, if you've been operating for 12 months, you should have some easy FAQ page where everyone can understand the login, deposits/withdrawals and other stuff related to your games.",

You did not leave any margin at all, the most recognizable module here was the Coinflip. I suggest that you should place the bets panel and the game itself closer to one another. It's so wide to that it became harder and harder to see from a wider screen. One more thing, your leaderboard, why does it have no data at all?",

That is something that I really like, I imagine that poker is one of the games that has the greatest strength, I really want to try it, and what else do you plan to place? There are games that require a lot of concentration, chess is one, have you thought about it?",
