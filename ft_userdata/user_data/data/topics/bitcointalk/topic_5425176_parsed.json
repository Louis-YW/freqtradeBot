They are fighting on Makhachev weight but I still believe that Volk will manage to find a way to beat his opponent. I will not bet in this match because this is very close.",

      "body": "The title fight is higher weight level on the current dominant weight class of Volk. With that in consideration, Islam has the advantage here because he will fight on comfortable weight. Volk has a very good striking punch and kicks but he might be slow due to this weight adjustment  that will make this fight more on clinch that Islam has very good advantage.I would say that Volk can endure the clinches punishment but Islam can finish him with just an opening. This might be the match that he will experience his first defeat because Islam ain't the typical champ that doesn't have consistency on his skill set. Volk should prepare for worst case scenario.",

Takedowns would be difficult to defend if Volkanovski were a similar mass and weight to Makhachev. Being at a disadvantage increases the difficulty factor.Volkanovski is essentially doing the same thing Israel Adesanya did when he fought Jan Blachowicz at LHW. He's doing an easy fight where his belt is not on the line and he has nothing to lose. Yet he will still be paid PPV points as if his title were on the line. While Volkanovski has a good winning streak and good wrestling, Makhachev should dominate him.",

This shows that the guy can achieve a lot if he doesn't become to cocky or stressed. One could say that Volkanovski defeated better opponents but 3 of his top fights are against the same guy, Max Holloway, who is good, but had some mental breakdowns and wasn't in his top shape which got him kicked out of the UFC.",

Being at a disadvantage increases the difficulty factor.The difference in mass is only 5 KG so its not really that much to go on. Does that much weight really make a difference in any sports event? I would say no.The height on the other hand is quite a gap between them and I think that will be more of an influence on striking power, from a physics standpoint. So my money would be on Volkanovski. Although I do not know much about him and have not yet seen many of his fights yet. I do find it hilarious that the Australian has a more russian-sounding name than the russian boxxer.  Makhachev might have a couple of years more experience in boxxing but that does not seem to have put his career far above Volkanovskis. Still, Volkanovski has more to gain from this fight. I think that motivation alone will make him fight harder. Smart money's on the australian boxxer, Volkanovski.",

It's because when you're not a champion, you can fight with any fighter, but when you're already become a champion, you must take any fight from any fighters which want to fight with you because you need to prove if you're deserve to get the belt. This fight Makhachev need to risk his belt while Volkanovski doesn't, so it's will be the first task for Makhachev to defend his title.Volkanovski is top 1 men's P4P rank, Makhachev is taking more scariest challenge than Oliveira, you need to think twice for saying Makhachev isn't better than Oliveira.",

I would say no.While body weight discrepancy does not make a huge difference in boxing or kickboxing.It does matter more for wrestling and BJJ for reasons similar to 5 kg advantage being relavant in tug of war. Having greater mass can translate to a strength advantage as well as allow for greater conservation of energy. If Makhachev and Volkanovski both weigh in at 155 pounds. On fight night Makhachev could weigh 175 pounds while Volkanovski weighs 160. The amount of water weight they regain after weighing in can vary tremendously due to height differences in the size of their frames.On paper, I thought Makhachev was a bad match for Volkanovski. We can see if I was wrong. That is one thing that makes MMA a great sport.",

Islam is going to have to fight for it and Volk will give him a good run. There will be time for him to dominate in the division if Islam wins. He is the younger among them since in the coming years Poirier or Gaethje is on thier decline.",

There’s sill doubt about Makhachev because he doesn’t much face strong opponent except Oliveira on his career but his submission and wrestling are both impressive since he is guided by Khabib which is the best on this method on UFC. The only advantage of Volk on this match is striking and his experience because he fought many strong fighter on his career but he will definitely dominated by Makhachev on this fight since this will be a wrestling game. Islam will never let this fight a striking fest and he will surely attempt takedown as much as possible like he was always doing on his previous matches.",

I know he is used to being the smaller man but Makhachev is huge compared to him and has the ability to submit him easily if he can get the takedown. Volk will be not be throwing as many punches as he does normally because he will be worried about the takedown. He could lose in the striking because of this threat of submission. I still think Makhachev submits Volk in 2 rounds he will make volk tired and he will stop defending the takedowns and it will be game over.",

Most opponent of Makhachev is exactly doing what you said before that’s why they failed to beat Makhachev with striking power but Volk is different to other player which Makhachev defeat before because he is much confident on his striking power and can defend submission attempt properly. With this, he is always focus on his striking power which his main weapon to beat Makhachev.I’m sure Volk will have a hard time but I don’t see him lose via submission because he will surely counter Makhachev take down with his punch fire power.",
