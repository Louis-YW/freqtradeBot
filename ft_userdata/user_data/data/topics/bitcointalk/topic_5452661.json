The rest of the forum will still see the neutral. You are correct in saying the neutral doesn't mean much.@OP you might consider just letting it go and locking this thread. The feedback is neutral and means very little. At worst it will make a manager look more deeply at your profile when you apply for a sig campaign. If you are putting effort into your posts, you have nothing to worry about.",

He PREDICTED football scores and goalscorers incorrectly ONE DAY AFTER the games ended when results and goalscorers were already known.I don't know if this sounds funny or not but I had a chuckle after reading this. It seems that JG's concern was not that the OP predicted an already concluded match, what upset him the more was that the result was wrongly predicted This is one of the many things we see in the gambling discussion mega threads, just that most of them are buried faster than they can be discovered. Quote from: dbc23 on May 14, 2023, 07:16:42 AM he reversed his feedback from negative to neutral. How long will it take to remove the feedback completely.That is the best I have seen JG do. And before he reverses from red to neutral, there are compelling reasons and opinions of many. Quote from: dbc23 on May 14, 2023, 07:16:42 AMI need my reputation restored and the stigma of parading my profile as a shit poster discarded.Your reputation is not dented and this shouldn't call for being stigmatised. If a neutral tag is stigmatising you, what will ban do to you.I will advise you to find solution for yourself, someone had already suggested same. The trust system is decentralized. If you don't want to see the feedback, you can consider to distrust him and then give a counter feedback that looks like this Unble to forgive me after some years of pleading Then, you have to upgrade your posting quality and if possible avoid the gambling boards and a campaign manager can hire you.",

There are other members who received similar feedback from him and are now in some of the best paid signature campaigns which proves that if you are a good poster, that feedback won't prevent you getting into those (which is a reason why you want it removed I suspect).",

Follow carefully:You have returned to the forum after three years of absence. Your first post after waking up (I haven't looked at the archives) shows the date July 10, 2021, 6:30:15 PMOn the same day, you send 10 merits, 5 merits per post, to the account that had a connection with the account seller. Your time to read two posts, and decide to give 10 merits, did not take a minute. Do you think that you can believe in the randomness of these estimates?https://bpip.org/smerit.aspx?from=dbc23&to=MistafreezeThe account itself to which the merits were sent has already been banned.I also think that you are not the real owner of this account, but I will not leave any tags, but I can say that I do not believe you either.",

I chose to have a break and came back in 2021 July how does that mean I bought the accountIts tacky for Timelord to leave a link to his own question as the reference in your neutral feedback (in lieu of proof or even evidence), but it means even less than Jollygood's feedback. You leaving him a negative in response is not the right way to go about handling it.I can see you're upset but the thing is you probably did buy this account, or acquire it in some other way, because the person who owned it before you had a completely different style of writing, and they were writing because they enjoyed posting, not because they were merely slogging through the requirements of their sig campaign.So you're gonna tell us you posted this?Quote from: dbc23 on February 20, 2018, 05:05:50 PMIs it just me or has the quality of discussion and even grammatical coherence of posts gone down almost as logarithmyically as bitcoin went up last year?  I've been off the board for a little while and coming back it feels like it's completely different, I gleaned a MASSIVE amount of knowledge hear in the past years and now all I see is google translates of boiler plate statements.Granted those translations have always been here, just seems like that's ALL there is these days.Cmon bro, that's not you.What's worse is you appear to have a bunch of accounts on this forum, and one of them is even in DT2:The address of coco23 shows up first because you only wrote \"R\" for reserve, meaning he didn't copy the address from you. And that account only used it once whereas yours used it a bunch of times.I'm not tagging you but I am excluding you and coco23.",
