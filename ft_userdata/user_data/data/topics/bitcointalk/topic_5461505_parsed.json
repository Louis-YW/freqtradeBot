So you need to do a single-board test on the third board, find out where broken, and re-solder or replace new chip. The status pages chain 1 and 2 show that TEMP is abnormal, which may be due to an abnormality in the PIC chip or the control board.If you can paste the full log here, maybe someone else can find out what's wrong.",
