  "content": "SEC Charges Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang with Defrauding Investors in Crypto Asset Trading Platform FTXThe same Caroline Ellison  who was said to be the former girlfriend of SBF, who blew the whistle that the $10b of assets aren’t reflected there account has been charged by the SEC along with Gary Wang the former Chief Technology Officer of FTX Trading Ltd. (FTX), for their roles in a multiyear scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX, the crypto trading platform co-founded by Samuel Bankman-Fried and Wang. Investigations into other securities law violations and into other entities and persons relating to the alleged misconduct are ongoing.According to the SEC’s complaint, between 2019 and 2022, Ellison, at the direction of Bankman-Fried, furthered the scheme by manipulating the price of FTT, an FTX-issued exchange crypto security token, by purchasing large quantities on the open market to prop up its price. FTT served as collateral for undisclosed loans by FTX of its customers’ assets to Alameda, a crypto hedge fund owned by Wang and Bankman-Fried and run by Ellison. The complaint alleges that, by manipulating the price of FTT, Bankman-Fried and Ellison caused the valuation of Alameda’s FTT holdings to be inflated, which in turn caused the value of collateral on Alameda’s balance sheet to be overstated, and misled investors about FTX’s risk exposure.In addition, the complaint alleges that, from at least May 2019 until November 2022, Bankman-Fried raised billions of dollars from investors by falsely touting FTX as a safe crypto asset trading platform with sophisticated risk mitigation measures to protect customer assets and by telling investors that Alameda was just another customer with no special privileges; meanwhile, Bankman-Fried and Wang improperly diverted FTX customer assets to Alameda. The complaint alleges that Ellison and Wang knew or should have known that such statements were false and misleading. Edit:  Alameda Research ex-CEO Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang plead guilty to involvement in frauds causing FTX's collapse.",

No, it's not that I dont want him be punished for what he has done. I am just giving an account of the gravity of the atrocity he has done with the FTX user's fund and the possible tricks that all the parties involved will pull just like we watch in the movie where the innocent man suffers the most. An example is what you said about Wang.Following the Sam Bankman-Fried case. Court records show he purchased Robinhood shares with $546 million through Alameda Research and following the FTX's bankruptcy, the US government opens an inquiry into the $372 million cyberattack because the issue happened by surprise right after the FTX exchange filed for bankruptcy which is totally fishy.",

It's more strange to have other directly plea guilty but afaik it's normal if in return you get a deal for a softer sentencing.Regarding the allegations you mentioned, I wonder that, too. Remember reading something like this on a smaller news site but can't find it again. Probably just some FUD with political agenda that was stopped from spreading too much.Unless anyone has a good source?I am not in law and I don't know have a slight idea about what SBF ought to do but I believe he must have a valid reason for pleading not guilty while other plead guilty.About SBF activities with Ukraine, I think we need to be extra careful and always find the truth about things we read especially when the information can cause FUD in the market because the site you said may have taken down the news. From what I see there's a lot of FUD information spreading ever since the SBF issue happened.Quote from: cr1776 on January 08, 2023, 02:32:17 PMQuote from: suzanne5223 on January 05, 2023, 04:59:17 PMQuote from: cr1776 on January 04, 2023, 07:31:03 PMUsing FTX to launder political donations and things like billions in dollars to Ukraine, and then some coming back to those in power to buy more votes.  It is disgusting.Yes, it is. I heard rumors about the Samuel Bankman-Fried billions of dollars to Ukraine but I never hear from a trusted source. Is this rumor true? What do you think about SBF pleading not guilty to the fraudulent charges while Caroline and Gary Wang pleaded guilty to their roles in the FTX bankruptcy despite they are not the prime wrongdoer?I haven't seen details on it yet and whether it is true or not.  However given the stuff that was suppressed about Hunter Biden's laptop, Hillary Clinton's use of foreign nationals in 2016 to impact the election etc, it wouldn't surprise me if in a few years we find out it really was true.  The lies from Fauci at first that masks don't work, then they do and he admitted they lied etc. Either way when SBF is donating millions to buy votes and protection, whether it went through Ukraine or not doesn't matter too much.You see stuff like this you see them raising money for Ukraine, but not the other way:https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1501268476488417281[snip]  Seems suspicious, like they wanted to stop him from saying something.Yes, there are a lot of suspicious activities in the SBF case and that includes how he was arrested because was arrested 3 days after he was seen leaving the white house, they likely had a meeting about it before he was charged with fraud.Sooner or later the truth will be known.",
