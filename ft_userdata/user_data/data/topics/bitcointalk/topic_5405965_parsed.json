  "content": "We can speculate about reasons for the booming popularity of cryptopayments nowadays, but let's just admit for a second, that they ARE quite popular among businesses. Today I want to walk through the question: if I want to connect cryptopayments to, let’s say, my business website (e-commerce or digital entertainment service), and I don't want to dig a lot into technical details, I want just turnkey solution to instantly start accepting crypto: what cryptocurrencies payment gate/aggregator should I choose?What should you pay attention to? Before owners decide to use cryptocurrencies, they need to find as much information as possible. For this idea to work, they need to use multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously. As with fiat assets, the more payment systems one uses, the better. Suppose the casino intends to accept multiple currencies and wants the flexibility to receive final settlements in their home currency (which also resolves many of the tax implications associated with cryptocurrencies). In this case, there is no better way than using a payment processor that can handle even the most minor tasks when collecting crypto payments.So criteria would be like:Amount of cryptocurrencies Settling and auto-converting into fiat money for business purposesAdditional Commissions charged by Gate/AggregatorUX/UI and multi-language interfacesKYC services integrations/providingTime to settle/clearanceTOP payment gateways in the crypto industry Right now there are at least 103 gateways. Charts and TOPs can be constructed in different ways, due to the priorities of those criteria. If businessmen, first of all, want to have a gateway that accepts the most significant number of currencies:Aggregator nameLinkNumber of cryptocurrencies declaredFsfPayhttps://fsfpay.com/414CoinPaymentshttps://coinpayments.net/175Bestratehttps://bestrate.org/120Rocketfuelhttps://rocketfuelblockchain.com/120NowPaymentshttps://nowpayments.io/100As you can see, FafPay accepts the most significant number of currencies. It is a trendy gateway that is a big hit worldwide. But do not blindly trust this; it also has several disadvantages. If commissions are in business priorities there is gonna be another TOP chart:NameLinkPaymentcommissionmin,%Free-kassahttps://free-kassa.ru/0,00%ZondaPayhttps://zondaglobal.com/0,00%Bancchttps://bancc.finance/0,00%Coinqvesthttps://coinqvest.com/0,00%B2BinPayhttps://b2binpay.com/0,05%Paymiumhttps://paymium.com/0,10%FsfPayhttps://fsfpay.com/0,20%Swapinhttps://swapin.com/0,20%Coinremitterhttps://coinremitter.com/0,23%CoinPaymentshttps://coinpayments.net/0,50%NowPaymentshttps://nowpayments.io/0,50%Crypto.comhttps://crypto.com/0,50%Cyclebithttps://cyclebit.io/0,50%CoinsBankhttps://coinsbank.com/0,50%AlteWayhttps://alteway.com/0,50%Cryptoprocessinghttps://cryptoprocessing.com/0,80%Confirmohttps://confirmo.net/0,80%TripleAhttps://triple-a.io/0,80%Cryptonatorhttps://cryptonator.com/0,90%Alfacoinshttps://alfacoins.com/0,99%Coingatehttps://coingate.com/1,00%Bitpayhttps://bitpay.com/1,00%OnChainPayhttps://onchainpay.tilda.ws/1,00%AliKassahttps://alikassa.com/1,00%Blockonomicshttps://blockonomics.co/1,00%But if you wanto combine low commissions and the number of cryptocurrencies - charting becomes tricky, to cut long story short let's just stretch a few of them which can be considered as top:NameLinkPaymentcommissionmin,%NumberofCryptocurrenciesFsfPayhttps://fsfpay.com/0,20%414CoinPaymentshttps://coinpayments.net/0,50%175NowPaymentshttps://nowpayments.io/0,50%100Crypto.comhttps://crypto.com/0,50%30Cyclebithttps://cyclebit.io/0,50%20Cryptoprocessinghttps://cryptoprocessing.com/0,80%30Confirmohttps://confirmo.net/0,80%2TripleAhttps://triple-a.io/0,80%3Cryptonatorhttps://cryptonator.com/0,90%11Alfacoinshttps://alfacoins.com/0,99%17It still might be not enough to find the most suitable gate, because you might be interested not only in minimal commissions but average or even maximum commissions. some specific currencies (like Stellar, Dai, or NEM) fixed charge per transactionConverting and settling to fiat moneySo if we mix all those criteria into a sort of Product Value Score, TOP can be completely different. PV score - an indicator of the attractiveness of the product. Calculated based on comparing the commission conditions and the number of payment methods. It created its ranking of payment gateways with the best conditions for PV Score:CoinPayments - 9 PV ScoreFsfPay - 9 points by PV ScoreNowPayments - 8 PV ScoreFree-kassa - 7 points according to PV ScoreThis list can be considered “the most reliable crypto gateways, the most favorable terms of cooperation, a large number of cryptocurrencies, and a relatively low cost of services”. Example of calculation of PV score in the google-sheets table.After all, there are even more criteria to work through, for example, if the chosen gateway/aggregator will work with a company registered in a specific country, or work with a specific bank. And a huge amount of questions related to KYC and AML operations. By this survey, I just wanted to conclude, that there is no easy answer to the question “What gate is the best?”, but there are some criteria and priorities which can help to find an answer to the question “Which gate is the most suitable for this particular case?”What do you think about the criteria of choice such as gates and their importance?",

      "body": "I think the table is misleading, for example, only the min value is taken as the commission, this is a very broad concept, the min can be 0.5 but the max can be 55. Also, the number of coins doesn't mean much because there are only 10 coins in the market that have a volume and are used for shopping.Let me add one more:​Payid19 | https://payid19.com | %0.5 | 7 |",

Personally I don't think offering hundreds of tokens supported is an advantage. I don't know anyone using anything other than BTC to pay for things. Maybe ETH.",

If you have customers living in those restricted countries, I'm sure they will lock your account. I also would like to clarify about fsfpay, but you mentioned above that is fafpay? I tried to access the website fsfpay, but I notice the year at the bottom of this website it said it's 2007-2022 but the domain is November 2020 not 2007.I never heard fsfpay and I don't know how did you get them unless you just created this thread to promote those suspicious payment gateway?",

      "body": "Your list is a bit strange. I think it's not good idea to rate services blindly based on how many currencies they support or how big or small their comission is. Do you really need that service would support 414 currencies. Because besides Bitcoin, maybe 15-20 currencies is used for payments and I imagine that volume of it is such small compared with Bitcoin. For sevices it's just waste of resources to support so many currencies.And commission, does 0.20%, 0.50% or 1% really makes big difference? For example, I doubt that I would use BitPay, even if they would pay for me to use them.From all these services which aren't very well known here and you listed, I used Free-kassa many times to pay for IPTV with BTC. Can't say any bad word about them.",

      "body": "Apart from the factors you mentioned, I think it’s also very crucial to check the settlement process. Not all merchants want to hold cryptocurrencies, especially the volatile ones. So when I chose Capital Wallet as my payment gateway I also checked these - what settlement currencies are available, if payments are auto-converted into the desired crypto or fiat, the conversion rate, the time it takes to get funds in your bank account etc. Gave me the much-needed clarity in decision making.",
