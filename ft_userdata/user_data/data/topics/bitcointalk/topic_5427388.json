  "content": "I have read moderately on POW and read about the huge amount of energy required to earn each BTC.  There are other ways to distribute new coins and I find it a bit concerning as to how few are suggested.  The time of 120 years to mine the remaining 2.4 million Bitcoins is a bit absurd. Here is just one possible method.Let’s say 10 years for the remainder. At 144 blocks per day that is 6,307,200 blocks in 10 years.  Divide 2.4 million BTC by that many blocks to get about 0.38 BTC per block.Create and maintain a list of all the bitcoin nodes that have been active for some period of time, maybe a year or some other time period.  Node owners must have a certain amount of time invested before becoming eligible for payments.   As each block is completed, select one node, maybe at random, and the owner of the node gets 0.38 BTC.  Take that node off the list to received block rewards for some period of time to allow for sharing the wealth.After the last BTC has been distributed, profits are derived from the work needed to certify each block.  Each of the, for example, first 32 nodes that are involved in the original certification of a block gets some percentage of the fees for that block.  Maybe provide a sliding scale based upon the time the node has been active.  Those on online for longer periods get a bit more.  When a node receives a transaction fee, maybe take it off the distribution list for some period of time, share the wealth.This is just a suggestion and can certainly be refined for fairness.  Any thoughts?",

It is actually very easy to fake being a full node without actually running one. If you provide the incentive, the network could be flooded with them.Quote from: bkelly13 on December 09, 2022, 04:39:56 AMAs each block is completed, select one node, maybe at random, and the owner of the node gets 0.38 BTC.  Take that node off the list to received block rewards for some period of time to allow for sharing the wealth.This sounds like changing (increasing?) the total supply which is not something that the community would accept.The same problem with decentralization exists here too. In PoW we have an easy way for anybody to verify the work done on that block. Here when you say \"random\" there is no reproducible way to verify its fairness anymore.",

In other words, block mining abuse will be rampant with such a model.Yes, it is almost POS.  But no, its not a matter of doing no work.  The node must be up and online for some minimum period of time.  Block mining will be gone so there is no abuse of it.  Remember, I suggested that the nodes be monitored as being on line for some period of time before making the eligible for new BTCs.ETFbitcoin:  I don’t know how to respond to this post.LoyceV: The problem I am concerned with is the energy being spent to mine coins. Other than earning some coins, it provides no advantage.  From my readings there are thousands of mining rigs running 24/7 and only one of them gets a coin reward for each block.  That means that the energy spent mining is wasted for all but one mining rig.  Again, the energy consumed by mining is quite significant.Mocacinno:  Your proposal would make mining completely unprofitable, …Yes, it would do that. It would make mining obsolete.  It would stop the consumption of all that energy.… completely wipe out the security of the chain.  I don’t see why.  There is a consensus algorithm for verifying blocks.  Use the same “concept” for determining the rewards for being a node. Look to the future.  Eventually all the coins will be mined.  There will be no further mining.  Nodes will be profitably only for transaction fees.  My basic suggestion is simple:  Move that concept closer in the future and stop spending huge amounts of energy on mining.And yes, I am sure my concept has some holes and weaknesses.  However, the problems have already been solved in the current system.  Use the same concepts for distributing the new coins until the list of new coins have been exhausted.Climate change is real. It is here right now.  It is causing disasters, right now. It is caused by humans.  Put it into the equation.",
