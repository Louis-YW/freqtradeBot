One of the disadvantages of this is that once there is loss, it would be more because the profit is included. I see this as a way to greediness and a way to lose.If you want to trade, you have to gain and set aside your profit, or you can set aside some of your profit which you will not be using for trading.",

What are the other alternatives you know?The advice of compounding that $10 into $100 is not a good one because there are hardly that level of traders who can accomplish 10x with trading. In the world of crypto trading there are wins and losses, and in most cases people lose their initial capital in search of winning. Although, it is possible to 2x or more your capital in crypto but that depends on the condition of the market.It is even more harder to 2x your capital with Bitcoin trading as there are very few instances where you can earn 5% or more by trading it. The case is different with altcoins as there are some good coins that might get 20% or more of a pump after the market dips. But still there isn't any guarantee that the pump could occur in a week, a month, or even in many months.If you don't want to have a loan to start crypto trading then sell your old stuff that is of no use to you. And, with that money you can start trading without any worries. Loans aren't given for free you'll have to return it plus the interest. So it's not suitable for everyone to get a loan for the purpose of trading. You can also do a part time job and earn a little extra, then invest those in trading.",

It requires patience, just as trading does.This means to me that a new trader should always be patient and not be in a hurry to trade with big amounts. New traders should not borrow a huge amount of money to finance their trading because it can easily be lost. As a new trader, you should start small if you do not have enough money to start big. Even though it is not advisable to borrow funds to finance your trading, it is worse for a new trader to do so than an old trader. If you must borrow to trade, it has to be at a stage where you are very sure of your trading, that is of course after gathering experience. If you are a trader with no experience, avoid borrowing money to trade with.",

Otherwise, sentiments and emotion will be the first obstacles you will face. I don't care if they can make that money back in a short or long period of time to pay back the loan. The fact that it's borrowed money will create problems which could lead to your downfall. And if you are able to make that money back, then why do you need to borrow in the first place? If you can save money, then invest when it's available in your hands. 1-2 months time gap will not create any difference when you think about trading. If you are skilled enough, you can make profits in any market conditions.Also, the $10 investment idea is not a bad one. We are always told to start low and climb the ladder while increasing our budget. If you are not confident enough with $10, how can you be so sure that you will be successful with $100/200? So follow pro people's advice, create a plan, learn from the best and then execute that plan to get success.",

This way, you are using your own money without incurring debt. Another option could be a DCA, if you heard this and understand, this is the best option because this strategy involves regularly investing a fixed amount of money like $10 at regular intervals, regardless of the asset's price. By consistently buying cryptocurrencies over time, you can average out the purchase price and potentially benefit from market fluctuations.",

Just dont make yourself in a hurry because this is where mistakes and errors do happen.If you do find that $10 is just too small to start with then you do always have the right on taking a loan, just really be that so sure that you could really be able to repay it on time.",

Another possible alternative is that people will choose to trade themselves instead of lending someone else to do it.By doing it yourself, satisfaction will be obtained by the owner of the money even though it does not guarantee 100% that he will always be in a profitable position.",
