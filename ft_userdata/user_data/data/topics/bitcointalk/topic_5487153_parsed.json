  "content": "Trying to grasp the technology behind the bitcoin blockchain and why so many things happen the way they do has become quite a confusion to me, I read about bitcoin blockchain and I saw that nodes help to validate transaction and all of them or most of them must agree something like voting that is been done before they store or validate a transaction, and I am a bit confused about this or how it works, in fact instead of going into much detail on what I know, I wish someone would help me out by answering my questions that help enlighten me, I've also come across a recent topic about nodes but it doesn't quite ease my curiosity.I don't have the best english please mind me üôè1. What is a node and what is its function2. Is the node a protective counter measure to protect the blockchain from scammers 3.if the nodes act as a validator does this protection still extends to exchanges and why are they being hacked, cause I know that bitcoin is actually stored on a location in the blockchain and if it's anti bodies are nodes, how do some exchanges still get hacked ?Please is me been confused, don't mind me for asking this kind of question, you can provide me with a link for me to read about it if you have one, I'll really appreciate.",

What is a node and what is its functionA node functions by connecting to others to relay and validate various data (transaction data, block data) to others. They validate blocks and transactions in its entirety. By running a node, you can relay these data and validate them for yourself. Quote from: teamsherry on March 01, 2024, 06:47:10 AM2. Is the node a protective counter measure to protect the blockchain from scammers No. A node doesn't serve those sorts of functions.Quote from: teamsherry on March 01, 2024, 06:47:10 AM3.if the nodes act as a validator does this protection still extends to exchanges and why are they being hacked, cause I know that bitcoin is actually stored on a location in the blockchain and if it's anti bodies are nodes, how do some exchanges still get hacked ?No. Exchanges are completely different and they can handle Bitcoin through their service but it is completely different from the protocol. It appears that you have fundamental misunderstanding about how Bitcoin works. You should search for resources online and understand them before asking any questions, or else none of the discussions would be productive.

      "body": "1. Nodes are computers that are running the bitcoin program, and the are connected together to generate a network. Nodes are always sharing information to each others of new transactions, and confirmed transactions , and they also keep the copy of every transaction made in the blockchain. To run a node, all you need is the internet, and you download the bitcoin client, which is a software on your OS. 2. With the nodes connected together to get a network, it makes it very hard for any attack on the blockchain, because any transaction that is invalid, the nodes will rejects it.Read more... https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/nodes",

Is the node a protective counter measure to protect the blockchain from scammers My question first is. Do you want to run a node? Because from the look of your post. You have little idea about how the node works. Nevertheless, to answer your question,Bitcoin node is a computer that participates in the Bitcoin network by maintaining a copy of the entire blockchain which is a distributed ledger containing all Bitcoin transactions.The nodes validate transactions, relay them to other nodes, and help enforce the consensus rules of the Bitcoin protocol. You can run different kind of node mate depends on your choice. If you wish to download all Blockchain data, you should run a full node. But if you want to download some parts of the Blockchain data, then you have the lightweight nodes, which only store a portion of it and rely on full nodes for transaction validation. I will want you to check out this link to understand more about the nodes and how they work What is a Bitcoin node?

You missed the point of what Full Noders are protecting, they are not protecting the Bitcoin Network against Scammers but against rule breakers, which go against the consensus of Bitcoin Network.Exchanges are not in the Bitcoin network but its just an online platform for storing your bitcoin and so this is not the business of Noders.",

Is the node a protective counter measure to protect the blockchain from scammers The answer depends what kind of scam you are talking about. Any transaction that is included in the bitcoin blockchain must follow consensus rules. Nodes check whether transactions follow those rules or not. For example, one of consensus rules is that the total value of inputs must be equal or greater than the total value of outputs. So, if a scammer wants to make a transaction in which he spends more than he owns, his transaction would be rejected by nodes.",
