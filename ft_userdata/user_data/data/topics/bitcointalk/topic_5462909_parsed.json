  "content": "Hey! I 've been trying to find an answer to a simple concept, but I can't.My question is: I create a wallet on a hardware device. I obtain its XPUB. I import the XPUB to some software like Nunchuk, Sparrow etc. Does it make a difference (an actual difference) if the software is connected to my own Electrum Server or a public Electrum Server? And why.",

With VPN, you will connect to the VPN central server. Some VPN providers say they do not keep logs but some past events make us to think otherwise. Some people may use free VPN, but which is risky.Tor is not connecting to central server, but instead making use of three nodes before connecting to the destination which is far better and decentralized. On mobile, Orbot is the alternative.Also if using VPN, the green icon that supposed to turn blue on Electrum will not turn blue but remain green like normal IP address connection, and VPN canb fail and automatically be disconnected. Although it has been a long time ago that I experienced this on the paid VPN that I am using. If Tor/Orbot failed, Electrum is disconnected which I think is the best.On the devices, it is possible to set that if VPN failed, IP address connection should not work, but this will affect all connection on the mobile device.Because of these, I will recommend Orbot.",

Even if only one of them has transactions, Electrum doesn't know that until it asks. Even if you don't do anything except open your wallet and close it again, Electrum still has to ask for the history of all the addresses in that wallet. As soon as you connect to a malicious third party server, then the owner of that server can immediately link all your addresses together. The only way around this is to run your own node and your own Electrum server (this is easier than it sounds).If you connect to a different Electrum server from a different Tor relay/VPN server/IP address for each wallet you open, then an attacker won't be able to link your wallets to each other (provided you never make a mistake, which is unlikely), but they can still link together addresses within the same wallet.",
