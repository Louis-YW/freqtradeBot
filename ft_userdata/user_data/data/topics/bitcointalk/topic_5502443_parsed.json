They are not prepared for chaos in the market and face with margin calls, forced liquidations that make them sad and panic.QuoteAdditionally, Germany have also sold a huge chunk of their seized bitcoin in an operation against a piracy site last active almost over a decade ago.

Selling bitcoins to stabilize a national economy of Germany, one of biggest national economies, is unrealistic.",

The increased supply of bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market inevitably leads to a fall in value. This is a classic law of economics, the swing of supply and demand. Former users of Mt.Gox can't be called distraught investors, because their money was frozen for many years and their desire to sell bitcoin is now completely justified. Plus, not all of them will sell all of their bitcoin. Having seen the results of a long hold, some users will certainly leave some part of bitcoin for storage.",

I previously wrote about how deep the liquidity is already so even 1000 BTC dropped in a single order won't affect the market, trust me.In fact, any sales should already be predone. All the BTC is ready, they are sending it out already, most likely even offchain if all agreed parties have custodials (which they surely do).Doubt these people waiting and getting repayments are dumping all at once.Why would 'investors' fear?

Frantic investors have all sold their bitcoin in fear but if you know better, you know this is the right time to buy and accumulate as much bitcoin as you can.This panic does not only originate from Mt. Gox, the German and US governments and several miners are also doing the same thing because the decreasing income from the halving requires them to sell some bitcoin to cover the increasingly expensive development costs. The large selling power in the market does attract the attention of panic sellers, but on the other hand, those of us who have cold funds will be grateful because we can buy in an ideal area. Maybe there will still be a decline during Mt. Gox distributes Bitcoin to its customers who have been waiting for their assets for a long time. The distribution duration takes up to months, peaking at the end of this year we can see the resilience of Bitcoin's value in a fairly deep area.",

The thing the news about the Germans buying back is really not that accurate as some news outlets debunked that, what was really happening was that they transferred a large chunk of amount (around $1B) to various exchanges like coin base, Kraken, Bitstamp and after some time selling off they returned some coins back to their wallets again. This has been on repeat for days now and reasons why I feel they are not buying but rather selling some off and returning the rest is the number of coins they take out is usually more than they return. Although it is not wrong since it is a seized asset they need to sell but they just sell OTC which many predicts will be more profitable to them than this back and forth on exchanges. But as you pointed out this Shouldn’t be causing a real problem regarding the volume of sale but the problem is that the media are actually using this to create a FUD among investors and as such it is not only them that is selling. I check the fear and greed factor the other day and it declined to around 27% which is a yearly low. As someone looking to stach more my opinion is buy the fear",

Before Bitcoin spot ETF was not approved whereas now it is approved and the inflow from these ETFs are holding the price of Bitcoin. Being said that a large chunk of Bitcoin is now going to institutional investors and big whales. The situation does not look problematic now but eventually these guys will decide the future price of Bitcoin. You are right the market is overreacting and most of them are retail investors as they were always lose hands. Not much to say but the way things are now more panic selling will be witnessed by us like it used to be before. Inam expecting Bitcoin to go below $50K once again and then it will again come back after a few months to where it was earlier.",

I mean we will taken the advantages form this dip. Because these kind of activities are common in bull runs, Those who have seen previous bear markets and bull markets they will be well aware that a similar decline in price is a normal routine. it is an opportunity for buying instead of panic.  Therefore, I also believe that it is the time for buying at cheap price because if Bitcoin make a U-turn there is a high possibility that the price of Bitcoin will gradually start surging and possibly the price to move straight forward towards 85k or 100k  So, fill your wallet as soon as possible, i.e., buy and just wait until the new ATH of the price.",

You've said it already. Mt Gox repaying those who lost their money a decade ago and Germany selling the Bitcoins they seized caused uncertainty and fear towards the investors hence, it created panic to them that's why they're panic selling thus, helping in putting the price of Bitcoin going down.Fear really is a big problem with these investors because they always think that if there's an institution/government or whatever it is that's selling huge chunks of Bitcoin, they believe that it will push the price of Bitcoin that hard. These 2 events caused fear towards the investors that's why we are seeing the price of Bitcoin going down (even though we saw a bit of a recovery already). Anyway, if you're a smart investor, you will see that this kind of events are a perfect opportunity for us to buy Bitcoin at a lower price. I believe that we are all smart investors here that's why we took the opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoins, isn't it?As for what's happening, I don't care TBH.
