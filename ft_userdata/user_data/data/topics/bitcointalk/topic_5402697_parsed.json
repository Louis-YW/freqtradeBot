I'm afraid no one may take you serious. Your use of your instead of you're in your original post is unforgivable for a writer. Dropping one badly written line as your sales pitch is nothing but lazy and unbecoming of someone who clams to be a professional copywriter.Don't see this as an attack. Rather you should take it as a fair criticism to help you improve in your subsequent presentations. I'm a writer. I write for a living and therefore, would never present my pitch in such a mediocre manner.",

Talking about ego, you're judged by what you put out there. No one knows your personal struggles likewise you don't know that of other but I believe you can improve greatly by listening and applying people's suggestions in your life.Yes, $10 is a fair price for a mediocre article but why not try and offer it for free just to build your skills and self esteem? As you continue to improve, you may begin to charge the $10, $20 or thereabouts. I think people here are more interested in your wellbeing than attacking you.",

      "body": "Gonna be honest.... No other online site that I use has this many issues... As far as going out of my way to work for others for free so they can 'judge' me... I'm not up for that. I have enough issues as is. Doing everything I can just to figure out a way to keep a roof over my head while lacking transportation or the ability to work a normal normal 9 to five. I deal with shallow judgements from strangers CONSTANTLY and I don't offer the same judgement I get used and ignored on the daily by people around me, I'm not about to waste my time working for free on here while letting those around me sit here and be judgemental towards me too. You either want the service or you don't. You think I'm trying to scam you? Well I write about the content your wanting and I send it to you for review before you pay anyway and I only accept payment once the buyer is satisfied and that means that you don't send a cent until after I'm done. From a logical standpoint you aren't at any risk of being scammed I write things in my own words I don't just go around copying and pasting others shit. So like I said you either want the service or you don't. Getting on here and acting like there's an issue with my post of like I'm putting someone at risk of being scammed is bs. Your not better then anyone else, hate to break it to you but no one is, every last one of us is born equally human so any exclusive feeling you have is just a fantasy and you need to wake the fuck up.

Like actually read what I wrote, if I write it and the person paying me to write it isn't satisfied after reviewing it then they never have to send payment, this eliminates the entire point your trying to make.
