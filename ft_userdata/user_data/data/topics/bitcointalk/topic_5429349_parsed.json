  "content": "Alik BakhshiRussians as a state-forming people              To emphasize the special leading role of the Russian people, the Kremlin ideologists declared it to be a state-forming people, introducing this definition into the Constitution, so that all other peoples would know their place in the Russian Empire. From now on, the Russian language, as the language of the state-forming people, is the only state language in Russia, and if in the Soviet Union there was no requirement for compulsory knowledge of the Russian language, now all other languages ​​of the peoples of the multinational state have lost their state status. It should be noted that the state-forming people have a very indirect relation to the formation of the state, because the Russian state was formed by the Varangians Ruriks, then they were replaced by the dynasty of German kings who converted to Orthodoxy. By the way, Catherine the Great, under whom Russia grew in territories the most, could not connect two words in Russian. Russia reached its greatest power under the Georgian Stalin, who not only returned almost all the lost lands as a result of the First World War, but also acquired new ones (Tuva, Prussia, South Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands). The USSR, as a state created by Stalin, existed after his death for another half a century, until the Russians who came to power destroyed it. Today, Putin seems to finally end Russia as an empire, returning the Russian people to the borders of Muscovy as a primordially Russian state. (1)    From a historical point of view, it is fundamentally wrong to call the Russian people a state-forming people. The Russian people had the opportunity to govern the state. The collapse of the communist regime put the Russian people in front of a dilemma of choice between freedom and dictatorship, and the people decided not to tempt fate and traditionally chose the latter, in accordance with their mentality. (2) For the people, in whose mentality there is servility to the authorities and the inability to rational political and economic activity, which has been observed throughout history from the moment the Russian state organized by the Ruriks to the present day, democracy is nonsense. The inability of Russians to rational work is known as a definition rooted in Russian classical literature - Oblomovism. There can be no Democracy in a state without at least some more or less active participation of the people in politics, and, most importantly, no democratic state is viable without the initiative economic activity of its population. with the tacit consent of the people, all responsibility is assigned. In the very name of the people \"Russian\" there is a definition as an adjective. To the question - whose slave are you? The answer was Russian. That is, a serf (slave) of the Russian prince Rurik. The genus of Ruriks (Rurik translated from Scandinavian is a falcon) from the Rusa tribe. Hence the name - Rus.     The Vikings of Rurik created a country whose population is Russian, that is, slaves. How can one not recall Lermontov's poem, which accurately defined Russia as a country of slaves and masters, a country in which subservience to any official has survived to this day:    Farewell, unwashed Russia,    Country of slaves, country of masters,    And you, blue uniforms,    And you, their devoted people.     The “Russian world”, which Putin is trying to establish with the help of weapons in other countries, is a world of slaves and masters. (4)          It is no secret that the Russian people support Putin's political vector for the restoration of the Russian Empire within the borders of the USSR. The war in Chechnya, Georgia and Ukraine with the seizure of territories in favor of Russia, as well as numerous speeches by Putin and members of the State Duma with threatening territorial claims to Kazakhstan, Moldova, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania do not cause resistance among the state-forming people. However, there is a very interesting moment in the attitude of the Russian people to the war in Ukraine. The fact is that from the beginning of the hostilities, the Russian army mainly consisted of Buryats, Dagestanis, Chechens, but due to failures at the front and heavy losses in manpower, Putin decided to take a forced step, namely, he announced mobilization. It was then that the state-forming people made their feet, showing a real attitude towards their status. Of the thousands of unfortunate patriots hastily leaving the borders of Russia, there are neither Buryats, nor Chechens, nor Dagestanis - entirely mental warriors of the Crimea.   1.

This attitude of Russia towards its neighbors leads to the global isolation of Russia, which will end in the complete decline of its economy and, as a result, the collapse of the empire.So, you haven't seen the gas pipeline Russia to China? It's almost done. And it will expand to Mongolia and other countries. Except that the West might bomb it out of existence like they did the Nord Stream pipelines.Sure, almost every nation can find some raw material that they can use to support themselves. But that isn't the point. The point is development. In the case of the pipeline to China, it is simply easier for China to use Russian 'pipeline' engineering than develop their own. In addition, BRICS is enhanced by it.In fact, it was the ingenuity of the Russian engineers in copying and inventing all kinds of things, and then developing world trade with these things... it was this that scared the West so badly that they made war on Russia through Ukraine. That (the US) sounds way more totalitarian than the simple Russian engineering and trade developments they are offering the world.",

But the main force behind the collapse of the empire is precisely this circumstance. The issue of belonging to the indigenous people of Crimea, which has been subjected to genocide for 200 years, has never been discussed at Dozhd. \"Rain\" for the preservation of Russia as a state, but a democratic state, where the rest of the peoples will remain to the role of colonial. On \"Rain\" they would not mind if the peoples of the Baltic states remained in the empire. The main thing is to remove Putin and take power, leaving the Russians as a people without initiative, easy to manage, as it was under Lenin. As for the Crimean Tatars, it doesn't matter to Dozhd.",
