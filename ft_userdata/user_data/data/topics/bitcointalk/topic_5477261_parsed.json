Even an experience trader will at some points have bad trades. What matters the most is their risk management strategy. The balance between the risk reward ratio and the win rate should also never be ignored. A trader can have a very high risk reward ratio yet the win rate is shitty, or could have a very good win rate, yet the risk reward ratio is not good enough. In this case, he will just be giving the exchange lots of trading fees while the equity in the account just keeps going down.",

Instead they want to hear that trading is for everyone that trading is easy and everyone can make $10,000 a month trading simply by following a line on a chart. If you lose on 70% of your trade even as a skilled trader then you are not qualified to be called a skilled trader. Your losses should be reasonable as there are losses that comes as a result of the fault of the trader and there are those that are as a result of the market.A beginner reading this your approach towards trading should be one mixed with a little bit very cynicism and a little bit angry at the world because the rest of the world is there to take your money.

Losses and wins get activated in the system on a daily basis, and they apply to all categories. Skilled traders generate tremendous losses in the system, but they always fight to recover with significant profits. There constitute significant ambitions to achieve in each season, and there are several opportunities to capitalize on with the goal to become one of the main indicators.

Somehow i do agree with that when it comes on using up that 1:3 kind of ration then 60% winning chance will be common sense that you are really that indeed doing well or something that do really make our profits. If you dont find yourself to be that profitable in the first place then you would eventually notice that basing up on the capital that you do have. It would be that too impossible that you wont really be able to see whether you are making up some progress or not.Skills and knowledge would really be that depending on someones capacity or capability since not everyone would really be having on the same level when it comes to this matter.Results would really vary or would really be that depending on how well you do make out trades. It is really indeed a competition in between buyers and sellers on which if you do find out yourself to be having those skills and a little bit mix of luck then you could really be having that advantage.",
