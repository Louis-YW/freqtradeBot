The biggest issue is whether your PSU can handle it and also depending on how you have your risers powered. If you are using those SATA connectors to power your riser and you start to mine a more power intensive coin, you might end up melting those connectors even though they were previously fine. Right now profitability is in the toilet. You can switch algos and coins but in the end your profits will more or less be the same. The fact that you got those 100 RX 470 GPUS for free is proof that mining is dead.",

Need more video cards.   LOLThe Kawpow algorithm will be good for AMD video cards for a long time. On Nvidia video cards it is not always profitable.AMD BC-160 are more reliable due to turbines instead of coolers. But cheap video cards also take up a lot of space, but the payback of $130 in 9 months is good.",
