  "content": "Hello Fellow Bitcoiners!I am excited to be running my first auction here on the forum! I am auctioning off my “CoinJoin Panel” from an artist named Adam Kadmon. Here’s a quote from the artist about the work: “As an artist who spreads the word about the technology, I want to follow as much as I can the path and the values that Bitcoin gives us, so I decided to “link” my CoinJoin panels to the Bitcoin blockchain, and produce a panel, just like the block is produced on the network. The first linked panel was created on block number 700,000. Currently my CoinJoin panels are produced every 2000 blocks.”I have CoinJoin panel 715,000 and it is absolutely stunning in person. Here are some pictures:When the panel was shipped from the artist it was slightly damaged in the lower right hand corner during the shipping process, and when I mean slightly I truly mean it. When on display you cannot see the imperfection, it is naked to the eye unless you pick up the work and closely examine it. I took photos of the lower right hand corner to show where it is slightly raised (Happy to provide more photos if requested):AUCTION TERMSItem for Sale:  CoinJoin Panel Number 715,000 by Adam KadmonDimensions: 19.1in length x 10.8in height x 1in widthBid Format:   BTCStarting Bid: 0.01 BTCMinimum Bid Increment: 0.001 BTCAuction End Time: Wednesday, October 12th @ 5pm EST  countdown clock...https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/launch?iso=20221012T17&p0=179&msg=Coinjoin+Panel&font=cursive&csz=1 Sniping:  No sniping. 10 minute standard sniping rule.

I used DHL to ship a Fractal Encrypt \"Public Key\" Bitcoin art piece to the UK in February of this year and it was pretty expensive at $180.Best,BTCOVERFIATS",
