Mine is 0.1$, what do you think? Good altcoin?",

There are too many Layer 2 around and their development is way faster compared to immutable x, I dont see why would people use this when there are better options to choose from.",

      "body": "After I looked at their website, it looks like Immutable is a potential project. They even became the first layer 2 for NFT on the Ethereum network. And it seems that buying target at $0.02 is impossible, even to touch the price of $0.3 will also be very difficult. If you've researched these projects, you know a lot about them. So if you think their project is good, what's the harm in buying from now on?",

      "body": "Immutable X has become affiliated with Gamestop (the game retail company), So because if the corporate interest, I highly doubt the coin will see a low of USD 0.10. Also, if a publicly traded company is utilizing the token, I'm sure there is potential. Gives way to more funding/development/adoption. Here is an article about it. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-forms-partnership-immutable-x-120000870.html",

Mine is 0.1$, what do you think? Good altcoin? I remember this project on coinlist, one of the profitable projects in 2021 in terms of initial investment. The project brought its venture capitalists x50 last year. I continue to hold this project, I think it can update its ATH in the next bullrun. As far as buying now, the project could go even lower in value, with a loss in value of up to 95%. Right now the value loss is 88%, not a bad price to buy, but only a fraction, still a chance to wait for 40-60 cents on this project.",
