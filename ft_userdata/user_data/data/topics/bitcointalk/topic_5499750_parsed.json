But still maintained-in the mining algorithm used by Bitcoin is SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256), designed to be computationally intensive and favor hardware with high computational power.As Bitcoin's popularity grew over time, miners shifted from central processing units (CPU) and graphics processing units (GPU) to Bitcoin-specific Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). With significantly higher hash rates and energy efficient ASIC's were amore cost-effective.The change to ASICs was determined by market pressures and technological progress, rather than a deliberate mod from Bitcoin '. The Bitcoin protocol remains open to any miner who uses compatible hardware.",

That's not even a possible thing to do in the code. You can't put any kind of limit on what type of hardware used to compute hashes. It can be CPU, GPU, FPGA, ASIC, etc. You can even use Pen & Paper to compute hashes! The only reason why ASICs are used these days is because they are the most efficient hardware capable of computing the most number of hashes per second.

Mining is based on luck. For example you can get lucky and the first hash you compute is the correct one and you can submit your block. That means you can get lucky with the oldest CPU with lowest hashrate as well. But the chance of that happening is so low that it is practically impossible to \"get lucky\".",

Maybe you'll have to use an older version, or make sure you use the correct parameters when compiling to enable cpu/gpu mining. I'm pretty sure you could even find the exact commit where cpu mining was removed from bitcoin core and re-integrate it so you could mine with bitcoin-qt.The thing is pooya87 and NotATether are correct: if you use a cpu/gpu/fpga to mine, you'll have allmost 0 chance to hit a block. Even if you'd join a pool, the minimum difficulty of a share would be so high you'd solve almost no shares and you'd probably would not make enough sats to withdraw. The keyword here is \"allmost\": theoretically, there *is* a chance... But if you'd do the actual calculations, you'd see that on average it would take millions of years to solve a block... I did these calculations in the past a couple of times, but they are quite time consuming so i won't repeat them. Here's the last time i gave somebody an indication:Quote from: mocacinno on February 09, 2024, 08:12:48 AMTo give you guys a \"real\" idear about the odd and timing, it might be a good idear to read the wikiQuotetime = difficulty * 2**32 / hashratewhere difficulty is the current difficulty, hashrate is the number of hashes your miner calculates per second, and time is the average in seconds between the blocks you find.source:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficultythe current difficulty is 75,5 T, that's 75.500.000.000.000You can get to run your sidehack R909 @ 2,1 Th/secondwhen you're talking about a cpu or a gpu, you can look here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Non-specialized_hardware_comparison, but the fasted cpu hashes @140Hh/s and the fasted GPU @2568 Mh/s (those numbers are acutally quite old, but i would be supprised if new cpu's and gpu's have a SIGNIFICANT difference in the outcome of the calculation)So, a lottominer, the R909:time = (75.500.000.000.000 * 2**32)/ 2.100.000.000.000 = 1.544.143.004.038 seconds = 25.735.716.733 minutes = 428.928.612 hours = 17.872.025 days = 48.964 yearsSo, on average, at current difficulty, it would take you about 50 thousand years to hit a block with an R909So, a gpu:time = (75.500.000.000.000 * 2**32)/ 2.568.000.000 = 126.273.376.498.442 seconds = 2.104.556.274.974 minutes = 35.075.937.916 hours = 1.461.497.413 days = 4.004.102 yearsSo, on average, at current difficulty, it would take you about 4 million years to hit a block with the \"best\" gpu in the benchmarkSo, a cpu:time = (75.500.000.000.000 * 2**32)/ 140.000.000 = 2.316.214.506.057.142 seconds = 38.603.575.100.952 minutes = 643.392.918.349 hours = 26.808.038.264 days = 73.446.680 yearsSo, on average, at current difficulty, it would take you about 73 million years to hit a block with the \"best\" cpu in the benchmarkThere are all averages offcourse... yes, in theory, there *is* a chance of hitting a block with an rpi whilst cpu mining for a couple of seconds... The thing is that people are very bad in interpreting the odds, as long as they see a number and the word \"average\", they think there's an actual possibility of hitting a block with a cpu/gpu, whilst in reality their odds are sooooo small, they are so close to zero that you can probably just round them down to zero to begin with... You'd probably have better odds of getting married, going for a swim before the ceremony, being bitten by a shark at the same day as being hit by lightning, winning the lottery and getting into a car crash on your way to the hospital (i didn't do the exact math tough).",

That speed goes down in that list (CPU < GPU < FPGA < ASIC).To be fair you can harden your PoW scheme against certain types of hardware indirectly, by, say, choosing a hashing algorithm that is more RAM intensive and thus making the development of ASICs less viable. That's why Litecoin went with Scrypt over SHA256 for its PoW scheme. Alas, we all know how that went.

No matter what machine you are using all you're doing as a miner is hashing, which can be done by any computer.Only reason people only use ASICs is because they are thousands of times more efficient at computing these hashes than general purpose computers so it is a huge waste of energy (and therefore money) to use anything but ASICs. This means you're only gonna be losing money mining if you don't use an ASICs.Your developer friend doesn't have a clue what they are talking about.You are perfectly capable of running mining software on your computer to test out mining if you want to, though you're just gonna lose money doing it so it's not useful other than just seeing how mining works, and there's the chance that it like overheats your computer or something haha so I wouldn't recommend trying it for very long.",
