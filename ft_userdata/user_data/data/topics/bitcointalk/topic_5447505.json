Is it true?In the last year, people said bitcoin fell because of pandemic effects, increasing interest rate, inflation, recession but they just witnessed Bitcoin rose from $16,000 to $30,000 nearly. Now, what is a new fearful type?Recession, inflation, interest rate, unemployment rate, what is or are reasons?",

If it is truly independent of all including fiat, then we should not use fiat to measure its value.

We could always overcome the inflation with bitcoin, and that alone is good enough, the only problem is most of the time our salaries shrink at the face of inflation, I am not living as rich as 2019.Because since 2020 there has been high inflation and prices didn't drop neither, so I am making about the same money, and yet I am spending a lot more, that's why life is harder obviously but thanks to bitcoin going up, I overcame that issue as well.",

This is not entirely true. The things happening in the economy affects bitcoin. An interest increase affects bitcoin, the pandemic affected bitcoin. Like you said, \"demand and supply is the determinant of bitcoin\", so is every other asset in the world. Put in simple economic terms, when the demand for bitcoin increases, the price increases, when the demand reduces, the price reduces. Now different factors can determine the demand of bitcoin and that is where the factors affecting the economy comes in. No matter how decentralized bitcoin may be, the people that operate in the industry are people that cannot escape the economy because they live, work, make and lose money in that same economy. So if these players in the economy are affected by different economic factors, it will tell in the economic decisions they make and their decisions can also affect bitcoin price.",

I'm not really sure if there is a correlation with the oil price and BTC, although we might argue that traditional financial market could have affect the price, still though numbers are rough and we can't conclude correlation. But what we are seeing is that anyone is fearful of the economy, i.e. inflation, rate hike, banking crisis and this could still be the effect of pandemic after three years. And with that, everyone is looking for something the hedge their wealth, thus making BTC as Store of Value (SoV) and this was been tested when the pandemic occurs in 2020, although it might coincide with the bull run, but still though, BTC remain resilient that time and we all know that we reach all time high. So it's sort of a \"protect against inflation\" crypto.",

So it cannot be said that it is essential, what bitcoin is achieving on a more personal level, and we are moving up step by step.

But given the current economic situation and the recent movements of bitcoin, it is hard to say that it is having a negative impact on Bitcoin.This is kind of the irony of it all. Bitcoin is correlated to the wider economic environment until it no longer is. To me it largely seems detached as based on a 4-year cycle 2022 was always intended as bear market (similar to 2018 and 2014). I think it's likely inflation and other factors accelerated the bear market, particularly the first half when price dropped to $17.5K. Notably, 6 months later, the next low wasn't much lower at around $15.5K, the price that Bitcoin was likely going to reach by the end of last year whether there was high inflation or not. It's also possible the acceleration came from LUNA/FTX rather than inflation.Since then we have seen Bitcoin recover in 2023, just like in 2019 as well as 2015, so it's hard to say this is all a coincidence and not based on Bitcoin's own inflationary policy rather than that of fiat currencies. The real test will be if a recession begins and Bitcoin makes a new low (which would be uncharacteristic based on it's cycle), then we can agree that Bitcoin's price is directly affected by the economic environment.",
