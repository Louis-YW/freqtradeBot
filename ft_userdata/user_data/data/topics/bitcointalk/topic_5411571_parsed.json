That is really old as a card despite the hash rate of it being 30-31 Mhsh it is not worthy to run right now where prices of cryptos are going down and the difficulty skyrocketing for ETC which many people will flock into it after ETH mining ends in mid September approximately.Unless you have an electricity like in Washington at 0.02-0,03 kwatt/hour (at least this is how ti was a couple of years ago) this card is better used as a relic or at an old gaming workstation,this uses near 350 Watt the same as an 3080 ti uses but the 3080 ti can do 120 Mhsh approximately or 4 times better in hash rate.",

It's about improving the profiability of inefficient hardware.The heat from mining in the summer is wasted but in the winter it reduces the heating bills.",

After I sold these video cards, bios modification appeared.If it is possible to get 20 megahash by consuming 150 watts, then this is also very bad. Probably better to buy a 1060 6 GB video card, which will give 23 megahash at 90 watts and it will be much younger.",
