If there is a bank in the middle you can get your money back in many ways. When you send money directly, there is no possibility of getting this money back. The example you used is quite hard to understand and is confusing but I do get what you mean. Let me give you an example here:Just like you said we cannot take it back. If given or sent to the wrong person, that person might never bring it back and no one else is responsible but you. So you can not blame anyone unlike with centralized systems they can be penalized but you? You just lost your money.At the same time this is part of our freedom and we must bear the consequences.",

Upon regulation, a country like Brazil has centres or should I say mini banks, that help do direct transactions from cryptocurrency to the local currency or otherwise.This is why I see it as a problem that has already had a solution for future purposes, because the decentralized network has mostly now been infiltrated by the centralized network and although P2p still works, there has been other means of transactions that exist wherein P2p may be considered invalid, old or out of date.",

They can literally shut down almost any business if they want to, regardless if it's bitcoin/crypto-related or not. Even them going after pools/miners is totally expected.There's a reason why this quote has been used a lot when talking about Bitcoin: “First, they will ignore you, then they will laugh at you, then they will fight you, then you will win.”",

This is the best response I can give from my understanding of the OP.P2P on centralized exchanges like Binance or OKX, this is not pure P2P trading because of the intervention of those exchanges. The P2P the OP is talking about is a transaction between two people without an intermediary, and if your partner intends to cheat, there is no way to get it back. There is no method without disadvantages and that is the disadvantage of P2P trading. I agree with the OP's point of view, P2P also has its disadvantages but is not perfect.",

You prefer something based on the comparison between its pros and cons, so both Bitcoin and banks have negatives and positives, but Bitcoin’s positives are much more than its negatives, unlike banks.As for sending money peer-to-peer, this is true. If you send money even by mistake, you will not be able to get it back. Therefore, trust is required in this system. You only have to send money to people or services that you trust and there will be transactions between you. Otherwise, the mistake is your fault.",

In banking system, there's a hope of getting your stolen/mistakenly sent money back to your account with proper procedure and legal interference. But in crypto, one a transaction is signed, it's final. The transaction can't be reversed. That's why you will see scammers and hackers are very active in the crypto market. because they know that the chance of getting caught is very less here. There are some standard practices which can help you to safeguard your cryptocurrency. But it can never be 100% secure. That's a real challenge. But I believe it works well for privacy focused people.",

I can't recollect how many times I have used Bitcoin to make payments online, from small items to big ones and I have never made the wrong transfers or done business with a scammer before, if this happened the fault is on you, so always verify the person or company you are doing business with first before paying with your Bitcoin.",

One could be payments to reputable \"receivers\".

The other solution is using escrows or even a 2of2 multi sig between yourself and the merchant (without a third party escrow).",
