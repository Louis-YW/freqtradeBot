Staying at the top of your potential can even be more difficult than reaching it. It is very competitive at the top for who will remain relevant there. It is not enough to reach your potential, you have to not settle when you reach it so that you do not begin to fall slowly even before you can realize it. To remain at the top, you need to be committed to development and growing in knowledge and skill. If you settle with the knowledge and skill that you have, it will not take long for you to become less relevant.",

You can develop more than one potential, someone who is always online can learn so many things from digital marketing to freelancing, blogging, affiliate marketing etc.",

I have heard so many religious preachers and motivational speakers come up with different strategies for discovering your potential. Potential are natural or inborn abilities that if put into good use will empower the person and the society. A potential should contribute positively to society and also assist the individual gain financial and other benefits. The first thing one should do is to identify potential, develop it, and put it to good use. I believe that one can identify his potential by observing things you like doing easily. When you don't struggle to perform a task and you are always willing to do it even without rewards, that area might be where your potential lies. When you are using your potential, your main focus shouldn't be to make money. This is because, if money doesn't comes you might become discouraged. Let your focus be to satisfy a need or solve a problem. If you meet needs and solve problems, money will naturally come to you. Conduct your research so that you will not rely on the advice of inexperienced friends and family.",

Sometimes we become trapped in a situation, doing the same actions again and over. However, if we are prepared to venture outside of our familiar surroundings and attempt new things, we may unlock new possibilities inside ourselves. For example, if you are an excellent writer but have never considered publishing a book. Or maybe you're fantastic at sales but have never considered establishing your own firm. It's critical to discover your entire potential. So, instead of being discouraged by an obstacle, make use of it as an opportunity for improvement and keep moving forward.",

Desire plays a very vital role in achieving in life.The drive to keep going. If that drive is always there then you'll never stop and as long as you don't stop, there's a chance to always go forward. There's no limit to what one can achieve.When you've achieved a certain level and there's no more drive anymore you might stop and this can limit you. I've seen many people in different fields who just felt comfortable after they've gotten to a certain level when they had the potential to achieve more. It's not a bad thing though, but I'm just pointing out who desires and drives pushes us.When you want something and you reach for it, without allowing anything to stop you, you'll most likely get it if you do it right. I believe the world is easier today than it was 50-100 years ago. The internet has made things very easy. I can get a degree today without ever stepping on a university campus. I can learn a skill without leaving my house. The problem is people do not take advantage of the world today as much as they should. There are hundreds of ways to achieve our goals and we have to first start by learning. Invest that time and money into learning something. Be very good at it. Solve a problem, then you'll begin to make money from it, and never forget to keep learning. The moment you stop learning you stop growing.",
