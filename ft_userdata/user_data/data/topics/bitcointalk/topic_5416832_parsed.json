And you can make x1000.  Why would anyone who loves crypto and who wants to see a better world trust projects that made their owners rich and lazy? If you want to be in a good, hungry project that can still change the world be in Bitcoin (since its not owned by single people like the rest of the top100 crypto), or buy crypto that is still only $5m or even less market cap like Modefi.   I got x100 on Chainlink which I bought in 2018. Because I learnt from early ETH buyers who got eth for $0.25 and got rich like mmcrypto and themoon (they mainly got rich with affiliate commissions tho), however anyone who bought ETH at $0.25 trusted an unknown, small, tiny project that was not established yet (like Modefi and others now) and got rewarded. But why did people go in ETH early? Simply because they learnt it from the early Bitcoin investors who got Bitcoin or $0.20.  Now you need other early projects that are still small to become financially independant and free and to revolutionize the world. Not the big ones. The big ones keep everyone poor. They crash by 95% in bear markets for a reason. Do you not want x500 or x1000? How can eth possibly ever go x1000 again?  Learn from the early crypto people who trusted early projects and got rewarded. You just need to find the good projects (modefi over 1 million lines of code, self-funded), the good teams, the crazy and creative teams, the guys who will make the world a better place and help replace banks, mainstream media and centralized social networks.",

      "body": "ModeFi just pumped like those high marketcap coin in 2021. But the main disadvantage of the coin is low liquidity and only yet trading on six decentralized exchanges, with low liquidity. Only trading on one centralized exchange which is Kucoin. Having just $3 million in marketcap.Low marketcap projects can fail, you may think it would pump, but become a shit coin. I will prefer high marketcap coins like bitcoin and other with above $300 million worth in marketcap, they are better than low marketcap coins which have the problem of trading volume and most prone to become a shit coin.",

      "body": "Based on your title, it seems you think that buying the top 50 isnt worth it now. Well thats where you are wrong. You dont know what fundamental could affect the market and boost those top 50 projects. Yes you are right that early project has more potential to gain more than 100x but its still a risky one. Ive also invested on some of the early projects and some of them didnt go well in the past. Its not that Ive picked a wrong one but the projects are indeed good but not compared to others that get more than 100x. Low cap coins are good investment but if they arent good in terms of many things then its not also a win win situation. A risk is always associated with a high multiplier gains.",

This is because, I'm of the opinion that the project with low market cap are relatively riskier. No doubt one could make a lot of money if they turn out right, but we never can tell if the project would still be existent in the near future. To maximize returns, it could be better to have both the high and low capitalisation projects in your portfolio Inorder to benefit from the two worlds.",

Those top 50 alts in the market, a lot of people were making money out out of it. I don't know how you came up with the theory that people who bought top 50 alts were poor. Why did they keep buying if it is not profiting them? Furthermore, you're talking about investing into a new project as if 90% of them will give you that x500 or x1000 that you've boasting about.",

And most likely are coins that will pump.",

And you can make x1000.Well so in the end your thread title is just a bait to make people look into your ModeFi shilling thread. I don't have a problem with that because the crypto space has always been the wild west in regards of scamming, shilling and so on but i doubt that such threads will convince any reader to invest into that project. I don't know about ModeFi so maybe it even is a great Project, but there are so many new crypto projects out there, it is almost impossible to keep track of them all.Also i disagree with your statement that you will stay poor if you invest into top 50 coins. I even think that a bear market like now is a good chance to get some of those big coins and when we are back in a bull market even those big projects could do another x10 from here on.Of course there probably won't be a x100 or even a x1000 anymore but at least the risk is relatively low in comparison to an investment in new projects.",

Yes, sometimes new little-known tokens can give very large profits, but this happens very rarely. Top coins with a high level of capitalization give a relatively lower profit, but it is more reliable. Therefore, each of us has a choice of which tactics to choose. To invest in a little-known new token, you need to know the market and the project of this token well. And then, there is no guarantee that even with all the positive characteristics, he will succeed. Failures can be in everything, since a lot depends on the project team and the general state of the market.",

You've made other posts about this coin, it's a shill thread.  Honestly picking low cap coins is almost always a losing strategy.  Buying bitcoin year over year has been one of the best decisions anyone could have made.  Every new bull culycle it goes higher, whereas low cap coins get wiped off the map every bear cycle never to come back again.  So yeah buying coins in the top 50 isn't a bad strategy at all.",
