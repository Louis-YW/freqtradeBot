  "content": "Alik BakhshiKedmi broke up with Solovyov    Yakov Kedmi, realizing that Russia, to which he predicted an indispensable victory, was losing the war, decided that it was time to part with Russian propagandists and thereby rehabilitate himself in the eyes of the world community. To this end, Yasha, who earlier in the nightingale dung show called for an end to Ukraine as a state, issued seditious words to all of Putin's Russia that it was impossible to bomb peaceful cities, killing the civilian population, it was criminal, which led Solovyov and other propagandists into a stupor. For this, another would have been immediately sent to jail, but Kedmi knew that as an Israeli citizen they would not dare to touch him. Naturally, participation in the Russian TV feeder, where conscience is traded for a good reward, will no longer shine for him, but with honor, as he thinks, he will leave this Russian nest of terrorist propaganda.    Conscience is such a substance that is given to a person from the moment of his birth, and once parted with it, he will never find it again. However, she will remind him of herself in the last hours of her life, this will be the very Hell that they frighten.11/30/2022",

I haven't kept up with the Putin hit list to see if Israeli's are off the table. Putin hasn't hesitated to off detractors across borders. He might just have an \"accident.\"",

      "body": "I don't think it's worth to pay much attention to things which are told un Russian state controlled media. You say that Kedmi now is sceptical about ''special operation, btw, could you share link where did he said these things? Maybe week ago he offered Russia to use tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, so, it would be strange if he changed his views so fast.https://news.obozrevatel.com/economics/analytics-and-forecasts/rossmi-ozvuchili-uslovie-pri-kotorom-okkupantyi-gotovyi-pokinut-zaes-shantazh-nabiraet-oborotyi.htmAnd it's not first time when propagandists tells something negative about this war. But these things comes with approval of creators of such shows because there is no freedom of speech on Russian media and they  don't invite people who have different opinion. Telling negative things about war on Russian TV is simply preparing people for loss of war that it wouldn't be so painful for them. Like before retreat from Kherson, propagandists were giving excuses for few weeks why Russia can't keep control of this city.",

Vladimir Solovyov a core Russian supporter have recognized that targeting civilians during a conflict is the highest form of irresponsibility. Maybe he has seen many harmless children, elderly and women suffer from the actions of Russia and his heart began to bleed. Even in the face of arrest, imprisonment or even death his conscience is bold enough to accept and speak out the truth and damming the consequences. I hope he survives this act of bravery.",

Whoever pays him more, this scoundrel will campaign for that. It is noteworthy that in the TV show Solovyov (Shapiro) in Russia, there are only Jews and Armenians.",
