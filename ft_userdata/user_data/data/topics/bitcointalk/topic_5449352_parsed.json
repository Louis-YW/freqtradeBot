  "content": "Dear Bitcointalk.org Moderators and Administrators,I am writing to request that additional sub-forums be added to the site to better serve the diverse interests and needs of the forum's user base. While the current sub-forums cover a wide range of topics related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there are some areas that are not well-represented or could benefit from their own dedicated sub-forum.In particular, I would like to suggest the following additional sub-forums:1. Cryptocurrency Investing: A dedicated sub-forum for discussions related to investing in cryptocurrencies, including technical analysis, market trends, and portfolio management strategies.2. Cryptocurrency Regulation: A sub-forum focused on discussions related to regulatory issues affecting cryptocurrencies, including legal developments and government policies.3. Cryptocurrency Mining: A dedicated sub-forum for discussions related to cryptocurrency mining, including hardware and software recommendations, mining pool reviews, and profitability analysis.4. Cryptocurrency Gaming: A sub-forum focused on discussions related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the gaming industry, including the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in gaming and blockchain-based gaming platforms.5.Cryptocurrency Education: A sub-forum focused on educating newcomers to the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, including beginner's guides, tutorials, and recommended resources.I believe that adding these sub-forums would not only better serve the needs of the forum's user base, but also help to organize and streamline discussions on specific topics, making it easier for users to find the information they need. I hope that you will consider this request and look forward to hearing your response.",

We would like experienced traders to join us there to discuss more about trading.What I have always thought about is for trading discussion to also be on altcoins board too just like speculation, but I consider it not necessary and not that relevant as we discussed most in trading discussion board.",

The board that you should have even suggested is a \"Security and Privacy Board,\" which I think has already been talked about before. Bitcointalk really has a lot of boards and sub-boards, which, if you look through this forum carefully, you will find all of them. Also, there are some local boards that I think only need sub-boards.",

So far, the only Merit he got was for advertising someone else's topic where it doesn't belong. It got him a spot on my ignore list.On-topic: New boards are usually only created when there's a lot of posts on other boards that can be moved there.",
