I know what has to be done but I'm not sure how to go about it so I'm lookingfor some advice or maybe a breakdown of your workflow?Generating addresses and keysprinting and adhering the hologramsFunny thing is I have seen guides on how its done but I just cannot find the threads?The most recent one I saw was a tip on how to apply the holograms....maybe by krogoth? idk....Thanks in advance !",

      "body": "I use bitaddress.org as it seems to be the most reliable / trusted site for QR code generating and is also extremely simple to use. I disconnect from the internet / Bluetooth etc completely and get my QR codes made up. I literally just copy and paste the QR codes from the site to windows and resize them. Once I have my QR codes sized and ready to go I print them with an also air gapped printer which I connect to my laptop with a laptop printer cable you can buy off Amazon. This way the generating of the holos, transferring them to computer, and printing is all done COMPLETELY offline. A side note: I have auto save and all that turned completely off on windows so it doesn’t try to back up the QR codes In any way but I still check and make sure once I’m done… Now they are ready to print! Once printed I cut them to size using a little drafters tool that has different sized circles and squares. I use this to place over QR codes and give me a clean circle or square to trace out and cut around so that when I DO apply the security sticker the outline of the paper will be even and uniform. You obviously don’t have to do all that I’m just a bit ocd when it comes to stuff like thatApplying the Security Holo-I do this a little differently than the tried and true “Painters tape” method. Using painters tape works fine but makes it incredibly hard for me to see the center of holo if there is a “firstbits” rectangular window or a swuare window to view the public key through the holo. I use 2 pairs of “hobby tweezers” that have soft but firm rubber tips that are good for holding the holo without damaging it. One pair of tweezers is normal with long angled arms while the other pair is the kind that stay closed and clamped until you squeeze them and THEN they open.      I gently peel I tiny portion of the holo and use the “clamp style” to grab the TINIEST portion of the edge of the sticker. Once grabbed I can set it down and it’ll hold it in place. If the sticker has a window I use the other pair to grab my firstbits or public QR code and Apply. If not I line up the sticker with the reverse of piece and get it as centered and straight as possible. Press her down and boom you’re done. I also keep pressing the sticker down for a little while to ensure a good connection all over just to be sure. Hope that helps I know it was a long explanation and I’m sure there will be a few people who don’t like the way I do this but it’s the simplest and most reliable way I’ve found and has never failed me once. Good luck buddy!",

Thank you also for the info, I could probably give a HD a fairly tough timetoo with a drillpress, lump hammer and blow torch, the metal shredder forsure is a hard-core job !!Interesting on the Revla paper, I think that is the same as Tyvek paperwhich I am familiar with.So I have to create an airgapped system which I will look into, and I mighthave some more questions further along in my learning.",

The only end game is to load them as they were intended with some Satoshi's.@Todamont I dont have any such hardware so I cant say I'll be using that. The actual processseems quite simple, the address and private key will be stored on the coin with a tamperproof hologram.I get it that scans can be made and do happen but the excersize of creating the addressand keys is what intrigues me, I wont be loading any coin with substantial amounts of Bitcoin.",
