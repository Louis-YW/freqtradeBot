  "content": "The news about spot Bitcoin ETF approval has been making rounds in the news recently. And it has brought so much hope that next year will be a profitable one for Bitcoiners. I have a feeling that the SEC will approve it next year because approving the ETF will also favor the SEC in some ways. It will promote centralization of the Bitcoin system which will make the sector very easy to regulate. It will be easier for this regulatory body to control the space through various policies targeted at these institutional investors. I suspect that the reason why the SEC is delaying the approval is because they have not made enough regulatory policies to control the sector but they have intensified actions to make these laws. The clampdown on mixer services is one of the strategies of the SEC to make the Bitcoin space more centralized. And who knows if the next target might be decentralized exchanges. Institutional investment in bitcoin will lead to an increase in the price of the currency which is good news to investors. But do you think the SEC will also benefit from the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETF?",

And it has brought so much hope that next year will be a profitable one for Bitcoiners.Maybe we should understand this that it's more of halving next year than bitcoin spot ETF approval, wether the SEC approves application or not, bitcoin market remains dependent of the demand and supply rate, the recent fake news could be said that it has a little impact on the increase felt but yet it would have been the same news that would have make the market go dip when it was realized to be fake news.Quote from: Fiatless on October 31, 2023, 09:33:43 AM I have a feeling that the SEC will approve it next year because approving the ETF will also favor the SEC in some ways. People are just giving theirselves fake hope with the expectation that by next year some might been approved, but SEC themselves are not making any official release on this fact, so i will count this as part of the gist that accumulate to FUD.Quote from: Fiatless on October 31, 2023, 09:33:43 AMIt will promote centralization of the Bitcoin system which will make the sector very easy to regulate. These companies applying for bitcoin spot ETF are not applying for bitcoin itself to be adopted by them, they are only seeking approval for the use of bitcoin market price in rating their stocks and market bonds with their clients, if SEC should regulate anything here, then not bitcoin but the organizations after the use of bitcoin spot ETF.",

Well, the regulatory policies that the SEC should be establishing were supposed to stop fraud. You know, the kind of stuff they let FTX and its band of disheveled incompetent geeks get away with for years.  But the SEC can also fall prey to lobbying, especially from politicians. And we are seeing a lot of them try to shut down crypto by drafting bills - most not necessarily intended for the SEC, but can still cause a bad policy to be made nonetheless. But a clamping-down on ETFs shouldn't do anything to the average user anyway, because really, only institutions benefit from it. That's why I feel neutral about the topic.It all comes down to the organization being basically a skeleton with no real funding for it to draft safe and useful policies.",

And of course the Spot Bitcoin ETF will also be categorized as a securities market because it will be under SEC supervision after approval. But I have a feeling that the SEC will not do much to make Bitcoin centralized. Because there is a difference between the regular bitcoin spot market and the Bitcoin Spot ETF. And the SEC has limited authority in this matter. Because Bitcoin itself is not considered a security in the US. So I'm not worried about anything else regarding the SEC and Bitcoin Spot ETFs. As an investor I am excited about big institutions joining bitcoin. But I also have my own concerns about this. But I can't explain my worries.",

I mean it's their job to do that so obviously as a regulatory body they will have to give in to the pressure of the Spot ETF. But first they should be putting some form of protection and I think those companies have already adhere to the policies of SEC. So for me its just a matter of time before they will have to approved it. Maybe they will look good in the eyes of the investors or maybe some wall street guys.

I can’t agree less with you because I think with investors actually going through this traditional exchanges to get bitcoin even though it is not real one will make the government Atleast have an idea of the number of its citizens actual involved into bitcoin holding. Should they need to find the details of possibly the investors, this traditional exchanges might have to provide it for them base on the rules of regulatory compliance. One thing I would say the government is bent on having a hold of or taming in this bitcoin is the fact that people can go into full anonymity. The government doesn’t want you to have that privacy. And just like regular exchanges were you submit KYC and we all say you’re no long anonymous because the government can get you through them, I also see this traditional exchanges been another backlog for the government to get details of its investors.",
