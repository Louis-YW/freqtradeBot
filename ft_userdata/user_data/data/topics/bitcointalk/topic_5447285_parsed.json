Damn that was the worst day, i will never play with my all bankroll. (ignore bad english)For entertainment purpose only.As Fivestar4everMVP said above, you can't enforce rules without putting your thread in self-moderated mode, because I don't think any moderator will remove a post not respecting your own requirements if the post respects the general forum rules. And unfortunately I don't think it's possible for a user to convert a thread into self-moderated mode once it has been created. Only admins and maybe global moderators should be able to do that.Anyway, in addition to pictures I think people should be allowed to post videos of their big wins or big losses, and slot \"replays\". Indeed, many slots offer a replay feature with a sharing link when people hit high multipliers. A topic dedicated to the big losses separated from the one of the big wins would be more appropriate though.",

      "body": "I know it's just for fun, I don't really think it's a nice idea sharing your win on the forum here, when it comes to financial aspects, we should always learn to keep it personal, we shouldn't disclose our worth on the internet, not everything is suppose to be shared on the internet. That's just my opinion and I don't really know what you will do with the big win and lose that is posted here, when you are dealing with money we have to be sensitive and careful.",
