I find them better than gambling and lucky gamesThat can somehow be considered as gambling. You are already playing and risking something and expecting to win more than what you put in. You put in the time and effort in exchange of competing with other people for the same pot. That's considered gambling to me. At the least you are getting something off of the effort you are exerting and that is great. I tried considering doing these back in the day but unfortunately, I don't have the personality and skills to be successful.",

I find them better than gambling and lucky gamesEvery game that involves money is considered gambling for me, so yeah, pay to earn could be in that category, that incentive is there in the end.So in the example you put, FPS or First Person Shooter I will assume (correct me if I'm wrong), will have like a pot money and winner takes all, taking out the skills and luck, with money on the line, that is already the definition of gambling as there is money and there is incentive and the winner gets all the money.",

That's normal for most of the games even in RPG games where there's PVP. I've seen people betting on who's the strongest.Today, with most competitive games are online, it's easier to bet and have someone on their end that will just have to pay and sent the payment through online transfers or crypto, too easy to bet and play these days.",

I find them better than gambling and lucky gamesThat is still considered gambling since you put money and expect to get the money from other players when you win. I think that is not profitable for a casino since there is so much needed to get that going. They need refs, the location where players can play. I think that is why no casino is picking that up. Casinos only pick up professional tournaments and they act as bookies where you can bet for your favorite teams. It will be very expensive for them to host the event themselves. I suggest, if you really are good at FPS games, then try to be a professional gamer. Rank up and get noticed by professional groups. They pay higher and with a contract, you are secured. If you are playing since you were young, then you should be very adept by now and can be a professional gamer if you pursue it. If you think you do not have enough skill to be professional gamer, then another choice is to stream games and earn from it. As long as you are entertaining to watch, you can have followers in social media and other streaming platforms.",

I just can't find it.Not just pay-to-earn but games with gacha rolls, premium items to buy in-game, and other kinds of stuff that are being bought with money are considered gambling too. It's just better now because online games are paying back by means of cryptocurrencies where items can be sold for it. Or, you could pick a game with an NFT option, make your avatar an NFT then trade it for cryptocurrency in their market.If you are the type of hardcore grinder in MMORPGs, you could try Mir4.",
