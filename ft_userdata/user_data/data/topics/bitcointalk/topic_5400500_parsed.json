The pot is part of a timing circuit and without knowing what that circuit is...What you need to measure is the duty cycle and frequency of the pulse train being sent. Best way is with either a multi-meter that has those functions, use an oscilloscope, or -- measure the average DC voltage you see between the yellow tach wire and the black wire (common). You can assume that 100% = 12v. That will at least let you calculate the duty cycle different fans speeds give but you still need to find out the baseline frequency, as I mentioned before, 1kHz is common.",

If you do have some personnel experience on the brains software how much power savings can one achieve with base clock speeds after auto tuning ? I have no experience with immersion cooling but I have tested both firmware in the past, and I personally think Vnish (asic.to / awesomeminer) is far better, although,Vnish is a modified bitmain firmware (originally Cgminer) while BOs+ is written from scratch and thus does not violate any license, but then \"copyrights\" aside, I would personally use Vnish over BOs.But then again, everyone is different, you can try both and see what works best for you, the power saving on both firmware versions is pretty good compared to the stock firmware, it's good enough to justify the fees especially if your power rate is high.",

I do not have an s19 unit so I can't give you how much power you can save and Autotuning on BraiinsOS you can manually set how much power limit that your PSU can provide on 3 hashboards.Braiins OS will automatically find the optimal settings for your unit(Of every ASIC chips) and I think if the miner is cooler then it will give you more boost on hashrate and I think also can save more power based on my s9 miner.",

I am sure you know this, but I would like to clarify to OP that a hashrate boost means a sacrifice of efficiency, when we say custom firmware is more efficient than the stock we are talking about (when comparing the same hashrate), in other words, if the stock firmware gives you 100th and 3100w, you could expect the custom firmware to give you 100th and 2900w or maybe lower, so you go down from 31w per th to 29w per th.Now if you underclock the miner using custom firmware, you get even a better efficiency at the cost of losing hashrate, so maybe you can achieve something like 70th at 1600w, or 23w/th, which is a lot more efficient than the stock.However, if you were to go to 120th overclock, then the efficiency of this setup will be less than the stock, you will also need to replace the PSU, if 130-140th is your target, then a 6kw is needed, pushing towards 160-180 will require an 8kw PSU, overclocking with the stock PSU is going to pretty limited.",
