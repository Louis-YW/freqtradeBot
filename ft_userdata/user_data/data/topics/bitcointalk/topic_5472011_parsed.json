Even though it worked for you the first time, I don't think it will work the next time.those who share signals with you do not invite you to be successful, it could be a trap for you because they buy first and try to take advantage of people like you to make more buy orders in the market. the price will probably increase slightly, and those who buy first at lower prices will benefit more from the small movements resulting from people like you.Believe in your abilities, those who whisper to you are not necessarily sincere.",

Nobody hates pumps, if you can catch them on your own by watching the market yourself (as opposed to some scammer telling you about it), you can make a high risk trade and make some profit.QuoteToday poweroump team will pump LTC let's see how high they send it Scam groups usually stick to small shitcoins they can pump with their small \"herd\" not bigger shitcoins like LTC. They may sometimes take credit for a pump that had nothing to do with them though!LTC got a little pump last week though and it is not making any moves today, and its volume is going down so it is unlikely to see any major pumps anytime soon.I guess in 24 hours we see what this scam group is made of",

As long as its a free group then that can help in the gaining of each users in terms of trading. If a group is a paid one then its agenda might not to give you profit but to earn from you on subscription. Surely not all calls are likely to yield any profits daily right?

Although I listened on some of them but I always filter everything that they say through doing my own initial research and found out that most of them are not reliable and are not worthy of our funds. However, while some of us are totally aware about it but here comes newbies who actually put their full trust on these pump groups or channels like everything they say are the realities on the market.However, we can't also blame the people behind these channels since they are only working to earn a living. No matter how they try to deceived us, but if we know that we are entering an unpredictable market, then its our initiative to avoid them immediately since they can't help us anyway to achieve our individual goals in crypto.",
