  "content": "Assuming you want to have five wallets. Let us say 2 for bitcoin and 3 for altcoins. Having more than one because it is good not to have only just one wallet. Because of that, you split the coins into 5 wallets. I also prefer to use bitcoin only wallet for bitcoin.For one seed phrase, you can have three backups which is what people are saying on this forum. For 5 wallets, that is 15 backup. If you will keep the backup in different places, that is becoming impossible.What about having only one seed phrase and backup the seed phrase in three places on a paper. If you want to generate the 5 wallets, you will set different passphrase and have only 1 seed phrase.Example of the passphrase:_-\\A.bb.ccc&zzz.yy.X/-_I can make it longer like this if I have the passphrase backup online:$+$-sbdgsgsgs$+$-362+2;$;_-$:_;$)$+_+$+3+$_-(3shdhrhe3+$-jsjdhrh_+$-#-#ehsh$!$-$-$eudydhdbs$-$&363That is 23 characters long which will be difficult to brute force. Another thing is that if you have the backup in different places, people that see it will not know that it is passphrase.These are my questions:Is the method good?Is this better than having just seed phrase backup in different locations?Can you have the passhrase backup encrypted on online password manager so far the seed phrase backup are offlineThe proper way is to have different seed phrase and passhrase. But the backup is getting difficult for me because I do not have safe places to keep the backup anymore because the seed phrase are getting plenty.If I have three backup for just one seed phrase, I can use my memory for the fourth backup and have the passphrase online encrypted and protected on a password manager.I do not want posts like do not memorize seed phrase. We all know that. I depend on my backup, the fourth is just for emergency purpose.",

If one of those wallets is vulnerable and the attacker is able to get his hands on either the seed or the mpk, the attacker is able to rob all 5 wallets since the password merely encrypts the mpk, so it doesn't matter if you used different passwords to encrypt said mpk (since he'll steal the unencrypted version anyways... Or the encrypted version which only needs to be bruteforced once, not 5 times).If you're extending your seed with a 13th or 25th word, things are a bit different... This being said, if for some reason an attacker exploits a weakness in the wallet that allows him to capture the first 12 or 24 (or whatever number) of seedwords, he only has to bruteforce this extension word 5 times, which is far easyer than bruteforcing the complete seed + extension word (which is impossible). Offcourse, a long extension word makes this a lot harder (if not practically impossible). This is basically my setup, but i keep no unencrypted version of my seedphrase and i only use hardware wallets to store my funds.For your next question: keeping the password or the extension word in an online password manager decreases your security... If an attacker is able to exploit an attack vector that lets him get his hands on your seed phrase he no longer needs your password. Keeping an extension word in an online password manager will require him to steal your seed + brute force his way into your password manager, which is hard (but certainly not as safe as keeping everything offline).Basically, the \"ideal\" way to create the wallets is completely offline seed creation + completely offline extension word. The best way to store the seeds are 5 different seeds + 5 different extension words saved in at least 2 safe places, and never store seed + extension word @ the same place... All other things described in your post decrease your security.. This being said: you might be fine willing to decrease your secutiy in order to increase your redundancy of backups, but that's very hard for a thirth party to decide... You're probably fine re-using the seed and adding a very long extension word that you keep in a very secure cloud environment using a very hard passphrase for encryption, but I would never do this since for me it wouldn't feel secure enough (but maybe for you it does?).Personally, i have one 24 word seed phrase + several extension words. I use this seed on my 2 hardware wallets, and i keep said 2 hardware wallets in two safe places. I have different wallets on both hardware wallets by using the different extension words. I then used ssss to split the seed up into 3 parts using a 2 out of 3 scheme with passphrase encryption and i stored the 3 slices in 3 very safe places. I did not keep several copy's of the seed phrase, since i have 2 physical wallets + one encrypted copy of the seed phrase split in 3 parts using a 2/3 ssss scheme. Odds of me losing both hardware devices and 2 out of 3 slices are negligible (since the storage spots are physically far apart... It would basically need an atomic bomb nuking half my country in order for me to lose access to my wallets). If an attacker:gets his hands on one slice: he can't do anything since he needs 2gets his hands on two slices: he needs to bruteforce the passphrase of the ssss scheme + the extension wordsgets his hands on a physical hardware wallet and bruteforce the pin + the extension wordsThe thing does remain: there are always attack vectors... The more attack vectors you eliminate, the bigger the odds of you losing access to your wallet or funds... If you try to make up schemes to make sure you will never lose access to your funds, you'll inevitably open up very small attack vectors for potential thiefs. It's very hard to find a balance.",

It is at the same risk of being compromised, and is only as safe as the security of wherever you are storing it (which will likely be much less than the security of 23 random characters).If you must back up something electronically, then I would suggest using an airgapped device, encrypting it, and storing it on a USB drive or SD card which will only ever be plugged back in to the same airgapped device. But then of course you now have the problem of where you back up your encryption key.",

I would use a single seed phrase stamped into steel or titanium that will last a natural disaster. I would also use a piece of paper with the same seed phrase that you can access a little more easily but you can also destroy easily. the more places that you have your seed phrase stored, the greater the likelihood that it becomes compromised unless you have multiple passphrases to use with that seed.   Once you have that, I would stick to passphrases with 24 characters including numbers and ASCII characters. I like this stainless steel passphrase stick that can hold 24 characters: https://codl.co/products/punchplate-4-compact24-words but there are other otc options. I don't think you need to go crazy with multisig security if you have your seed phrase backed up and stored somewhere safe and then use multiple passphrases with that seed phrase. I know that there is no single right answer for this but I think that passphrases provide a high level of security with a reasonable UI/UX without a lot of the technical requirements or a full multisig setup.",

If sophisticated centralised exchanges could be hacked  then why can key phrase not be able to hack by hackers. It Is better avoided than allowed happened OP.As for wallets, excessive opening of wallets compound  more key phrase for storage. I believe it would be nice for one  narrow down  the rate at which one uses multiple wallets as I can result to loss of funds and assets in most cases due to misplaced key phrase as a result of mix-ups.",

And given that you've just shared this method on a public forum, that's no longer the case. Nope, still a case, because  firstly , your may construct whatever pattern you want, secondly, you may apply hashing as many times as you want and finally SHA256 is not the only hashing function with irreversible feature. You may even construct your own function which is not known to anybody. You have plenty of choices in fact.    The point to use this technique is easy remembering message for digesting and, at the same time, to have unbreakable password in outcome.",
