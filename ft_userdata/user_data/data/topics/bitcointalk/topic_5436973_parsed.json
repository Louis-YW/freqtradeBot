Nothing required beyond that.If it can see it it will add it, if it can't it will not. If it goes offline it will mark it as such.At least that's the way it used to work, have not used 1209 in a while.-Dave",

Remember, running an Electrum server, isn't the same as running a Bitcoin node, because the latter connects with already existent nodes (which means you're been already advertised), while the former is exclusively connected with your Bitcoin node. Not with a peer-to-peer network.Alternatively with 1209k, you can create a pull request in the Electrum repository. You don't have anything to lose if you try.",
