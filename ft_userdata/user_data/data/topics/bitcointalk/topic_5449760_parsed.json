  "content": "With a total network hashrate of 2.69 PH/s (MPS erroneously says 2.92 PH/s due to false data) and a current price of $13 on SafeTrade per token, Iron Fish pays miners $1.39 per 10 GH/s. A 3080 achieves 17.58 GH/s so this results in $2.44 in revenue a day. For reference, a 3080 mining Iron Fish uses approximately 150 watts.  At $0.1/kWh this leads to a power cost of $0.36 for a total profit of $2.08.ZIL Dual Mining will add on $0.1541 but will also reduce your IRON income by 2 minutes resulting in a total profit of $2.15 per 3080.",
