You're right And since they can't beat Bitcoin, they have now decided to fall back to Bitcoin and join the winning train.Most government officials posses alot of Bitcoin secretly and there are more news of country's adoption to Bitcoin in recent times which is a positive prove of the the acceptance of Bitcoin.Bitcoin despite struggling to be a global legal tender, there are so many other businesses who also accept Bitcoin and other cryptos as a means of payment.So you're right and the situation with government and Bitcoin can also be associated with tye saying that if you can't beat them, join them.",

That's what many countries have been doing as of late. The legality of BTC as a country's legal tender remains negative BUT transactions over centralized exchanges and other platforms offering crypto custodial services are highly regulated and are subjected to taxes.",

The government knows the truth but I don't know why they don't really want to join bitcoin, maybe it's because they don't have control over bitcoin that's why they are against it, they want a currency that they can control but they can't control bitcoin. The only thing I know is that with time the government won't have choice than to accept bitcoin, they have done different things just to kill bitcoin but all are always in vain, so they will accept bitcoin but it might take time before they will accept it.",

The government doesn't really need to stop Bitcoin; in our technological world today, we've got a Grand rule, which is: you can't destroy what you cannot create. Ethical hackers are tryna bypass 'em limits but it's somewhat hard and almost impossible.The government isn't in control of Bitcoin. AFAIK,since BTC ain't a \"medium of exchange\", alot of Bitcoin's transaction - most especially in p2p - will have a user paid in FIAT, cash, bucks etc....this invariably means that this two are working in concordance, until whenever. For now, Bitcoin serves as a store of value which, I guess is ONE of the reasons for it's volatility.Sandra ðŸ§‘",

I don't think the government are directly buying Bitcoin although they hold a very large amounts in seized assets (Bitcoin and probably other cryptocurrency). QuoteBut sometimes the government is able to get it back. Last week, the United States seized $500,000 in cryptocurrency from alleged North Korean hackers who got that money by extorting American medical organizations. Thatâ€™s just a drop in the bucket considering the grand total: the IRS alone seized $3.5 billion in cryptocurrency in 2021. Source: https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/07/26/1056447/how-governments-seize-millions-in-cryptocurrency/amp/ We're yet to get to that stage when the government will be scared of Bitcoin to the extend that they'll start trying to buy out the Bitcoin in existence. Now there are still some doubts by the government that Bitcoin can achieve what it claims to be targeting which is the total decentralized of finances.",
