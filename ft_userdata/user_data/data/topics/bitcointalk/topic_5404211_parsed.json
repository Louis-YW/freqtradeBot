If you are over experienced then why have you asked here? You aren't appreciating negative comments means something went wrong. Are you asking a question or are you promoting your scam site? If you aren't ready to hear community opinion and want to invest big then go, who is preventing you? I am pretty sure you are promoting this site in the forum. Just noticed from your post history that you have shared this link on multiple threads.",

I don't need to dip my fingers into a boiling water to know it'll hurt me. You can't guarantee % of profit on this, trading is already unstable as it is.

You wanted to hear opinions and you got. If you don't like it, that's your problem. I shouldn't try every shady website with my money to tell that's scam.If yoy hear only positive reviews from people, why you're asking here? Go on and invest. But when it comes to investments, if something sounds to good to be true, better don't even try it. For me it's seems that you come here just to promote your business in such way.",

I also check it with similarweb and most of the website traffic is from Russian. I do some deep scanning and research the website itself is secured and private but this website is hosted on Abelohost with Netherlands IP. The owner of the website seems Russian or living in the Netherlands. Since it looks like an investment site and the website info or owners info are in private then there is a big possibility that this website is scam 100%.",

Thanks and goodbyePeople here are much experience about many scam attempts that's why they share their own thoughts about the website ask by OP and obviously there foot tracks with other scam site are the same. They make people believe that they are legitimate by paying the interest of their investment so that they will be urge to put more money or even invite their friends or other people nearby and the same with other once they accumulate huge funds they turn scam common repetitive actions by many scams platform use before also even now it still exist.",
