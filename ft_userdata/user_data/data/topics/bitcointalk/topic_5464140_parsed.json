In recent time, a lot have been found to note nothing than just that and you can't as well say its practices that defines Africa. I think some other parts of the world had something similar and they still aren't defined by them.Africans have adapted, have evolved to learn that, there isn't much in a chair except the Kings throne.Counting meat you say... I think the only reason a patent would do that back theÂ  was to ensure the child don't go seeking the pot for some meat protein. One means to deter the child from stealing from her pot.Be it as it may, some of these practices shaped lives for better.",

Let me take Nigeria as an example, the Igbos don't really bow like the Yorubas when greeting. Even you hardly see the young ones standing up for the elders to sit in an occasion.
