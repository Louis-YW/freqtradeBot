A good instance of this is the bitcoin proof of work (PoW). What did some people said about it? They said bitcoin mining should be banned. Bitcoin miner are working more to the side of using clean energy to mine bitcoin, like waste gasses of the by-product in crude oil refineries and the use of others like hydroelectric power generation and solar energy. After the Ethereum merge from PoW to PoS, some organizations wanted bitcoin to change to PoS too, but that is never going to happen for now. Instead of people to focus more on how the world can stay away from the use of fossil fuels to generate energy, which are releasing high amount of carbon, all they know is to focus on bitcoin PoW. Is bitcoin PoW the problem? No. Most problem are the countries that have no other alternatives than to use fossil fuels to produce energy. When crypto mining was banned in China, GPU price dropped significantly. Recently after Ethereum merge, the price of GPU has fallen again, but to its lowest in history.GPU prices in China drop to their lowest levels in history after the ethereum mergeIf no electricity is produced, no labour in electricity sector. The more electricity that is produced, more labour, more employment. Companies that are manufacturing GPU, ASIC and other miners are employing workers. It means more employment.PoW has resulted to increase in employment, but people do not want to understand than saying it is deteriorating the environment. But the deterioratiion caused by PoW is far less than the one caused by other activities like gold and other mineral mining, other industrial activities and many others that is leading to global warming.",

Bitcoin's mining hashrate is doing really well despite markets being quite bearish. It's likely that a lot of miners (especially with cheap rates on electricity) will have moved to bitcoin and probably a good suggestion or reason the hashrate has increased since the market has been bearish.Saying ASIC development lead to employment is a bit like saying it lead to the destruction of the environment - it's a bit wrong as a lot of that is automatic. The logical option for a lot of cities is to use fossil fuels, it wasn't in the past when production could be supported via renewables in some cases (like in factories). Though I'm pretty sure there's more dragging heals since countries have planned to move to renewables.",

Imagine the cost to build them over there and getting the GPU there with additional custom duties and shit. Let’s assume they have reached their BEP, but what about the profits? Or let’s assume some of them might have reached to profits too but what about the hardwares now? Just sell them into market where nobody wants it since ETH isn’t mineable anymore? This is really hard patch for these miners. It’s not easy to switch between ETH to BTC mining. They will need entirely new machine for that.

UK plug sockets are able to handle up to 3000W (electric kettles use about that much). But yes it will have moved some miners with GPUs to other things - obviously there's no chance you'd want an Antminer in a studio flat, I noticed Bybit had an offer on GPU mining software they claim to be good - this was via email so I don't have a reference link - (I'd guess nicehash does too but I'm not sure if there's any additional competition there).

I think the pricing of GPUs has already been manipulated quite a bit due to a lack of competition (with nearly all coming from AMD and Nvidia).

I think GPUs are still required in data mining though (and things like password cracking/forensics) so I think there'll still be a big market for them - ethereum mining also seemed to force them to become more cross compatible too (so gpus could be used on linux) which might give them an additional market to exploit still.I don't quite know whether pillages will be done as much as finding ways to encorporate a GPU into a system if it means keeping the costs down (especially if something a gpu has can be used by multiple parts of a system (like power controllers). There might be driverless vehicles and other innovations soon that may be buying up gpus now to be used in their future systems",
