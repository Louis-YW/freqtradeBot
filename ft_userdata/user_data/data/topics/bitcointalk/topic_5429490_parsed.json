We can always negotiate the price, Let me know in the comments.Do the Terms of service of that webpage even allow people to sell/exchange or share accounts?Is there any warranty you won't have any way to access by e-mail/phone/security key recuperation after the fulfilling of the purchase? Are you willing to take the cost of the escrow yourself instead whoever decides to buy this account from you?Also, I am not completely sure but this thread may belong to the Marketplace instead being here.",

(Still a new platform)I cannot access the account, as long as u change the email and you enable 2 factor for even more security, there's no way I can access it then.I'm not familiar on how much the escrow costs but sure, it would come out of the money that you or someone else pays with. so 1.5 - escrow cost.",

I've seen many people(usually, scammers and people who know what they are selling are BS) claim that they got an offer after being called out by someone. I wouldn't be surprised if you say that the account is already sold. anyway, good luck to you.",

I don't want to disappoint the OP but I am sure no one is going to buy a username if Adin is desperate for that username simply kick.com will remove your account and give it to him.",

Who knows, maybe he did get offered $500 (I doubt it but maybe), but if someone did make that offer then they just wasted $500 IMO.Quote from: Mahirap on December 17, 2022, 05:29:22 PMQuote from: yahoo62278 on December 17, 2022, 03:31:15 AMWhy would someone want that username?

Yes, there are a billion ways to have a certain name. There's no reason for anyone to get bent out of shape if a name without numbers or special characters isn't available.",
