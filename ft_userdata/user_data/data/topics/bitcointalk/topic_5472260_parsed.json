Like , the purchase of cosmetic products of my company being available only with certain alt coin. You can do anything you want. The problem is making the business be stable and get loyal base of customers who are paying only by a certain coin. That is not a good move. The best thing to do is to accept cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin but to not make it exclusive as there are still many people who are not into cryptos and there are those who are not so willing to buy things online using their portfolio because they are viewing and deciding they are investments and must not disturbed.",

However, if OP uses the payment option via Bitcoin, and if this news goes viral, this could be good as free marketing media.Emhhh but... If I had a business, first of all I would not touch or use shitcoins other than BTC for payments or anything else. The OP should understand the basics, until now Bitcoin has not been widely used as a means of payment throughout the world, why did the OP choose a shitcoin that will not necessarily survive when the long bearish season arrives? Many shitcoins claim to be capable and will overtake Bitcoin, in fact, after only a few weeks or months, these shitcoins are already dead. Lol",

If he is associated with cryptocurrency, is Bitcoin payment accepted or other cryptocurrency like ETH, BNB, and others? This is the usual thing that happens when they touch Bitcoin in their traditional businesses, like the Honda car company did.I hope most of your customers are aware of bitcoin and cryptocurrency and, at the same time, have a good view of bitcoin or cryptocurrency. And if they don't have an idea, I guess they will have an interest, and when that happens, show them the guidelines that they should follow, as if you were giving them an instruction procedure.",

Male cosmetics are also available in the market and OP would be selling both as most cosmetics website do. It is better that OP provide multiple payment option. Like fiat and known altcoins, the more options are available the more convenient it becomes for a buyer. I won't suggest restricting the customer to only use crypto for purchase of any product.",

Like , the purchase of cosmetic products of my company being available only with certain alt coin. I have seen many companies did this but many of them failed. It's because many people chooses to use those coins that are already established and they don't want to take risk buying something with their 'only' coin. They prefer to use fiat over their own coin on it thus, the customers will just avoid that brand. It's not going to work because those that I have seen were established but little to no success. So, for the smaller and unknown brands, you'll have hard time unless you work hard with a bit of luck is with you, you'll succeed.",

Like , the purchase of cosmetic products of my company being available only with certain alt coin. The idea looks great, but you might not completely get the kind of sales that you desire. You need to start up a shop that will help you make a profit, and at the same time, you want to promote crypto using that shop. That's understandable, but do you know that it's not just everyone that will like a product in your shop that will be a crypto user? The majority of people will like to pay with their fiat. So I will advise that if you want to make a shop like that, add both your desired altcons available as methods of payment and also allow the use of your local currency for purchase. That way, you can be rest assured that your business won't fail even before you start it up. If the business has now gained some value and constant customers, then you can evaluate between those monthly sales and check which method was mostly used to purchase products from your shop. From there,  you can know the next step to take.",

It's difficult to market anything in the crypto field, especially with the scams and hacks lurking in the shadows. If you are aiming for selling your cosmetics by means of old cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins then I don't think there will be much of a problem. But if you are trying to create your own altcoin then it adds a workload. A team to manage it, investors, maintenance, developers, and more. It's not like it can be done with just the flick of your finger. Then, you will have to market it and try your best to make it attractive to buyers.",

It will depend on the rank of alt coin, the usage of the alt coin. If you want to use only a specific alt coin, that will be a problem for your customers. If you allow multiple coins, that might be a good choice. But let's say you offered them your products that can be bought with Elon coin only at this moment, surely customers won't buy elon coin just to buy your product unless it's too important.
