With that News we have seen some pull back in price and hope it will again rise upto 10$. Fundamentally Near is very strong and we can say that it will be best then Solona in long term.",

Like when someone got listed on coinbase should expect a pump isnt it? People got excited for different reason like coinbase users now can use their account to purchase near which probably some are wishing aside from major exchanges. Its not just a listing, but an achievement for near protocol, so I dont think thats a funny statement.",
