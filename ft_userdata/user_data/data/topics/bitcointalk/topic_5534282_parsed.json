But in the case of this popular streamer with nearly 4 million followers, reports say she publicly revealed that she owned Bitcoin.I pulled this from an article while trying to figure out why she became a target for robbers.QuoteSiragusa has posted information about Bitcoin previously on social media, including information about her assets. So moral of the story is, never gave idea people that you are holding bitcoins as that would put you in danger, unless you are a person with a lot of bodyguards, but if you are just an ordinary person, its better to be safe than sorry. read the full story here.

Online you are faced with a lot of security threats ranging from hacks to scams and even phishing. Hence storing offline is a better option however it still has its own disadvantages attached too.Coins stored offline on probably a paper wallet or a hardware wallet are not 100% safe from burglary and theft and this is the major reason why it is important to keep your coins offline and private. It's difficult for you to get targeted when there is no intel on you.",

The person in question I don't know what she was thinking to display such online on a social account where she has a lot of fans and enemies; she was lucky she didn't get harmed, and how the story is speculated, some said she and her husband were able to fire a gun on one of the robbers before they escaped.",

Any person who decides to show off wealth over there is trying to put his life in danger because not everyone on social media has a good heart. Some have bad intentions, looking for who they will scam, kill, and steal from.People should be mindful of how they disclose their wealth or things about them on social media because that place is not as friendly and welcoming as thought by some people.I feel bad each time I hear people talk about their accumulated wealth on social media because it feels like they don't know the kind of dangers they are inviting into their lives.",

Such utterances directly or indirectly attracts both physical attacks and attacks from hackers who'll what to steal from you. As crypto enthusiasts, it's very important to be absolutely conscious of the information you let out so it doesn't negatively hit back at you.
