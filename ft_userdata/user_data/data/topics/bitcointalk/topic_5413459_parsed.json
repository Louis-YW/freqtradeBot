  "content": "Did anyone saw new bitcoin explorer claiming they are using homomorphic encryption that guarantee privacy for Bitcoin addresses you check on their website?This is different from all other blockchain explorers that are connecting address you enter with your IP address and they can potentially store (and sell) that information indefinitely.They have code released on github, they released a paper explaining how everything works, and they plan having some partnership with ledger wallet in future.I tried testing with few addresses and it's working but pages can be opened slower than using regular explorers, and less information about transactions is shown.Website is working and opening pages just fine even in Tor browser.Website: https://btc.usespiral.com/Github: https://github.com/menonsamir/spiral-rs",

      "body": "Yes, i have tried it earlier when it pops as shared on electrum twitter handle.I don't like it overall aside from its privacy-related features. It's slow as you said, there is no clickable link for seeing transaction id, shareable link for txid and address and other features that can be seen in other blockchain explorers, it just shows recent transaction at least in mobile browsers, didn't check in desktop yet.Although it still new and there are still rooms for improvement and features to be added. But hopefully it will be supported by the majority by using it.",

      "body": "Seems to work, but definitely not as detailed compared to the top explorers. Also, it seems like it scrapes the blockchain every like 5-10 mins or longer. That's going to suck a bit if you're going to check for new transactions.Cool project though, I'll definitely stick to Blockstream.info + Tor for now.",

But after they add more feature, i'll consider this website seriously.Sure, but if you are not self-hosting btc node and just using Tor, I think that SpiralBTC is better option for privacy.",
