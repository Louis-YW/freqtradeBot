Unix-time is a system for describing moments in time, adopted in Unix operating systems.For example, in a game, you are given a Unix-time number: 1,000,000,000, and the date corresponding to this number is September 9, 2001 - you do not know.Your task is to guess, given the Unix-time number, what season it was (Winter, Spring, Summer or Autumn).So the correct answer to the question \"What was the time of the year when Unix time corresponded to the number 1,000,000,000\" is Autumn.Let's play : @UnixSeasonbot",

Earn game bonuses by inviting friends to the game, play, win. The only inconvenience - if the bonuses run out - you need to view the advertising message to get the bonus, and you can continue playing. Game statistics are kept.",

Your preference for other game kinds suggests that you aren't finding the excitement you're searching for in Telegram gambling games. The \"telegram bot game\" may still be enjoyed by many individuals for a variety of factors, such as practicality, ease of use, or a distinct social component. at the end, whether a person chooses to play games on Telegram or at conventional casinos will rely on their personal interests and what they find entertaining.Additionally, I dislike Telegram games because they are uninteresting to me and have a plain background. Crypto casinos are my preferred type of gambling.",

Regarding game, it seems bland, you can keep guessing same answer and you will eventually win, I won thus, however I have no idea how to proceed with bonus [1] !? Also, I dislike how it clears previous games. [1] https://www.talkimg.com/image/GWwvd",

Most of us have Telegram but we won't entertain anyone unknown on that platform or participate in anything that is free. I think OP should take his platform on a self hosted website and then come up with an ANN page, it would certainly encourage forum members to indulge in his platform otherwise it would remain dormant for a long time.",

I am not sure if I would be willing to spend a lot of time on this because what makes this different than opening a gambling app on my smartphone and playing with it? Why would I start playing a game inside a chat app or document-sharing app that I am mostly using for friends' chat or business purposes? I understand that Telegram has given a wider range of development and open spaces for such programming and bots, but sometimes I just feel like it ain't worth it mate. Obviously, as a hobby and small revenue model, it will be your dream project. I would go further and motivate you to publish it to a wide range of gamblers. Good luck.",

OP posted it in a specified industry, therefore, it won't be surprising that not all people would be interested into it. If it is just the gme itself, then no doubt that's entertaining but the reason why most of the gamblers are gambling is simply because of money. Yes, bonuses are a good thing but a typical gambler will be needing more than that. This is not to generalize but as we all know, things do run in such reasoning. What I am looking forward is for gambling platforms to adopt such kind of games which is a more tricky. Problem is leaks with the winning outcome or nswer given that the result is centralized to the provider itself unlike with other gambling games.",

So far, this is not yet. Try the free version for now - if you like it, we will make a paid replenishment of the player's account and a fee for each of your winnings. Discuss the game, ask questions, and over time we will try to make an interesting game.",
