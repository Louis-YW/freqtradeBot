  "content": "I know that many users don't like receiving PM. I understand and you are within your rights.Personally, I don't mind being PM'd because I know it's a way for people to reach out to me. And if someone abuses it, I can take action in that case.The only thing that bothers me is that the MP's title is just \"(No subject)\". I know this is what appears by default, but it can be changed. Normally this field serves to define the title of the message - three or four words that identify the objective of the PM.Therefore, I ask that when you send a PM, write something in the subject of the PM and not just leave the \"(No subject)\". This helps a lot in managing PMs.I believe that most people will not read this information, but here's a note. Maybe other users \"suffer\" from the same \"problem\".Hugs to everyone, fellow Bitcoiners and Bitcointalkers!",

Not sure why this is happening, but it might be due to mobile platforms and the popularity of instant messaging among younger generations. Since my early days of using digital communication, I have been taught that the subject line is just as important as the message itself. However, it appears that younger generations have disregarded this practice, and \"(No subject)\" seems to be gaining popularity as a trend. This is, of course, just my personal observation.",

Changing the entire PM involves deeply tweaking the forum system. And I think that's unlikely to happen.Therefore, when asking, I was asking for something that I know would be easier to deal with: readjusting the way in which the PM's title appears.Speaking of which...Quote from: LoyceMobile on September 15, 2023, 09:04:15 PMGood one, I dislike receiving this too.You can't create a topic without entering a title. PMs should reject the default too. Patch time?I believe that if the title field changes from a new PM to being blank by default, without the term \"(no subject)\", the problem will soon be resolved.Because, if I remember correctly, how the SMF system works, all it takes is for the field to be blank to be asked to fill it in, as happens when creating topics.Therefore, this issue will be quickly resolved if this default text is removed.Now, if it was placed there... I believe it was for a valid reason.",

I agree with OP here. I would like to see a subject in all my PMs as well. It literally takes a few seconds to write one. It can get especially frustrating if you are talking to the same person on different subjects, and at one point in the future you have to go back to check something. Imagine dozens of PMs without a title where you have to search for that exact message that contains the information you need. I would rather that I can figure out what we talked about based on the title of the PMs. But that also means that the original PM sender has to be professional enough to write a correct subject and not something like 'Hi' or 'Yo'.

(I've sent a patch to theymos.

But if it is informal, for example I am writing to a friend on this forum, I may decide not to include a title.If you are writing an official letter, you can write it the way you want.

That option is left also on this forum. Even on emails, you can send a message without the title, just like if you write a letter to someone on a paper. If you do not see the title, you may like and not read it than to make a suggestion about how PM supposed not to be.Or if it can be in a way that someone can option for it on their profile settings, that all messages that should be received should have a title, it would be better like that. But the default should be as it is now.This is just my suggestion. Messages can have a title or not. If the suggestion should be added, it should be optioned for.",

I am not questioning the content of the message, nor am I looking at the sender. I'm just analyzing the title, which is the indexing element, which if they are all the same, ceases to exist.Let's assume you are having a conversation with 3 friends here on the forum. They all sent the message with \"(no subject)\". When you look at the message list, from the title you don't know who is who. You need to look at the user's name and you still have to \"get\" the message you want to reread.This is a habit on my part, maybe that's it, but every message you send (here or elsewhere) I like to put a title on.
