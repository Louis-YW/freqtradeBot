My one reason to this insecurity mata na like you have already stated say na corruption and na the whole truth be that because is core chain to so many issues wey dey happen for this country. Unemployment is another branch of this insecurity mata and this also caused by the corruptive mind of our leaders wey don refuse to spread the rate of employment around this our country and this has lead many people especially the youths to go into different illegal things and business as a means of survival. Person wey no get work or the system dey condition  am go also strive for a way to survive na and in so doing actually condition himself to commit crimes such arm robbery or kidnapping to get money for his survival so nigerian leaders na the real cause of the insecurities in the country. But brother i still we can grow out of this situation and become better its only a matter of time because with time all her deep wounds will eventually heal up with the right medicine.",

This is because many heartless people are frequently sponsored by those in power to intimidate their other opponents just to continue get their selfishness, and there is also a lack of government effort to meet the basic needs of is citizens, such as lack of creating job opportunities  in the nation and simplifying the educational process for citizens. Most of the people involved in the book-haram controversy today are uneducated and have been brainwashed by their religious authorities. In my opinion, our country's security issues can only be solved by the military power which I think it will hard for military to get chance to rule again.",

Security concerns each and every single individual in a country. Security is everyone's business. If you fail to take note of possible security threat and fail to report to the nearest security agency close to you then you are bound to face security risks. We should not wait for the security forces or government to do investigation before they swing into actions we should do well to report so as to be on the safe side. Atleast doing this would help mitigate potential risk involved and also, Keep security agency on the watch and alert at any time to swift actions.Quote from: Obari on December 27, 2022, 06:08:53 PM~what will you suggest as the way forward to combating insecurity in the country?There is a saying that says \" an idle mind is the devil's workshop\" I remember a one time minister of the federation saying that \"human capacity development is the answer to curb insecurity and restiveness in the society\". Going by that,  one would say that employment and empowerment could aid in curbing security issues in the society. This is so because when the people are gainfully employed  in legal activities which fetches them reasonable amount of money through salaries, income etc, they would not be bothered causing problems in the society.  My conclusion is that the government should look into human capacity development which will help individuals in the society and keeping them busy with a means of getting income, their energy and intellect would be meaningfully used for good productivity",

However I feel with that the security apparatus of the country is already overwhelmed. First there is already a low level of confidence by the public on the security agencies. Second the security apparatus of the nation is greatly under armed. Third we have to do deal with those sympathizers or those who have hijacked the insecurity the country is facing for business gains.The solution to this is that everyone should be his own security. Arm yourself and your family. Take proper security measures and be security conscious at all times.",

Nigeria is a large country, and bringing its people together in peace and unity is not an easy task. We have numerous languages, cultures, and beliefs that do and react differently to things. I believe this is one of the reasons the Nigerian government is finding it difficult to deal with insecurity, but they are doing their best and I applaud their efforts.
