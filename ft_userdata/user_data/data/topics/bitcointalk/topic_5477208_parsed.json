  "content": "We can easily see how the media is influenced by big business. How can we see it? By the many people who have been de-platformed, and by the numbers of articles and videos being censored.What could the media do if they were honest, but simply didn't like the opinion of somebody? They could simply set up one or more sections in their systems, where they could place what they considered to be junk news or fake news.They could even make rating system algorithms that sorted items into a bunch of categories, depending on how fake or junk they thought it was. Nobody would have to be censored or de-platformed.So, we can see from this that most of the major media companies don't fairly control the material they show.",

If the media had a place for low ranked news it won't profit them so they have to put fake news at the top to bring attention to them. Even the advertisers don't have or use the product they advertise but because it has to make money to keep it running they advertise the fake things and get paid.",

Because if its news that may damage the rep of these businesses which are their highest paying patrons, you'd find that either they do not air it or they find a way to \"trim\" it so they (the big guys) look good. I mean, you don't want to lose a well paying patron simply because you want to shed some truth. As long as everyone has a price, it becomes not much of a challenge to wave a few bucks and have the media dancing to their tunes.  The bitter part is, these guys don't see any wrong in it, for all they know it's just part of business and it is called compromise or smart thinking.",

Because they are funded by those billionaires who want to shift the minds of the people into buying their products they are also profiting from these media and they are scratching their backs with each other. Thankfully, we have social media right now though they are not 100% accurate, we have some idea of what other countries are suffering unlike before we were totally unaware about it. Hopefully, they won't cut this source for us because it's really hard to rely on media now that we all know what they are really all about.",

Reporters no longer reveal essential information to the public; they work to hide it. Journalists act as censors on behalf of entrenched power. They have contempt for the public. They hate the truth. Democracy can't function in a society like this. Voters can't know what they're voting for. People do understand they're being manipulated, and they resent it. The population becomes angry and paranoid. Things fall apart.

It is not a secret big corporated media usually have some ulterior motives because their are backed by companies which may even have nothing to do with the business of information and facing the public, there is a \"secret\" which is keep in the plain sight of all of us and specially those who do not blindly follow whatever they say on the Television, regardless the corporate media is either pro right or pro left wing. That is one of the reasons I am pretty much in favor of independent media, small journalist who do not take sponsorships from big companies but rather finance their small network thanks to the direct support of the viewers and small advertisers. One must wonder how much influence those big corporations may have over the filtering of content which a channel is supposed to broadcast or not. Would a news channel sponsored by a chocolate company easily or eagerly report on the new-found negatives effects of chocolate over people's health? What about news channels which are directly supported and sponsored by big oil companies? Will they be openly talk about the negative consequences on the abuse of fossil fuels instead moving to a more carbon neutral society? I doubt it and that is what one can see sometimes when turning on the Television or watching YouTube channels which talk about politics and economics.",

The media is controlled by Politics and that is why people cannot just make comments, the freedom of the Media is controlled by the state government. The State Government tells the media what to do. I have seen a lot of arrests by the government law enforcement agencies to those who speak against the government and everything the media presenters do is for the favour of the government. And any Media speaks against the government will automatically be stopped from operation. The license will be withdrawn from them. So everyone sing the praise to the government. The media is one the key supporter of the government. And anything come from the media is the final. And the people are to obey. But I still believe the last hope of the poor man is revolution.",

It's ok for these medias to come down hard on small companies and individuals, they'll do there jobs to the fullest, to gain trust of the public.

This influence can impact the news agenda & overall media narratives.Thank you for particularly mentioning the mainstream media on this thread. The mainstream media because of its huge financial investment, many people especially individuals cannot afford the mainstream media thereby giving way for the government and top political institutions to control the mainstream media. Mainstream media such as the TV stations, Radio and Newspaper publications are heavily controlled by governments and most information that come from those platforms are filtered and are delivered in a tone or voice that will suite the political spectrum of that moment.This is unlike the social media where everyone have the opportunity to ear a view about incidents, events or scenarios. In social media, you have little or no influence around public opinions since every person out there can make a comment or two about issues. What government and politicians have also try to do is to buy the influencers in those platforms and use them as their promotional tools, however, people can still revolt them or say in contrary to what ever information they put out to the public.",

Yep, there is influence from the government behind it and also private factors that directly affect the entire government system.Nowadays, the development of technology makes connecting information easy and we can really access any source of information without really worrying about censorship issues. I also know some businesses that cheat by bribing major media channels to speak well of them, it comes with the consequence that those media can direct many different things in life. The truth can be distorted, changed,... but it cannot be killed and the problem will be exposed.

They have allowed politics to penetrate the cruz of their publication, although politicians are the biggest news in the media even more than business and this is the problem, money buying the media space.There is now a dangerous part to this influence and that is that politicians now see media outlet as business that they should venture into to push their image more. I wonder if a politician owns a media outfit then the editor would dare publish negative news about their director or owner who is a politician. In fact such media outfit that is own by a politician becomes an added opposition political party, they would hardly publish a good news on their opponents even if they have done well. So it is now a business of witchunt for another politicians. This has taken away the taste of objectivity away from the salt in the media space. News are not really worth it because of the biase in there, more politicians have radio stations and television houses more than business people.",

The question is, is there now more influence over media than there was before? I would argue there isn't. Today we have the internet and effectively ten thousand news channels, whereas 30 years ago we had about three. People quickly forget what life was like before the Internet.When people say, \"de-platformed\", they usually mean, \"moved from a platform with 100 million daily viewers to a platform with only 20 million daily viewers\". Same with \"censored\" media: articles and videos that top the US readership charts are not \"censored\" regardless of any bellyaching you might hear from people who want to increase their ratings through performant victimhood.",
