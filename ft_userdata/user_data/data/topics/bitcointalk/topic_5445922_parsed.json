Unfortunately, that's not something that anyone can say for sure. You said you verified the signatures, which means that the newest update was signed by the right person or people. What was signed is something completely different though.Generally, there shouldn't be a reason to worry. Anti viruses have in the past tagged software wallets as malware-infected. We have all read about it. Even Electrum and Bitcoin Core has been tagged as such.",

Is anyone else having this issue? There are some antivirus software that are not compatible with some other softwares. If the antivirus is in the system and and you are installing another software or proggramme, the antivirus will detect the software as a virus and quarantine some the files in the software and delete some which will make the software not to work well. The antivirus that causes such problem in most time is Avast Antivirus and Norton Antivirus. Though I am using the mobile version of the Sparrow Wallet and it is doing well and you can connect bitcoin core to the wallet when you click on UTXOs and start your transaction.",
