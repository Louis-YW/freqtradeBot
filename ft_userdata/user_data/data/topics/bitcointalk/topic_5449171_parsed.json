Actually, he is providing a service where you can buy or sell crypto and in return you will get or pay the fiat money in /from your Cash app account or other payment providers listed in the OP.For doing these transactions and providing this service, OP is charging 20$ monthly fee. This is additional fee which you will be paying other than the usual cryptocurrencies market prices. He never mentioned in the post if he will offer you crypto at the rates lower than the market value.The additional risk by using this service is that you never know the source of the fiat money and it can get your cash app and other accounts banned for suspicious activity.",
