The label is printed on the neck of the shirt in grey print that is very hard to read.From what I remember, it was sold \"new without tags\", but yes agree does appear worn.. maybe by one of the coaches/sideline people.If someone is savvy with Worthpoint.com, can maybe dig it up, as ebay doesn't keep records that long.....The patch is new and it appears you can still buy them from at least 2x sites:https://www.theemblemsource.com/products/bitcoin-st-petersburg-bowl-patch?variant=29199131181133https://patchcollection.com/products/bitcoin-st-petersburg-bowl-game-jersey-patch-ucf-vs-nc-state-2014Figured this was a fun addition to the auction that SatsLife is running for his bowl coin here:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5416661.0Here is a close up of the label of the shirt:",
