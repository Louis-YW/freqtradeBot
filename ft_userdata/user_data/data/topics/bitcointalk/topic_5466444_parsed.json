Our supply of 21,000,000 BTCe tokens mirrors Bitcoin's scarcity, and halving events trigger as half of the remaining tokens are mined.Key Highlights:Halvings: In the spirit of Bitcoin, BTCe implements halvings. Whenever half of the remaining tokens have been mined, a halving event occurs. This ensures a controlled and measured token distribution over time.SHA3 Proof of Work: BTCe harnesses the SHA3 Proof of Work algorithm, guaranteeing robust security and decentralization through its mining process.Passive Income and Active Participation: BTC ERC20 presents a distinctive opportunity that bridges passive income and active engagement. Holders can earn through staking, contributing to network security, while miners can actively participate in the mining of BTCe tokens.BTCe is more than just a cryptocurrency; it's a tribute to the core principles that have driven the success of Bitcoin.
