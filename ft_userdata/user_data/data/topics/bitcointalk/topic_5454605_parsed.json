I don't think that anyone is going to fall into the trap because if a coin is hosted on a free domain that's given by google then why would an investor think to invest money in such coin?If you really think that you have a legit project and you can offer good services then you should host the site on a paid domain rather than relying on a free domain name. At least with a good domain name people still give a look to a project, but not the one with a free domain name.",
