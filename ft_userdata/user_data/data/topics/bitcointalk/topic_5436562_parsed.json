  "content": "In my early stage of crypto investment I was once a victim of exit liquidity and right now the numbers of crypto influencers on Youtube is growing in numbers and merely seeing this it brings back some bad memories. My MistakeI spent few hours per day watching influencers videos on youtube, and u always think they know better than everyone else, they talk about coins that will bring 10x to 1000x in the next bull run and I listened only to realise that they are doing this to bring in new buyers for their own bag to surge and exit on us. The lesson I learned is all those influencers are pumping their own bags so that people like myself can become an exit liquidity. Always do your own research and don't trust any influencers.The next successful crypto projects are probably never going to be talked about by anyone or get shilled online by anyone, do not rely on influencers to pick tokens and coins, spend your time finding the next good projects with new utilities, do your own research and invest wisely.",

I would tweet and retweet things related to crypto, and in no time in started getting DMs from different projects asking me to tweet or shill about their projects in exchange for some tokens. Good for me, I wasn't having that dishonest mindset and greed, and I would see most of them as useless scam projects and shitcoinsBut the truth is, this is what happens out there. A lot of those so-called influencers are paid a lot of shitcoins in advance, and then they are told to shill so that the price pumps, and they dump their bags. After that, they move onto the next one.",

He has an excellent track record in detecting fraudulent influencers and exchange/defi hacks.IMHO, he is really one of the good guys out there. I mean, there are so many scammers on social media, so it's great that there are at least a few big accounts that are fighting these pricks and stand up for all the scam victims or the people who become exit liquidity after their favorite influencer dumped his bags on them.Even in 2023, crypto is still the wild west.",

Many of them are marketers and  their marketing the project they are paid for.and with that nobody is forcing anybody to invest in the project's but their just try to convince their people so they can buy and that is the advertisement strategy.infact some project even pay some artist to do such a thing, by telling his/her fans to invest in project that it will do like 10x.so we see differences case like before. So it is a normally thing for those YouTube but you have to wise up by doing your own research after you have seen the awareness of project because any project need awareness so that people can get the notification,and some people are just predicting base on their own research, now many crypto members are saying that Bitcoin will dump again because due their analysis and experience they say we not out of bearish period,from there they  have given you the  idea that we not yet out of bearish period, so with this every is left to you to own research and follow what you see.as for me I always see it as awareness.",

By that logic, no scammers who promote scam projects would be guilty even if somebody found proof that they got paid to scam people. Being paid to promote something and being paid to say something/encourage people to buy scam things are different. Quote from: Mahirap on January 24, 2023, 10:40:25 PMSome people also create twitter profiles so that they can take offers from companies and promote them out of greed and they cause losses to many people following them. I think creating a social media account to work as an influencer/marketer is fine, promoting scams itself is not. Sadly it is really difficult to find one who genuinely promotes interesting projects, so many of them want to dump on you instead. I guess it is also silly to expect them not to sell anything especially if they found them earlier than most people. The best thing to do is definitely to never jump on what they said too quickly and do your own research.",

I remember Bitboy Crypto is the one who is doing this the most. I mean years ago, there are coins that he is sharing on his youtube channel and currently, I don't know if he's doing it still because I'm not watching him anymore because of the shilling that he's been done.As for me, watch those crypto influences just because you want to get a bit of knowledge (if there are) and a bit of entertainment, but don't follow what they are saying. Like OP said, doing your own research is still the best thing to do when it comes to investing. Don't listen to these influences because it's like you are giving your money to them by following what they are saying.",
