  "content": "So I'm a big fan of the Plinko game. I like Plinko because:1) It works better than provably fair blackjack for me - in Stake, I had an experience where I lost 6 times in a row. 2) In Plinko, it's much easier to double up little sums and you always have a chance for a big win.I found an algorithm with same chances as most provably fair Plinkos have, so I launched a website to make it convenient to see my luck before playing with actual money. Website adress:BITCOINPLINKO.COMIf someone else want to try, please note that it requires Gmail (so don't use with your real name)!So there are options to change lines, bet size. Each time when your balance below 10, you can replenish it.In one day, I'll add affiliate or sell single link there to pay coder in order to change Google Auth to smth else and add high volatility mode.",

Well, most of casinos do this and not just you OP but would love to try it anyway. Not that fond of the game but I think you have a nice UI there. I suggest to include the links of the Terms and Conditions, About Us, and Responsible Gaming on the homepage rather than using hyperlink to the blog page. Use that footer wisely.",

I experience more than 6 lose streak but I won more than 6 games either. I’m not comparing blackjack to plinko but at least on BJ you have a chance to win 1:2.5 payout for Blackjack card on a 50:50 chance game. You have the abulity to win or lose the game base on your game decision.Quote from: jordanw21 on September 30, 2023, 09:00:08 AM2) In Plinko, it's much easier to double up little sums and you always have a chance for a big win.Nah, it’s still the same in terms of doubling your bet. I believe the best feature of Plinko is the possibility to win huge some of the game.",

      "body": "I like Plinko, it's a good game for wagering a lot in a short period of time, and with a bit of luck with some little profit. But as with any other lucky-based game, it can be really hard to survive some long-losing streaks, so I can't agree that it's easier to double your amount with Plinko. And I don't like simulators, so why would we play Plinko for free? Where is the excitement?",

Not worth the time.OP, you've got a cool domain there. Ever thought about turning it into a real gambling site with functional deposits and withdrawals? You might even consider enabling the Lightning Network to make it attractive for budget-conscious gamblers. Just a thought!",

      "body": "Ah I love this game too. I started with this game on Roobet and also got very addicted after watching YouTube shorts associated with it. One streamer was very crazy with this game and he used to play only Plinko and no other game at all while streaming. He made huge money with it and also was able to hit the jackpot multipliers like 250-500x. Since in the Plinko you have equal distribution on the edges it has two 250x and 500x and there is double chance of hitting the highest multipliers.  That’s what I like the most about this game. The stimulation game is really nice. I think you should really turn this into paid one to make it more competitive experience. You already have the great UI, better turn it into a business venture.",

      "body": "I guess it is pretty good way of just playing some plinko when you want to but some casinos also offer either free play or fun credits to play with. So i guess both work fine.It wont be repeatable in any sense but might be interesting to see how many of the largest multipliers you can hit in like 10k rolls.",

The outlier is what we always want to have the highest multiplier, you know?Maybe you are planning to make it into a casino. Good luck OP!",

You are welcome, that is thoughtful and a good site. So how have you confirmed this above. You boost of being able to see your luck before playing with your money, so how are you sure you will win when you play real money with the casino. How can you be sure your game will not be reset before you cash out, I'm asking if probably your website covers such research. I still believe plinko is lucky game.",

      "body": "Yes, to be honest, Plinko is a promising game, in fact I like it more than playing blackjack or slots, but it all depends on how the gambler feels comfortable playing the game they like, sometimes every gambler has their own views on which game they want to play, usually I play it often. Plinko when he feels bored with the Limbo and Crash games.But I want to try this simulation, unfortunately it requires a Google account, I don't have many Google accounts, I only have one Google account, but maybe I will try it again later if this can be played by anonymous users without having to log in to enter the account and everyone can use it. like a DEMO game and play this simulation very easily without using a google account.

Good luck OP!or turn it into an affiliated review website that specialises in Plinko, they already started comparing Plinko games from three different websites, so turning it into a review website that features Plinko wouldn't be a bad guess.",
