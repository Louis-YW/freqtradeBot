  "content": "What happened::  A scam Ponzi platform that I found by chance in the Bounties (Altcoins) board. It is promoted by a notorious Bounty manager. I found on the CashSkull platform that they offer a guarantee of a quick return on investment to investors and claim that they are the trailblazing and foremost global investment platform ((and their domain has been live for 66 days now)) and that they take advantage of the latest artificial intelligence techniques and investment strategies to achieve swift ROI and risk-free wealth accumulation for their customers. The funny thing is that the platform contains entirely skulls and ghosts as if you opened the gate to hell!!Scammers Profile Link: Bounty Manager: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2522364Reference Link: Bounty Topic: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452315.0 [ Archived ]The Scam Website: https://cashskull.com/ [ Archived ]QuoteRegistrar: Namesilo IANA ID 1479Status: clientTransferProhibitedRegistrant Email: pw-36e6fc56e92c0bf7371e84860663d1fb@privacyguardian.orgCreation Date: March 11, 2023Update Date: March 16, 2023Expiration Date: March 11, 2024Age: 66 daysAdmin Name: Domain AdministratorAdmin Organization: PrivacyGuardian.org llcAdmin Street: 1928 E.

Even if they are bots they can still spread the word about this Ponzi scheme, the operator of this platform have the nerve to post this platform here, and they take the opportunity by using bounty hunters to spread their platform the bounty campaign started 5 days it is good that OP catch them to stop the massive promotion of this platform OP should create a flag for this project to warn people, anyway if you're a wise investor you're not going to fall into something like this.",

Because to me just by reading through the details ails posted by the ops,  one could possibly discover the scam in all of this,  and I am 100% sure that the bounty will end up not paying them.",
