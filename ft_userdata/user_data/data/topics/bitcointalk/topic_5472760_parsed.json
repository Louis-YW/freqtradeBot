After the recovery, they will keep 10% as their fee and send me the rest.It took Bank of America 90 days to inform me that they were unable to recover the funds.I wonder how they are able to recover the funds when Bank of America wasn't able to?",

If not then there can't be any further damage can be done for you.",

If the person made you to invest then probably he is part of the scam website or highly paid to make people fall.",

I do understand but some may just ask for some top up and payment in advance and that's how the scam goes on.So, if you're not paying in advance and you're not paying anything on these services and consider the percentage cut that they'll get, just be aware of such.",

Here are some steps to consider when using a crypto recovery service:Nope.  Scammers love crypto because when properly planned, it is untraceable and irreversible.  If one falls for a crypto scam, they are most likely to be scammed again.  A CRS takes advantage of this market.   They will not do any work for you unless there is a chance for recovery (i.e. you have a password pattern you can give them) and it's large enough for them to bother.   If they manage to recover anything, they will vanish with your coins.If you have an idea what the password could be, go with a service that requires a set fee upfront through a licensed payment processor.   However if you want to remain anonymous while recovering your coins, you probably lose more.  :/",
