  "content": "You would rather waste as much energy as possible on a mining algorithm that was never designed to solve any scientific problem. I would rather find the most important scientific problem and then use a mining algorithm that is designed to not only solve this scientific problem but also has the required cryptographic properties to secure the network. Sure. The mining algorithm may not be 100% efficient at advancing science. Sure. The mining algorithm may eventually expire since the scientific problem has already been solved or because the current methods of solving the scientific problem may not work so well in the future. This lack of efficiency is better than the efficiency at advancing science exhibited by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Using a cryptocurrency with a mining algorithm that is not designed to advance science is incredibly anti-intellectual. This causes people to distrust Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. If you come to me and say I AM A BITCOINER, I will immediately distrust you and regard you as a science hater.I know that this topic has been discussed before, but I am bringing it up again since the cryptocurrency community still needs to learn.I also realize that Bitcoiners have brought up counter arguments for why cryptocurrency mining should not be used to advance science. Some of these counter arguments only apply to some poorly designed mining algorithms. For example, there are many proposals for using cryptocurrency mining for scientific computation for questionable use cases. We should not care about using cryptocurrency mining for computing Cunningham chains. Most mathematicians have not even heard of Cunningham chains and the computation of these Cunningham chains does little for scientific advancement. Other counter arguments make no sense whatsoever because the people making these arguments simply hate scientific advancement. It is hard to understand anything about anything when Bitcoiners are unwilling to look at specific proposals for using cryptocurrency mining for scientific advancement.",

      "body": "un_rank-Thank you for reiterating the obvious. But is that all that Bitcoin mining does? It is easy and it takes very little effort to come up with a mining algorithm that secures the network. It also does not take much effort to analyze the cryptographic security of such a mining algorithm. This is very boring. It is much more difficult to come up with a mining algorithm that both satisfies the properties that mining algorithms should satisfy and also works on some scientific problem. For example, if you want to replace SHA-256 with another cryptographic function, then one will probably need to do new mathematical research to evaluate its cryptographic security.\"That solves the scientific problem of secure, unregulated transactions which works on consensus and discourages bad actors.\"-The bad actors are the Bitcoiners who are not willing to use cryptocurrency mining efficiently in order to secure the network and also solve another unrelated scientific problem. I do not trust people who are willing to waste resources for no reason whatsoever instead of actually putting those resources to the best use as they can.\"Go right ahead. Bitcoin does not limit technological advancements.\"-It is much easier to solve the technical problems than it is to convince very many people in the cryptocurrency sector that we do not need to waste as many resources as possible for no reason whatsoever. It is even more difficult to convince people that the proposed solutions to the technical problems are the correct solutions. Overcoming the problem of human ineptitude is extremely difficult. People would much rather invest in SBF and FTX and whatever chlurmck the media tells them to invest into.",

But you probably think that education is stupid, so telling you that I am educated will probably only make you exceedingly angry.If you think I misunderstand something, you need to give an actual explanation or give a specific reference for the specific thing that I do not understand. Since you have not done this, I cannot take you seriously. Please learn some social communication skills. Please seek professional help so that you learn those social communication skills.\"2. You seem completely unaware what this amount of energy means in the grand scheme of things.\"-Is this an excuse to waste more energy then? Is this also an excuse to waste as many resources as possible? Please seek professional help so that you learn a thing or two about decency.Next time, you should focus on making real arguments so that you do not come across the way that you do.P.S. If you knew anything about economics, you would realize that asking companies to be unprofitable would not work. Just because you do not personally benefit as much as you think you should when companies advertise does not mean that there is any way to make companies not advertise about their products and services. And advertisements do benefit you. Sure, you may think of advertisements as annoying. Most people do. But advertisements educate you about the products and services that are out there. Without this education, you would not be informed about all the different products and services that you can choose from. The next time you have a discussion, you should think before exposing everyone to your word salad.",

Your solar arrays produce power and this power is measured in something like watts or even megawatts. The amount of power is not measured in megawatts per year. Unless you have a solar array factor, you cannot measure the output of this factory in megawatts per year.\"you don’t. so  for all your education you left out major information in your arguments.\"-There you go hating on education again.

I am not going to put irrelevant information because irrelevant information is not relevant.\"our arrays dedicated to mining make 600 megawatts in a year.\"-Megawatt is a unit of power. The amount of power that solar arrays produce is measured in megawatts and not megawatts per year. If you have a solar array factory, then you can say that it produces 600 megawatts of solar arrays per year, but that is different. Please use the correct units.\"About 18000 megawatts for their useful life.\"-This is b***s***. You clearly do not understand anything about units because you are uneducated. You are not even enough of a good person to realize your lack of education. You instead hate my education because you are a bad person. The largest solar array in the world is a 2200 megawatt solar array. Are you saying that your array is larger than the largest in the world?  Do you use multiple arrays to get up to 18000 megawatts?\"The btc rewards were the extra financial boost we need to get then done.\"-This is not relevant since it is clear that you are speaking BS.\"I get that using asics to solve different scientific problems can help people. But asics mining btc can greatly expand the worlds solar arrays especially when you grid tie them.\"-Whether ASICs are powered by solar or by nuclear or coal is not relevant to the fact that the mining algorithms need to be used to solve an important scientific problem.\"A far bigger issue is grid power companies in the world that don’t net meter your solar array. Do some research on that and you will find that many places do not require net meter on solar power.\"-Or you should do research so you know the difference between a Joule and a Watt.\"This is far worse problem than btc mining as it hinders the boost that solar arrays can do for the world wide grid.\"-You are saying that the existence of Problem B means that Problem A is irrelevant.

I hope you know that since Bitcoin has a mining algorithm that was never designed to advance science, Bitcoin has attracted a lot of chlurmcks who know nothing about Bitcoin or Bitcoin mining except for how it consumes too much energy.
