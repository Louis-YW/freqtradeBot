      "body": "Why do such transactions need to be manually entered by a miner? You have up to TX_WEIGHT = 400000 which enables you to set up a transaction up to that size and then keep broadcasting the transactions until you have one input of 15 BTC.I do not know the amount of fees you will pay, but it will definitely not reach 1 Bitcoin. Assuming it does, a miner will not be able to send them all in one transaction, and then the same process will follow.The choice to admit that these coins are not yours will not change the reality of what can be done in mempool.https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/99813a9745fe10a58bedd7a4cb721faf14f907a4/src/policy/policy.h#L24",

I will just claim it.Reality check sometimes no one really cares even if you committed a good action, in the end, it's to their benefit that they get back their money and possibly they will blame you like you stole it. If they lose their keys its their mistake at all, also even if you announce this sure many people will claim those and you don't have any verification that its on them so its your choice tho 15 BTC is 15 BTC even its just a 2 digit BTC once you check the price it can sustain your living for more years.",

I once returned someone's lost wallet and as I walked to my car, I received an SmS from my Bank and when I opened it, it showed that I won a small jackpot on the Lottery that I bought tickets to via the Banking App...Â     Haha, I was thinking outside the box here. Which is a 6th option to not give the reward to the real owners and live a life like nothing happened, so I do not have to ask the authorities where all the funds are coming from. haha. Just kidding. Well, if I come to find a Hard Ware wallet, or by any means, I find access to a wallet containing that much BTC.I will definitely return the amount to the real owners, and if the real owners are not found, then boom, that's a jackpot for me, and I will keep those bitcoins as they are mine and I have earned them with great hard work.Â   I am glad you made that decision. Because in today's world, people tend not to return things even after borrowing them, one who finds lost things will tend to find the real owners and then return that thing to them. Such people are so rare to be found, but we should really not return things out in hope of getting a reward because that will not do any good to us. But what if the person does not recognize us, then would we not tend to return things afterwards?",

      "body": "Well, contacting the morons who own the keys is the first point of action, that is supposing there's a contact information visible enough to my conscience's eyes and anyone who may have been around or bore witness to the find. It is also a point to note, that there's a common phrase that says 'not your keys, not your coins'. Such a find is mine with such saying, but with being humane as the first principle on which the BTC ideal stands, I would do well to make contact while I hold unto the keys till it is down to the options of reinvesting it. Turning to the authority is pointless for me at this point, because quite frankly, anyone with such amount would have done well to avoid the authority or hackers and would track down the coins, not sure if mixers would work at this point too.This is 15btc we talking about, not 1.5btc.",

Of course not your coins cause it's like already stealing if you taken that wallet even when you said the owner leave it open for people to steal it's always wrong. There's no bad thing if you're expecting something in return cause that amount is actually no joke. It might be hard to trace the owner so if you report it to the police or any authority I think it would be useless plus there's a lot of hackers and scammers once they found out your information holding huge amount of BTC. It's like you're carrying the responsibility so a giving you something in return would be appreciated.",
