You suddenly want to focus on making other people successful. How do you expect us to believe you are having 7 years experience, you should have provided so evidence. A newbie account that was created on November 8, with 1 post and 1 activity is trying to give a signal and he is claiming to be having 7 years experience, I smell scam, you should have posted with your main account, and not create a alt account.

OP won't lose anything if he gives you wrong signal, you are the one to lose because you are going to pay $250 for monthly fee and $1500 for life time fee and also at the end you might endup losing the amount you are using to trade, so we all have to be very careful and smart.",

You said that not everything is about the money and that you want to focus on making other people successful, yet you have a premium group in which people have to pay. Interesting Quote from: brianabstact on November 09, 2022, 12:08:46 AMWin rate : 90%Monthly return : 800-1200%Now I am 100% sure that you are full of shit as no trader have that successful trade percentages (at least not in longer period of time), nor the monthly return.",
