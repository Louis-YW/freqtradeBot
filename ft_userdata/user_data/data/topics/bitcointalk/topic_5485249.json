  "content": "Hello everyone, I hope you are well.I came to bring a case that happened in Brazil, an investor wanted to get rid of his bitcoins at the Novadax cryptocurrency brokerage (I've never used it, I can't recommend it, I'm just bringing the news). The fact is that he went to sell 1.7 BTC and generated a market sell order, with the lack of liquidity his orders were executed and consumed the entire order book taking the price to practically zero. He had bitcoins sold at 238 USD.A huge loss just for not paying attention to selling at the price of the day, maybe he wanted to execute the orders quickly, or he didn't know what he was doing.So be warned, if you are going to sell, fill out your order correctly at the price you want to sell, never use the \"market\" price to sell a large amount of bitcoins.",

Am sure this BTC seller will never forget for the rest of his life what happened to his Bitcoin and getting almost zero in the process. One of the many things I learned with crypto is we must be allotting some time to educate ourselves even the very basic one. I know that this is actually a big hindrance for many hence crypto is not for all though it is very much open to all. So sad, indeed!",

If you just want to cash out your bitcoins without getting into the trading details, it's smart to pick an exchange with lots of people trading. Some exchanges let you set your own buy and sell prices but honestly not many folks are likely to go for those prices when selling. It's different when buying like more flexibility there. Many exchanges keep it simple by not letting users mess with the prices which helps avoid some headaches in the process",

Of course, before selling BTC, one should do some research about the most reputable exchanges, and familiarize oneself with the interface of a chosen exchange before placing a big order. In my experience with exchanges, I set the price of the sell order myself, so if it was near the market price, the order was filled very quickly, and if it was way off, it just remained an open order, but there was no way of my coins being sold for a price that I didn't set.

I don't know why the Bitcoiner decided to choose Novadax when there are many other high-profile exchanges. He would have used a small sum to test the exchange If he was not conversant with the operations. Losing such kind of funds during this period can make someone depressed for a long time. People need to know that selling cryptos is a very sensitive transaction because it might be irreversible. Thus it is always important to read and have a proper understanding before engaging in any transaction. If you can't pay attention to details, you might face situations such as the one OP reported.",

For Bitcoin trading pair, its total trading volume is about $420,000, not too much.However, the loss is likely from a bad order used by the seller and maybe a technical issue on their exchange. If there is no technical issue, the seller must check buy wall and sell wall to see where is next big buy orders before initiate his sell order.Additionally, selling must be split to some orders, not only one and of course using Limit order is safer than Market order.",

It is not advisable for newbies to use order if they don’t have the knowledge about orders and how it works; the best thing to do is to use market orders just to sell immediately because if you place order and the order is not executed quickly, the price will affect it and some newbies don’t know how to cancel orders because some exchanges are very hard to use as they are not user friendly.",

That’s why it’s important depth chart to determine what’s the price with highest liquidity backing it aka as support wall. The news is really sad because the user with huge holdings is very dumb and doesn’t care to do research first before he does the market sell. I’m not familiar with the exchange either but he can file a complaint about if the exchange has a huge trading and just suddenly remove liquidity right after he does the market sell on his holdings",
