You should focus on running your own race to the finish line rather than allow your self to be distracted by how other people are running their own race.. Even if you are able to find out the wallet whales store their bitcoin, whether it be one, two or more wallet, knowing this will not add a single bitcoin to your own wallet, why not focus on accumulating your own bitcoin? Quote 2. Is it possible to invest very very big money like 10's of billions without been tracked by authorities or is it not possible to earn or invest this amount by illegal businessIf you have that kind of money, (like you put it, 10's of billions) you already have a good level of authority yourself, so which ever or what ever way you choose to invest it is no business of the authorities as long as you are not laundering the money or sponsoring human, drug or weapon trafficking.",

But if it is fiat equivalent, that would be hard for sure. The market value moves a lot which makes your computed value indefinite. I do also tend to do so but only speculation to somehow give me inspiration to continue engaging in this industry.

There are chain analytics that focus on this and you can find all of it if you do a bit of googling. Whether those are whales or not is difficult to tell because if I wanted to buy 1000 bitcoin and I did it all on binance that has a known wallet and makes their volume public people would know but I don't have to do it. I can buy everything OTC or I can buy some of it OTC, or keep buying 100 coins each month, every time on a different exchange and every time into a different wallet. You wouldn't even know.",

Or you can use Excel, which provides columns that you can fill in with the date and amount of money and how many bitcoins you bought.That will make it easier to track how much money you have used. I usually do it that way and it really helps to know my total investment in fiat money. From there, I can find out the temporary profit position that I have got.If bitcoin is legally accepted in your country, it may be okay to invest 10 billion. But if not, your bank will suspect it and will investigate. My advice, do this regularly every week or month in the amount you can afford.",

I highly doubt that the crypto exchange platforms would reveal such information. Years ago, multiple crypto exchanges were faking their trading volume, in order to look bigger and more reputable. Maybe these unethical practices remain in some of them.2.No, it's no possible.

Since a centralized exchange is usually required to convert the funds before you can spend them, and because bitcoin isn't yet legal tender in all countries, your anonymity cannot be guaranteed unless authorities are aware of the large sums of money in such wallets.",
