How could you even think that anyone will give you the loan without any proper collateral. That NFT thing was a hype of the 2021 and nobody will fall into that thing anymore. Like Royse777 said if you want the loan then provide the collateral if you have a collateral other than NFT than you might get the loan otherwise lenders will consider you as a scammer.",

Was you really thinking that \"Yeah..

Even that´s like one out of one million chance, but its bigger chance then anyone on the internet would \"LOAN\" you $39K.I dont want to be rude or anything, but i am just mind blowing that nothing seems to have any limit these days.I see this more and more on this forum, and i always ask my self, why tf does this people not find a work, using a bank, or ask some friend or family...?But is not the best thing to brainstorm and try to find out something your good at and see if its possible to make any money out of that instead?",

Fine but dont ever judge me Too late!  You're the one scalping stolen or hacked accounts, and getting butthurt when no one volunteers to send you a small fortune without any guarantees of reimbursement.  Kind of hard not to place judgement on your values and ethics at this point.",
