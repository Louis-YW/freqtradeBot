It is true that some believe in centralization and that you should not trust banking systems, but many will not risk investing 99% of their money in Bitcoin, especially if there is the possibility of any other investments. Profits are what motivate the vast majority to invest, and as long as there are profits, more will continue. In investing, when profits disappear, very few people will think about investing.Bitcoin is now at less than its value because it can make a profit from interest and treasury bonds, so liquidity is drying up from these investments, otherwise we would now be above $50,000.",

Profits are what motivate the vast majority to invest, and as long as there are profits, more will continue. In investing, when profits disappear, very few people will think about investing. No person will want to invest their money where their won't be profit especially not those that still believes in the centralized system, they do invest in shares, bonds, stock all of this is to earn profit so what difference does it make for the majority you think that are investing in bitcoin because of profit.I feel a 99% of people that invests in bitcoin after doing their own research invested not just for the profit but following the privacy that bitcoin decentralization offers a situation you can at any time have access to your investment funds and make use of with your private keys without having to get consent from a third-party or passing through a paperwork  before gaining access.Investment is motivated by profit be it in stock, bonds, gold or bitcoin and if all of these financial tools has no ROI a whole number of people will step back, so it's natural that the number investing in bitcoin will reduce should profit be removed from bitcoin.",

Privacy, a fundamental human right, is at the core of this transformation, solidifying the potential of cryptocurrencies to reshape our financial landscape.From the past until now, the banking system has never experienced major changes. The system implemented does contain rules that are a little less good and can even be detrimental to the customers themselves. So it is natural that in the future the banking system will experience a slight decline in popularity and little by little it will be replaced by cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin. Because Bitcoin does have a very good system and can be said to be very different from the current banking system. However, I believe it will be difficult to replace or replace the current banking system with a bitcoin system. Because as we know, the banking system has been around for a long time. Apart from that, sometimes in a country the banking system is also managed by the government, which of course will be more difficult to overthrow.Then apart from that there are deeper facts, such as currently almost the majority of people on this earth use and need the banking system to save their money or send money. So with this fact it will definitely take a very long time until the banking system collapses and is replaced by the bitcoin system.Because currently, even though bitcoin users have experienced a significant increase, if we talk about a larger scale comparison with bank users, it is certain that banks are superior. So in conclusion, the opinion you explained could indeed happen, but if it really happened it would definitely take a very long time for it to happen.",

      "body": "Anarchy and Bitcoin are incompatible. Bitcoin was created to give you freedom or liberty to do what is right/good.  Anarchy is freedom to do whatever you want, whether good or bad. It has no boundary or rule. Whereas True Freedom, which Bitcoin offers, is the freedom to do what is right/good. It has rules or boundaries like Bitcoin. Bitcoin does not allow people to steal one another's coins. It secures people's coins. It doesn't allow coin inflation, non-transparency, mutablility, privacy violations, it doesn't require permission or trust for good reasons, etc. Since it's designed to protect people via its boundaries/rules, it will be unreasonable for certain people to use it lawlessly to harm others or create problems for society in processes that could be harmful to people, who could be Bitcoin users.Unlike traditional financial system, Bitcoin clearly limit choices to do evil, and even makes sure members enforce the limit. One of its most important boundaries that helps expose evil is transparency. Imagine a World where good rules are made with sufficient transparency to help expose the evil that might try to break the good rules. Evil is limited in this case.Bitcoin has spoken via its boundaries or rules, about what it dislikes and what it likes. It will be hypocritical for Bitcoin to secure people's coins but allows its users to rob banks in lawless time. It would be hypocritical for Bitcoin to protect your fundamental rights in order for you to limit the fundamental rights of people that are guranteed the rights. There is right to life, which is where alot of the fundamental human rights are derived from... It requires the protection of humans from harm and death. This right is also protected by Bitcoin with privacy, anonymity, permissionless, transparency etc. It will be counterintuitive to use Bitcoin to exchange, buy or sell things that harm you and others.Finally, Bitcoin is more useful during crisis in order to protect and help people survive when every fragile thing around them is collapsing. Bitcoin does not cause the crisis nor does it help people cause the crisis. It's not compatible with its nature to harm society or people.",

Traditional systems in politics and finance often limit choices, resembling a form of modern slavery. In my view, cryptocurrencies, led by Bitcoin, provide a decentralized and liberating communication protocol, offering genuine freedom and empowering individuals to shape their destinies. You don't have to be in some doubt, because BTC really provides a decentralized and anonymous way to convey your messages now. For example, we only use it for p2p transactions without dealing with any single or middle entity. We are free to provide all the documents and can still make transactions and send money from one place to another. All we need is the internet, a wallet, and money, of course.Well, not only does BTC provide us with freedom of speech, but a recent incident in Ordinals has allowed us to upload images and videos on the BTC blockchain, which lies there forever and cannot be deleted or tracked if the uploader is taking precaution. I also came to know about it in a recent incident, when war logs were uploaded on it.

Worth a listen!I am not fond of listening to podcasts, instead, I love to read the articles, but yeah, while doing work and listening to the same articles in audio format, saves you time, and doing 2 works at the same time. I did not think of it, because I am totally free, to do one work at a time.",

      "body": "I agree with this, it's obvious and maybe not a new point of view, it was literally in the whitepaper that Satoshi wrote and definitely the core values of bitcoin but that doesn't mean I disagree with it.Anyone who is invested into bitcoin should know the values of it and should approach it differently. I get that it may look a bit different and difficult at times but that doesn't change the fact that we are going to do something that would be a little bit different approach. Hopefully we can reach to a point where we could end up with a good return one day or another, and profiting is part of this.Because even though the values are important for something, the results are also quite important as well. We can't have bitcoin being small amount with tiny marketcap and keep supporting it, if there are enough people who supports the ideas behind bitcoin then it means there must be all those people buying it, which would in return make the price go up.",

      "body": "What financial freedom somehow is different from the meaning they are saying. Sometimes it means that your BTC is yours and yours alone no one can take it from you.While I also agree crypto is reshaping our financial landscape, privacy is something that is to be considered in a critical situation. It's getting harder for crypto users to be off the grid when all platforms today are asking for KYC. Once you have data sent, I guess you already have compromised privacy and we in crypto have had fewer options.",
