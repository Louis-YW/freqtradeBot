It's a trap and just take last one week's data as example it pumped to $0.078 from $0.01 and then dropped to $0.03 and now again pumping towards $0.07.

So this pump must be from retailers and traders just for pump and dump. So there is no guaranteed of going back to $1 per each too bad that ustc becomes a token rather than its purpose as a stablecoin though. Dont expect too much on this.",

It's never going to be back to $1 and it won't be stable coin anymore. Despite of everyone's effort to think that this will comeback to its former. I'm not happy to cut your fun because that's what I think. If an altcoin has been into controversy and trying to get up from that and the developer of it has been caught and sued to jail, do not give too much hope on it.",

And with the dump, it has made people lose faith in it. In the crypto industry, faith and trust is the only thing that keeps a project alive. Cryptocurrency is a thing that you can't see or touch. People believing in it and putting money in it makes it a success. When the very thing that is missing in a project, how can you trust it again?",

I don't see any reason why their stable coin will reach a dollar again. Not even during the bull run. The effect of what happened to them in the past is just too big that investors who experienced that one will never forget what happened to them. They'll remember that the once massive project that's been in the top 10 is now below the top 100 or even 200 already. They'll never forget the fact that they completely lost their money investing into once a very good project.You said you bought it right? Take profits as early as possible.",

If you ask me so I will say that these both coins will never come up again. Because they are scammers. And the founder is already in jail. So I don't think so they will come back again.Whales are just trying to accumulate profit. They are giving the indication that it will go up and make a comeback. But it will dump again and it will liquidate the traders with big amount. So I will suggest that keep away from these kind of coins and be careful.",

I don't think if it would hit $1 it has been pump and dump all this while. Whenever users fell that a coin has no value anymore, they start withdrawing from the project and that becomes the fall of the project. The success of any project is determined by the community. If the community is not strong, it will definitely fall. the best phrase to use is \" Together we stand divided we fall\"",

Have you considered the risk and are willing to accept that decision? If you are ready, then you don't need to worry too much and just wait for that goal to happen, or it will never happen. I would also agree with many people who witnessed the Luna event that it is a product of the landfill, and it is only a place left for those who are still stuck or even those who want to create hype for profit.IMO, if you buy USTC and wait for a recovery, it is not necessary to instead spend that investment on other safe cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, what does the OP expect from a product that has lost its community? Negative reviews are always a challenge for some sort of comeback plan. So don't talk about belief without a basis, it's just confusion with fomo from surrounding news.",

But what I can say is that there are many altcoins in the cryptocurrency market and with different names. Some them are meme coins, shitcoins and others and all are classify as altcoins and all these altcoins, it is not all that will survive, some will go up and come down again while some will not survive because the management or the developers are not ready to work again or they have gotten what they needed. Therefore the only ones which will survive in the space are the ones that the developers are active.And because of what happened to Terra Luna, and anything that is related to it will not go far again so for USTC to hit $1 is not possible at any time soon.",
