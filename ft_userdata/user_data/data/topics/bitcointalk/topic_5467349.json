  "content": "As a bitcoin investor, there are some challenges that can make us unable to invest in a long term due to some certain reasons.Lack of income If you want to invest in bitcoin for a long term, it is important that one should have a source of income which will enable him use some percentage from his income, let me say like 10%. This will enable the investor to be able to DCA with a particular amount regular, and will lead to increase in his bitcoin portfolio, so that during the long run, he can have a significant amount, which he can take profit after the long run when bitcoin has reached his price target. When you don't have a job or a mean of income, this will totally kill your dreams of reaching your bitcoin target. Some people after acquiring bitcoin to an extend, they quit their jobs that pays them, which they used part of it for investing and believe that the price of bitcoin will keep on pumping to survive them, this is another great mistake some newbies does because we need fiat currency if we are investing into bitcoin for our daily use.Lack of preparation : In whatever investment one wants to go into, it is good that you prepare yourself very well with the knowledge that you have acquire so that you wouldn't be trapped at the middle of everything and go back to level zero. Bitcoin investment needs a proper insight to know how much fiat funds that you have available at even given period of time, which can be used for an emergency needs, so that you don't go back and sell your bitcoin when you don't have fiat on you anymore. In this one needs to know how much income that you earn, and what type of strategy will fit into your cash inflow, either DCA, lump buying or buying at the dip, or rather still using all method based on the level of funds in your possession at that time.Lack of knowledge : Knowledge is power and leads to one success in whatever he is doing. A bitcoin investor needs the knowledge of bitcoin first before jumping into investing. This will enable him to be able to know the price movement of bitcoin and not to panic and sell, when he sees a slight change in the market or hear any bad new that will affect the price of bitcoin to drop drastically. This is also enable him to know the right time to buy and sell without regrets.Trading : Trading is like a distraction to long term hodli because you will be busy thinking of making daily income and not having plans to hodli for long forgetting that long term holders benefits more that traders in the long run. Also due to the unpredictable price of bitcoin, it is very possible that you will run at loss, especially when you are a newbie because hodli doesn't need any skills but discipline, while trading needs skills and market strategy. You will be open to loss more of your bitcoin to trading than holding because you might end up making the wrong decision.Sickness : This is another factor that can make a bitcoin investor not be hodli for long. You will notice that there are some sickness that will make us not able to go to work anymore due to its critical condition. One will not be able to earn anymore but will need to take care of himself and this will make him go and sell his bitcoin. It is better to use your bitcoin to take care of yourself and become healthy rather than die and leave your bitcoin in your wallet.One source of income :  This happens to those people that their earnings is not big, but could invest in bitcoin from their income Some investors due to hardship from inflation might not have enough money like they use to have to take care of their important needs and families,because if this their bitcoin investment will be tampered. All that they have bought will be sold off at a price that is not their will. If you find  yourself in such situation, it is good to look for another job to add to the one to increase your income so that your bitcoin dreams wouldn't be shattered by inflation.You can add yours to it as I will stop here.Let's discuss.",

So in emergencies like sickness, lose jobs, you will have other money like savings to use and don't touch your investment part.With savings for emergencies, at least you won't immediately touch your investment part to have money. After a while, hopefully you will improve your financial situation with new jobs, get better health.If you invest all money, in emergencies, you have to sell your investment assets even you don't want to sell or even you know you have to sell it with loss.",

Don't invest in Bitcoin if you know you don't have any source of income because you will end up selling your Bitcoin at a low price when hunger hits you and there is no other money with you to feed, you will have no choice but to sell your Bitcoin to settle your stomach.Another thing I think that makes some people sell their Bitcoin is the lack of \"Bitcoin fundamentals\". When people lack Bitcoin fundamentals and they go into investing in Bitcoin, when there is a price drop in Bitcoin they will be afraid that their money is going to zero, and with this fear, they will be pushed to sell their Bitcoin to recover part of their money before it will go to zero.",

This may be one of the challenges that can deprive a person from holding bitcoin for long-term.

It is better to use your bitcoin to take care of yourself and become healthy rather than die and leave your bitcoin in your wallet.This is a phenomenon that's out of our control. Just like natural disaster that can dwindle the economy of a country same is likened to sickness in a holder's life. We shouldn't never hesitate to withdraw from our HODLing to use in taking care of our health. We can always start again after we are well and strong.There's no pride in leaving yourself sick to death just to prove you can hodl even in dangerous circumstances.QuoteOne source of income :  This happens to those people that their earnings is not big, but could invest in bitcoin from their income Some investors due to hardship from inflation might not have enough money like they use to have to take care of their important needs and families,because if this their bitcoin investment will be tampered.

To bolster your plan you need to work with the income size you have, you can't be aiming higher than your income you are bond to crash if you  do it that way.",

In this case no one would need to fall back to his or her savings for a rescue which actually that is the real reasons for savings. The essence of savings is for situations of this nature and when it arises that one needs urgent attention like this nothing should deter them because at that point in time only their savings could rescue them. I have heard experience of this nature thrice and it came up so impromptu that I had no option than to sell my assets and  lucky enough what I had in my assets savings was enough to cover my needs that came up as an emergency but as time went on I was able to reinvest as I had enough to do so. That was my experience. When it in has to do with life and others, in one would need be sensitive to respond immediately irrespective of how much assets you have or the nature or situation of things. Life is precious and there is no second life. So make sure you sort out things if it happens to be an emergency situation.",

One source of income shoudn't deprive you from investing in Bitcoin and holding it for long. It only depends on how well your planning is. When you're receiving a low salary, don't be greedy to invest more than you can afford to lose that you'll run out of money to use for your wellbeing. Invest only spare money from that one source of income and you won't have issues. When you receive your salary, take care of all the necessary things first then keep emergency fund before taking our some part of the money for your investment plan which should be DCA. When you do this you won't be finding yourself in financial difficulties frequently selling your Bitcoin investment. Quote from: Ruttoshi on September 19, 2023, 05:09:51 PMLack of income If you want to invest in bitcoin for a long term, it is important that one should have a source of income which will enable him use some percentage from his income, let me say like 10%. This will enable the investor to be able to DCA with a particular amount regular, and will lead to increase in his bitcoin portfolio, For this I would have said, having a reliable source of income makes it possible for you to hodl because you won't have a need to sell your investment because you have a job that can take care of majority of your needs. A common mistake most newbies make when they want to invest in Bitcoin is they think they can rely on the profits they'll be making from Bitcoin and some of them quit their jobs after making some big profits. They decide to go fully into investment in Bitcoin but doing this is a risk because during the bear market that the market isn't moving, it'll become a problem to be able to keep holding when you'll be in need of cash.",

What I would not stop talking about every time is the need for us to also focus on the other side of the investment i.e., the loses that you are likely to encounter so that it will prepare you ahead of your investment plans.I will also advise anyone who has the plan of investing in Bitcoin to also do more of findings and research on the market flow and trends and how the system has performed over the years. You should also know what your calculated risks are through risk assessments and prepare your self ahead of any future circumstances.I will also advise any investor to weigh their investment capacity, in terms of the type of business they do, their inflows and outflows and what they have as a capital to invest. While you're putting everything into cognizant, don't forget to invest with little, even when you can afford more, so as to test the market.In the end, avoid investing all the capitals you have gathered and make sure you have some cash handy for contingencies.",

Trading in most cases still leaves you with your bitcoins and you would be hodling something of great value as well.Obviously, some of these reasons you’ve given do apply but, most of what I would like to say is that, the needs of a person when you don’t have an alternative source of income or satisfying your human wants makes selling your bitcoin to fill in for that want more easy.

I will always choose to sell and rebuy at the low price. I will continue this process until the next bull run and I will make more profits than someone holding tight both in rise and in fall. Just because I cannot predict to some comprehensible percentage what happens in the market, I have no option but to follow the hodl syndrome.",

As we all know that gambling is one of the first use case of bitcoin, i.e. that's why we have a lot of crypto online casinos right now and there are a billion dollar business.With that, maybe some of us here who invest but then again become an addicted gambler might be putting their holdings into crypto gambling and losing their holdings. If you have great plans for your long term investment, then you should never compromise it and won’t let your gambling addiction ruin it. For me, it all goes down to your own choice and decision making. You can gamble and invest for long term at the same time, but it’s important that you set a budget on gambling and when it’s already used up, just call it a day and just gamble again when you have spare amount of bitcoin.",
