That will be heavy and hard to transact and proceed with, and money is the solution. Backing with the gold standard. That's why it's essential to have that to prevent inflation. And now, in the digital era, it's better to have digital coins that run on the blockchain so that every transaction can be tracked and monitored. Internet currency is already being explored with the invention of the internet, and the \"double-spending\" trick is solved by blockchain technology.",

I'm not sure if they were aware of what they are going to invent for the future because the shape of the old internet was not same as the what we can see these days, as far as I know, Internet was not created for what we see right now like buying stuff online, So having an internet currency was not a thing in the early years and none could even think about it, however, the idea of internet token was start a few years ago the name is ICP but what jut an alternative coin and it was not started in the early years.",

Where did you hear those rumors that the early developers of the internet had already recognized a possible protocol for money in the internet? I haven't taken the time and effort to really trace the development of the internet, but although it is indeed possible, it's probably a way to innovate fiat so that it is also usable online. They're probably not talking about Bitcoin or an entirely different currency which is solely designed for internet transactions.",

It is not easy to visualize and project situations that we do not understand if we do not experience them, it is not for everyone.If you don't understand me, it happens with theoretical physicists, their formulas lead them to visualize things that they only understand when a formula guides them, after that it's light, it's easy, not before. They move on a different thought frequency.Now, let's get to the point of the matter, You have you ever given a check. So, do you know that a check traveled from point A to point B offline, this as a simple example of how before some transactions were mobilized and in that process, the technology worked with punched cards, etc.Then! There were many people visualizing in one way or another something similar to what we have today, but in your precarious perception of the situation you need to have accurate documentation of names...that perhaps does not exist today and that it is lost or relegated to oblivion... at least as collateral of the precise and well documented information that does exist.__Read about these two characters, their contributions to the subject can be very specific. But they denote that concern for a solution like Bitcoin can be persistent in related areas, as well as in others that we would never expect to see.Milton Friedman, visualize a idea that resembles we know today.Richard Feynman, one of the greatest minds of the 20th century, I speak, mentions something very similar to the idea behind Bitcoin, not specifically about what we know today, but he mentions it, it is understood that he refers to a similar system.So,  your search is extensive if you want to look beyond what is known by short reference or is the most formal and best documented.",
