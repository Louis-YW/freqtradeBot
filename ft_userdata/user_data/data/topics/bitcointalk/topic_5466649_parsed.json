This will include whether bitcoin is legalised, outlawed or a legal tender in your country. You have the liberty to mention your country or not. Other details may include if bitcoin is mined in your country and the overall friendliness of the government to cryptocurrency in your country. Importance of the threadThis will enable bitcoiners to know the fate of bitcoin in different countries This thread will allow travellers to know bitcoin friendly countries that they will travel to for residential purpose or vacation in order to live a bitcoiner's life.I go first:I am a Nigerian. On the 5th of February 2021, The Central Bank of Nigeria directed all the banks in Nigeria to close the accounts of all the people that are involved in cryptocurrency transactions in the country. The banks swung into action immediately. This made Nigerians believe that the government has banned cryptocurrency in the country. Nigerians began to use centralized p2p to trade and when there is need for banks, they send the money without using any crypto keywords in the narration. Meanwhile,  the information was that crypto is banned in NigerianQuoteMarch 21, 2021: The CBN clarifies its position on the ban and states that individuals  are not prohibited from buying and trading crypto, just not through any Nigerian bank or fintech. So, in my country cryptocurrency is not banned but its transaction with banks is banned.On 28th May, 2023 Nigeria government signed into law the finance act 2023 which grants 10% tax on gains in digital assets including cryptocurrency while still keeping cryptocurrency transaction banned in the country. This is the state of the confusion about bitcoin and cryptocurrency in my country.",

They don't want to be Bitcoin holders, investors and accepting Bitcoin for their small businesses is risky because of Bitcoin volatility.In nations where Bitcoin is not legal tender but locals are ready to use it, national-wide accept it for their businesses without much fear. It's different like you said between legal tender and non legal tender nations.Bitcoin with its decentralized network, non custodial wallets can be used and transacted without need to be legal tender.",

That is currency to currency or currency to whatever is possible. I am more or less happy that at least we do not have to worry about our accounts getting banned. We pay 1% TDS at the financial year end on only bitcoin to altcoin exchanges that happen on any exchanger. This is traced as exchangers are subject to submit the trade data to authorities during that financial year. Secondly we have to pay 30% taxes on the bitcoin sell to local currency and any profits that we got from such sells. However, this is again calculated based on various expenses, income slot during that financial year. It’s pretty much easy if you have business and you can end up paying less as compared to what is given. The country is India.",

The only official and valid medium of exchange in Indonesia is IDR (Indonesian Rupiah)- Every crypto trade will be subject to a tax of 0.1% of the transaction amount through the official exchanger in Indonesia.Maybe there are still some points that I haven't included, but the points above are important points that need to be paid attention to when using crypto in Indonesia.",

As for Honduras, it is not true that Bitcoin is legal tender there, but it is a tourist project of the Santa Lucia enclave called Bitcoin Valley. A similar thing exists on the Philippine island of Boracay, and BTC is not legal tender there either.Your idea that Bitcoin can only prosper if it is legal tender is completely wrong, because forcing someone to use something they don't want is counterproductive in most cases.",

It is not necessary to have a bitcoin ATM to use bitcoins as there are many non-custodial wallets to hold bitcoins and p2p facilities to cash out.  And for this p2p facility, Bitcoin can be easily cashed out in countries where Bitcoin is not legal. One of the biggest reasons for not legalizing Bitcoin in a country is to prevent anti- money laundering. Because bitcoin wallets don't generate country-specific wallets, the same category of wallets are generated for everyone, so it's impossible to tell from a wallet transaction where those bitcoins have been transferred.  In this case it is very easy to launder money through Bitcoin.  And this is why the government fears the most",

I really liked these types of steps in compare to banning the whole crypto sphere in country. I live in Pak, and crypto is totally ban here, agencies are hunting bigger fishes and they are seizing their funds, but IDK why big influencers and Youtubers are still live and making daily videos on crypto and are not under any type of investigation. They even showcase their profits and lose too but mostly profits. Point is, till now I think agencies do ban the crypto but according to SBF private statements that it made in court during the trial, they said, we do not have any authentic reason to ban the crypto but still they have banned it without declaring any specific punishments.People already avoid to made direct transaction in banks which are connected with crypto, just like you said. And we almost follow the same method to withdraw funds which you aforementioned.

Therefore, in order for your topic to work, it will need to be constantly updated.For the most part, there will be few countries mentioned here in which it will be possible to live the life of a bitcoiner, which will lead to this topic being spammed with posts like “btc is banned in my country.” It will be easier if we proceed from the opposite: don't mention countries in which bitcoin is prohibited (or mention briefly), but rather concentrate more on information about those countries in which BTC is not prohibited and what goods and services can be used to pay for them. That is, real and useful cases that can really be useful to bitcoiners when moving or going on vacation to another country.That is, I propose to narrow the topic from “the status of bitcoin in their country.” to “in which countries and how can bitcoin be used by visitors/locals.”",
