What do you think? Is good to teach your children sex education or thy should be allow to grow on their terms? Is sex education good for a child?When it comes to such education, better to teach them to keep their virginities and the consequences of not doing so. Always monitor what they consume, watch or see. Get them to be very open to you about things that involve sex they consumed, saw, watched or feel. Make sure to destroy every sexual seed that may have been planted in their minds with good opposites, else the seeds grow in them and they become slaves to sexual sins. If they are overcome by lust, get them isolated for couple of days and feed them with things that suppress the lust. Feed them with the Word of GOD especially where the evil of lust and its consequences is specifically mentioned. Repeat it several times until the Words heal them. At the right time, you could teach them about their sexual parts and what they are used for, how to take care of them(like keeping it clean) and how to and how not to use them. Teach them never to mingle with pervert as they could be turn into pervert. Teach them never to stay alone with the opposite sex. They should only be in public where speaking about sex or getting involved in sexual activities is frowned at, or at home in the presence of responsible guardian/parentBelow is the Word of GOD in Audio form.

When these little ones as why they are different, the simple answer is that some people are boys and some people are girls.Once the kids get used to this idea, and once they start to become modest, they will remain dressed in front of each other as they grow older. They will remember that their question was answered when they were little, and might not ask again.At the time of puberty, parents should be sensitive towards their kids and start training them about where people come from.",

But watching and learning this kind of stuff is too much for them to handle. As they learn new ideas which can led to bad decisions. In school they already teach how sex can affect their body so they already know the consequences of sex. Even at high school they teaching kids to have safe sex. It means that sex its part of our needs but in a right age. We only prefer to have sex activities when adult since they can take care of themselves already when consequences happen.Quote from: Car22 on March 10, 2023, 04:43:35 PMYes it is very bad to learn sex education on child base .

You can teach them in a simple way where they can easily understand without watching some adult stuff which is uncomfortable for them. If you let them to learn in their own, they might try it themselves because we all know the children in their age let curiosity wins.",
