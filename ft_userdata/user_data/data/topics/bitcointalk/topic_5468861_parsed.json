How dose this make availability of petroleum products?Although I don’t know the process they undergo but I am very sure they will waste so many useful contents in the crude because they are centered in some specific outer coke and I am sure the rest will be waste.The government need to understand these people and bring a permanent solution to this problem because this is really affecting the country’s economy in general.QuoteI believe that since our government are not ready to make things easy for her citizen, they should also allow them to develop any idea of easing the tension and hardship of the masses.

Please what are your takes on thisThe illegal refining of crude out is a big criminal act whic is a crime on its own, I don’t see any reason why government just because of this hardship will allow its citizens to be committing crimes just ease the pressure.We citizens need to understand the whole situation and pray for this hardship to be over but committing crime is not the solution.",

Please what are your takes on thisOn this subject, the concern has been raised several times that the government should give license to these local refineries, but that their refining activities would be regulated to avoid the sale and consumption of fake crude.The idea was good as its purpose is to allow the product be common thereby reducing monopoly and reducing its price.Until we have a government that is not after their own pockets, monopoly, crude oil theft and pipe vandalism may keep being issues for every sitting government to combat.",

Isn't that still a criminal activities?As long it is an illegal and its risky is not capitalized on losing its funds but lives on the activity then it should be a banned (no go area) despites how lucrative or what affordable roles it places on the societies.Imagine how you would get into a business that would stake your life a decision or 50/50 and you the consumer purchasing what could tend to also stake lives 50/50 during consumption Imagine about how the process of the illegal refineries has the possessions of pollution the areas that tends to have negative effects on humans health, the farms and the reactions to the atmosphere.My dear, it is illegal just as you said and so also a risky of lives and properties just as elaborated. So,it should be a keep off.There are other means to creat source of wealths or incomes.We should thank God the dubious govt never placed Crypto trading an illegal otherwise we all the Bitcoineers would be on illegal indulgement otherwise it is placed on suspense specifically on the government sectors.So myself of though, the same reasons of it risky and  negative effects to the natures is the primary reasons why it is declared illegal but I would be in support of the federal and state levels of government could support this illegal refineries (bunkeries ) with the amenities to assure humans safetyness and of course eliminating other related disastrous occurrences.This is my thoughts on  how this can be viable to reliably exist.This alone boosts the BTC Investors in the country to trade without a fear of violating the laws of the nation so....

And in that case you conscience won't allow you to be sentimental since you've already pardoned the first person so definitely you have to pardon others as well.The area I'm emphasizing on is the area of stealing from the government because since they don't want to make life comfortable for the common man, they should also allow them do the same thing they've been doing for long because this economic sabotage is being championed by some top government officials so they don't want the common man to do what they do or know what they know so that's the perspective I'm talking about",

It is our country resources and no one has the right to go and steal the property of a country. The worst of it all, is that this hustle is very risky and it is a 50-50 chance of surviving. Why I said so is because, there can be invasion of the point by JTF or Civil defense and some times, it use to be shoot aside. Another risk is that there can be explosion at the point and it will lead to unwanted injuries and death. The fact remains that this type of hustle is illegal and deadly and if you are caught, you can go to jail for it.This is why I wouldn't encourage anyone to be part of such act because the risk is higher than the profit.",
