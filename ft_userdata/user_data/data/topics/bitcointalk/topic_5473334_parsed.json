Because bitcoin price at that time was just $1000 a piece , so his wealth would have been about 30 times at current prices. Based on my computation, he would not become a billionaire, proabably a millionaire. I dig a bit and look for his name, there was an article that was dated 2013 reported about him getting paid in bitcoin as his salary. So if he continues receiving it, that's 10 years already. But let's judge it based on the fitures, not sure if the salary rate is correct but based on this article below., the \"Chief Of Police Salary in Kentucky\" is around $80k per month, I rounded it off. So $80k x 10 years, that's only 800k which is less than a million, so even if we will multiply that by 30 times, that would only reach up to $24 million which is already overstated, so that \"billion\" never exist. https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/kentucky-police-chief-to-be-paid-in-bitcoin/https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Chief-Of-Police-Salary--in-Kentucky#Yearly",

It could have been anyone else too; perhaps there were so many people who also bought Bitcoin very cheaply those days but were unable to hold it till the last ATH. In the space of life, some people are faced with different needs and responsibilities, and there is no way they might have been able to keep holding their coin to date, even if they wanted to, but it seems they sold it because it was the only choice they had to make at that time.",

Even if I get the salary during that time, I won't hold it till now; it's quite impossible unless I forget about my bitcoin. So Tony Vaughn could even become a millionaire if he holds, but who knows?

I am really sure, He probably didn't spare his salary at that time because he had to fulfill his life needs such as bills, food, etc, and maybe if he really saved his BTC, that is possible a only few satoshis left on his wallet. because BTC price movements would make people tempted to sell it. Maybe we can equalize Tony Vaughn with signature participant who got payment with btc, because there are many necessities for life, they might sell some, and set aside some. But I am really sure, some of them will sell everything if BTC price back to ATH or more than the previous price. because there are still many people still compare BTC with fiat.",

A town with only 330 people, a police chief who requested that his salary be paid in Bitcoin, and a city commission approving it. That sounds really fun. In 2013, not many people have heard of Bitcoin. But it seems to me Chief Vaughn didn't have much work to do that he probably had a lot of time to update himself with what's new. He probably studied it deeply to the point that he even requested that he be paid in Bitcoin. Did Vicco have a nerdy police chief? LOL!",

Based on some news I read, Tony got his salary in Bitcoin when its price was $1,181 on the Mt Gox exchange. It's true that back then, the price of Bitcoin had a really big jump, and this event from a decade ago actually made a lot of people talk about Bitcoin. In early January 2013, the price of Bitcoin was about $13, and later in Q4 2013, it reached its highest price at $1,000.So, to sum it up, the experiment of receiving a salary in Bitcoin started during a time when Bitcoin was doing really well in the market. This was partly because of something called \"halving\" in November 2012... and usually, in experiments like this, salary payments weren't done many times... maybe just once or twice. So, I don't think Tony Vaughn became a big millionaire from his salary back then unless he held onto his Bitcoin until now.Personally, I'm not a fan of discussions about regrets, like \"if you didn't sell coin A a few years ago, you could be a billionaire by now.\" It's better for people not to dwell on their regrets and focus on the future. Bringing up past experiences that sound like big mistakes is not really ethical.",

Do we know at that time that the price of Bitcoin will be reaching its current price right now? In the end, it's only a matter of trust, and if we need it or not. I've been in signature campaigns for years already, and most of my earnings are converted because a portion of it is being used for some monthly needs of our home. I also used I guess around 0.08 BTC to build my own computer. Just imagine how much it would be if I chose to hold it until now. I can't imagine how many BTC I already converted into fiat. I guess let's forget about this \"He would've...\" or \"He must've been...\" things right now because we don't know what can happen in the future.",
