It would not be impossible that this time you are right and your accusation is true, as in the story of the boy who cried wolf, but seeing that you have been tagged by false accusations of this style, you should provide some weighty arguments with hard evidence for the community to believe you, and the images of the other thread are worthless.",

As I have read your posts, it's pretty confusing, and you even said WhatsApp on Telegram messages, so it's kind of sketchy that even that detail is wrong. So how can you be trusted when you don't have enough proof to say that there's unfair treatment with you being blackmailed? There's no link or image to the promises made, so it's pretty weird.",

You don’t need to become aggressive to all criticism and just provide necessary evidence to prove your accusation as legit. Explain how your claim is valid and try to find a way to verify those whatsapp and telegram chat is came from the legit person because it’s easy to create social media account just to impersonate someone. You need a solid proof to prove your accusation online so that people will believe in you. Without proper reporting and evidence, You will not received a single support to your problem. @Twitchyseal is known for fighting scam and fair to handle this kind of issue. Why not cooperate with him and provide what he is asking. He will be a great help if you are telling the truth.",
