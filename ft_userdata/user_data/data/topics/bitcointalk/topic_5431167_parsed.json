Edit:Opened this a few hours ago.I quoted this at 12/07/2023 10:20 pm setQuote from: philipma1957 on December 08, 2023, 03:12:36 AMQuote from: kano on December 08, 2023, 02:56:22 AMAlas V2 is, by definition, transaction bias.Not allowing all transactions in the blockchain is a very bad idea for the free open bitcoin transaction system.Mara pool tried doing this and stopped because of the obvious expected backlash.Not sure why anyone would want to promote this.It doesn't give you more blocks on the blockchain, it allows you to do 2 things:1) Remove transactions \"you don't like\" = transaction bias2) Put cheaper transactions in your blocks = devalue bitcoin and get less reward miningI highly suggest everyone to avoid this.Okay with crazy high tx numbers that we have now. could this set the bar higher?Ie no fee under 400 sats a byte when fees are high and it cherry picks higher  by 50 %  would it be more likely to get a block with 3 btc in fees while a non biased one would be more likely to get a block with 2 btc in fees as it allows for low fees.In my example above it would appear on the surface that he would hit fatter feed blocks.Or am I simply wrong.BTW if I am right his method is only good when fees are high.right now if you set 120 sats as your cut off and I set no cutoff leaving it alone does he  hit higher fees  then the open non biased poolI think he wants to leave that impression that his way results in bigger fees.and I am asking is that true or false?",

Furthermore, 2020 was nearly as bad as 2022 or even worse for mining too, 2021 was better than the others but 2020, no, that year I'm absolutely fine if it gets erased from my memory!We can have price growth and obviously increase revenue in mining without covid, inflation, war, and all that stuff, actually, I'm almost sure that once all these are over we will see far better times than previously in all kinds of BTC related revenues.",

It's a nice change from a desk job to install fans, draw a scheme to set them up, do a bit of DIY fixing the walls and the floor, inspecting cables like you're a bomb squad  ,  checking all kind data on my smartphone but after almost two years..nope, the magic is gone! Not to mention the ~100km drive! A few more days of 1% stress till I get some feedback from the guy I sold to have some peace of mind that none got damaged during the drip or played possum at start and, peace!!!!That's why I admire you both, cause you can still do this and manage it every day and still think of expansion, I probably wouldn't be able to do it even in a far better market, actually, no, not probably, for sure I wouldn't have managed at all. QuoteLatest Block:   770497  (18 minutes ago)Current Pace:   108.8493%  (386 / 354.62 expected, 31.38 ahead)It's not 23% anymore but still added around 8 blocks per day ahead, so a 5% pace increase to the previous, so it will not only recoup the last period but add at around 2% on top, of course, if things don't change.Also, you're not the only ones expanding, just got an email update from marathon releasing their numbers:  QuoteAs of January 1, operating mining fleet consisted of approximately 69,000 active miners, capable of producing approximately 7.0 EH/s2.1 EH/s is currently pending energization after 1,000 S19 XPs were installed in DecemberDepending on Applied Digital’s energization timeline, the Company expects to have between 12.0 EH/s and 15.0 EH/s online by March 31, 2023So an extra 8 exahash by march, another 3% from them alone.sometimes I don't know how I do it. but I have multiple people in on it. The biggest issues holding back expansion to say 500-600kwatts are distance to the mines.Howell,NJ  to Clifton, NJ is 100KM or 65 miles. Cost to drive with tolls and gas is $30 and 3 hours round trip.Howell,NJ to the PA location is  300Km or 180 miles. cost to drive with tools and gas is $80 and 9 hour round tripthose are with okay traffic if traffic sucks it is more.I have found an good asic mine setup properly needs 10-15 visits a year. If we do both and tie in the visits it is 2-3 days every 4 weeks or so. I would do it if the spilt was 2 way it will be 4 way.So it means 8ph/4= 2ph for 'free' that is only 121 usd  a day or 3600 a month. I don't count my on line time which is quite a bit.If we could set up 20ph 4 way split this year and my 5ph clears me 9129 usd a month I would be in with no questions asked.I know we do the Clifton,NJ mine  to the max this year. not sure about the one in PA (ie it has no gear just a lot of power) if we do PA it will be a trailer setup.",

We are at a higher point in difficulty than we have ever been before, of course, not saying things couldn't get worse, but the point is, the numbers you run right now could be 2-5x in two years.It would be perfect if you wouldn't risk anything and just wait for the market to get better, but then the four of you will have no way to buy 8PH worth of hashrate, if it's 14$ th now, that's a total of nearly 100k, if profitability is 5x better next year, it will take half a million dollars to buy that same hashrate, let alone 20PH when the price per terahash is back to the 40-50$ mark.So think of it as somehow a future investment, won't be worth the trouble and the rides for maybe 1-2 years, but when the time comes, you would probably be willing to walk the same distance.",

All gear in one plant site. Maybe two 150,000 sq foot buildings with liquid cooling could do the trick. let me think that over.say a 5 by 3 basin stacked 4 high does 32 s19's that is 15 square ft so 10 stacks of them is 150 square ft  and 320 units.1000 stacks of them is 15000 square ft and  32000 units so yeah only one 45000 foot building with 3000 stacks of liquid cooling bins would do 96000 s19's that would be a sight to see. Hopefully the liquid would be not flammable",
