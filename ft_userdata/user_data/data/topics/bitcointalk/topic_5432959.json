Been contacting various tokens to see if they're interested but not getting much success and thought I'd reach out to the forum to see if you had any ideas. Btw BTC was the first coin that you could earn in the game so thought itd be ok to post in here   Would crazy appreciate it if you had any thoughts! Thank you!",

Based on the reviews I can see that some users are not happy with the game itself, hence if you charge them a lot to put their token there they won't be interested. There are other media where new projects can easily do their marketing, I think it will be difficult to compete with them because they can provide awareness for 'free' (Twitter, for example).What if you just add support for every new token launch, but take fees if anyone uses the token? That way you don't have to wait for another party to start collecting fees. But I think the urgent issue is to improve the game if the feedback from the users is to be trusted.",

      "body": "As far as I know, implementing tokens into games requires a special ERC20 contract that is dedicated to one game from the start so that tokens have economic value based on token development. Adding existing tokens will not help the game system in depth, only serves as a prize payment (and even then \"bluechip\" tokens are needed so that players are really interested).Instead, you need to set up a game-based dedicated token development team so that you have your own unique token and allow for token adjustments and upgrades at your own pace.",

This is very good.For ERC-20, I believe you can do , even if it is expensive as examplens said. You can just increase the minium withdrawal and the fees inside the game to allow people to withdrawal.There are games such as https://spllnterlends.com/ which allows many blockchains to withdrawal, including ERC20 (probably few users will use it, as it is expansive)",

Agree that improving the game itself is the way forward but hoping some projects can find approaching 000s of in-game users (and the Japan market) interesting! Thanks for the idea!",
