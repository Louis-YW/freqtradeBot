For businesses, accommodating this growing demographic would mean an expansion of their potential client base.QuoteThe process of accepting cryptoWhether a company sets up its own node like Tesla or opts for a payments processor to facilitate the transaction, the way to do it is more or less the same but differs under the hood. For instance, certain payments processors can allow a merchant to receive crypto but would also enable real-time settlement in fiat.With the following image you can see the ways for the company to accept cryptocurrencies as payment:Source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/accepting-bitcoin-for-your-business-just-like-tesla-report",

      "body": "Accepting cryptocurrencies for a business is a good proposition for the business itself because it saves on the transaction fees. However it is not the most convenient payment method for the buyer. So you may see businesses accepting cryptos but there are hardly any users to use that method. Cryptocurrency is great for investment, but not the best choice among available payment methods. Very soon, UPI method will be implemented in a lot of countries. Why do you think Visa and Mastercard has gone to US competition commission to comllain against UPI!!!! They could very well become extinct from the markets where UPI will exist.

However, the obstacle that made me give up my intention was because at the moment in my country I have not been able to do it. because a few years ago even many hotels and cafes in my country accepted bitcoin as payment but were eventually stopped by the local government. because there is no legality. Maybe if there is a Tesla-class company in my country. then that would be another story. Because after all, there is no legality in my country because no big company has yet taken this step in my country. so there is no impetus for the government to legalize it.",

So imagine trying to buy a cup of coffee but you have to wait more than 10 minutes for the transaction to settle. That would be annoying. And let's not talk about what is going happens to the fee when the network is overloaded. You don't want to pay a huge fee for a dollar and an a half worth of coffee. Lightning Network might be the solution to these issues though.",

If anyone accepts altcoins they are usually doing it through a third party that charges extra fees that would mean they lose 3.5% ore more not save on it and also since shitcoins are always dumping they are going to lose more if they receive them directly.QuoteAccording to reading information, Tesla temporarily embracing Bitcoin as a method of payment for its products was conceivably one of the catalysts that pushed asset prices to record highs last year and put the spotlight on crypto legitimacy particularly in the realm of payments.I disagree because this was not a major news, not to mention that Tesla is not a company that has that many customers in first place. It is not like a grocery store that everyone is visiting regularly! How many people are buying their very expensive products anyway and of those how many are paying with bitcoin?!!QuoteCryptocurrencies are believed to be in a phase of hyper-adoptionWrong. Bitcoin is considered that not cryptocurrencies, in fact everyone considers altcoins to be a pump and dump overhyped nonsense.",

It boosts their popularity and attracts some customers that are also pro-crypto. There is nothing wrong if they convert it to fiat immediately, it is considered their profit not an investment. If they plan to make it as an investment then they should have a separate fund that will cover that bitcoins' current value in fiat so their business won't lose profit.",

In my opinion, such behavior did more harm to Bitcoin than good - because it only supported those who spread the idea that Bitcoin is dangerous to the environment.If we take into account that Mr. Mars has not yet changed his mind despite various studies that say that most of the energy for mining comes from renewable energy sources, I wonder how much damage he still does today in terms of discouraging others from accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment in their companies?",

Tesla Will have more bitcoins for each payment as compared to what they were receiving the last year. This I’m stating on the basis of fiat value for bitcoin. Like more qty of bitcoins would be in the wallets of Tesla in current state. However, it is not beneficial to for user to buy bitcoin and then buy Tesla. Because Tesla would be stagnant investment while on the other hand buying bitcoin and holding the same for a year or so can have double the money.",
