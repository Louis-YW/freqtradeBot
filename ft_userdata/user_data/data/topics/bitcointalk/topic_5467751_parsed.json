  "content": "Alik BakhshiArmenia and the failed Crusade         Having lost the last two wars to Azerbaijan, the Armenians, finally convinced that the Russians no longer intended to fight for them, turned to the West in the hope of finding new patrons to realize the dream of creating a chimerical Greater Armenia from sea to sea. To this end, the Armenians began to once again exploit the Christian idea of ungrateful barbarian Muslims who had seized the promised land and, it must be said, found fertile soil in France (1), which in the past was the most active participant in the Crusades against the Saracens. Only this time, instead of the promised land, Azerbaijan was offered, which is about to begin the genocide of the Christian Armenian people.      It seems that the French liked the idea of a new Crusade, but in order not to be alone in this godly undertaking, they decided to attract fellow travelers through the UN and urgently convened the Security Council to condemn Azerbaijan with the adoption of subsequent sanctions, and possibly forceful methods. However, unexpectedly, one might say, right during a meeting of the Security Council, the Armenians let France down by officially abandoning territorial claims to Azerbaijan, thereby making France a laughing stock. Members of the Security Council, who already had enough problems with the war in Ukraine, breathed a sigh of relief and peacefully dispersed, mentally scolding the French representative.          As a result, Armenia, which uses political chicanery (2) and has traditionally betrayed its allies in history, flogged itself, burying the “Great Armenia” project (3, 4).1.

At the latter date, the chief threat to the Crusaders from the east and north became the Zengids. The conflict was generally fought between European Crusaders and the Seljuk Turks and their vassals. The Muslim Syrian emirates occasionally allied themselves with the Christians against rival states. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_the_Crusader_states.",
