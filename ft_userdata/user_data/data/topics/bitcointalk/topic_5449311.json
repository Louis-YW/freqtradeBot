  "content": "Hello guys I wrote this article. Read it here for better formatting:https://www.jbgsmining.com/en/post/central-african-republic-drops-bitcoin-as-legal-tenderIn April 2022, the Central African Republic (CAR) introduced Bitcoin as legal tender, aiming to position itself as one of the \"bravest and most visionary countries in the world.\" However, just one year later, the country has reversed its decision and passed a new law restricting the use of cryptocurrencies once again.The CAR is one of the poorest countries in the world, struggling with numerous challenges such as political instability, crumbling infrastructure, and food shortages. Nevertheless, last year, the country decided to introduce Bitcoin as legal tender, following El Salvador as the second nation to take this bold step. However, the move generated little interest as most business owners preferred to focus on improving infrastructure and security.From the very beginning, the introduction of Bitcoin as legal tender was met with skepticism, not least because of the CAR's close ties with Russia and suspicions that the use of cryptocurrencies could serve to circumvent sanctions. Additionally, the United Nations warned that cryptocurrencies in developing countries could be associated with high risks and costs.Now, the Central African Republic has reversed its decision and repealed the original law. Instead, a new law has been enacted, designating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as reference values that citizens can voluntarily use or accept as payment.The failure of the Bitcoin project in the CAR can be attributed primarily to the country's economic situation and lack of development. From the outset of the Bitcoin introduction, there were strong doubts about the project's success, as only about ten percent of the population had access to the internet. Furthermore, the promised economic benefits never materialized, and planned projects like building a Bitcoin city or launching their own cryptocurrency stalled.",

Poverty was one of the major challenges of that country. When citizens are focused on satisfying their essential needs and they don't even have savings, how will they embrace Bitcoin?Another factor might be external influence. Some international banking and lending organisation like the BEAC and IMF may be mounting pressure on the government of CAR to reverse its policy on Bitcoin. President Faustin Archange Touadera is not as dogged as Nayib Bukele that withstood all the pressures.",

They're still accepting it, just not forcing people to do it as they would in case of a legal tender. I feel like poor countries shouldn't push it if they have very little tech savvy people. In places where you're scared of displaying your phone in public so you don't get robbed, you can't expect people to start paying with bitcoin. That said, Mexico is making a move towards accepting bitcoin as we speak and this isn't the richest, nor the safest country, so it can be done and it's going to be done more often in future. IMO a great first step is not to make it hard for those who want to accept bitcoin, give people some freedom and it will grow in its own pace.",

Ethiopia is also making the move to go in with bitcoin but the unfortunate thing is countries that are not yet prepared are those initiating such move. Like the case of CAR with less than 10% of her population having access to internet facility was a project waiting to crash. Thinking deeply, I think there are few reasons for the rush to throw in all in the bid to make bitcoin a legal tender and that is countries trying to think bitcoin will improve their sorry economic status and overnight land them into economic riches whilst they are still deep in corruption. CAR is one of the poorest countries in Africa with illiteracy rate and no prior inclination towards bitcoin by its youths and citizens. Another reason for the rush for making bitcoin a legal tender is to have an financial escape route like we have seen in some was zone countries who are trying to escape some financial sanctions like Russia.",
