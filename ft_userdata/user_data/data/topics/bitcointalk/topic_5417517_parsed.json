The browser market is flooded with new products every month, it is almost impossible to test each one.An Overview of Gologin Anti-detect BrowserIn this article we will analyze the already recognizable GoLogin anti-detection browser.

By the way, the antidetect browser works on all platforms: ●   iOS;●   Linux;●   Windows;●   Android.As it turns out, the price is not the main advantage, but if you pay for a year – 3-4 times cheaper.What Functionality Is Available in Gologin?What is the antidetect browser GoLogin? It is not just a Chromium-based browser: 1.   It uses a maximum imitation of the real Google Chrome. 2.   It allows you to manage up to 10,000 profiles on a Custom tariff with different access levels.3.   There is a mass import of accounts from stores.4.   Creating virtual profiles and swapping fingerprints.5.   A lot of attention is paid to usability and automation of routine processes, so that the preparation and creation of profiles takes a minimum of time.

We use several checkers to make sure – the anti-detect browser passes all the checks:●   iphey.com;●   abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/;●   whoer.net.Creating FoldersYou can create folders for convenient account management:Creating Fold Each folder can be configured to a different level of access, with granular granularity for each user's profile.
