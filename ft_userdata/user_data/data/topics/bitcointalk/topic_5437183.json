  "content": "I'm aware if this kind this has been discussed before in the past, but I think it's need repetition since I see many users in this forum still not care with these mistakes:1. Compress your image to make it lighter and resize your image.You don't need to upload your heavy image which will make people need to wait more longer to see the image properly. You can compress your image in very simple and fast, just upload your image in this site https://tinypng.com/ and then download it after it's completed. When you have upload your image to third party hosting image e.g. imgbb or imgur and copy the BBCode in your post, make sure you click the preview first and if the image is really big and it make your screen is full with your image alone, just use \"width=400\" or \"height=400\" don't need to use width and height in the same image since it would make the image looks really terrible.Code:[img width=400]https://[/img]2. Quote only the part you want to reply.Many users still quoting someone post in full, moreover they're don't care to delete the previous quoted text which can make it look like a pyramid. There's no need to quote previous quoted if you're only want to reply the latest post, I don't think any user will read the previous quote since it's quite hard to read especially it's full of text. If you're still don't quite understand about BBCode, you can learn it from this thread [TIPS] to avoid pyramid quotes (for Newbies) Quote from: zQuote from: yQuote from: xLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Familiarize to use report to moderator button, not only giving advice to the @OPGiving advice to the @OP about his mistake isn't wrong, but most of the @OP aren't care to comeback to their own thread and continue to discuss, most of them only abandon it. Some of the advice like:Move this topic to x sectionLock this topic to prevent from spamPosting in a row isn't allowedIf you not report the post and only wait the @OP to correct his mistake, only 10% will do it.Quote from: 1miau on January 30, 2023, 02:56:50 AM4. Proper quoting and linking sources to avoid plagiarismPlagiarism will lead to a ban of your Bitcointalk account because it's against Bitcointalk's forum rules: Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM33.

Chances to get your account back are very low. So please be careful and don't plagiarize by paying attention to: When copy-pasting content from sources outside the forum (Twitter, News etc) you need to provide a link to the original source.

Proper quoting and linking sources to avoid plagiarismNow this is the most important part that must be avoided by newbies, I think Op should add this point to increase the awareness of those who often ignore this prohibition. Newbies who find it difficult to Up Rank often make copy-paste mistakes without attaching the source to lure other users to distribute merit to them. Plagiarism is a form of behavior that violates the principle of honesty, this must be campaigned continuously for newbies so that they can be taken seriously with concrete preventive measures.",

This is something basic and needs to be used when writing a long post. Proper way of quoting a reply is very important but I have seen a lot of the members quoting more than one reply to make a reply which looks preety confusing and is hard to understand. This is mostly seen in self moderated thread.  If you ask a question and have received multiple answers to your query then it is advised to lock that thread. A discussion thread can be kept open. I see very few members following the rule. Locking a thread is important to stop spam replies.",

Proper quoting and linking sources to avoid plagiarismI really understand about plagiarism will lead you get banned because this forum has zero tolerance against that. But after I read this one proper quoting and linking source aren't need to avoid plagiarism in this forum That's user just write he took it from someone article without linking the source and he's not get banned! There's a user saying, it just a bad citation and he has no intention to plagiarism it, so he's free. Although it's true, but it's still on grey area if it's completely 100% allowed or the moderators will ban him if he's keep repeating same mistake for not linking the original sources.There's someone get exposed if he was plagiarism for 7 posts, the thing is the account still active until now without receiving any punishment Quote from: cydrix on January 30, 2023, 04:39:48 AMAvoid bumping threads that has not been posted for a long time.They're not follwing this warning when they try to reply on a thread that has been quite for long time.Quote from: zWarning: this topic has not been posted in for at least 120 days.Unless you're sure you want to reply, please consider starting a new topic.It's true, but I think it's mostly a newbie who bump an old thread without any reason.I'm more concerned with many old users doesn't use their eyes to see the date of the thread and the last replies, when someone already replying to the old thread, you wouldn't see any warning message  again. So there are a lot users only read the last reply and continue to make post, if they use their eyes, they will know to avoid the thread and just use report to moderator to delete the recent reply or lock the thread.",
