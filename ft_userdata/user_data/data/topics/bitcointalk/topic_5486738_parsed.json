  "content": "With the vast improvement of technology across our world, finances, cryptocurrency, AI and even in the communication sector right now, from the time of 2G to 5G which is widely in use right now, our mobile phones, laptops, network servers now operate on 5G network with its high speed, high bandwidth, low latency and other improvement. 5G has shown great positive effects on the across the technology of our time, given at the speed in which, data is been generated and processed.    I like to think this will help boost the Bitcoin network, I tend to believe Bitcoin servers are now running on 5G  which will help Bitcoiners in terms of as per: 1) Network congestion: With 5G now the network congestion has reduced because of its high speed processing power which would therefore aid the rate at which, Bitcoin miners and the entire Blockchain network carryout it’s activities with less stress. Which in turn saves time while increasing efficiency. 2)It would also ensure safety of data been stored in the network since it connects various devices at a time. 3)It would also save cost, like some people interested in running Bitcoin core nodes can now access it without those secluded devices, with bigger storage or need some Blockchain free data servers which is expensive thereby making some person uninterested but now with 5G we don't really rely on the servers again, with 5G and it's improvement more man-power will be added making the Bitcoin network boost and improve. Amplifying the Bitcoin network with this technological advance is a great win for us.What’s your take on this guys.In what way is the Bitcoin, Blockchain technology and the whole cryptocurrency world taking advantage of this and improve the network systems?",

The attributes of the 5G network which you have mentioned above is quiet not true statements in regards to how it will help the Bitcoin network. although it will increase the user experience of global internet users but it's not a ground for the attributes you mention.You can read of Bitcoin network congestion [1] how it work, what causes them etc. to get aquatinted with the knowledge hence Bitcoin network connection is caused by factors like high rate of transactions (increase in Bitcoin adoption), cost of transaction fee, lastly size of transaction, each transaction on bitcoin network has a limit of 1 MB and when transactions are higher 1mb it takes more space in the block thereby causing reduction in transaction process which may lead to increase in tx fee.

Which in turn saves time while increasing efficiency.The bottleneck on the network is the blocksize, not the bandwidth. The propagation of blocks and transactions on the network are not limited by bandwidth. The nature of Bitcoin's decentralized nodes ensures that bandwidth is not a bottleneck since each node connects to each other. In addition, increment in hashrate does not result in a significantly higher block frequency in the long term due to the difficulty adjustments.Quote from: Bravut on February 27, 2024, 12:28:47 AM 2)It would also ensure safety of data been stored in the network since it connects various devices at a time.Firstly, 5G does not ensure privacy nor security.

People wouldn't run a node on 5G because it can be significantly more expensive as compared to wired lines with no bandwidth restriction or cost by data usage. Bandwidth is not the main reason why people are not running nodes.",

The chances of a user having to run a node , enough energy to keep it powered up and at the same time no internet cable near by are pretty slim, but try to find this in an area that has 5G coverage and you're talking about the near impossible.And in a city center, what would be the point?Quote from: Lucius on March 01, 2024, 09:56:53 AMIn addition, 5G mobile stations consume a significantly larger amount of energy, so I once read that in China they even turned them off during certain parts of the day to save energy.5G consumes less electricity on the same data, the problem is that to reach the same coverage as they have shorter range you need far more 5G towers than 4G.",

The first is speed and bandwidth and the revolutionary innovations it brings in technological terms. The second is the differences it brings to the end user's life. With smart factories, smart agriculture, smart transportation, smart cities, 5G creates connectivity.When 5G is fully integrated into our lives, it will positively affect not only Bitcoin but the entire crypto ecosystem. There are dozens of systems in the crypto ecosystem that will work together with 5G. With these, more people will be reached and it will be easier for cryptocurrencies to enter our daily lives. 5G means accessibility and speed to me, and it would be completely irrational to have a negative opinion about it.",

Are you saying Bitcoin can’t be run on 5G or you mean nobody would agree to run it on 5G?Please kindly explain!!I don’t understand your point.I'm saying 5G is a mobile network. On mobile networks you pay for bandwidth, plus you're not always going to be connected (assuming you're talking about mobile devices, though I guess some people use a mobile network for internet at home, actually I'm one of them but thats only because I live the vanlife). Whereas running a node at home over your wired internet connection you will always be connected (unless your internet cuts out which would be rare), and you get as much bandwidth as you want without any extra cost. Also pretty sure 5G is still gonna be quite a bit slower than a wired connection. So I'm saying I don't see any reason why someone would choose to run a Bitcoin node over a mobile network when running it on a computer at home makes much much more sense. But I'm also saying wired internet connections have always been better than mobile networks so 5G doesn't change anything, weird connections are still better, so why do you think this would somehow benefit the Bitcoin network?What is the use case you are thinking of that would make someone want to run a node over a mobile network rather than wired internet at home?",
