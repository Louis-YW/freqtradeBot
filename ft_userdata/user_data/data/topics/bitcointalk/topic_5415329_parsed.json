That's why some experts consider using only 12 words.A bitcoin private key is 256 bits, to make up that bit you would need about 24 words to equal that and that's why some experts also consider to use 24.So either 12 or 24, they all same bit of security as Bitcoin private key which is 128.Quote from: KiaKia on September 29, 2022, 09:53:45 AM Also is higher the number the better with security?

I just want to know how far wallet security can go.So as you have been already told that the standard practice for wallet using the BIP-39 standard the seed phrases are 12 words or 24 mnemonic entropy and it's secure.The word list contains total 2048 words from which they are derived by the wallets but if you say about extra security then you can use passphrase along with your 12 or 24 word seed phrase but remember to safely store both of them on offline storage as without it you cannot access your funds.Now if you say that you know only 6 words out of 12 then I would say it's near to impossible brute force and crack the rest of words because there are lot of possible combinations as you are missing 6 words out of it.See this  answer  where only one word is missing and we have so many possibilities so you are wrong on this part I would say.Quote from: Charles-Tim on September 29, 2022, 11:40:38 AMAbout brute forcing seed phrase. On a computer, 4 words can be brute forced in some minutes, while 5 words can be brute forced in some hours. 6 words shouldn't take more than 2 or more days. I have not practically tested this before though. As long as an attacker has the remaining words correctly and not scattered or disarranged, brute forcing it is possible.This is why the standard practice is 12 words long with full security and really hard to brute force that will take some years to crack it and the small word can easily be brute forced out of the list of 2048 but still there are lot of combinations to them.",

Only 5 words would extend that same procedure to even 7 years.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on October 22, 2020, 07:57:43 PMThis person bruteforced 4 words: https://medium.com/@johncantrell97/how-i-checked-over-1-trillion-mnemonics-in-30-hours-to-win-a-bitcoin-635fe051a752On his own computer it would have taken him 25 years. By spending $350 renting cloud computing he was able to do it in 30 hours. If you make that 5 words, rather than 4, then it would have cost him $350*2048 = $716,800 and would have taken him 30 hours*2048 = ~7 years.I think 4 words is the limit of what could be called \"easily\" brute forced (and even then, it's not that easy). 5 words is potentially possibly, but only with a significant amount of time, money, and resources.Also from the same thread, one interesting fact when it comes to 12 word seeds.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on October 22, 2020, 11:29:41 PMBecause there are this many possible valid 12 word seeds:340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456And there only approximately 30 million bitcoin addresses with balance on them. Divide those two numbers and you get a roughly 1 in 11 million trillion trillion chance of finding a collision. (Now, this is not quite accurate since any seed can generate potentially billions of addresses, but you get the idea.)",

I just want to know how far wallet security can go.There should be an equilibrium between security and ease of use (convenience) so that users feel comfortable playing around with the system. When you add more security to your system, it makes it too heavy and complex, which in itself may lead to unexpected errors and hard-to-find vulnerabilities. In other words, complex systems are not only inconvenient but also very hard to maintain. Twenty-four-word seeds are undoubtedly more resistant to random attempts of brute forcing, but at the same time, it is sometimes a tough task to back them up properly. Moreover, the private keys produced from such lengthy seed phrases can't provide more than 128 bits of security, which makes the whole idea of using very long keys less attractive. Twelve-word seeds are shorter, easier to back up, or even memorize (I don't say you should try to memorize them, but it is good to have such an option). In other words, while short seed phrases are more vulnerable to brute force, they generate private keys of the same length and, at the same time, are more convenient when compared to heavy seeds.",

But in case you have the backups already in different locations, and you want to memorize it, 12 words would easily be memorized than 24 words. But it not a good option to memorize seed phrase, but I understood your point, if provided, it should just be the 4th backup, but not depending on it.Quote from: witcher_sense on September 30, 2022, 05:23:38 AMMoreover, the private keys produced from such lengthy seed phrases can't provide more than 128 bits of security, which makes the whole idea of using very long keys less attractive.That is true. About brute force. 12 word seed phrase is secure enough, that is what we should just point to. Also in a 12 or 24 word seed phrase, if only one word is missing, it would take the same time to brute force it. It would take the same time to brute force the same number of missing words while having more missing words, it become more impossible for brute force.So if anyone thinks he has 24 word seed phrase and attacker got hold of 22 words from it, the time required to brute force the two missing words would be the same time for 2 missing words in a 12 word seed phrase. As 12 word seed phrase is secure enough just as we see it from Lucius post, the point of going for 24 word seed phrase that has just 128 bits of security is not necessary. 24 word seed phrase makes brute force more impossible, but no significance in reality if compared with 12 word seed phrases.",

      "body": "To expand on hosseinimr93's answer above:The computational expensive part of brute forcing a seed phrase is turning that seed phrase in to the first address in the first account to check if it matches a known address or to check for history. This involves 2048 rounds of HMAC-SHA512 to produce the root seed, followed by another round to produce the master keys and chain code, followed by several more rounds to work down the derivation path m/84'/0'/0'/0/0 or similar, followed then by elliptic curve multiplication to produce a public key, then three SHA256s and one RIPEMD160s and a conversion to Base58 to produce an address, and potentially then looking that address up to check for history.Conversely, rejecting a seed phrase with an invalid checksum is as simple as performing a single SHA256.With a 24 word seed phrase with one missing word, on average I can reject 2,040 possibilities with a single SHA256, meaning I have to perform the additional steps outlined above 8 times.With a 12 word seed phrase with one missing word, on average I can reject 1,920 possibilities with a single SHA256, meaning I have to perform the additional steps outlined above 128 times.",

Although perhaps an easier way of thinking about it is that given there is only ever one checksum which will fit the given entropy, and for a 24 word seed the last word contains 3 bits of entropy (11 bits of data minus 8 bits of checksum), then since 23 = 8, there are 8 possible words.
