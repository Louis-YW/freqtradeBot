  "content": "***This version of BTCapsule is no longer available. Please see the new thread here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5420600.0***I have created a program that allows you to leave your private keys as an inheritance, or it can replace Timelock by allowing you to hide your private keys until a specific year. The program is very simple. Move it to a thumb drive, turn off your internet, and enter a future year and your private keys. You can give the thumb drive to a loved one, and when the year arrives, they will have access to your keys. There is no need to trust lawyers or any third party. https://btcapsule.comPlease let me know what you think. Thanks!EDITI have worked very hard on my program, and I hope I have addressed all concerns. More sources for UTC timeI have added multiple sources for checking UTC time online. I will now post them, as I’m not concerned about them being hacked. Time is now coming from the Network Time Protocol from various sources. These are the sources, in order of possible failure:time.google.comtime-a-g.nist.gov (United States government servers)pool.ntp.org (a mostly decentralized pool on distributed networks. Used by major Linux distributions)Keys are NEVER onlineI have added a feature that can keep your private keys from ever seeing the internet. Basically, you turn off the internet and move the keys.txt file to another thumb drive. Then turn the internet back on to check the date. If successful, it will create another encrypted file. Turn the internet off, move the keys.txt back into the folder with BTCapsule, and your private keys will be available. You can read the directions here:https://btcapsule.com/offline.htmlThe only concern I haven’t addressed is making the program Open Source. I am considering this, but I fear Open Source will make it easier to exploit. I am thinking about providing the code without sensitive data, but I’m not sure yet.",

I will temporarily make the download link unavailable until I fix this. What I will do is allow you to move the text file that has the private keys to another folder or device.

It doesn’t come from the OS because that can easily be changed. BTCapsule creates two encrypted text files called year.txt and keys.txt that are stored in the same folder. The year.txt is encrypted, so that nobody can change the year after it’s created. When you run the program a second time, it checks to see if these files exists, decrypts the year.txt, checks the year, and then encrypts it again.You can move the keys.txt to another thumb drive so that it is never online.

So long as the user is still alive, they would still have access to their actual wallet and the responsibility to secure their Bitcoin. If they later decide they don’t want to leave their Bitcoin to whoever possesses the BTCapsule, they can simply move their Bitcoin to another wallet. I realize thumb drives are not the best, and that is why BTCapsule doesn’t have a license key that makes it dependent on a single device. I was thinking we may not even have USB in the future, so BTCapsule can be moved and copied wherever it’s needed. If the future brings us unrecognizable technology, I figure it won’t be too hard to find an old laptop if it means you’ll have access to Bitcoin. I have an old NES game system, so even if technology changes, we can still find and use what we need from the past.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on October 04, 2022, 02:00:25 PMQuote from: BTCapsule on October 04, 2022, 09:13:00 AMYou can type anything into the text field to try it out, and when you feel comfortable, you can delete the generated files and start over.You can never feel confident in a closed-source environment.

I found this website that goes over the various models:https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/open-source-companiesI believe in capitalism, and would love to use the money I make to constantly upgrade BTCapsule and make it a better product. I also want to make wise business decisions, and if open source would offer the trust needed to sell my product, then I would be willing to do that. However, there is also a concern with security. I have read this other article that describes the problems with making software open source:https://www.writeclick.co.il/practical-strategies-for-securing-open-source-code/I could make the basic code open source, and then offer to sell my program with the extra security features I have added; but then it seems like those who do not trust anything that is closed source wouldn’t trust to buy my upgraded option anyway.

The year.txt is encrypted, so that nobody can change the year after it’s created. When you run the program a second time, it checks to see if these files exists, decrypts the year.txt, checks the year, and then encrypts it again.I understand that program creates this files but what sources it uses to fetch exact time information for year.txt file?Even if it is encrypted it has to use computer time (either from BIOS or from system) or something that is coming from internet connection.I can't trust this until I see some proof, since this is closed source and it can't be verified in any way.",
