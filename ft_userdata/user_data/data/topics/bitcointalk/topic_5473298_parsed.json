Rockstar is on 25th year already and this can be their anniversary launching for the GTA 6.Not a launch but likely a trailer for most of their fans. But for this release, I think that the graphics will be higher and likely gonna require some 2000 series for RTX.Hopefully it won't and it's still gonna be playable with low setting. Anyway, I've just started playing the GTA V that I've got only for free in Epic games.",

I just don't understand what do you think about it as an emotional game for PC games because, console or PC, there's no need to compare them because both are enjoyable to play.",

Please support the game and company itself because downloading it from the unauthorized websites might even contain you some malware.",

They are just popping on my account but a portion of their replays that I watch. And that's the one that I like to watch and not entirely a stream of theirs.Anyway, I'll check that guy you've mentioned.",
