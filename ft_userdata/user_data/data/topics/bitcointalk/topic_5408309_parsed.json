  "content": "Illuminati / Lumin Coin is the world's first currency to facilitate direct democracy over monetary policies. ¬†Combines the best of traditional currencies and blockchains to provide THE ideal currency/DAO for future.Website: https://lumintoken.com/Telegram: https://t.me/LuminCoinPinkSale (Aug 6th): https://www.pinksale.finance/launchpad/0x9F1682D401D9daAC9Df5ae090C1B38Adc254Dd26?chain=BSC ¬†The current monetary systems:Central bank currencies: Versatile, and adaptable. With many monetary tools for different marketing conditions, including inflation, crashes etc. However, they are controlled by a small group of bankers, who may favor their banker friends, than people like you and me, for example.Traditional cryptos: Mostly designed to be deflationary, or hyper deflationary, with pre-programmed rewards controlled by some linear functions. Mostly not adaptable. You couldn't do anything during today's high inflation for example, or in a production boom. The design could inhibit consumption, investment, and their own transactions, because the eternal deflation would favor money receivers than money spenders. (Gresham's Law) ¬†Lumin Coin, THE alternative for future:Lumin Coin would be the ideal currency in lieu of the traditional systems, as it allows real monetary policies on chain. This means, it could be as versatile as central bank currency, to raise interest rates during inflation, or reduce rates during normal times to stimulate growth. It could keep at the right pace with the economies to be fair for both money receivers and money spenders. But, it will be much more transparent, democratic, and decentralized.This in effect, is the world's first community banking system, in lieu of the old central banking system. Any monetary changes would be controlled via direct democracy. No special owners, admins in the system. Any one could propose, vote on, and execute policies (if vote passed) on chain. ¬†Development Status:The token contract, as well as the monetary democracy protocols, have been completed and deployed (immutable) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The token contract has been audited by InterFi on PinkSale.Through ABI (Application Binary Interface), the governance system could run with full functions. However, the normal interface is still under development and will be deployed after launch (and long before the first voting session takes place).Lumin Coin will not be limited to BSC, and will have its own ecosystems, and its own chain, the drafted roadmap is viewable at https://lumintoken.com/#moon-map, but the the progress will depend on future development budget as well. It will be the first currency launched to allow people to determine their own monetary future, through direct democracy. You propose and vote on monetary policies, instead of letting some dev's pre-programmed deflation functions, or some several bankers be your monetary future. ¬†PinkSale Launch-Up:The PinkSale launch starts on Aug 6, 00:00 UTC, and ends on Aug 7, 00:00 UTC.Unlike other projects, 100% PinkSales proceeds will go to PancakeSwap and get locked, to build the biggest and best liquidity pool ever possible.The token contract has been audited by InterFi on PinkSale.All team tokens are locked, with only small portions unlocked only much later for later phases of marketing/development push. No tax, no admins, the \"unlocked\" are exclusively for liquidity providers, holders, the community to EARN. Nobody could dump after launch unless one wants to dump on himself/herself¬†¬†---For additional information, join the Telegram group/follow the Twitter, as multiple text and voice AMAs are scheduled for the next few days.QuoteDisclaimer: \"The managers of this campaign and author of this post are not part of the entity.
