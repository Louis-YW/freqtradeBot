If the market changes, the possibility for profits changes and you need to go on and find a new way. Also what i wanted to mention:A Strategy is a strategy if you have rules for everything. What you discovered is in best case a half strategy. Where do you close your trades?Whats your R:R? How many profitable trades you had? Whats the PNL? All the best. and Keep going.",

They can serve as a support or resistance and when broken out, it could be a sign of a break out and in the other hand if it has a spiking candle that could form a retracement. Usefulness of pivot pointt are,1. It can give proper sign for breakout and create high volatility2. It can be used to signal trend3. It can be used to signal retracement4. It can be used to confirm subsisting trend or change of it.5. Pivot point can also be silent at times which can deceive you on your analysis so you also need a combination of another indicator to confirm your analysis.",

I mean I get that in the above comment you have mentioned, you are using 15 minutes of data set but it is valid for how long? Will it change the course of next trend after 15 minutes and will it be able to forecast anything beyond let’s say 1 or 2 hours, thats the question for me all the time. Though I do not want to get much into trading session I would always throw my dices on the project news, some past quick look ups for the trend and would decide based on that. It does not work all the time for me and that’s the reason im mostly on hodling pattern. Safest bet for a guy like me in the crypto space.",
