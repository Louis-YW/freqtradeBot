  "content": "Our first Airdrop for the total amount of 2 million ANH is underway! It doesn’t mean it will all be given away, the Airdrop may be stopped earlier.You don’t have to take any additional actions, it’s completely free. The only limit is 25 ANH coins per wallet. Though, you can use any number of wallets.To get Anhydrite cryptocurrency for free, you need to have a MetaMask wallet configured to work with the “Binance Smart Chain” network, which must have a minimum amount to pay the network fee (about 0.0007 BNB).Go to https://anh.ink/news#airdrop, click on the button and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.",
