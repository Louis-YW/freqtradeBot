But those passive investors will choose to go with those slow growth cryptos than taking risk with the newer ones because they already understand the market that it goes like this.As for me, I've been into a few altcoins but they're the main ones in the market for most altcoins and still hold bitcoin no matter how much gain I've made from those.",

Everybody has his own strategy and the list OP created is a pretty good list if you want to hold your crypto for a longer period of time. There will always be coins that can go x10 or more, but it also contains a lot more risk. I think everybody wants to make a massive profit but if it would be so simply than everybody would be a millionaire also.",
