  "content": "In order to reduce the number the low-value posts, I had PowerGlove design a state-of-the-art, AI-enhanced CAPTCHA which will identify all low-IQ people. You'll have to complete the CAPTCHA before posting.You can adjust the CAPTCHA's size with the +/- buttons in the upper left and right. If you post without solving it properly at first, you can go back and edit your post to try again. The CAPTCHA gets more difficult in more active topics, and it gets more difficult the more you post. If you experience poor performance, typing \"\\\" changes a setting which may improve it.Right now the CAPTCHA is in beta testing, so it only shows a warning banner for likely spammers, but in 2 weeks everyone who fails the CAPTCHA will be immediately banned, so you'd better get used to it!",

      "body": "I'm very excited about this! People have been spamming the forum with low-effort posts for far too long.Hopefully this system separates the wheat from the chaff, so to speak.I'm guessing that there might be some pushback on this one, but I think it's important for people to remember that this is only in beta for now, and that any issues that are discovered with the CAPTCHA will be fixed long before anyone gets banned for not completing it properly.There's some really cool stuff planned for the final version, including much harder game modes and a pretty sophisticated anti-cheat system based on a polymorphic transpiler that mutates the JavaScript every few hours. Exciting times.",
