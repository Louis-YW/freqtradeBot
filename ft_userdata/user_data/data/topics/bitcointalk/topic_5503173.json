      "body": "Bitcoin went up 500% under president Biden. Trump promises massive changes to the US economy:1. He will deport 5% of the US workforce, leading to massive labor shortages and shortfalls for things like Social Security that depends on younger workers.2. He will make abortion illegal nationwide, which will require the largest new law enforcement effort in the US since the Prohibition (which begat the FBI, let us not forget). Such a crackdown is going to necessarily need to come after things like Bitcoin since it can be used to pay for illegal abortions.3. He will surely manipulate the market for his own purposes, making himself and family billions of dollars, but at the expense of ordinary investors. (Trump could effectively make Bitcoin illegal with a simple order, and force Americans to replace Bitcoin with TrumpCoin, since the price into the toilet).The safest vote, if you value your Bitcoin, is to stick with the president who saw the price appreciate by 500%.",

Someone who is not a fan can later change their opinions and views on something when they get to understand that thing and then like it. With \"never,\" you have likely closed any chance to even change your mind, so I'd say Biden has a stronger negative view about bitcoin than Trump has.",

Some time back there was a hack that allowed scammers to take over accounts of big names and use them to ask for crypto and a lot many people lost money like that before it was patched.What some president thinks about should not be our worry, because bitcoin is decentralized. There is election campaigns going on in US and a lot of things will get talked about that we will like or not like.There is no reading between the lines here, because in reality you have to buy bitcoin yourself, they will not make it easier for you.However if US stance over crypto becomes lax, we can expect other countries to follow, which might have a impact.",

Words..Trump may have shifted his stance and made some concrete statements in support of Bitcoin. That doesn't make things easy for him. It's a tough job being the president of the United States and still supporting Bitcoin because BTC's dominance in the financial sector could whittle down the influence of the USD. What's exciting about Trump is his shifting stance towards crypto. What's uncertain about him is that he may yet shift again after being elected and faced with the choice of supporting either the USD against BTC or letting BTC thrive at the expense of the USD. With countries like China, India, Russia, South Africa, and Iran seeking an opportunity to drop the USD as a reserve currency, it's the wrong time for a US president to fully back BTC.",

      "body": "The situation is evolving with time and development. Trump is known for adapting his stance when he deems it appropriate. Previously, he opposed Bitcoin before the approval of ETFs and regulatory involvement, but his position has since changed. As I mentioned earlier on many threads that, President Biden has already facilitated the path for Bitcoin by not standing in the way of the approval process for Bitcoin ETFs, recognizing that his involvement could potentially complicate matters. Although Biden has not fully endorsed Bitcoin, there has been a noticeable easing.Trump, on the other hand, is strategically getting support from various voter groups. He is a clever individual who understands how to attract attention. As crypto enthusiasts, we immerse ourselves in the world of cryptocurrency. To understand how he is appealing to other sectors, one should look for his statements in those fields, which often differ from his previous statements. Ultimately, this is all part of political methods. The crucial question remains whether he will fulfill his promises.",
