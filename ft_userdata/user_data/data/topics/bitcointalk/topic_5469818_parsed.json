  "content": "I've been doing a bit of research on this debate and come to a conclusion about which one is better and why. if it was possible to just buy gold at spot price and sell it at spot price then maybe gold would be a viable way to make money but in the real world, you don't buy some 1 ounce gold coin at spot price. You pay what they call a \"premium\", a ripoff factor if you will. Apparently some gold coins have a very high premium like if you buy from the US Mint. They could be as high as 50% premium. And when you turn around to sell it to your local coin shop you'll be lucky to get spot price. So just to break even you need gold to go up at least 50% in that scenario. Of course not every 1 ounce gold coin has such a high premium but they all have premiums. You might pay a 5% premium at your local coin shop. For a $2000 ounce of gold, that is $100 fee. And then when you go and sell maybe another $100 fee. you're not making money with gold. the only people doing that are the ones buying and selling it at the coin shop. Gold is not going to make someone rich. How many people have you ever seen that say \"investing in gold made me rich\"? None!",

Gold is considered more as a store of value than being an investment. If you want to invest, it is better to invest in bitcoin, its price is more volatile in a way that it is better if you study the price and invest at the right time that can make it a good investment for you and also a store of value in long term.I do not have big bags and that will let me go for bitcoin for better profit.In security, bitcoin is better for me.

Those may have their ups and downs.But it is demonstrated that bitcoin has a better store of value than gold at least in the last 10 years no?",

None! If it was a competition between Bitcoin vs Precious Metals I would definitely choose Bitcoin. Investing in precious metals gold and silver is much less risky than Bitcoin. I am not telling anyone not to invest in gold or silver. Investing in Bitcoin is riskier than gold at present but I think it is better to invest in Bitcoin. Where I live I have never met anyone who has invested in gold. I have seen many people buy gold ornaments or silver ornaments to use. Those who held gold a few years back have made good profits in the present. But no one could benefit like Bitcoin. I prefer bitcoin to gold.",

How many people have you ever seen that say \"investing in gold made me rich\"? None!  The measure of the level of wealth must be seen from the amount of capital one invests, gold does not provide quick returns and does not make people rich in an instant. But when you keep gold for a long time, it could make someone richer. Talking about the productivity of gold investment is very slow and most people invest gold only as a way to store value.If you want to see a much more productive investment then Bitcoin is a good choice and we can see profits obtained more quickly compared to investing in gold. But what we need to know is that gold is also an investment that can maintain value in the long term and gold has been the choice of many people in the past.",

And indeed what you are wearing, if it is a gold chain for example, has a value, but if you are going to sell it you will still get much less than the price you bought it for because you will be paid at the price of melted gold.

Op you make it sound as if buying precious metal like gold or silver is a useless thing to do or a waste of money. And I don't understand why.For people living in countries with a weak fiat currency that gets devaluation concurrently due to the inflation spike an alternative to keep the money value stable is by buying a precious metal like gold to retain value for as long as you want to keep it for sell. Gold protects you from losing your wealth under a deflating economy that when other person's are worried about their money losing value you are exempted in the loss.Actually, bitcoin and gold both retains value but if it's for investment purpose that's when bitcoin should be taken as a better alternative.  For portability, seamless movement and transfer without having to leave your location bitcoin is an excellent choice. In all it's still depends on the risk you're ready to take in keeping the value of your fiat money from falling.",

Because if your opinion is correct, then gold will not be an asset known to humans throughout the world.Because you need to know, in the country where I live, quite a few people get rich through gold. Even though they don't come from investment channels, they can get rich through gold. And this is obtained from mining gold independently. Because in my country, if you study gold mining seriously. There are many places where the soil or rocks contain gold. So if used well, the opportunity to gain profits will be very large.",

In the event that a monetary catastrophe happens, where liquidity dries up for all assets and the ability to transact digital currencies somehow becomes limited severely, these will prevail. Even when Bitcoin is not prohibited, these store of value precious metals will still serve as hedges against the failing reserve currencies.
