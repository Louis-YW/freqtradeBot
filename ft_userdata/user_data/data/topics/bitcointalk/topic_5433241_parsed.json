Additional Tips to be Security Conscious1. Don't leave your email and phone number open to public access2. Don't visit any unsolicited link, downloads or websites.3.

Don't backup your password or private keys on google drive, icloud or any online storage.Well said, since we're on a cryptocurency forum this advice is also applicable to your crypto wallet. Anything stored online can be easily hacked since those offering such service will most likely rely on a centralized server to store those information. It's a common mistake by most beginners to think this platforms are safe to use but they usually end up regretting ever trusting them with such sensitive information. You should not also store or send any sensitive information on social media platforms or emails like drafts etc. The moment hackers get access to your accounts those information are vulnerable and that's exactly why even the forum warned against sending sensitive information through the forum private message option which says \"Note: PM privacy is not guaranteed. Encrypt sensitive messages.\"",

Don't leave your email and phone number open to public access It's even better if you don't leave your desktop or mobile devices unattended at all no matter what you are currently working on and what is accessible. If you are working in an office with other people, in a public space, or even at home, lock your screen if you have to leave for a toilet break or to get a bit to eat. Don't look at it as if you are hiding something. Those working remotely who have kids or pets know what can happen if they walk in and start playing around on your computer. It isn't pleasant, and can cause all sorts of problems. So, protect yourself. Quote from: Aanuoluwatofunmi on January 06, 2023, 11:15:44 AM3. Verify every web address to be accurately typed before launch and observe the security signs Use ad blockers and don't blindly trust Google with its results. Doublecheck it with a different browser and search engine like DuckDuckGo.  Quote from: Aanuoluwatofunmi on January 06, 2023, 11:15:44 AM5. don't sell any of your old devices used in handling your wallets to any body and dont repair them if damaged but instead destroy them and get another one if possible, they may spy your details during maintenance and attack. This isn't bad advice, it's just something not many will listen to. It's a normal thing to sell your old phone or laptop when you buy a new one. I guess that 6 or 7/10 people do that unless you have run into very security and privacy-conscious individuals. Formatting the drive or selling the computer without the disk are decent options.",

You can destroy your old USB drives, even your hard drives, but not many people are going to do that with their phones. It's really becoming a security risk of our times where everybody owns a phone and there are millions of used phones changing hands. The safest way is to use a phone as long as it's possible by giving it to your children once you're done with it and when the children are done it's going to be unusable anyway",

The online space is very unsafe and ignorance is not an excuse in anyway.A few persons are not observant while wanting to use any site address, as with just a little dot hackers can use it to divert you from the original intended address you wanted to key into. So it's pertinent everyone pay attention for these kinds of things.Lastly, if I want to sell my gadget or device I might have been using my wallets and crypto transactions with am very sure flashing the device to a totally new one wouldn't keep any trace on it if am wrong about this someone should clear the air for me",
