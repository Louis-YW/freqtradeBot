On the other hand, the Eurasian Union includes Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, which are at a different level of integration, which, according to Tokayev, is a problem to be discussed. Tokayev makes it clear that there is inequality between Russia and Belarus and the rest of the union.                   However, in my opinion, this circumstance gives the Turkic countries the right to create a similar union state, which in the future may be replenished with other Turkic countries, including Azerbaijan and Turkey. In fact, we are on the threshold of the revival of the Great Turan, which will replace the crumbling Russian Empire (1).1. The first president after Putin will be the first president of Muscovy. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/83920.html   05/27/2023",
