  "content": "with the increase in the number of new users joining the Bitcointalk community and many new topics, threads are being made every day. I noticed that it can be challenging to find relevant information, tools and extras on Bitcoin talk community. so in this thread I've compiled a list of previous threads on Bitcointalk add-ons and some other ideas i found that I think would help new users navigate the forum with ease.1.have you ever wondered how you could receive notifications on new threads, posts and replies or even monitor your own account or your favourite posters? then check out the  SUPER NOTIFICATION BOT (works on telegram only)2. Do you want to add changes to the way you view the forum eg(theme and display setting) then try the  Bitcointalk script it's an extension on Bitcointalk that can work on both desktop and mobile browsers.3.Do you want to check you account status, statistics and all activities since you had joined the forum, then use the Ninjastic.space 4. Just like the Ninjastic.space, if you want to view more details about your account or any other members account, then you can also use the BPIP.ORG  or you can download the Bpip extension https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5224821.0and run it on any desktop or mobile browsers like kiwi browser or mises.(I don't know if it still works on Firefox).note to know how to use the listed extensions on mobile, then use Bpip for Android and iOS users  here are some extra tips you can check out.*you can actually activate the notification via email settings, so as to receive notifications on new topics,replies and forum announcement. just go to your profile, click the notification settings, then click on the notification buttons then save settings and then click on which notifications you would like to receive.* if you also want to edit the layout and preferences on how you view the forum, then click on the layout and preferences setting on your profile page and  select Which  of the setting, best suite you. note, the change theme has been deactivated, but you can use  Bitcointalk scriptthere are some other settings you can check out on your profile board if need be. To get more useful information on more Add-ons, smfpatches and users scripts on Bitcointalk, check out this previous thread made byhd49728 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5148488.msg51262090#msg51262090* Posting images, signing signatures, wearing badges and using avatars. All these listed above, requires you ranking up to at least a junior member. Feel free to check out this thread RANKING UP AS A NEWBIE As a newbie, posting images is disabled but then, once you have finally ranked up posting images is pretty simple. You just have to use some image hosting webs, to create an image url like the imgbb, imgur(note the imgur is currently not supporting image url but I guess this issue would be resolved soon) Then copy and paste the link created in the reply box. You have successfully posted your first image as a junior member. Also read more on this from how to post images on Bitcoin talk **Signatures is a way for members of this forum to promote a particular service or website in their post and equal get paid doing so. Using signatures require you ranking up to a full member. Signatures includes links, text or even images and  they can promote a wide variety of products related to cryptocurrency.**Same as signature, avatars are images that forum members wear, to identify them as promoters of a website or a business.they are used to help members, visually identify each other. You can also design your own avatar if you are promoting your own business. See this thread made to know more about signatures and avatars and badgeshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=178608.0I know that this thread might be irrelevant,but I feel like there are some newbies who would benefit greatly form it. thanks for letting me help out, feel free to comment (I will keep updating this thread from time to time)",

I noticed that it can be challenging to find relevant information, tools and extras on Bitcoin talk community. I am unsure if this thread should belong to Meta. Maybe It better fits in Beginner and Help section since your topic target audience is Newbies. QuoteAs a newbie, posting images is disabled but then, once you have finally ranked up posting images is pretty simple. You just have to use some image hosting webs, to create an image url like the imgbb, imgur(note the imgur is currently not supporting image url but I guess this issue would be resolved soon)  FYI, Imgur won't fix the issue. They created the issue for Bitcointalk users. They blocked requests from ip.bitcointalk.org. So, Bitcointalk won't be able to load images from Imgur anymore unless theymos want to do something. As far as I know, LoyceV decided to download 800K images from Imgur, and maybe we can see some fix from him and joker_josue along with theymos. However, Talkimg.com is a new image hosting website exclusively for Bitcointalk users created by Joker_Josue.",

Also, there are so many other websites which one can use to upload their images if Imgur is blocking bitcointalk.",

I didn't expect it to be that many.Well, this is an interesting concept that I have never seen before. So I think you just made a URL grabber which included Imgur link in it and parsed every single page on the forum.May I know how you got to know that 200k of those 800k were duplicates? Maybe it was the images from ChatBuddy?",
