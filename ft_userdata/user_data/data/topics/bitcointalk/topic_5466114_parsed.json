You can be scammed.KYC do not let you have privacy. That is the main disadvantage. Quote from: tranthidung on September 08, 2023, 01:20:04 PMIf you have yet deposited any cryptocurrency to your account on that exchange, nothing is serious because you won't lose any cryptocurrency there.If you already deposited cryptocurrency into your account, you will lose your cryptocurrency if they reject or you fail to complete KYC with more attempts later.It is good to point to the fact that people should not leave coins on exchanges because any exchange can be hacked and because the person do not have complete control over his coins.",

Some exchanges ask for users to undergo KYC verification so that they can hold onto their funds. Should you pass the KYC, they may ask for other new requirements from you. Should you fail the KYC, they will lock your account and keep the funds. This behaviour is common with scam exchanges like HitBTC2. Other exchanges just let you withdraw the money out of your account should you fail their KYC verification. They then lock your account, and you won't be able to use any of their products. This happens at times in exchanges like Binance.3. Certain circumstances such as suspicious transactions or as requested by law enforcement that your account is frozen and investigated. They may ask for KYC but won't release your funds until you pass KYC verification.",

As far as I know they may have similarities but I guess it will differ and vary per your residency I guess something like that.",

Without it, An exchange can’t get their license to operate on most countries or they might breaking the law since most country is now regulating crypto exchange unlike before that government doesn’t cares about crypto trading.Repercussion is you might not recover your funds without undergoing KYC.

For individuals who do not want personal identity to be scattered with fear of abuse, then KYC is very important not to be given.Enthusiastic KYC, for me it is very important not to be shared carelessly.Consider.",

The first one that requires kyc for any function you want to use like Deposit/trade/withdraw. If you fail to complete KYC then you can just overview exchange and you cannot do any operation like Binance/probit and many other exchangessome exchange will let you use the exchange without KYC and you can deposit/trade and withdraw but there will be some limitations like daily withdrawal limits, fee and also you will not be able to use P2P and participating in new token sales/staking. Bitget, bybit and some other non kyc exchange have these feature. These exchanges can anytime ask for KYC if technical team found any fraud or abnormal funding.Third type of exchange where you can deposit without kyc and also trade but for withdraw your fund you have to pass kyc otherwise you will loss your funds like bitmart exchange.",

For example, most of the exchanges ask for KYC if you need to use P2P trading. But few ask for it. The point is that if you do not provide KYC, you will not be tagged as a spammer or something like that because you can still use the platform or exchange with no restrictions.By restriction, I mean that you can wander here and there but might not use the features. Besides these, there are no legal investigations that will take place against you if you do not do KYC. It is optional, but as you have asked this question, Many will suggest you not perform KYC, and I will also suggest the same.Because by doing KYC you are handing over all of your documents to these exchanges and who knows what they will do with these details and another thing is you will lose the anonymity factor. So, the following thread by Ratimov is the best thread for you to read out to understand the importance of KYC, and after reading that thread, you will learn whether KYC is important or not.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5456199.msg62398807#msg62398807",

Unless you've got an unjustifiable amount on them and you're asked to comply, you'll have hard time if you fail so. Because if you have provided them already with your kyc and then you are not truthful to it, that's going to make them more doubtful to your identity and could lead to the freezing of your funds until you're all clear to them.",

You can ask for help from the support service to help you until the process is successful.If you delay completing KYC, you cannot use all the features on the exchange because it requires KYC verification. Usually, you are only allowed to deposit assets without being able to be traded. And you should not do that because you have not done KYC.Regarding your question of whether KYC is important or not, I think it depends on you. If you want to trade on an exchange, you must comply with its regulations. But you can also use decentralized exchanges where you don't need to do KYC. But you need to find the decentralized exchange you want.",

Many exchanges provide the option of P2P with KYC and if you would provide KYC then you will be able to use all those features plus there might be more features based on the platform one is using.Short answer to your short query is, if you do not provide KYC then you have to face no repercussions instead you might not be able to use the features about which I just talked about. If you are new to crypto sphere then it is best for you to avoid providing KYC because there many other options available to sell, buy etc. the BTC. I am saying it because once you linked your personal life with your crypto life the. It will become difficult for you to unsee it all. I hope my answer might of some help to you. 4",
