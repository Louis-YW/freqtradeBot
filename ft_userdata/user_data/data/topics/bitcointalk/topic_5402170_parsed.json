This is a serious accusation on casino that was already established here. Do you have screenshot on your conversation so that we can verify whether you are telling the truth and not omitting some lines of the CS. No deposit bonus should be honor and allow to withdraw if you already complete the required wagering requirements and casino should allow withdrawal without any deposit since you shouldn't play that bonus at the first place without any deposit if that is just a deposit bonus promotion.Trustdice recently received a lot of complaints and some of them has basis. I hope this one will just an isolated case but this issue is alarming if it's proven true.",

His account was already blocked without completing his withdrawal. His accusation seems valid because the CS acknowledge his withdrawal and tell him to wait. We just don't know what really happened before he got blocked since he trim their conversation with the customer support. Maybe a full screenshot of the conversation will help us to further understand but base on the evidence above I really feel Trustdice don't want to give the bonus.Quote from: dsanity29 on June 11, 2022, 07:27:17 AM after that fast forward  they blockdd my account and didnt receive any of my winnings they just let me deposit and lose what i gave them. im planning to report them on askgamblers .

The best solution is to become humble and apologize to them via emailing the support. You shouldn't show rudeness when talking to CS even you have issue. You should deal it professionally since you are claiming a bonus which is there incentive to player. You are just waiting so you don't need to be rude especially if they gave you a valid reason while you are not even waiting for more than 48hrs.Trustdice representative is active. You should notify there Bitcointalk account to look in your case and pray that they will still process your withdrawal. Good luck!",

Gambling sites have a lot of traffic so they often delay the withdrawal.  And since your withdrawal amount is very low, it may take some time for your withdrawal to be completed due to high traffic. And if your account is really blocked then you have to admit that you have violated their rules. So you are temporarily blocked from their site. You should follow the email and see exactly why they blocked you. And you can post a Screenshot of that email here. By looking at that we will be able to guess your problem.Quote from: dsanity29 on June 11, 2022, 09:36:31 AMUPDATE guysthey just let me withdraw back the deposit that ive loseand it is withdraw within less than 5 minutesThey told you to wait 48 hours.  And they have completed your withdrawal within the time given to them.  Which prevents them from considering the scam.

Specifically, he repeatedly harassed the CS team with the same message, and started a total of 13 conversations with the same message simultaneously:Such behavior, as serjent05 has pointed out, violates our T&C and subsequently got him banned. We do allow our CS team to ban very abusive users because there have been cases of extreme individuals behaving badly towards our CS team.
