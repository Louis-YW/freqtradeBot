  "content": "Scientists at the Weizmann Institute have made a major breakthrough, growing a model that mimics a 14-day-old human embryo using stem cells. This \"embryo model\" was created without using sperm, eggs, or a womb, and even produced pregnancy hormones during lab tests. The hope is that these models will offer an ethical way to study the earliest stages of human life, a period often fraught with complications. However, this development has sparked ethical questions about how such models should be regulated.Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66715669This embryo model is a breakthrough, but the 99% failure rate raises questions about its reliability for studying infertility and miscarriages. Plus, as these models get closer to real embryos, ethics come into play. This is a conversation that will require input from scientists, ethicists, religious leaders, policymakers, and the broader public.Personally, I think there is something very wrong with this.",

The hope is that these models will offer an ethical way to study the earliest stages of human life, a period often fraught with complications. ...... The simple cause of this are disturbances, or what I would call Problems (problem = to become disorderly or out of order or to be wrongly placed) in the internal and external environments.You need alot of stability or order in the system to enable the micro builders do their job well and produce a healthy human. And it's important that the builders are given a blueprint/plan without mistakes from previous generational errors. This part can be categorized as internal factor while the external includes stuff like radiation, bad foods, unpleasant noise, not doing things morally etc This are external factor that produce problems that are recorded as immutable info in your body database and serve as blueprint for creating the next generation humans",

Some things should just be left alone, nature doesn’t need this kind of intervention. How long before all strange things are happening? We have to be very careful or the human race could be at threat from science & technology.",
