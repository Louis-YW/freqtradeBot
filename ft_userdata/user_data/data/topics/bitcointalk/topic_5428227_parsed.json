But if this is true then this would allow me to expand a bit further! I'm still down 3 x S19APro's @ 110TH with control boards on all 3 on the blink... Hope this new firmware sorts that out too!!",

Will that mean lower hashrates???¬† Nobody really knows for 2 more days...I for one do use their OEM firmware since my warranties depend on it. (Even though their support has been crummy) Once the warranties go then I may think about changing things up.One would expect that they have been tuning their S19Pro miners in their own farms for months on end now. Why wouldn't they? I would for sure if a stable firmware that offered a benefit was to be released.Personally I just really didn't care for the unwarranted advertising which to me was quite spammy! Also from the 4EH drop in hash rate in that \"related\" pool that is being reported today I would say that I might have hit the nail on the head with my assessment of monetary loss.",

People in this forum know perfectly well what pool is good and why, and there is a whole section for that which isn't here.@Artemis3 I think we can all agree that your firmware provides a significant advantage over OEM currently in regards to performance. I can see how you can and should boast to say hey, we did it first and even better. I get it. Not discounting your contribution.There is never a need to convince anyone of anything, I agree fully. The intention of my post was not to insult you or anyone else. I was simply stating that by running the new oem firmware it may offer a similar advantage to non-oem firmware which in fact may cut into the financials of pools and companies like yours. Not personal only my assessment based on logic.Look at it this way. Why would I or anyone else run other than OEM firmware if there is no financial advantage? Most wouldn't therefor my comment about pools and companies losing money after a release for their hardware to make it better like in this scenario is completely relevant.I've seen the bashing posts and threads this wasn't meant to be one of them and apologies if that was the way you read it.Not trying to disrespect you or anyone else here on this forum as I understand the significant efforts and strides you and many others have made for the good of the community. I'm only looking at it from the business perspective and how I perceive the fiscal impact (good and bad) that may result from this new firmware release by Bitmain.",
