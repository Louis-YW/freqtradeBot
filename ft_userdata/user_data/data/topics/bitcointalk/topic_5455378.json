I support projects as a Community Manager.My question is this: You know that Bounties is a system that has the most user traffic on the site and most people can generate income. I want to do a bounties campaign with the company I work for. But I have such a question/problem; Is there a tool or system other than manually checking whether the people who write comments are doing the tasks I give? Because when it comes to distributing the rewards, there is a serious labor force. In 2023, doing such a job manually feels a bit like manual labor.Thanks in advance for your answers and solutions BTC",

You can't check the quality, you can't ensure what they are posting etc. Manually checking is the best option. For the mentioned manual labor, it's work vs the reward you are getting.",

It all depends on your choice on how you wanted to conduct the campaign management, but i bet you need some kind of experience being a manager, you can contact some other managers here on the forum maybe they could give you clue on how they engage managing a campaign but i will like to inform you that it could be demanding as easy as it could appear, not until you started you may not know what and what constitute managing a group of people.Quote from: giorgiomoroderr on June 06, 2023, 02:39:41 PMBecause when it comes to distributing the rewards, there is a serious labor force.

If you feel it will be stressful for you, you can seek assistance from any campaign manager on the forum, or you can engage any of them to handle the campaign on your behalf.",

Bounties are pretty useless nowadays. One of the biggest mistakes campaign managers can do is to accept everyone into their campaigns. They don't make quality assessments, or pay attention to what their members submit. If you want good contributions, pay quality members to deliver. If you want quantity with shit quality, act the way most other bounty managers act and simply don't care about the assignments submitted to you for review.",

There are indeed tools and systems available that can assist with verifying whether people who write comments are completing the assigned tasks. These tools can automate certain aspects of the process, reducing the need for manual labor. As he already mentioned, LoyceV provides a reputable service for signature campaign managers that can help track and evaluate user contributions, while ninjastic.space offers API endpoints that can be used with a little bit of programming knowledge to streamline the verification process. But it really depends on what you want to automate and the specific needs you have. While there are tools available, you have to understand that not everything can be fully automated. For example, tasks like evaluating the quality of posts will likely require manual intervention. So, if you could provide more details about what you specifically want to automate?",

Managing bounties is difficult for those managers who truly care about the forum and their clients' needs because there will always be tons of cheaters. This is normal behaviour for those who use bounties as a source of income since the more alts you have, the more tokens you will likely get, so everyone tends to have as many as possible. I would recommend that the manager use Ninjasty.space for post count, since it is much easier and gets additional individuals to his management team.",
