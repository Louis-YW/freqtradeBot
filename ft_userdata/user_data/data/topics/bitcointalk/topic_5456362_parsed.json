There are also some (anonymous) crypto payment processors like Blockonomics if fiat is not that important to you.Or if none of those are options for Tunisia, you can make an online account at The Kingdom Bank and pass KYC, then link any other payment method to that. (Note: US citizens are banned, pretty much everyone else is allowed though).",
