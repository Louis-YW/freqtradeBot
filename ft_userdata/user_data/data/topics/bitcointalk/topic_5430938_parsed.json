They many bankrupt cause they came here for a temporary and now they do not know what to do and that's why they have been exiting and shaking crypto market too.",

When a company is dealing with investors money or even personal money, it is important to put in place mechanism that will help the funds to stay afloat from market crisis and the best way to hold such liquidity should have been dollar cost averaging instead holding Bitcoin as liquidity.

Poor financial management wins again.Agree with you, poor financial management is the major reason for companies' bankruptcy and not the market condition,  some of the CEOs already funded the lavish lifestyle with investors' funds and even went on to borrow more but when the bubble cant continued it will end in bankruptcy and possible exit scam.",

Poor financial management wins again.Your first theory doesn't apply to all mining companies, if they take loans from banks at high interest during such bull markets, it's enough to bankrupt them.The bank gives the customer a high interest loan for a fixed period of time, and the loan must be repaid with the principal and profit within that period.  Then the excess profit and the original combination created great pressure in this bear market.  As a result, mining companies are forced to file for bankruptcy.However, if some of the policies of the mining company, especially the financial management, have adopted unethical measures, then the mining company has to fall into a financial crisis instead of profit at the end of the year.",

That is true, the Crypto price declining, and combine with high-interest rates from bank.Boom the company will struggle especially with new company. I saw the huge layoff on a major company so a small company will most likely hited too. OP do you mean https://twitter.com/Core_Scientific I checked the Twitter and the social media pretty much still alive maybe they only filled when everything really going to wrong. I also checked their stock and the price is climbed up",

But I still have this feeling that the market will come down once again. Maybe not for the news, but how people will trade in this market. Still very risky to buy at this point. I have seen many people only buying when the market is green and moving upward. Many have bought in the bear market around 16k, if they are just investors and want to make quick money, then they will sell if the price begins to fall again. Which will hurt the market.",

Makes you wonder if they are going to keep them or sell them.Back of the napkin math makes it about 1 year to RoI @$500 each with some decent power prices not accounting for other expenses so not the worst. Unless my math is wrong. But probably no warranty and last gen tech makes me wonder what the plan is for these units. And lets face it, if any are DOA at this point MicroBT is probably going tell them too bad so sad. -Dave",
