At first when i joined this forum newly on 16th july 2023, i was finding it difficult to navigate and understand the activities of the forum, i spent almost a month watching and learning about the forum and i started getting accustomed to how the forum works then i began to give my opinion towards other people's thread, as time goes on i began creating threads as well and what amazed me most was when i started receiving merits from quality posts i've made, getting these merit increased my morale to study more and give more vital ideas on topics that are being discussed in the forum. As days goes by thats how my activity started growing and merits awarded to my quality posts. My activity now has reach the level of a full member but my total merit hasn't gotten to the number required before being confirmed a full member. I believe with time i will reach the desired merits that will increase my ranks accordingly. I encourage everyone that is new to this forum to spend more time learning from this forum rather than jumping into making posts that will become irrelevant or has no meaning to offer any idea to the forum. I'm also happy to be a member of a signature campaign and i believe i will do my best to my benefit and also to the benefit of the signature campaign i am representing.I know most people will say it's too early to celebrate my stay in this bitcointalk forum but i tell you in this life we need to appreciate our little beginning so that it can give us an edge towards achieving great success tomorrow.",

Being a Brand New/Newbie isn't easy, you'll need to do your research about Topics, Study tooth and nail to gain a good number of shareable knowledge that others can learn from. Like one of my OP said in one of my threads on this local board. Quote from: Mayor of ogba on November 21, 2023, 11:26:29 AMWaiting I come to understand for this forum how to get merit na when you create a post wey people see say through your post wey you create people don use am guide their selfThat you need to use your initiative to come up with an informative article that people can actually get resourceful information that would be beneficial to them, then you can  earn yourself a good number of merits to reward your resilience and contribution to the forum. And we all know that to that, you need to study and make proper research to gain that kind of knowledge.",

Before you go count 1000, you go first count 1 till 10, then 100, and you continue moving gradually until you finally reach your destination. And they funny thing is that even after you've become an hero or legendary member, if you've not been grateful for this little fit, chances are that you won't appreciate it when you get to the top. The effort, commitment and consistency. keep learning, keep growing and never give up along the way.",

With each passing day slowly you will see that your success will creep into you  merits. Being a thread starter can be very beneficial since you already have your thread to engage into and not look somewhere else. It means your attention will not be spread into different topics, more focus and concise. Congrats and on your early wins and don't forget to enjoy the journey.",
