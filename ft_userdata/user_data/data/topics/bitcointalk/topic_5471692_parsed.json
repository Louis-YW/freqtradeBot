      "body": "For somebody who claims not to promote WireMin, you seem to be eager to promote it here and there. Besides, a chatroom based on Bitcoin or altcoin where people can send and receive BTC is nothing new. On top of that, the risk of losing your coins would be higher when you have no address, etc to hold on to.",

You deposit money to them and they give you a number in their database, and when you send a message, you can update your balance, increase or decrease, meaning that all transactions take place outside the chain.It is not as if it is a second-layer network or transactions are broadcast on the Bitcoin network and require trust in the service, which can block the possibility of withdrawal.The service is limited because you can only use it with WireMin users and the number of users will be limited compared to Instagram and TikTok.",

Then the aspect of having platforms that are claimed not to be affiliated to them, its quite unreasonable if you ask me.Newbies should stick to knowing how it works rather than creating threads and advising people on channels appriopriate to use on financials",
