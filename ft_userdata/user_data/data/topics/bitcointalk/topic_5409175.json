You can close the topic.I think it should still keep open pending investigation.Have you noticed the newbies accounts that replied the thread with seemingly fake positive reviews one after the other? Those accounts maybe worth looking into as well.",

      "body": "Quite possibly. What's the point, though? Most likely these are the alts of the author of the topic, with which he tried to promote his sales. Most of them have only one post, and that is in this topic. So I personally do not see any point in watching them. If anything, they will prove themselves.",
