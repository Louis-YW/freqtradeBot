Back when you first started reading all the Legendary rank meant was that that person had made at least one post every two weeks for two years. The merit system was introduced to stop people just farming accounts by logging on once a fortnight to make a mere shitpost just to collect the activity. Today, it's very unlikely you would be able to achieve Legendary rank by merely shitposting. You actually have to have a lot of posts that are worthy of meriting to get the 1000 merit needed. It's actually a fairly decent system as it means you don't move up the ranks by merely posting rubbish. Of course, like any system or preventative measure it isn't perfect but it does its job for the most part.I would agree that there are too many shitposters and legendary accounts though. A higher post-Legendary rank should be implemented that requires a very large amount of merit to really sort the wheat from the chaff.Quote from: stoat on October 26, 2022, 07:20:45 AMQuote from: Rikafip on October 26, 2022, 07:14:11 AMSince your activity is below Legendary requirement (775), first thing that you would have to change is to post more consistently and you might reach Legendary rank, evenbtually.Why not just abolish all these ranks entirely and have reputation based on, you know, actual reputation not a \"reputation system\" which exists just to be gamed by a cartelWhat makes you think that also wouldn't be gamed? Anything that can be abused will be. All you will have is people then farming reputation. People already do that by doing deals or taking out loans with the right people they otherwise don't want or need just to repay it and collect a nice green feedback. Rinse and repeat. The merit system is already somewhat reputational based as it means that a decent amount of people have thought your posts were worthy of meriting.

You still make money. You think having thousands of beggars making pointless posts will make the forum better? this is now a low quality forum with low quality users. If there's money involved then there will be corruption involved somewhere down the line. It's also not a level playing field as those with the most money and deeper pockets get to advertise whilst others are potentially priced out. I do agree something should be done about all the shitposters though and there should be repercussions for those people who make low quality posts and for the campaign mangers who don't do their job properly and pay for it. The forum would be a much better place very quickly if poor campaign managers were held accountable.",

I detect an overriding sense of jealousy here, apart from the legitimate complaints you have (and you do have some).  If you've been here since 2014, it's obvious why you haven't reached Legendary yet, i.e., you just didn't post enough before the merit system was implemented.  I know you know that, so I'm not sure why you brought it up--though again, I think it's jealousy and/or a feeling of being left behind because of your own inaction.I'm not sure I entirely agree with you that there are too many Legendary members, but the prestige of that rank has definitely lost a lot of what made it such a thing to shoot for.  On the other hand, for the vast majority of newcomers it's still nearly unattainable.  It'd be nice if Theymos added at least one more rank if not several, but he doesn't seem inclined to do that, so there's not much the community can do.The state of the forum is truly bad, but I'd say only in certain sections and only if you're not using your ignore list to alleviate some of the frustration.  But I'd also argue that (at least for me) I find it much more tolerable than it was prior to the merit system.  You remember what it was like back then, hopefully.  There were so many blatant account farmers spread out through so many sections it was unreal, and they were the lowest kind of shitposters imaginable.  Right now the quality isn't even close to being as bad as it was back then.Quote from: hilariousetc on October 26, 2022, 07:57:48 AMAnything that can be abused will be. All you will have is people then farming reputation.Yep.  I've been saying the former for years, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.  This forum is proof of it--and there have already been quite a few members who have tried to or successfully have farmed reputation to nefarious ends.  Luckily that isn't a widespread problem right now and typical members are skeptical enough to see through those attempts before they come to anything.",

Now tell me, what have you contributed to Bitcointalk?From the posts I'm going with they would be happier on AltCoin talk. But beyond that since they are wearing a signature for a scam token. And they fully admitted after asking for a no collateral loan that they are just shilling and trolling. Quote from: stoat on November 04, 2018, 09:57:17 PMMy post history is mainly just retarded shilling and trolling. My offer would suit a UK based lender. The vehicle would be fully insured. I’m open to any imaginative terms or ideas for how I can get this financing.https://archive.ph/QRwcQSo I would figure this thread is just more trolling.It is possible they do believe what they are saying, but I just don't see it.-Dave",
