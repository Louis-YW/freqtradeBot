  "content": "What happened:: I opened an account on Jackbit.com in late december and did a single deposit of 500 usdt-erc20 on december 28th 2022. I placed a grand total of 12 bets in a month on the website and won 437.15$ in profit, bringing my total balance to 937.15$ usd. At that point, I realized that every single bet I was trying to place was getting rejected by the casino's trading team so I decided to withdraw my funds on january 29th 2023. The next day, my withdraw was canceled and I was told on livechat that my account was under investigation (which could take up to 6 months to resolve!). I inquired about the reason for the investigation and they told me that per their company's terms, they had the right to not provide the reason.My current balance of 937.15$ is being held hostage for maybe 6 months and the casino refuses to tell me the reason. I have already sent a complaint via their gaming license in Curacao so I am waiting for an update on that, but I would advise against playing on a casino that cannot even pay such little sums. Probably have solvency issues, etcBelow you will funds screenshots of my discussions with the livechat as well my username and a proof of the total amount of deposits/current balance.Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3528006Reference Link: https://imgur.com/a/vbwb4KMAmount Scammed: 937.15$ usd",

You have to wait to check if there is anything wrong. Anyway, how long they have asked and have you any updates? I have just noticed that their profile on the forum is not active. Still you can send them a private message on the forum.The investigation phase is unjustified as this is my first and only account and I have not broken any rules. Furthermore, the casino is unable to provide the reason of the investigation which makes me think it's just a way to delay paying me out. It's not reasonable for any reputable casino to hold a user's funds for 6 months without justification.If you look at their thread on the gambling section : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5434569.140, you will see that this has happened to other users who have not been paid yet.I made this accusation more as a way to warn others who may want to sign up on Jackbit in the future.",

If don't just say on their public group usually or try to email them one more time During the 6 month investigation it was very long, then with $ 937 it had to take 6 months and even this was not hundreds of thousands of dollars won so I just found out about this problem until this investigation has gone on and obviously we will get tired of waiting for it.From what the OP said, he didn't break anything, but we don't know if he's honest or not, because usually an account that's invested means he has a problem that needs to be followed up, but that's something they don't know yet.One is the PM of the Jackbit representative on the forums and he can clarify the reasons for his investigation here.",

If don't just say on their public group usually or try to email them one more time If you already thought of writing something useful, then at least you could have read more carefully what it is about, because the casino is actually called Jackbit, not JackRabit. The thing is that the OP is not aware that he did something illegal, and he is quite right that it is not normal for someone to block his account and that he has to wait up to 6 months to even find out what the problem is. This is very unprofessional behavior and a definite red flag for every potential user.I will never agree with anyone who says that this is something normal in this business, although I know that a lot of people try to abuse online casinos, but they need to implement better protection methods and hire more people to speed up the investigation process.",

I completely agree, however, they didn't tell you they would hold your funds for 6 months. The support agent said the investigation can take up to 6 months. There is a clear distinction. In theory it can take that long or be completed in a day/week/month, etc. Their terms don't mention any time frames though. I guess the support agent is speaking based on their experience.QuoteThe Company furthermore reserves the right to hold the withdrawals for the time needed to investigate violations of the Terms and Conditions and/or applicable laws on part of the Player. https://jackbit.com/en/static/terms?category=generaltermsHave you asked the casino representative to reply here with more information?",

I also like to see a casino rep reply before making a decision 1 way or the other. So far 4 days have passed and no reply from jackbit. You would think they might want to make a statement of some sort. Their account hasn't logged in since the 3rd so let's see if they make a reply when they do login. I'll pm them as well in case they are not aware of the thread.",
