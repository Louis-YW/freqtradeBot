      "body": "I think it's either:Price variation of how much the price would vary after that point is hit (considering its moving less than $190 that'd make sense but I don't know why its 0.0%.The other reason I could think it's that is it's how much depth in the book you've reached up to that point (there's normally a lot of Bid and ask orders far enough away from the current prices to.make those figures close to 0.0%). I think this one is what it was on bitmex but they used to tell you how much money it'd take to get there too (in orders).",

Bitcoin market price at that time was around 19,367, Percentage price difference is 0.03099% which is approximately 0.0% to one decimal place.",

Move it slowly to the right or left and you will see that it will slowly change to 0.1%, 0.2% and so on.But depth chart is very manipulated by spoofing or waiting orders from arbitrage trading bots. Many orders disappear before filled. This chart does not give any useful information. Especially as zoomed in as the one shared with us by you.",

      "body": "Thanks Â y'all for answers.A'ight. That also explains why I always saw '+' on the right side ('cause as I dive deeper into DOM chart, I move towards higher and higher ask prices). Same with bid prices, which are positioned the opposite way (those which are less desirable from sellers' POV are simply cheaper, positioned gradually to the left).As for how much valuable data I can find looking at this chart, I understand your gentle suggestion. Although I'm completely new to trading, I've been interested in crypto for around a year now. This gave me basic understanding of the market - if correct, idk. But you know, if I want to understand it, I need to start somewhere. It'd be at least reckless to believe that one can make money simply by looking at a chart that's given to everyone. But it brings us to the discussion of what is more valuable - technical or fundamental analysis. If I were to answer, I'd say both, depending on what your goal is. And with technical analysis it's like with health. You can't use one symptom to diagnose what's going on.Besides my first thought was if I could use a simple program which does the same what I'm trying to do observing depth chart - read orders - but keeping up with new orders coming from all over the world in real time. If I could make it, there'd be no problem to set a few orders and cancel one of them if the other was successful.I feel dizzy knowing what I know or maybe realizing what I don't. Any suggestions for such a headache for a newbie? My answer was that I should trade, trade and trade with small asset using what I have just learned and trying to observe any relationship. Binance and no fees trading pairs with huge volumes seem just the best way to start as there's room for mistakes and deduction. Correct me if I am wrong. But then if I switch to bigger asset or different market, conditions change and my conclusions might be worth nothing. That's crazy...Anyway sometimes I wonder if this isn't gambling.",

That's crazy...Yes, starting small is a good idea as you learn the basic and also perhaps get a trading strategy to best suits you and then you can try testing it out in different conditions so that you get your best performing trading pair. The mistake some traders make ma=is start off with a lot of money they can't afford to lose and once they lose a couple of trades, depression sets in.Everything in life is a gamble/risk anyway",
