      "body": "Quoteand remove X if applicableDuh, you mean x=1? You want to remove it? Then, just do that. Which means, if you want to replace \"x*rr\" with \"rr\", then the conclusion is simply that \"x=1\".Seriously: if there would be a way, that would mean ECDSA would be broken. So, your question could be simplified into \"is there another way to break ECDSA?\".And the answer is also obvious: if there is no way, then nobody will tell you, how to do it. But if there is a way, then anyone, who will know the answer, will simply hide it. The incentive is just too big.Which means, in both cases, the answer is \"no, you cannot do that\".",
