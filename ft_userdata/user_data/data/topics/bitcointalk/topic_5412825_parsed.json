No such fear, no such risk.You can broadcast your transaction to the network, nodes and miners will confirm transactions with priority on highest fee rates first. If you don't use too low fee rate your transaction will be confirmed sooner. If you use too low fee rate your transaction will be stucked longer. Fortunately you can use Replace  by fee if you use a non custodial wallet and mark your transaction as RBF when you broadcast it initially.More fortunately, it's your keys, it is your coin. It is only if you use a non custodial wallet with it nobody can freeze your Bitcoin or steal your Bitcoin. It is big different and much better than central banks.Are you sure you read the above post correctly before making yours? i think you are responding to the wrong topic, perhaps you should check properly to see which topic your post belongs to.@op you have made a point with this, it is important as bitcoiners to represent it correctly, it will be unfair to misrepresent information just because we don't like the service of the banking sector, I use bank more than btc for now and even though I dislike many of their services i still need them to transact on a daily basis.",

Wow, thank you for noticing this.

Thanks for checking that out, besides, some of us that have good information about OP's alleged bank escapade know this is not the time even though it can actually happen. Some of us also are not highly technically knowledgable about Bitcoin but we have come to support Bitcoin for what it represents.",

Bitcoin is the Best OptionI really don't understand why you create a new topic. The thread I posted yesterday was a personal experience that I encountered yesterday morning. And all the pictures I used are the banks I visited to withdraw money from ATM, delayed tactics was used by the banks so I didn't see any fake information on my post. Is it the pictures which I used to represent the various Banks are fake or the information it is fake? Or the way the banks maltreated me is fake?I believe your concern is on the pictures.

My story there is real.There is nothing too difficult to understand and last time i check anyone can create a topic for any valid info.If you claim your story is real i can't argue too much on that since i was not there, but the image from techcabal makes it looks like it is the current state of atm which is not, lately there are pos agent in every point which has solved the problem of being on long cues (if there are any).",

And you create a thread for it instead of... You made people to insult me. Said I gave fake information, did you verify my information before accusing me of giving fake information? Jesus Christ of Nigeria. So all those things I explained in the originanal post is not real all because of the picture. Now that you are saying, you don't know if the story is true because you were not there. If it is in a court of law. What do you think would have happened? Remember you have already spoiled my name. And also do you know the kind of business I do that you are referring me to collect money from POS? I am still confused why you created this thread...",
