      "body": "That's definitely an advance fee scam. There are no \"hash power requirements\" for addresses, and \"reflection\" is not a term used in this space when talking about transactions confirming. I've never heard it used in this context before, so it's likely just bullshit.",

Just bogus terms.I would now worry where you got this message; was is just an email or in your Electrum application? If it's the latter, you are running a compromised / fake wallet and I'd move my funds out of it as quickly as possible.",

I don't have an account with Electrum.  My account is with a different blockchain platform.Thanks. So, 'Electrum accounts' aren't a thing, either. This is 1000% confirmed to just be a scam email; report it as spam and kill it with fire. Do not click any links and if you have, check that your machine is still fine.Case closed.Quote from: SME211 on January 07, 2023, 09:56:46 PMThe email address showing up on this \"Incoming Transaction\" is transaction@encrypted-blockchain.com.  The bitcoin was being sent by Crypto Fund AG in Zug Switzerland.Little addition: it is pretty easy to spoof your sender email. Even if it came from encrypted-blockchain [dot] com, that is some random domain someone registered which has nothing to do with blockchain.com. Lastly, blockchain.com has nothing to do with Electrum, anyway.PSA: No legitimate (Lightning or not) wallet application notifies you about incoming transactions via Email.",
