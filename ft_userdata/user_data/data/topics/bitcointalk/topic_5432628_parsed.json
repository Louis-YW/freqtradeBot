As a new trader I would like to know from our experts, the altcoins with good potentials in this 2023. You've just said the first one for the altcoins and that's Ethereum. You don't have to look that far in the market because everyone is aware that ETH is one of the most desired altcoin to have by most holders.It doesn't just have the potential but it's a market leader for altcoins. Although, the 2023 might another be a rough time to look at but ETH has just proven itself as one of the top altcoins that one should have, only if you like to have it thus, find some other coins.",

As a new trader I would like to know from our experts, the altcoins with good potentials in this 2023. Many complain about the state of the crypto market in 2022, they make various arguments about crypto. But most others are still eagerly awaiting the future of crypto. This is our energy so far even though the contents of the bag are running low. Of course there is still our big hope for the following years. As you wish for altcoins for 2023. All altcoins still have good hopes for the future. What you have to learn is how far the altcoin lasts. You should look at altcoins that have an effect on other altcoins. For example Ethereum, this is an altcoin that has an effect on other altcoins. If Ethereum dies, of course all the altcoins that have forked on it will die. Of course this is one of the altcoins that has future potential, because all investors will defend Ethereum, altcoins that fork on Ethereum will automatically survive. Likewise with BNB, or Polygon.",

Asking such a question in here is absolutely legit because that is the reason why this forum exists. If you are really a total newbie regarding cryptos, then be warned. Some of the answers you will receive if you ask a question like \"what project is good to buy now\" or \"what project will rise in the future\", will probably not be neutral answers to your question but just shill-answers of people that want you to buy the token that they are also invested in so they can dump on you.As others in this thread already said, i think it could be a good move to buy some of the established projects now, because we are in a bear market. If you are buying now and are willing to hold a few years, then you should be able to make a nice profit.",

As a new trader I would like to know from our experts, the altcoins with good potentials in this 2023. As a trader you should look into the price chart where you can know when to buy and how to timing the market. Altcoins will rise once there’s a good volume to push it so better to look on that. SOL might be a good one to buy now while its cheap but there’s a risk because of its connection to FTX, so consider other top altcoins. You should learn more about trading, asking here on which altcoin to buy is not a good practice.",
