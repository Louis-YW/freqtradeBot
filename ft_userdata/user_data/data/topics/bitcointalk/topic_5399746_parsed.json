It doesn't mean they control the price, no matter who predicts. Bitcoin is always decentralized and the price will be based on buy pressure. Mean depends on demand and supply, to be honest. Nothing wrong to predict, just do your own diligence.",

      "body": "there are dozens of exchanges. with millions of people. they compete with each other.usually if one exchange is cheaper than the other. a competition of 'arbitrage' plays in wher epeolpe withdraw from the expensive exchange and deposit into the cheap exchange and buy it cheaper to then sell on the expensive. this eventually levels out the exchanges to be nearly on par with each other when sudden price events happen on one exchangeand thats where people then see a good 'price' representation, when lots of exchanges are showing similar numbers......an exchange has a list of people selling coins, they go in order of price. meaning the guy with the lowest sell price gets his order filled first. an exchange has a list of people buying coins, they go in order of price. meaning the guy with the highest buy price gets his order filled first. EG if the current top buy order was $29,700. and lowest sell order was $29.701 you cannot just put an order to sell at $22k and it fills and changes the price immediately to $22kwhat would happen is your sell order would go to the buyer at $29700. and you would have to have ALOT of coins to THEN fill all the buy orders inbetween from $29700 all the way down to $22kand you would be stupid to be trying to sell so many coins down the price especially if you bought/acquired the coins for more then what your willing to sell for.......as for value(not price)over the expanse of multiple years of acquiring bitcoin from users. people dont want to sell for less than they acquired it for.so if the cheapest mining on the planet this year is about $25k/btc none of the miners anywhere on the planet would dare sell for less than $25k. as for just investors. yes some are 'old timer' / 'early adopters' but the majority are newer investors that regularly buy and sellso when someone sold some old 2012 mined coins in 2018. the purchaser of the coins buying in 2018 sets his acquisition cost at the 2018 price NOT THE 2012 price.so even though the coins were originally mined in 2012 at $6 they are now valued by the current holder in 2018 for alot more and he wont sell for less then he bought them for in 2018this causes a nice support line of most investors and all miners valuing coins above $25k this yearwith certain percentages of people in different situations having coins acquired for alot more thus not going to sell for less than $30k-$70k and simply holding/hoarding and waiting for the price to rise and very very few 'early adopters' left with coins actively in exchanges willing to sell below certain support value amountsas time passes and mining costs increase and the 'realized utxo value' increases. this 'bottomline value' increases. which raises the support of the bottom no one wants to sell below.the PRICE sits ABOVE this bottomline value. (not seen on exchanges, its a hidden wall no one wants to break and fall below)as for any predictions of the next PRICE, the next high, the next speculative bump the next volatile movement .. well thats just speculative competition above the bottomline support which is not predictable",

It has a demand. It has a supply. It has an equilibrium price. It has a equilibrium quantity. Whenever the demand for a product increases, so does the price and the quantity that the buyers and the sellers agree upon.For example, if people suddenly want to get rid of their bitcoin, because, say, they feel anxious about what's happening in the world, they will be willing to sell it lower than the price they were willing to sell it previously. That's a decrease in demand, which will drop the price. One cool thing that's different in bitcoin is the production. Normally, if the demand of a product increases, so does its PE and QE, and if the supply of a product increases, the QE does too, but the PE decreases. This means that if there's a concurrent increase in both the demand & supply, PE is counterbalanced. The supply curve of an inelastic product, such as diesel, looks like this:(Displayed linearly for the sake of simplicity)The supply curve of bitcoin is perfectly inelastic*, parallel to the Price Axis:That's because the supply of bitcoin cannot be altered due to a change in the price. There will be 6.25 BTC brought into circulation every 10 minutes, then it'll be halved to 3.125 BTC etc. Therefore, when there's an increase or decrease in demand, there's nothing else that can equilibrize the price. That's one of the reasons it's highly volatile.  *Note: Again, for the sake of simplicity, we can assume the supply is the coins in circulation and not the exchange's liquidity.",

The truth sometimes frustrates me to be almost since 2012 in forums learning about the Internet and never having bought bitcoins, because I really appreciate the philosophy of this currency and many Internet communities and this forum that are always willing to help.  Many people don't care about that and just want to get rich with the currency and then exchange it for fiat money. I think in the future bitcoin is going to be used to pay for very good and kind things that people who have fiat money will not be able to pay for, in that sense I do get excited about having bitcoin coins.  It has been clear to me what must happen for the price to change and I really liked the answers, also if someone wants to donate something I have created a new wallet bc1q0ew6jtj4swmf2ylf9yqeq7wp7xm3j9w3tqwvg5 since in 2018 I think, I received a payment of 0.0002 but my cell phone was damaged and I can not recover my key, I will take care of it a lot.",

IMO, I believe everyone can speculate and predict the future Bitcoin price, But nobody can control it. Because the price was purely based on the supply and demand, meaning the traders are dictating the price on a daily basis, and the buy and sell movements can affect the daily price volatility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the market. And if the market has a bearish sentiment which results in fewer bitcoin buyers we can expect the Bitcoin price to go down, but if the market is Bullish in sentiment meaning there are a lot of potential buyers we can expect that the Bitcoin price will go up because the demand was there.",
