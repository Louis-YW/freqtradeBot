They want to be decentralized   Their goal is to raise fund and then start new project by spending 50$. Quote That's right, after looking at the white paper which is a bit messy the way the writing looks like copy paste which is quite clear and on the white paper Meta Trader you can't copy the text maybe they disabled it. No, actually pdf contains image this why direct copy not possible.

Great work, you can also use Google transalator to copy text from any image.

Bounty manager should stop the bounty immediately so that no one fall for scam and from next time also do research before hiring any project.",

      "body": "That’s a good catch Op, I have not seen the campaign manager before prolly because it’s been a long time I have visited the bounty bounty so do well to inform them of your findings and if he’s indeed interested in promoting a legit project and not just into campaign managing because of what he can get from it then he should lock the thread and reach out to the project team.

You can copy text from pdf when you’re using an IOS device, I have done it several times when I’m on my iOS device but when I’m using an android or my laptop I normally use a third party app for it.",

After looking at the ANN thread for this bounty manager, it appears that he is a new manager and has managed two bounties before, and this is the third Bounty that the OP posted about.The good thing is that the Bounty was published today, and the scam accusation topic was published today, so I hope this project will end and its promotion will stop as soon as possible.-----Thank you, OP, for this catch,The plagiarized whitepaper has been archived: [ HERE ]Meta Trader website has been archived: [ HERE ]- Whois Domain Lookup:QuoteDomain Name: METATRADERA.COMRegistrar: Namecheap IANA ID 1068Status: clientTransferProhibitedRegistrant Email: 2b6cda2fbe744815874fc0df2c3b47d8.protect@withheldforprivacy.comCreation Date: February 8, 2023Update Date: March 4, 2023Expiration Date: February 8, 2024Age: 217 daysThe other thing is that their token [Meta token] was listed on Coinsbit through this Announcement, and this indicates that this exchange platform accepts any projects, even if they are not legitimate, which is evident from customer reviews on Trustpilot.",
