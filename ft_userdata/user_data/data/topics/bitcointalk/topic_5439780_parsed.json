  "content": "Finally, we have a new schedule for this fight, it was originally headlines for March 18. However, Stanionis had to go to go for Emergency Appendectomy Surgery.Stanionis holds the regular WBA welterweight belt, but Spence has the \"Super\" title. And Spence will have a fight against Thurman and hopefully the winner of that fight will go up against the winner of Stanionis vs Ortiz.Fight is going to happen at College Park Center in Arlington, Texas.I expect this to be war, Stanionis with 60% KO ratio, against Ortiz Jr, 100%. Both are undefeated as well.https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/791796 - Stanionishttps://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/766727 - Ortiz Jrhttps://www.badlefthook.com/2023/2/13/23598523/eimantas-stanionis-vs-vergil-ortiz-jr-official-april-29-arlington-texas-dazn-boxing-news-2023Odds:Who you got on this fight?",

      "body": "Let me be the first to comment on this one, this is a dangerous fight for Stanionis, no doubt that Ortiz Jr has the power based on his record of 100% ratio. But I think if Eimantas will have a good strategy to counter Ortiz and his chin holds against the power, he has a good chance to win, and win it on the judges score card. Both are motivated though, and I agree that this might go on a back and forth war and could be the first big welterweight fight this year. Spence vs Thurman is at 154 lbs, so that is not a real welterweight fight and even there are no belts on the line.",

But I think the judge who score favor in Butaev is really robbed, Stanionis should win via unanimous decision.",

This is a step up on boxers that he has fought.On the other hand, this is an avenue for Ortiz to show his talent, we have been hearing his name a lot in this division and that he is supposedly the new breed that will take over this division from either Spence or Crawford and that this two champions are avoiding him.",

Thanks for the link, yes, maybe majority of us here are not familiar with Stanionis, but he is the WBC champion and so he should be a good boxer. Ortiz has been climbing up the ladder and his name has been in the discussion for a Spence fight but for now it's not going to happen.If he beat Stanionis here, he could be the next for Spence belt. And the odds shows that he is the betting favorite and so he should be live up to that expectations.",

But for him to win against Ortiz, it's going to be old way, just box Ortiz and make him uncomfortable by pressures and fighting in the middle of the ring.",

He always throw punches surely and solidly. Once he caught his opponent's weakness, he will constantly hit and punch with all his might and that's what Stanionis should be careful about. He needs to be technical and strategic in learning how to have a strong defense against Ortiz or else it will be another good record added to Ortiz.",

The way he punch them though in the body is very different, it's like a straight right, not the one that we usually show like a left hook to the body. And I think the straight might be more devastating because his opponents will usually take a knee and can't get up in time.I agree Ortiz is kind of scary in how he delivers his knockout punches I already posted Stanionis will be tested here because he has not faced someone like Ortiz, Stanionis can deliver an upset why not, but for him to get that upset he'll have to go through a lot of pain and take a lot of risks.Vergil is the top guy to beat in the welterweight he should be in the spotlight because of his style and power, there are a lot of existing fights to consider in the welterweight division if only promoters will agree to let them fight the best in that division, hopefully, this year we'll see an Ennis - Ortiz- Crawford- Spence fights for the undisputed king of welterweight.Stanionis style might closely resembles Kavaliauskas, tough rugged fighter from Lithunia, but obviously, Ortiz just smothered him with power punches that he has no answer and seems to quit the fight until referee Laurence Cole stopped the fight because Kava doesn't want to fight anymore because he has taste the power of Vergil already.So might be the same strategy for Vergil, put up a show with his power and it's hard for Stanionis to counter. He should be like hit and then hug Vergil to not get him his momentum. But it's going to be a boring fight for us.",
