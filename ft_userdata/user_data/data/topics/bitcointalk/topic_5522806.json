US President Donald Trump has adopted Bitcoin because before Donald Trump won the election, the price of Bitcoin started to increase at a rocket speed and still the price of Bitcoin continues to increase. The Bitcoin Reserve Plan that he has now confirmed is positive for the Bitcoin market and will be bullish for Bitcoin.  Trump told CNBC in an interview that they are going to do great things with crypto because they don't want China or anyone else. Maybe that's why they confirmed the Bitcoin reserve plan.Trump told CNBC in an interview:",

Who knows, even companies like Microsoft, which previously stated they wouldn’t invest in Bitcoin, might change their stance once Trump’s plan is realized.according to the BIS (bank of international settlements) all central banks can only buy 2% of their fiat reserves in instable coins like bitcoin and when the fiat value of such represents 5% of fiat reserves they have to sell coins to draw it down below the 5% risk threshold, but cant buy in more unless the amount is below 2% againthis international reserves regulation is about all central banks having to disclose their crypto holdings from january 2025however institutions can have their own separate reserves away from the international trade reserves. which trumps financial team suggest eventually hoarding 1m btc or 5% of all bitcoin.. however im going to presume they wont own 1m btc(5% of btc) but instead stick to the international central bank regulations of 5% of their fiat reserves even outside of the international settlement market",

If you were to tell people 4 years ago that all this stuff was going to happen nobody would believe it! The Trump effect is real & its coming to a country near you! Bitcoin is going to the freaking moon. Before we know it they will literally find a way to mine bitocin on the  moon or something lol. Maybe we will even live to see Bitcoin being mined on Mars?

It's very unexpected with Trump President Elect, and his adminstration with plan to make Bitcoin Treasury for the USA.
