I cant find a reason.Because a plague named NFT hit Bitcoin blockchain. Those greedy bustards inscribe more than 5k NFT in each block.. Seekers of easy money load a lot of traffic to blockchain, making every low fee transaction stuck there for days and weeks, which turns into fee increase. These bustards are turning BTC blockchain into ETH  Remember times when transactions on Ethereum cost +50 bucks and still could fail? We can get same in BTC. Funny that those people will be first to complain that they no longer can pay few cents for transaction",

My tx used to get confirmed at 1sat/vB in the past months. I was just curious to know as to what has caused this sudden congestion in the mempool? I cant find a reason.The unintended consequences of the growing adoption of Bitcoin are definitely a bitter pill to swallow, especially for those idealistically-minded people who have repeatedly talked about Bitcoin being a store of value and its sole purpose being an alternative to the traditional financial system built on top of debt and continuous printing of money. As it turns out, the permissionless and decentralized nature of Bitcoin may involve utilizing it in unexpected ways that not everyone supports. Nevertheless, this additional source of demand (I am now talking about ordinals, inscriptions, and other NFT stuff) results in blocks full of large-sized transactions, which in turn leads to an increase in fee rate and mempool congestion. I'd say if you favor the absence of centralized control over Bitcoin protocol and permissionless access to all its capabilities and features, you should be happy about the fact that people find ways to use Bitcoin in a way they consider beneficial and useful for themselves. After all, not all people in the Bitcoin community support the use of Bitcoin as a means of payment, but nothing can't stop you from paying others in Bitcoin (assuming your counterparty voluntarily agrees to conduct the said exchange), so why give people a right to decide for other users which use case is acceptable?",

So I think this could be part of it aside the fluctuations of bitcoin price.This is incorrect.Firstly, I would point out that bitcoin.com is a BCash scam site entirely designed to trick newbies in to believing a dying shitcoin is the \"real\" bitcoin. I would avoid it like the plague.Secondly, the current average block time for this difficulty epoch is around 10 minutes and 12 seconds. This is the difference between 144 blocks a day and 141 blocks a day. This is a difference of 3 blocks and therefore 3 MvB at most, and not nearly enough to explain the >100 MvB of unconfirmed transactions we currently have.This quote in particular goes to show the author has absolutely no idea what he is talking about:QuoteMeanwhile, block intervals have slowed down and surpassed the average ten-minute mark, with the most recent block taking a total of ten minutes and 50 seconds to be validated.The time it takes a single block to be found is utterly meaningless when considering the global hashrate or the average for the epoch. We could double the hashrate and still wait an hour for a block, or we could lose 90% of the hashrate and still find the next block in 20 seconds.",

It may seem unreasonable to you, but there were times in the history of Bitcoin when you had to pay as much as $50+ to get your transaction confirmed in the next block. Back then, someone spammed the network for completely different reasons than what happens today, but the effect is the same for the average user - more expensive fees for sending transactions.https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#alltimeI don't like it happening this way either, because vigilant critics will again start criticizing that Bitcoin makes no sense as a currency because the transactions are simply too expensive. And of course there is some truth here, because microtransactions that are worth a few $ do not make sense if you have to pay a higher fee than the value of the transaction.",

Looks like those blockchain project that aims to anchor other chains to BTC is not going to die soon if people keep flooding BTC with NFT and the demand for anchoring to reduce congestion increase.

Silly not to, especially when the mempool is as it is. RBF would allow you to bump the fee at any time.

As you say, all it takes is one exchange to kick start the process by dumping a bunch of overpaying transactions in the mempool, and then 90% of wallets and websites out there start matching those exorbitant fees, and we get in to a vicious cycle. If everyone (exchanges included) actually just paid attention to the fee they are paying, then everyone could save 90% on all their fees, all the time.Quote from: tbct_mt2 on May 03, 2023, 02:40:33 PMReplace-by-Fee is chosen by a software wallet default if I am right.Some wallets do not support it.
