I think a lot of big companies have these sorts of projects just to stay in the news and attract investors, much like their attempts at libra.I think news like this is actually bad for tech firms as it does show they're making cutbacks to deal with a potential recession but it also shows they can't weather the storm and react to economic conditions as they arise (if they don't have a few years worth of funding to pay salaries - probably the cheapest part of the business - where is that money going to go? Are they just going to wait and be innovative in 3 to 5 years when everything's bullish again.",

The effects and the position that the metaverse project has put them must have encouraged this move to ensure that they remain in business.",

I also do not think that it has stopped delving into new experiences, especially in the field of blockchain applications, which it still imagines that it will generate profits, even though this market is not huge and the expected size is at the level of Meta's aspirations.It was announced a few days ago that the Instagram application will support the Polygon network to facilitate the use of NFT.I do not expect that this large number of employees is dismissed due to the lack of sufficient financial resources. I expect that this is a comprehensive change in the policy of human resources management, especially since many projects have not been launched after allocating work teams to work on them. An example of these projects is the Libra coin, then Denim, in addition to Metaverse.",

The money he has invested on it has removed him from one of the top rich people in the world. This firing of employees is what he think is best for the company.

Currently, the world economy is in recession.  People need real resources - food, oil, gas, metals, wood.  Interest in virtual reality and the Metaverse has fallen.  Under these conditions, investment in the creation of the Metaverse does not guarantee a quick profit.  Therefore, the dismissal of employees is a painful, but forced decision. The Metaverse will be created, but most likely not now, and perhaps not even in the current decade.",

Which one you think might be the actual reason? Don't you think Mark had gambled quite heavily in an uncharted territory and put the existence into huge risk? It's going to be a bit of both and even Mark Zuckerberg has been open about it. He said that he expanded the Facebook staff too far, which in large part is directly related to this metaverse fantasy that has been tried a dozen times before in the past - \"3d worlds\". I'm sure he got somewhere decent with it and took it further than it has ever been before, but ultimately he needs an audience of customers who will be able to participate and people are being rather careful with their money right now. He saw Elon firing a bunch of people and it is an opportunistic time to fire people when that happens, the attention is already elsewhere so it slips under the radar a little bit. The economy is also in trouble so all round spending is going to be coming down and job losses are part of that cycle too.",

These layoffs were inevitable considering the financial sectors throughout all of Q3 were all but certain a recession was coming. U.S. GDP for Q3 did not show recession, but my expectation is within the next 6 months there will be so it makes sense that Meta is laying off employees. Not that I would have expected the utter garbage of the \"Metaverse\" to be resounding success, regardless of the economy.Side note - Musk also said that Twitter was losing 4M USD per day which contributed to his decision to fire half of Twitter's staff. Seems like we might be moving past the tech bubble that's existed for some number of years.",

Which one you think might be the actual reason? Don't you think Mark had gambled quite heavily in an uncharted territory and put the existence into huge risk? You are absolutely right. The only thing I will add from myself:1. Social networks have degenerated from normal means of communication, into something that is trying to shove intrusive advertising at every step and \"sell\" unnecessary goods / services.2. Trust in social networks, as experts, is flying to 0. Income from advertising budgets that were inflated 5 years ago is flying there too ... Income is dropping sharply, it is not effectively growing, and regular costs are STABLE. And today they are still growing.The conclusion from all this - what to do? Reduce, inefficient resources and regular costs! For example, staff... This is normal, this is self-regulation of the market.",

The net sum of innovation and development for large tech corporations has diminished significantly in recent years. Which doesn't justify the expense of skilled labor wages in exchange for lack of expansion and invention. For whatever random reason, the intellectual muscle aren't pulling their weight, which leads to an era of fat trimming and slimming down to maintain viability.Economic slowdown certainly doesn't help as it leads to forecasts of reduced advertising revenue, upon which internet platforms like facebook and meta depend heavily upon.To an extent, the large amount of silicon valley headhunting and hoarding of personnel could have been implemented in the expectation of a future silicon valley dot com bubble. Everyone wants to control the developers and intellectual assets, perhaps expecting one of them to contribute towards a spin off side project that grows into the next billion dollar big tech monolith. With economic recession on the horizon, growth and innovation expectations are on the decline. Which leads to layoffs. Although, of course there are many other variables and circumstances in play.",

It's just that their Metaverse-related investment might need a longer timeframe before it can actually reach its peak. However, it will take a continuous heavy cost during the process, and reducing the company's expenses might be the best way to deal with it.",

In my opinion, this baseline is due to the slow economic growth in the US this summer, and maybe even worse in the fall, besides, investors sent their shares so there was a decline in META shares from the start year. that's because investors are not happy with the allocation of funds made by Zuckerberg for financing into the METAVERSE project of $10 billion per year and Reality Labs, which manages the METAVERSE project, has lost $3.67 billion in its operations. on the other hand, the reason why META fired 13% of its employees was due to increased competition such as with TikTok and the loss of advertising signals which caused revenue to drop significantly and was driven by inflation that is now happening everywhere.",
