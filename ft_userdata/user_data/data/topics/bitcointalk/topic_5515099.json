I understand the point you're trying to make, but this doesn't change the fact that this is an unreasonable recommendation. It makes no sense to report unrealized cryptocurrency gains; for instance, what if I report $20,000 in gains because Bitcoin is booming but next year has crashed, resulting in a $5,000 loss? I would already be taxed for the $20,000 I didn't sell and were never actually in my hands in fiat currency, but now that I'm at a loss, will I receive the tax amount I paid last year? Probably not; this scheme has many loopholes, but it still remains a recommendation; it hasn't been approved yet, and even if it is, I'm confident that this is subject to change.",

      "body": "I really think taxing unrealized gains is a terrible idea for investors. It’s frustrating to think we’d have to pay taxes on profits we haven’t even cashed in on yet, especially in a market as unpredictable as crypto. It could put people in a tough spot, forcing them to sell their investments just to cover tax bills on gains that could disappear in an instant.On top of that, it complicates everything when it comes to filing taxes. We’d have to keep a close eye on the value of our assets all year round, and that’s just asking for mistakes. If this kind of policy actually gets pushed through, I can see a lot of people looking to invest in places where the tax situation is friendlier, which would be a shame for innovation here. It just makes so much more sense to tax only the gains we actually realize when we sell.",

So if you owe $5000 the next year, you can reduce it by last year’s losses. Honestly, this setup feels intrusive; it pushes citizens to disclose their holdings, which raises big privacy concerns. Reporting your assets could expose you to risks if that info ever leaks, as it shows just how much you hold. I’m not in favor of this proposal, even if it won’t affect me directly since I’m not in that country. Here’s hoping it doesn’t go through.",

Overall, the challenges of a realization principle are that the calculation can be complex and difficult when there is a lot of trading. On the other hand, the calculation according to a storage principle is simpler, and it does not require that information about the trades be stored long after the acquisition. Particularly for the stock principle, however, it applies that a liquidity burden may arise when assets have not necessarily been realized to pay the tax with.The Tax Council recommends that financial crypto-assets in future be covered by the same set of rules thatcurrently apply to financial contracts that are taxed on stock according to the rules in Chapter 6 of the Capital Gains Act",
