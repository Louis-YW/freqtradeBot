  "content": "QuoteThe largest global bird flu outbreak in recorded history has combined with increased costs of fuel, feed and packaging to create a national egg shortage that's about to become worse.Eggs are a staple that, for decades, have easily (and relatively cheaply) been purchased from grocery stores and stocked in kitchens, but they've become increasingly hard to come by or way more expensive in recent months. In some stores across the U.S., customers are limited in the amount of egg cartons they can buy.One of the reasons behind the sudden shortage is the outbreak of bird flu that, after starting last year, has killed millions of birds in a dozen countries around the world, including poultry and wild birds. In the U.S., more than 58 million birds in 47 states have been affected, according to the Department of Agriculture.But disruptions in the supply chain have also played a part in the current national shortage, as have inflation and the increased cost of gasoline and diesel last year. But while inflation was reined in by the end of last year, the price of eggs peaked in December, when the average cost for a dozen eggs in U.S. cities reached $4.25, $1.78 more than a year earlier.The future, as Easter approaches, doesn't seem to bring a solution. The costs of fuel, transportation, feed and packaging have increased since the COVID-19 pandemic. The bird flu, which usually hits during migration in spring only to once again disappear a few months down the line, did not come and go last year. It stayed, and it has given no signs of slowing.The virus spreading among birds around the world is a new strain that is highly transmissible among the animals and incredibly deadly. Millions of birds worldwide have been put in lockdowns to avoid infection, while thousands were culled.Less birds means fewer eggs, especially as the virus tends to affect older birds rather than the young ones consumed as meat. According to the Department of Agriculture, the culling of birds at commercial facilities in the U.S. has led to an average of a 7.5 percent drop in domestic egg supply each month since the outbreak began last year.Additionally, in Bozrah, Connecticut, on Saturday, a fire burned for hours at the Hillandale Farms property before being extinguished, killing an unknown number of chickens. Unconfirmed media reports claimed that about 100,000 birds died in the fire.As spring approaches, together with new wild bird migration, a new wave of infection is likely to hit American poultry.https://www.newsweek.com/america-egg-shortage-about-get-whole-lot-worse-1777534....Doesn't sound good:QuoteThe virus spreading among birds around the world is a new strain that is highly transmissible among the animals and incredibly deadly.

According to the Department of Agriculture, the culling of birds at commercial facilities in the U.S. has led to an average of a 7.5 percent drop in domestic egg supply each month since the outbreak began last year.Could chickens and eggs be poised to become deflationary global commodities?One of the major concerns during peak COVID was the virus becoming permanently resident in the environment. Due to it being transmissible to birds, cats, dogs, rats and other mammals. Initially it was claimed the virus spread from bats to humans in a meat market. Being contagious across a wide variety of mammals could allow for the virus to have little difficulty finding incubators and spreaders which could make it ubiquitous and inescapable.Now it seems we have other issues with food supply infection. While there have been warnings for many years about over use of antibiotics in factory farming industries. I don't know that we have seen much of the warning signs penetrate through to public consciousness, until now. Could circumstances deteriorate into a kind of chicken and egg prohibition. With mass cullings of infected chickens on one side, coupled with underground guerilla efforts to mass breed chickens and eggs for human consumption on the other?",

      "body": "Are things qorse in the US because of chicken concentration? There were laws passed in Europe that now mean many caged eggs come from chickens that live in better quality than free range American ones. If chickens are kpet in crowded spaces they're probably going to end up spreading infection way faster than if they were allowed to roam but their chance of picking it up at first  was likely lower. Eggs do seem cheaper than they should be (in the UK it felt like the packaging was more expensive than the eggs with 18 eggs only costing double what 6 did).There's a lot of solutions to this problem though, one might be buying eggs and incubating them yourself and another would be to get larger birds on laying eggs so you can charge a higher price (either by selectively breading larger eggs or by selling eggs from a larger animal). There could also be moves to remove eggs from recipes (ie cakes can survive off gluten instead).",

I think this might be the first time for many people to learn about the harsh conditions the birds are kept in, and the brutal policies used and, I suppose, required, to limit the spread of diseases (if one bird in a whole compartment is sick, all others are killed along with it).Hopefully, this will lead to better regulations that ensure birds have more space, even an the expense of the higher price.Also, there are plenty of plant-based alternatives to eggs for various cases, so perhaps people will get to explore them more in an event of a shortage.",

He was listed in good condition.Yates said the tiger grabbed him and \"tore open my whole leg down to the bone.\" Yates told Philadelphia TV station KYW in a phone interview from his hospital bed that he was \"trying to create a Garden of Eden, something that this world lacks.\"A team of animal control officers, police and Bronx Zoo (search) workers removed the animals from Yates' fifth-floor apartment in a Harlem housing project on Saturday.Wes Artope, director of the city's animal shelters, said the tiger, an orange and white Siberian-Bengal mix (search), had been kept in the apartment since he was a 6-week-old cub. The 20-month-old tiger now weighs at least 425 pounds, Artope said.\"He's huge,\" Artope said.The tiger and the 5-foot-long alligator (search), both in good condition, were taken first to a local shelter, then to a Long Island animal sanctuary and then to Ohio, Artope said.https://www.foxnews.com/story/man-houses-tiger-alligator-in-harlem-apartmentThis guy had a tiger weighing 400 pounds and a 5 foot long alligator housed inside his apartment.Raising a few chickens would be easy mode for him.",

For them this would be more than business model to cultivate the eggs, reproduce, get more eggs, reproduce and so on to fulfill the market demand. Let us not forget that its business for them which means they will either increase the prices for it since they have to buy feed, give heat, protect from diseases and have quality checks before they can be sent for the consumer market. On the other hand, I am pretty sure peeps will keep buying them from the market irrespective of the cost that is increasing. Eventually we live through inflations, we understand the price hikes and do everything that we could to keep the life circle on going.",

With it being extremely unlikely that the decreasing supply can be reversed.
