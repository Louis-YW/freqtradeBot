  "content": "Hello,¬†I am looking for an investor in a time-tested and profitable business area.Do you know crypto trading telegram channels like: Fed. RUSSIAN Insiders, Crypto Bullets, Alex Friedman? they all sell spot/futures signals to people.To make it easier to understand how much the owners of these channels earn, some specific numbers:1. TLrJGz9mCjvknzm3VTwqgm1mQ5bbdUnXxV (USDt)2. 1ETX8eU2QjWQaKgiaMYnmsf3UjDeF3Scof (BTC)(this wallet belongs to Fed. Russian Insiders channel)Owner of FED. Russian Insiders channel earns +200k$ per month, from membership sales alone (+additional earnings from Affiliates, etc.)Owner of Alex Friedman's channel also earns over $150k per month from membership sales alone.Basically, profit is quite stable and it depends more on the channel owner's own efforts or investments in marketing.¬†So I think you already understand where I'm going üòÅI have been working with these types of channel owners 2 years and helping them establish themselves in the market. I think it's time to make some money for me too.I have over 2 years of experience in this particular business. I have spent over +$300k promoting such channels, so I know very well what/how and where it works.I currently have a channel with 100k followers (not started yet)¬†I also have an agreement with a futures trading expert who is currently in the TOP 10 of all time ROI on binance exchange with over +2000% profitI can back up every word I say with facts and evidence. (I'm talking about experience, money spent on advertising, etc.)If you are interested, I would like to continue the conversation in person. My Telegram: @Crypto1981 or PM me in forum!",

I guess you don't expect us to trust an unknown person from the internet at word. This business model is 100% legit, our customers are people who trade. They pay for a membership every month to get information. There are no cosmic offers, percentages or returns here. If information does not satisfy them, they simply do not renew their memberships.Regarding my credibility and making such investment deals. We live in the 21st century, making transactions, business, various deals is already common, so I don't see anything strange here. As for my specific case - investor will not transfer any money to me. I think it would be fairer if he directly bought ads for this project and thus contributed to it.Also we will make a contract and share project equally (website, social network accounts, bots)And yes, I have enough evidence.Quote2000% profit, it sounds absolutely realistic. Just as much as the fact that some expert wants to teach others how to trade, because that 2000% is not enough for them.No one wants to teach anyone. Customers pay for information (signals and market updates)¬†I don't know how much experience you have here, but this is a profitable business and I have given specific examples.¬†Expert I mentioned satisfies the TOP 10 best experts in the most popular crypto exchange (Binance) - this is a concrete proof that he is a professional with obvious achievements, both for a future investor and for clients.Sorry for the grammar",

Owners of other channels are not inclined to invest in new ones, because they will simply better invest more in current one.The $+300k I mentioned is my clients advertising budgets.And yes, I have my own money, but I still don't see anything strange, looking for investments in business is a normal and acceptable thing.If no one wants to contribute in the next few days, I will invest my money.

I have revealed the whole business principle. (And I still don't understand where you see any illegality)2. I am not offering any cosmic profits. I only give examples of how much competitors earn.3. I've already said that I have enough evidence to back up every word I say. (if you are interested, contact me - I will show you everything and I think there will be no questions)4. I am not asking you to transfer any investments to me.And I ask everyone who asks questions to read what I write.

Basically, you guys are giving suggestions to others to open a position that might go in the wrong direction, and you don't know what will happen with their money.Moreover, you charge them for the signals you provide. Why don't you start trading if you know the market movement? Instead, you are selling them on the internet and scamming people. At least, this is what I think about those free/paid signal channels. I don't want any explanation from anyone. This is a scam in my book!",
