      "body": "Your post sounds overly commercial, like a get-rich-quick fraud. Sony's partnership with Startale Labs may be intentional or a major company profiting on blockchain enthusiasm. Though, We've heard \"Next-generation Internet,\" \"more control for consumers\" before.Think about it: Sony's main business isnt blockchain or Web3, and Startale Labs isnt well-known. Now they're talking about changing numerous industries? Sony entering the murky NFT gaming market smells dodgy. Why the long game?If they're serious about Web3, they must commit. Workable products, not vague \"we aim to\" assertions. Everything till then should be regarded with a huge grain of salt.",
