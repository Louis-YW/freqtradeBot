This is another scam token that may issued by yobit.Â  You shall avoid to trade it or are you a part of yoshit shillers who promoting the scam token that is still actively traded in yobit? I have been marked this exchange site as a scam exchange site since a few years ago.

That apy was not making the token looks so shady but it has been confirmed if that token was a scam that being created by yoshit exchange site. A bit curious about who the hell people are still using that scam exchange site called yobit.",
