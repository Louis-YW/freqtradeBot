  "content": "I reset my lightning node. I didn't realize it would force close all of the open channels. All of them have closed except for one. All that is listed is the remote public key. This has been stuck open, in the state \"closing\" for weeks now. I think it is causing funds to be stuck in my wallet. Is there any way to move this channel closing along?",
