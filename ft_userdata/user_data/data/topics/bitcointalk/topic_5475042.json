  "content": "So, this is freaking huge event.Binance has been found guilty for money laundering and has to pay $4.3 Billion USD in penalties.CZ has been found guilty and resigned from CEO position. Now he is out with a bail.People seem to be unsure how this affects, but i for example am confused how fast this got solved. So what do you people think? Is this bullish or bearish? Boxmining in youtube seems to be bullish, but that's what crypto hypers often do. Everything needs to be bullish, even if that means being in denial, because they get their livinghood from bullish people.Was this something we need for growth in a long run? Does binance have liquidity for penalties if there will be a bank run from there? Is CZ going to same jail with SBF?Markets are dumping BNB, even though they are pretty careful so far, as it's only -9.25% in 1 day. I would think that shorting bnb could be a smart call after the panic starts. And it takes some time, but if binance needs to liquidate alts and btc. Everything is going down for sure.Source videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq-vIMylwb8Also there are ton of other sources all over the net now",
