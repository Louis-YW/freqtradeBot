Why did you continue to bet on their casino, if you believe they are scammers?Betnomi scam bet settlement manipulationThat's what makes this more strange because a normal person will not continue to bet on a casino where he accused for scamming. Maybe he just do this for some personal reasons and another maybe he just a butthurt because he lost a lot of money playing on that casino then this is just a part of revenge. Anyways OP should contact their support to get more serious answer for his claims.",

Casinos usually detects multiple accounts easily even if you try to hide the truth. You broke their rules. Although the account had been created by your friend, you were the real owner of that.
