There are several countries that are corrupt out there and still they get to say very little of it. Speaking of South Sudan, Somalia, North Korea, Pakistan, Paraguay and many others. Somehow, these guys aren't very shouty about it and you wonder if they are not on the forum or aren't plagued by the menace of these corrupt practices in there nation states.I understand at OP that, being constantly under the hit from the unjust acts and policies that emerges from the corrupt governance seems like a lot to you but in turn, what are you doing for a change. Its time again to select a new leader to head the highest office in the nation come 2023. I know its been so bad that Nigerians no longer believe in the electoral process as, its often rigged but I'll beacon on you to go get your permanent voters card (PVC), come out with the masses and vote in a peaceful election.Dont just vote and leave, wait till the results for your pooling unit is announced and if possible tap it and be justified that you've done your best before going about to being a good citizen of this great nation. The change is now and it starts with you!",

It is a kind of government where only families of the people in power benefit. Their families are those who get information about what is happening in government and they are the ones that can grab it. It is a kind of government that is not far reaching and so if you are not in you are totally out which is the reason everyone is trying to get into power and making the Nigerian political system one of the most expensive in the world.Quote from: Mr.right85 on July 02, 2022, 01:57:40 AMDont just vote and leave, wait till the results for your pooling unit is announced and if possible tap it and be justified that you've done your best before going about to being a good citizen of this great nation.

Whoever is staying behind after casting of votes is still standing to risk their lives because they have thugs that can come to destabilise and shoot to say a few.",

The Dictatorial government goes out and does whatever it wants.The US isn't a Democracy. Only the US Government is. The rest of the US is a Republic... freedom for the people.Is it the same for any place in Nigeria? Or are all the people included in the Nigerian Democracy, and none of them in a Republic?",

To some scholars e.g Aristotle doesn't believe in the existence of democracy as a system of government simply because it is not practicable based on what it preaches. It is just Nigeria and most of many other African countries tend to abuse power and have no regards to the constitution and democracy they practiced. Although democracy offers fair system of government despite its lapses after all.",

Best they can do is to change the law for future instances if they want to but that too shouldn't alter the very essence of the constitution. So constitution should always be supreme and not easily alterable for major laws.",

It is the very best for Nigeria and they have been maintaining it.@Lordhermes, I disagree with you that Nigeria is practicing a democratic system of government as you stated here. There are certain things that a county that is under a democratic government experience that is still lacking in Nigeria and that is why the country is facing a lot of hardship and suffering today, the word freedom of speech is found in democracy but when you rise to speak against the corrupt politicians here you will be arrested and imprisoned for speaking against them. In a democracy, people stand to elect who they prefer as a credible candidate to be their president but in Nigeria the reverse is always the case so I see them as a country which is still under military rule.",

You have a point but I believe some people don't understand all this president is a human, not an angel which will only focus on his assignment and the more people understand that the democracy we have this day is a scam the less they are not surprised with the habit of the government because decentralization is the true democracy.Quote from: Masplanc on July 04, 2022, 01:54:10 PMI don't think their is any government that practices 100% democracy and no epitome of dictatorship in the system of government. The constitution we are governed is a scam especially the country in the subject and if their constitution is not changed there's no way they enjoy democracy. As I said, decentralization is the true democracy, the government understands this, and that they never want to support Bitcoin in the first place and they are doing it now because they don't have a choice since their monetary system is collapsing.",
