It only works for a decentralized currency and not much else.Quotebecause the true freedom and Quest we all seek for lies in Decentralized system,I disagree. Decentralization is only good for certain things not everything. For example one of the fields some ICO scammers tried to \"pretend to enter\" was medical field (patient history) which has to be centralized and protected by a centralized authority not decentralized and accessible by anybody.Not to mention that decentralization comes at a cost and as long as the achievement is not big enough, it is not justifiable to go that route.Quotethe government agenda towards it's people should never be encouraged nor embraced by anyone.But that is a different topic.",

It gave way to a means decentralization can be more possible. Because bitcoin was created, Satoshi knew it needs blockchain.Blockchain which first started to be decentralized but altcoin came and its centralization began. In crypto, today, we have stable coins with much more centralization, example is USDT that Tether lab can freeze on noncustodial wallet, also is BUSD that Binance can freeze on noncustodial wallet and most other stable coins too. Another is ethereum that was slightly centralized before and becoming more centralized as it moves from PoW to PoS.Countries that have piloted and created their CBDCs are claiming it is built with blockchain technology. They are all centralized.Recently, you can see on the news how countries prefer to work with (centralized) altcoins companies. Example is Kazakhstan that wants to build their CBDC on BNB chain. The blockchain that supposed to be decentralized is becoming more centralized.Only what I still know is more decentralized about blockchain is still bitcoin.",

Nevertheless as Pooya has stated too.Decentralization is only good for certain things not everything, The example of ICO scammers is extremely thoughtful, but I will like to see a world that's more decentralized than the current system, We see all around us today.",

Ethereum moved to the PoS network and made it centralized so there is no more decentralization. Not only Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain also uses PoS and as in the case of BNB Chain Termination After a Potential Exploit that cost $100M in crypto, https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/06/binance-linked-bnb-price-falls-close-to-4-on-hack-rumors/This is proof that the network is centralized and has control over the network they build on PoS. Another example of Terra in May a few months ago when their validator stopped Blockchain for the second time.https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/13/terra-validators-halt-blockchain-for-second-time-to-plot-next-steps/The only truly decentralized ones are Bitcoin and a few altcoins that still survive on the PoW network.Both networks have their own advantages and disadvantages",

Cryptocurrency is one of the most promising projects based on blockchain technology. In the rest of the fields, its spread will be delayed as long as the major companies do not find the expected benefits in them.Here it must be recognized that cryptocurrency users do not represent a large market that encourages developers to take advantage of the decentralization of blockchain applications development.",

Its volatility and uncertainty is for real and that'll make it unbearable if it were given an opportunity to serve as a medium of exchange; deformated economy, fluctuating price rate for every commodity, etc..... That'll be enough reason. Advise people to indulge themselves into 'em because their privacy is guaranteed, bulk transaction confirmations ain't monitored synically , funds ain't retracted for some network issues, except the memphool is choked; trnx could still be processed in given time.I'm not disputing that BTC doesn't become an exchange one day, but that ofcourse would need alot of modifications which, is seemingly impossible.Sandra 💇",

What will be the place of human being in the world then and certainly there will be massive job loss and recession will fully hold the world in the \"scrotum\". Decentralized system should be better understood with the knowledge of the freedom from the control of government monitoring policy of financial aspect of human life and that is why we talk of bitcoin through blockchain that is totally out of control of the operation of government.",

What's wrong with the rest sciences?Yeah, I don't get it either. But they entered a lot of other fields too, basically anything they thought was a \"hot topic\" they created a token for. I saw a bunch in energy field, one was even claiming to \"ease\" selling oil internationally lol.QuoteSecond, why should scientific work or public info regarding medicine be accessible in such inefficient manner? What's wrong with current technology?Exactly. When we want to introduce an alternative, that should be a better one and have some advantages over the existing system. For example in bitcoin whitepaper these advantages are explained in the first page.The funny thing is, blockchain is the least efficient form of database so the advantages have to be big enough to justify using it but they don't even exist when they mix it in fields like medicine!QuoteThe description of this paper, for example, smells fishy, doesn't it? (Haven't read it though, nor am I related to medicine)Haha. That's just academia. The students saw a hot topic and thought about taking advantage to start a project, possibly a dissertation and eventually write an article to have that in their résumé. I know because we used to do the same thing although in our field you have to do solid work not some theoretical nonsense without actual work. For example I spent months working on samples in the lab before I wrote my article on three-dimensional metallography, which was a hot topic those days.",
