Probably it goes goes to volume on DEX, but as far as I know, the volume is very small as compare to let's say Binance that's why it is still up to this day remain as the top CEX and for sure CZ has really take care of his project since 2017 because it not then they could have been in the situation like FTX way back.And for sure many exchanges now has learn from that FTX collapse.With that I think DEX future is still that there, traders will still prepare the liquidity of CEX.",

Yes Binance could never be replace as trusted among cex and that would continue for more years to come. Somehow the event circulated on FTX, trigger some users to take a look deep on decentralized approach more. The convenience brought by cex somehow shattered due to a lot of losses of many people and that leaving trust on those very low.Now that it happened. Surely many will do more security on their funds moving into non custodial wallets and services.",

I couldn't assume that this will affect and influence attention to the community but what just I see is that what happened to FTX will affect the trust in CEX.And even Binance could not escape from it and the criticism made but of course, reputable exchanges whether it was Centralized or Decentralized exchanges will remain active and stand strong despite what is happening around them because their intention is not to fail people's views and scams traders but for them to give satisfying services and can be trusted.",

DEXs have also been around for a long time, like Bisq founded in 2014 but so far, its popularity is still not comparable to CEX today. Many people are still looking forward to the future of DEX, and when they see the fall of FTX, they expect even more but I still have doubts about the future of DEX. If they could really replace or provide services like CEX, they would have done it long ago rather than letting CEX take the market share like now. DEX needs a lot more effort if it wants to replace CEX.",

I believe that decentralized exchange platforms will have a lead in the future, and the reason is that they are safer because there is a relatively small possibility of hacking them, because users' information is not stored on a central server, and each user has complete control over his wallet, in addition to its integration with most cold wallets, Also, what distinguishes decentralized platforms is that they have greater privacy and protect their users from governments and central entities because they are equivalent to a distributed blockchain network. As for centralized exchange platforms, the matter is different, as they are similar to banks, and this means that there is a central authority that controls the usersâ€™ wallets and their funds and the entire platform, so it is less secure and vulnerable to hacking, which makes it a prime target for hackers.",

If it were implemented, many people would probably give up on CEX.I think dex could offer margin trading as well, it would be difficult but not impossible. How could it be done? Well, simply you would be putting up a margin trading on a dex with betting mindset, and there would be people who loan out that money simply, and then if the price goes wrong direction even a bit, you would lose all your money, and the winner would pay the loaner and then the rest of it would be their profit, so even a 1% drop would make you get the whole money from the opposite side, and that is how it is done at CEX anyway, they just provide the risk factor, someone else just like liquidity provider at dex would end up doing it.",

There are many exchanges that sell themselves as being decentralized but at their core they are still centralized, so those exchanges are not only not providing any additional protection to their customers they are even lying to them which is even worse in my opinion, however true decentralized exchanges are bound to get more popular, however I do not know if that is going to be enough for them to become more popular than binance, as the collapse of FTX has benefited binance as well.",

This is true, but have you heard of any decentralized exchange being the same or more popular let's say like Binance? There is none because crypto traders still prefer centralized exchange. And even if we have seen like the collapse of FTX, once everything has settled down, they will still go back to where they used to, that is to trade on centralized exchange. I have nothing against decentralized exchange, but I don't see them having the same love as compare to centralized exchange. Once reason is that it's hard to trade on decentralized exchange as it is too slow and then the question of liquidity as well.",
