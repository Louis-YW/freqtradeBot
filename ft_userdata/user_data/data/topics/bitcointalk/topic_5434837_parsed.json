      "body": "The answer the OP seeks is not far-fetched, I knew a thing like this would happen, so I'm not surprised at all. If a company is dead is different from a company that goes insolvent, FTX did not die, it only went insolvent, and the change of management is proof of that. No company that is dead will have its CEO changed (From Sam Bankman-Fried to John J. Ray III).Aside from that, there have been a lot of internal reforms within the company's activities, and I believe that more experienced hands would have been employed. This is in addition that there are some branches of the company that was not affected by the unfortunate incident of insolvency, and as they are doing well, everything would be counting positively for FTX and FTT.And the last good news I received a while ago indicates that FTX is engaging in partnership with other companies, this would surely strengthen the company over time. And with the CNBC news on withdrawing hope for FTX Japan customers by mid-February is another reason among many others that could cheer FTT market price.Source: Hope of withdrawal for FTX customers",

I'm asking here to know about the reason. ThanksIt's very simple. In my opinion, the most probable reason is merely always Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the Alpha to all of the other coins' Beta. Many shitcoins surge when Bitcoin surges, and many of them crash when Bitcoin crashes. It's very rare to see an altcoin/shitcoin that surges while Bitcoin is crashing, BUT it's not very rare to see Bitcoin surge while many altcoins/shitcoins are crashing.",

If you followed LUNA classic's price after the LUNA crash (I did), you will clearly see a pattern in market manipulation.The recent FTT price rise is even nothing, LUNA classic pumped over 700% for no reason even when everyone knew LUNA Classic was done and then dumped right back afterwards.",
