Every opinion and suggestions will be welcomed.Welcome to the forum. People that commented above me have already provided the necessary information, which I believe will guide you on the forum here, but I don't really think this thread that you created is really useful. I've seen like two similar threads within two days. I don't really know why you have to create the thread because all the necessary information is already pinned in every section of the forum, so I don't think you really need people to start sending it to you again. If you can't go around the forum and check it yourself, then I don't think you are really ready to learn here.  I will remind you of something that people might not talk about: we don’t need AI-generated posts on the forum here, so make sure you avoid using AI to post and make sure you are sharing your idea here. I notice lots of people are now beginning to use AI to generate their posts; if you can do that, then your account will definitely be tagged when caught. Also, there is an offence that is popular among newbies, which is plagiarism. If you are making a post and you copied it from somewhere, don’t forget to quote and add a source link. Punishment for plagiarism is a ban, so you have to be careful.",

Every opinion and suggestions will be welcomed.Hello and welcome!This is an online forum just like any other, used by thousands of users. Why do you feel like you need special guidance and that you can't explore things on your own? Sorry if I sounded harsh, but since you have obviously already found the Beginners & Help board, what is stopping you from browsing through the existing threads and reading some questions and comments from other users? That would be much more useful for you than opening a new topic with such a generic request.",

Grow from reading different terms, new jargon and words that you don't understand. We are here to learn, teach and exchange knowledge, that means your contributions matters too. I found a good resource about bitcoin FAQ https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6jlop4/rbitcoin_faq_newcomers_please_read/ remember and stay clear from people who demand money from you and offer to mine bitcoin for you. Bitcoin mining is not for beginners and no app can mine bitcoin. Don't fall for this! A board is available for mining, if you have questions regarding how it works.",

In the local language, you can ask questions and discuss more comfortably.there are tons of threads like this, you can find them and read the discussions to get a lot of information that you probably didn't need to ask.
