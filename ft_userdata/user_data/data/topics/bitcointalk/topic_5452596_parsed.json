  "content": "The society keep introducing new and better ways of living. Each passing day new tools are been innovated to meet the activities of human existence, this in return has escalated the wants of man. Some of the basic needs has become wants because of the luxury that comes with it, let's take for example house that is meant to be the most affordable basic need of humans is getting even more expensive as new and modern patterns is becoming rampant same thing goes to clothing because the fashion industry are also making their designs look more colourful thereby going for more expensive materials which in turn affects the cost of production and increase in price for the final consumers.Hunger on the other hand has also increased because the cost of meeting the basic needs of human existence requires extra hustle and more innovative calculations. As humans try to strike balance between what the need and what the wants the proportion to which comes first is getting even more confusing. Feeding now has become another course on its own because even the working class are having issues striking this balance. Making the right decision on which comes first can be a way to reduce the pressure that comes with living in the 21st century era.",

Hunger has been drastically reduced around the world. If you are going to defend the contrary, you should explain why when the posh guy who never worked in his life (Marx) was born the population of the earth was around one billion people and today it is just short of eight billion. Shortly before Marx was born, the visionary Malthus also advocated a food catastrophe under the argument that humans were growing in geometric progression while food production was growing in arithmetic progression. Another thing you could explain is why in countries where malnutrition abounded a few decades ago, now there is an obesity problem. Or why hunger and its descriptions were a constant in literature until not many decades ago and have now disappeared.",

We shouldn't quote by imaginations or assumptions, take a look at this. If you claim hunger has been drastically reduced what happens to countries where workers earn below their daily expenses, How about countries where their currency have little or no value. Currently agriculture is not promoted has it was in the past, many are turning into soft works except for countries where mechanised agriculture is rampant. Hunger is still a major concern around the world.",

Changes in the world have had a significant impact, and as a result, some people just do not want to be here again, but others always find a way to fit in and be among others. What baffles me the most is that most people always find a way to balance everything in the midst of all these issues that can impair their ability to live a decent existence. I believe that everything happens for a purpose, and that the end result always favors the majority who were passionate about it.",

I don't understand why this has to be on that page when it was affordable before. Maybe this is all about the capitalists dictating the market price for the homes and even if you want it but don't want to buy it anymore because it's totally expensive and even if you take loans, you don't want to get that burden for a very long time if you've got some other things that you're planning. I don't want to say it but it seems that these homes for sale are already on their ceiling and you know what's next to it...",

What about countries like China or Mexico, that do not appear there, where people used to die of famine and today they have an obesity problem?Quote from: dbc23 on May 13, 2023, 02:19:39 PMIf you claim hunger has been drastically reduced what happens to countries where workers earn below their daily expenses, How about countries where their currency have little or no value. That, in general, they are better off than in the past, although there are always exceptions.Quote from: dbc23 on May 13, 2023, 02:19:39 PMCurrently agriculture is not promoted has it was in the past, many are turning into soft works except for countries where mechanised agriculture is rampant. .What is there to promote in agriculture when it is highly mechanized? In the past it took dozens of men to produce less than what can be achieved today by a single person using machines.Quote from: passwordnow on May 14, 2023, 03:13:21 PMMaybe this is all about the capitalists dictating the market price for the homes...You have no idea. Capitalism does not dictate the price of anything. If there is real capitalism prices are set by a balance of supply and demand. Those who are in the business of dictating prices are those of the ideology you like, who are the ones who have caused the most millions of deaths by starvation in the world:Soviet famine of 1930–1933Great Chinese Famine",

Hunger is still a major concern around the world. in this aspect I will save it because of inflation that I happened to that particular country so there is a reduction of Hunger in a society it depends on the country that you are leaving all the place you are staying that is one country which average person always take three square meals a day, so you cannot generate it or put it across all the nation",

Making the right decision on which comes first can be a way to reduce the pressure that comes with living in the 21st century era.I think that the concept of hunger and unending wants apply mainly in underdeveloped and developing countries. I doubt that the developed countries have this problem, because they have improved mechanized agricultural system, advanced technology to make life more meaningful for their citizens. Their GDP is higher than the underdeveloped countries, thereby making people that are living in the developed countries to be living a more comfortable lifestyle, because their economy is well planned. Unlike the underdeveloped countries were bad governance has made basic needs to became luxury. Ordinary citizens finds it difficult to afford basic needs.",

That is why there are people who address Food shortages and the price of shelter in one way or another, through science.
