  "content": "As the title says, I want to know why forum moderators deleted my posts. Under which rules do my posts violate the forum rules, and why did moderators delete my posts? Not one, Not two. Moderators deleted my three posts, which do not violate any forum rules. Then why was it removed? Because some so-called heavy-weight reputed member reported those posts? Here are the three posts that we deleted;https://ninjastic.space/post/63040347https://ninjastic.space/post/63040507https://ninjastic.space/post/63040536All three were replies to Ratimov, and those posts were ON topic, constructive enough, and a healthy discussion. I demand a proper answer to deleting those posts. If those posts violate any forum rules, please mention them as well. If you say those posts were removed because the post I Quoted in those posts was removed, Fuck it! I do not control it. I don't know who will delete their own post. If their action affects my posts, how can someone be sure they have the freedom to write? Edit: Well, the posts were merged without any moderator's note. I didn't notice that at first. Didn't they notice that the author removed several posts?",

      "body": "Do you know how many posts were deleted by the moderators per day, should everyone of them come here to drag on why their posts was deleted, how clumsy do you think here will be, moderators are doing their job, it may seems right to you that every post you made were always on topic, but on a general sense, not until more than two people attest to the fact that it's not off point before you can be sure that you're really on point.I don't know when it has become a habit of challenging the moderators for doing their role, what about if more than two members already reported your same posts to the moderator, can you also question any reports or feedback left on your post when reported to the moderator, the day you started feels beyond being corrected then maybe you just stops from growing. Lastly, if a post is being deleted and you're part of the quotes to that post, your post will also be deleted.",

We as someone who visit someone house need to obey with every rules that the householder has. You actually have the freedom to write, just like you wrote \"Fuck it\" and it's not get censored by the moderators.Quote from: mprep on November 17, 2021, 03:23:31 AMbut someone posting a complaint about his / her posts being deleted in a non-Meta thread they were deleted from is usually off-topic.

This means you have found an answer to your question, why not lock this topic? The best thing that you can do now is to lock this topic for people not to be posting the same thing that has been posted by other members. On this forum, it is not advisable to be posting continuously and quoting the same person without seeing any other people's posting, you can do that on a single post.",

Didn't they notice that the author removed several posts? Seems like your posts were of good value and that's why they were merged and I don't think that anything is wrong with that post merging approach as far as the posts aren't deleted. I think you have received fair replies which cleared your doubts and merging doesn't means that the posts were deleted. I think it's better to lock this thread because further replies maybe of similar nature and won't be any helpful at all because now we all know that where those posts were gone. I think that moderators merged those posts into a single post so that readers can easily read the whole discussion between you two guys. I think the merges reduce the number of posts in a thread while allow everyone to know what's taking place in the thread.",

      "body": "I will lock this topic because the question of why moderators merged my posts will be controversial, even though I have a valid reason to ask. Moderators merged these four posts into one because they became four in a row after Ratimov decided to delete all his replies. But before he deleted his replies, everything was fine. I did not use bad words; he has used many in his posts. I want to say, Ratimov, that is childish behavior from users like you. At first, you tried to create a drama with me inside that thread, so the readers focus on you and me instead of the OP. When GazetaBitcoin pointed it out, you deleted all your posts, so my replies became all four in a row. LOL. Is it that how you manipulate the system? Poor try! To those who were saying those posts were deleted because they were off-topic, you need to spend more time in the forum and learn which could be considered off-topic and which is not. Whoever said I was posting all in a row, you should reread this post.",
