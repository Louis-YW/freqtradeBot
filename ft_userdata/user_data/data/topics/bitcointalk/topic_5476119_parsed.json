  "content": "Account FIODNederland. Is it really an official government account? Like some people have already said, FIODNederland seems to be quite knowledgeable about Bitcointalk. And I don’t see any proof against it to be real but it’s still extremely odd. Signup time can be proof for it to be real. Doesn’t look like a scam attempt as well. Legit account or nah?
