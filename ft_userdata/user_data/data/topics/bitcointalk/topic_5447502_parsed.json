  "content": "I've been thinking about something for a long time, so I thought I'd share my thoughts with you today. All around us we see many underprivileged people who are living their lives in hardship. And seeing the condition of some people that they can't even eat properly, a thought came to my mind that I could do something for them. But I am a very little person and it is not possible for me to do so much even if I wanted to. But all these things can be done if everyone wants sincerely.We know that the most virtuous month of Muslims, that is, the month of Ramadan, is going on. In this month of Ramadan, all Muslims abstain from all food and drink for a certain period of time to please Allah. And at the end of a certain time they break the fast. And normal families usually have lots of fruits and dates in Iftar but I have seen several families who drink only water in Iftar because of their poverty. And there are many who observe the fast by eating mudri or chira during Sehri, even though these things are very difficult for them. And the biggest religious event of Muslims is Eid-ul-Fitr, that is, Muslims celebrate this festival after fasting for a long month. Usually everyone buys some new clothes around the biggest religious event of Muslims but those who suffer from poverty cannot buy new clothes on Eid even if they want to. If we stand by them regardless of religion, maybe their religious ceremonies will go well. So if we can stand by their side from our own ability, maybe we will get a lot of self-satisfaction from our hearts. So you can help as much as you can according to your ability. And if you give your opinion then all our help can be pooled in one place and many families can be helped from there. I just shared my thoughts with you. If you think my idea is right then we can move forward.",

Especially now in the Ramadan feast, most people don't have much to celebrate with so if give them a little help will help make this feast a big one for them, then I see no reason why we shouldn't help them. Also don't you think that you made this post in the wrong thread??",

I don't think Bitcoin will pose much of a barrier to them here.  Because we are doing things thinking about the welfare of people.I agree, since a lot of scammers are everywhere even its for donation they would scam it. The best way to accumulate the donations would be send it to the charity in the place where they want to donate the money. If Bitcoin is the problem for them to receive the donations given, then it would be better to convert it to fiat money then don't mention the Bitcoin. If you really have good intentions of helping people then it would be better to give without promoting Bitcoin. I've seen a lot of donations that are from Bitcoin but kept mentioning Bitcoin despite of the issue. Good heart people doesn't mind to be mentioned for every help they give, but would be happy the fact they helped people. Here in my country you could donate using digital currency to legal charities to avoid scammers. And you could actually see where your money went as they provide the needs of unprivileged people.",

Maybe the least we can do for those under privileged people is to share our knowledge about it since this can test how eager they are to get out on poverty.Some might get interested about it but some of them might ignore the information they can learn since there are few people used to get easy money by asking aid to other people. So choose people who have potential and not those people got caught their interest because they have free money to get.",

All you said is nice to assist the less privilege at this period of Ramadan,but my own suggestion is that we should give this people in our various communities whatever we can to assist them to break their fast. Muslims are everywhere,and also less privilege people are everywhere, with this nobody will know what you are giving because it is between you and your heart. Doing donations for this will not be condole by many forum members, due to so much scam around the corner and nobody knows who is a scammer,until you have been scammed. Another problem is that the Muslims don't buy the idea of bitcoin and might not accept your offer,if you tell them that it was bitcoin that you used to get them those stuffs.",

He will help as much as he can. The main purpose of posting here is to maximize member's income of this thread through Bitcoin and other Crypto means. So I mean to spend some amount of money from the amount of money we earn from Bitcoin and Crypto currency for the underprivileged people whether through paper money or any other means.Quote from: Z-tight on April 04, 2023, 11:05:19 AMThere are people who help others everyday, and i don't feel people need to be reminded to help others, it is something they do by themselves. Donation threads are also not allowed in the forum if that is what you are suggesting.It is not the responsibility or duty of those who help the poor.  But it is their humanity. Out of humanity they stand beside the poor and help them in various ways. If we sit on the trust of those who help all the time that they are there to help, then the number of people to help in the world will decrease.  Rather, we can create a helping mindset through inspiration from them. This will reduce their stress even a little. And at the end of the day we humans help humans is the religion of humans",

I live in Ukraine, so it's not a surprise, considering the war, that people are not doing well and poverty is on the rise. I think I want to do something about it, but I haven't figured out what exactly, aside from small donations to humanitarian aid projects in my country. Bitcoin can be used to collect donations and donations can be used to help people. Is that the approach you envision as well, op? Or do you see a different way of helping fight poverty with Bitcoin? I see from other posts in the thread that the idea is to share profits on investment, but is it supposed to be systemic, at a fixed rate of profit or something, and will Bitcoin be in the end used to buy food and give it to others or will Bitcoin itself be distributed?",

It is good that you have a good heart to do something good for the less fortunate during this holy month of Ramadam. You can call on well meaning individuals in your locality to donate just $2 maybe in bitcoin if bank transfer will be a hassle for them. It will go towards the provision of meals to those who are in need. As it will ensure that these people have access to nutritious and delicious meals to break their fast.",
