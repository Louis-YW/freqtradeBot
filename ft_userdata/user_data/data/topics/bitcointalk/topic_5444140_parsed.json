I think the OP pertain the reserve currency of country that holds by the central bank and not as a reserved balance of a corporate which the list all about. @OP, The volatility of Bitcoin will always be the problem on this idea. A reserve price shouldn’t volatile or else it will cause havoc in the economy.",

But if viewed in general, it is difficult to believe that Bitcoin can compensate for the rest of the reserves used by the world. And if he is able to replace fiat money, especially the dollar, he will not be able to replace gold, since gold is a precious metal and a store of value. As for the dollar, it will expire if the world decides to end its use as a reserve.",

In terms of value there must be something called recognition from one of the parties who has power and thinks that it is important. Just like the dollar and gold, they have always been the country's foreign exchange because the government recognizes the power behind the dollar and is almost like gold because of \"assumption & trust\".In terms of energy consumption, price volatility, and sensitivity if chaos occurs it is a very difficult thing to control, in terms of energy it is very likely that we can still develop it and reduce the energy used, but in terms of volatility it will be very vulnerable to security. state finances because bitcoin is very sensitive to bad news.",

      "body": "High energy consumption is true, but there are lots of other things consuming energy and we, as a human society, are generally consuming more and more energy, so I wouldn't count is as a big disadvantage of Bitcoin per se. As for the high volatility, I disagree that it scares investors, since it's the volatility that gives a chance of making great profits with Bitcoin. Without volatility, Bitcoin wouldn't be of interest to investors, and that's even more true for investors. The third point about not having an army to support Bitcoin evades me a bit, but I suppose an argument could be made out of it based on the global reserve currency belonging to a country that has a strong economy and military force.I believe that Bitcoin's volatility is an issue for it being a global reserve currency (but not as much as issue to Bitcoin traders and hodlers), and so is the lack of a strong authority that would be perceived as a reliable force that would ensure the stability of the currency. But maybe it's not a problem that Bitcoin isn't a big global reserve currency, as it can be many other things while also having some appeal as something that no government and no country in the world can control.",

Can you share some enlightening information for me?Nope. Problem is that our world is now way past the time of reserve currency. These days no country wants to get into this mess of having a reserve currency because they want to print as much money as possible without any restraint. The reserve currency puts that restraint. So it's not the problem with bitcoin why it can't be a reserve currency but the problem with the currency system itself which will stop bitcoin from becoming so. It cannot even be a global trade currency due to the exchange costs involved to fiat and it's volatility.",

Before the fiat system was put in place central banks kept gold as their reserves, but after WWI and WWII economists realized the US had most of the reserves of gold around the world and the gold standard will be impossible to restore, so they stored the US dollar thinking it was as good as gold, but then during the Vietnam war the US printed a lot of money and this forced them to stop redeeming gold to other countries and finally the fiat system was created, so a very specific set of circumstances needed to happen for the economic system being the way it is, and I do not think they will repeat themselves so the Yuan can reach that status.",

Most of those companies already got their bank accounts wiped up due to bankruptcy. Bitcoin is not stable asset. Bitcoin by its very nature is highly unstable or volatile asset. It can’t have fixed price today, tomorrow or anywhere in the near future. It’s supply is getting released slowly however adoption is changing constantly. That can either pump the price but it could also go down if government influences regarding its ban/regulations etc came to effect. Now none of this is fixed and that makes it even dangerous for bitcoin to remain stable in long terms. That’s why it can’t have such Reserve status for sure.",

      "body": "Bitcoin as it stands today is being used by a lot of companies back and forth as a reserve currency, so the possibility of it becoming the global reserve currency is high. add to this the fact that it is immutable and is ever-deflating in value which means it's not vulnerable against impermanent loss and inflation, making it a top-tier candidate for being a powerful currency and a reserve currency as well in the future. One thing that just gives it trouble is the fact that not a lot of people are aware of its existence, as well as the fact that there is still some semblance of speculation in its valuation, which could steer people away from it upon finding out. at the end of the day, the more people use and recognize it the more it will penetrate the mainstream.

Some believe governments should regulate and control assets like global reserve currencies. Others throughout history have said it is a bad idea for politicians to control the money printing machine. They say mints and other critical aspects of monetary policy and the economy should be independently owned and operated to prevent political conflict of interest. Perhaps in the future global reserve currencies will follow a similar format. Where they do not fall under the direct control of politicians. I certainly would not mind it.

Therefore, there only way of making things to work is through banks and I don't think the government would like to use Bitcoin as a reserve currency for their emergency since there hasn't any single entities owning Bitcoin and therefore a use of third-party to get involved is a must if they wishes to use Bitcoin just like how banks work.",

The banking system is a part of state power, and states always use such leverage as regulation for undesirable processes. By regulating the circulation of cryptocurrencies, states can practically achieve any effect. Banks use everything from cryptocurrency that is beneficial to them to increase the efficiency of their fiat system, including they, like the state as a whole, use blockchain technology. But they will not use bitcoin or another decentralized cryptocurrency as a reserve currency, as this is not acceptable to strengthen their fiat. Commercial structures, individuals can and do do this, but this will not affect the state banking system in any way.",
