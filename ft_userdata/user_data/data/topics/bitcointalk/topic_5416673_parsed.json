Can anyone recommend a similar company to coinbase so that i can transfer my USDC there and then sell these and transfer the funds to my bank account.Thanks in advance.",

So much better convert USDC to USDT first before sending to Binance if you want to use Binance then use P2P, sell your USDT to fiat currency.",

You'll face this issue everywhere, there's no exchange that's going to be free from this (that's popular anyway).If it is erc20 usdc, you just need to select ethereum on the network selection (but it should already be selected). You're also looking for an address that begins with 0x if sending to an ethereum/erc20 wallet.",

If its a wallet where you have the keys, then you need Ether for transaction fee to send it.Your employer should have told you the way to do it since they know you are new to it. If you do have Ether already just send the token to the ETH wallet also, this is important to not lose them.P2p Platform is your option to send the money to your account. There had been lots of these including the popular exchanges like Binance.",

You can still get other stablecoins but once the transaction is confirmed successfully all your USDC will be automatically converted to BUSD, USDT deposit ports still working on finance. It is important for the OP and his client to identify the exact network they both use to make transactions and this is probably quite unfamiliar to the OP, perhaps he has never used crypto before. Whether it is bybit or FTX it is still important to identify the right network or they will lose money.",

If so, you actually have to transfer to an exchange where you can then trade it in the P2P so that your money will be sent to your Bank account. I understand some if not most of the cex have you do KYC so you might want to look at verified exchanges without KYC if you don't want to do one for this transaction and yes, you might also want to look at networks with lower transfer fees so that you don't lose most of your USDC.",

I think that you shall provide more information about this. The exchange site like FTX, Kraken, binance were also accepting USDC deposits, I have been actively using USDC stable token as well. I never face any problem with it. You must be more specific about your explanation.",

If this is one of the national currencies supported by the Binance exchange, then you can first exchange your stablecoins for it, and then make a withdrawal directly to your credit card.",

Just mind you of the kyc requirement for this since you are gonna connect your bank. Also depends on your country but they almost supported all so I guess theres no proboem unless your country is highly remoted area foe cryptocurrency adoption.",

You might get asked to pay $30-$50 when the network is busy, the fees is depends on the network, not on how many token or funds you've withdraw.Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on December 02, 2022, 07:26:08 AMIm not using coinbase but if you wanted to directly on your bank, then the best option is Binance P2P.

The @OP already said he's using Gemini to cash out his money, so this mean he's okay with KYC matters. IMO it's better to use centralized exchange than centralized P2P since P2P has low volume and there's a chance you will get scammed.",

Instead, you can choose to transfer your coins to any other exchange that offers a deposit address on the ETH network.For example, other exchanges like Kraken, Kucoin, or Bitfinex support USDC on the ETH network. The drawback is the large ETH fee gas fee. Secondly, you can first exchange it to BUSD (stable coin), then transfer it to the bank later. Hope this helps!",
