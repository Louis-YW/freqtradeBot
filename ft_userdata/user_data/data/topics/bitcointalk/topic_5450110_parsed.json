The gaming activity is essentially placing two roosters/cocks in an arena and betting on which between the two comes out victorious.I do not think it is what they even accept as gambling is Philippines by some people. But if it is accepted as gambling, it is stated in the news that it was legal before when the man was involved in it.If the government legalize gambling, anyone can be involved in gambling. But countries will have their own rules about government officials to be involved in gambling or not.",

What best thing to do about that situation is to see which of those politician is involve and don't vote them so that this activities will be stop, also vote for the right person who against this so that they can eliminate crimes and solve those pending cases which is related to this activities.",

So illegalities continue to run here when you have the power, money, and connections from various officials to cover and protect your illegal business. Many of these dirty government officials won because they spent a lot of money on assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic where a lot of people suffered financially and had difficulty accessing food and other basic needs.",

But to be honest, this isn't surprising at all since they will really do anything just to win the election. Of course, once you've got the position, you have access to the public fund. Election is like their investment, they'd do everything to acquire funds for the election and once they win, they can reimburse it through the people's money. Obviously, gambling is a big source of funds for them. E-Sabong alone was a big thing already. A lot of people become addicted to it because it can easily be access by gamblers even without going outside. They will operate gambling even if it's illegal cause they know people are addicted to gambling and the more people gamble, the more money they can get. Also another thing, they are not afraid to operate illegally cause they are backed up by bigger politicians who protects them.",

This shouldn't be a problem if a politician decided to create a Gambling for the sake of making more money which is not against the law in my own country. The problem is that many of these politicians are so how scared that having a well known company can make there opponents come for them and attack them in any form. I think having a gambling is a good innovation to create more jobs for the people to have something doing than taking the money to another country to make investment and create employment in that country. The politicians are also doing a great help to the people to have job employment.",

If what they are doing is legally valid in your country I think that's fine and it should work properly, but if you are worried about political activities that are morally unhealthy or have a bad impact on society, then you should have laws firm and explicit about this.

They can use ghost employees to simply hide their identities and also continue the operation of that platform or site itself. That's just how money works which resembles and characterizes power, unfortunately to some countries. Even if they are caught on the act, they could use money to prolongue the trial process and eventually win the case. There are just many ways to do things as long as they have the drive to do so and ofcourse power to make it happen, both on a positive and negative manner.",

My question is, what if these candidates are not politicians before but decided to run in the election and already owned a franchise in gambling? Are they not qualified to run? The best thing to strongly implement is, once a candidate now becomes a government official and held a government office, they should let go of their gambling franchise as a public official. Be used to it when it comes to the source of election funds, candidates especially those with lots of machinery will use their power to accumulate money from any means.
