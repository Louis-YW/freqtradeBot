Brought like ten 300x-1000x calls in just ONE MONTH that all hit 3 Mill + and it got so many epic presales that exploded. That was few months ago. After that we used to move charts like 400k MC within seconds, more instant volume than the space has ever seen next to a Travladd partnership when he was in his prime. We brought the most insane calls and presales the space has ever seen!https://i.ibb.co/c6C9yZK/IMG-20221121-123852-614.jpgWe also dominated in the most important thing which was the amount of money, education and career opportunities we gave in the channel. Easily gave out 2x more than any other channel out there this year, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS and even a 50k giveaway in one day. We helped many devs make a name for themselves and channels, and lots of our AMA regulars got jobs as AMA hosts or mods on projects and we hired alot of project scouts for us as well. And Maurice went the extra mile after AMAs educating you Apes as much as he could!",
