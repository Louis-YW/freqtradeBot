Use the calculator for more accurate calculations, I do not know the cost of your electricity.But the payback period is very high.",

I am sure that the author of the question will solve this problem. The new video cards 4070 and 4080 are still poorly tested in mining and the payback is very high. I would not buy these graphics cards to mine this coin.",
