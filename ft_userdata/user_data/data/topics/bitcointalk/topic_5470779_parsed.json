Will appreciate especially if you have used a multi signature wallet before.I am using this Bitcoin wallet and it has multi signature capability, I thought to my self, why not create one and get experience how this thing actually works? Because all this years I have not put it to practical, so I created one today, I was give three separate keys, my questions are as follow. 1. Does having a multi signature wallet opened just for you only add some more security level to your crypto wallet or it doesn't count? Like keeping all these keys to yourself and storing them offline separately. 2. If I am running a company and we need to use multi signature wallet to store company fund, since creating the wallet in the present of all three of us makes all these keys visible, doesn't that mean I have access to all the three keys? Or I should have take the first key only and pass the phone to the second person to create the next key? And also the third person? 3. If the second question with the answer is valid, what happens if two persons died and you are the only person with just one single key? Do you think it's not safe to be in multi signature? What's your thought.",

If you only have one signature without another cosigner you won't be able to process a transaction.2. Depending on how you create a multi-sig wallet the other two parties should provide only a public key when creating a multi-sig wallet. Meaning you don't have control of their keys.Unless the company lets you create all the keys to create a multi-sig wallet.3. If it's 2 of 3 multi-sig wallets then you won't be able to process a transaction without one more key.Never heard someone hack a multisig wallet so for me it should be safe.",

Does having a multi signature wallet opened just for you only add some more security level to your crypto wallet or it doesn't count? Like keeping all these keys to yourself and storing them offline separately. Yes it definitely gives you more security because instead of trying to duplicate your private keys into various locations you can just store each seeds into different locations and if one gets compromised the scammer or hacker wouldn’t be able to do anything with it without the other seeds and that could give you time to either move the funds out to another wallet. But one thing about creating your a multi sig wallet is if you use one device for it and also to regularly sign a transaction then the point of failure still remains one, which defeats the purpose of having multi sig. Quote from: Crypt0Gore on October 18, 2023, 11:09:49 AM2. If I am running a company and we need to use multi signature wallet to store company fund, since creating the wallet in the present of all three of us makes all these keys visible, doesn't that mean I have access to all the three keys? Or I should have take the first key only and pass the phone to the second person to create the next key? And also the third person? This is a bad idea to set up a multi sig, never use a single device just like I have said above it makes the risk high. All other co-signers should have their device and it should be an offline device then you create your seed and a master public key then you share your public key with other co-signers and then wait for them to create there’s and then send you their master public keys and once you get them all you can finish up the wallet creation. Two things to note; 1. The address should be check and compared with all co-signers so that they are the same. 2. All co-signers master public must begin with same letter as prefix so compare it to check of it is done well. Quote from: Crypt0Gore on October 18, 2023, 11:09:49 AM3. If the second question with the answer is valid, what happens if two persons died and you are the only person with just one single key? Only the number of co-signers set up as been able to sign a transaction can do that, if the other seeds are lost then one seed can never sign a transaction from that wallet and it is all",

It's safe because some account are good as being manage by two or more people, a good example are coorperative accounts, joint group or family account needs more than one cosigners, that's why you're choosing this purposely because you want more than one persons have access to the account being a joint account.",

The master public key or the public key is needed to completely setup the wallet (the seed phrase or the private key can be used but do not use it, I mean do not give other co-signers).When you are setting up the wallet, all of you have seed phrase or private key, you will have that and do not share it. The wallet will generate you the master public key from the seed phrase or the public key from the private key which is what you will share with co-signers. The co-signers do not have each other seed phrase. Read further below for the other explanation.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on October 18, 2023, 11:09:49 AM3. If the second question with the answer is valid, what happens if two persons died and you are the only person with just one single key? If it is 5 people that are needed, you can make it 3-of-5 multisig. Which means 3 people are needed to make transactions, out of 5 people that setup the wallet. If two people died, then you have to transfer the coin to a newly setup multisig wallet. That can be done because only 3 people are required for making transaction. So it t depends on how you setup the multisig wallet. Assuming 4 signatures are required and 2 people died, that means the coin on the wallet has been lost.",

You can create a multisig wallet with people that are continents away from you, that means when setting up a multisig wallet for business purposes, your partners do not have to be present with you, and they shouldn't because each co-signer must never reveal their seed phrase or xprv to another cosigner. Each co-signer would create their own wallet in their own device, and everyone would communicate their xpub to each other, to complete the set up. Take note that each co-signer must back up their own seed phrase, xpub and the xpub's of the other co-signers, because it may be needed in the future if the establishment wants to recover the wallet.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on October 18, 2023, 11:09:49 AM3.

It did count, because you need to have two wallets, and you cannot run two wallets to sign the transaction on one device, which means you will use 2 different devices, and the security level added here is, that when you will make a transaction, you have to sign the TX from the other wallet, but if in case, your main wallet got hacked and or the device got hacked, then your other device will avoid the hack, because hacker or scammer need access to both wallet, means both devices.

Well, at an organizational level, one can't be the only owner of the whole funds, because a company is run by many partners, so it would be wise to not hold all the funds by yourself only for many reasons, and some of which are briefly explained in this topic:Dangers of combining company and personal funds in the same accountYou don't have to pass the phone, I don't understand which wallet are you using for multi-sig, but yeah, if you guys are truly want to hold funds for an organization then it is more than good to keep your recovery keys of yours to yourself only, because if your key is gone and the funds moved, then they will blame you not the hacker or thief of your key.

If two people die due to some unexpected incidents or their wallets are gone, then it becomes a problem for you, because you don't know where are the keys and how to get them. But my friend, IMHO, when you make a wallet, you get a recovery phrase, and you have to keep it safe, then another member makes a wallet and has to safe his own recovery phrase, and then the other one, the thing is, the public key is the one, that will be shared by you with both of them. That would connect you to them. And then they can sign your TX.",

If the second question with the answer is valid, what happens if two persons died and you are the only person with just one single key? You have to find an actual scenario first and then design a script (smart contract) based on that scenario that predicts special cases like one of the cosigners passing away. Your script does not have to be a simple multi-sig, it can be a complex one with branches/conditionals, timelocks, etc.For example in a company you can define a \"senior authority\" that has full control over spending the coins without needing anybody else. Then there are multiple \"junior authorities\" each with partial control that can spend the coins together. So two branches, one with a single sig and another with a 2of2 multisig for example.Code:OP_IF  OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <senior hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGOP_ELSE  OP_2 <pub1><pub2> OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIGOP_ENDIF",

It is not that there is a standard seed that everyone uses to except maybe you used a master seed to generate all the private keys for the multi Sig wallet. But this increases the risk because if the seed gets compromised all the private keys associated to it will also be revealed. But the standard way of creating multi sig wallet is where each Co-signer creates their individual seed phrase and also master public key. The co-signers would then share just the master public key with each other to be able to complete the wallet set up. This master public keys of yours and that of other co-Signers need to be backed up to been able to recover the wallet back. But the seed phrase isn’t shared between the co-signers.

But multi-sig spreads things out so you need more than one key to unlock the funds.  Even if one key is lost you can still recover access with the others (for example two-out-of-three signature setup).  This gives you backups. Multi-sig wallets have clear benefits, especially for redundancy and security and  you can't really compare them to single-sig wallets since they serve different purposes and give you varying levels of protection.Storing your keys in more than one place under single-sig provides you with multiple backups. Quote from: FatFork on October 22, 2023, 10:03:59 PMQuote from: headingnorth on October 22, 2023, 06:31:03 PMThe problem with a multisig setup is you have to trust someone else to secure your keys for you, which introduces counterparty risk. That seems to go against the ethos of bitcoin which is supposed to be trustless. That's a wrong assumption. You can, for example, create a multi-sig wallet and be the sole owner of all keys.That doesn't seem much different than having a single-sig setup with backups.Quote from: FatFork on October 22, 2023, 10:03:59 PMQuote from: headingnorth on October 22, 2023, 06:31:03 PMI think for most a better and much more simple solution would be making use of passphrases/hidden wallets.This has nothing to do with a multi-sig wallet setup. Who said it did? Sure multi-sig may be a great option for you depending on your situation. I'm sure many institutions, companies and organizations make use of multi-sig.But for the average individual joe, it is rather complex and difficult to manage, and there are more simple viable alternatives.",

Well then I guess you are screwed.The problem with a multisig setup is you have to trust someone else to secure your keys for you, which introduces counterparty risk. That seems to go against the ethos of bitcoin which is supposed to be trustless. In a multisig set up you are not entrusting your private keys to anyone to keep it safe for you, take note that a multisig set up must not be for business purposes or for a group of people, you can set up one for yourself only and keep each key in separate devices to eliminate a single point of failure. Even if you set up a multisig wallet within a group, the right thing to do is ensure only one person cannot spend the funds, let's say in a group of 3, a 2-of-3 set up is good.Quote from: headingnorth on October 22, 2023, 06:31:03 PMI think for most a better and much more simple solution would be making use of passphrases/hidden wallets.A passphrase is also a good extra layer of security, it also provides lesser backups than a multisig set up and can be used to create a situation of plausible deniability. So it is up to the user to decide which extra layer of security suits them.",
