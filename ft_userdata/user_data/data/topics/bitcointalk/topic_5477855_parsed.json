We all have our likes and dislikes I suppose. Here I agreed about this all as it's never been exciting to watch but still I have found we have it's still 7th most favorite sports in the world which is ridiculous for me because I never found anything interesting from this game but still it's going to be like this and already mentioned we all have our likes and dislikes so it's not debatable.",

Thank you for your thoughtful insights! I agree, that combining crypto with golf could indeed create interesting opportunities for both industries. It's intriguing how golf often caters to the affluent, and introducing crypto elements might bring a fresh dynamic. Do you think some specific aspects or features could enhance the integration of crypto into the golfing experience in your country?",

We all have our likes and dislikes I suppose. I totally get that! Golf and baseball can be seen as slow-paced sports, and they're not everyone's cup of tea. It's great that you enjoy playing golf, though.What sports or activities do you find more exciting to watch on TV?I most enjoy T20 Cricket, if anywhere in the world any organization arranges 6six sites both teams should have only 6 players with 6 wickets and 6 overs.

They are very entertaining too, as they exhibit that spirit of liveliness, joy, togetherness, and everything good that has to do with sports when watched live and direct from the field or at your comfort, i.e., your home or a viewing center. As for me, I mostly find it exciting to watch football, as it is very entertaining and thrilling. There is this aura with football games that I like so much that gives me joy when watching them, and it excites me most when I do that with friends and family and when I am watching a live match at the football stadium.",
