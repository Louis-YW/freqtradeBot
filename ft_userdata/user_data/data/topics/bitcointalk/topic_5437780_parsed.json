Same with stocks, you can make money while the price is going down, and even gain comparable to the bitcoin price in some intervals.For example, MARA was 2$ in October 2020, it's $8 now.Bitcoin was ~$11 000 at that time it's ~24 000 now.It also peaked at $75 so with the same timing you would have experienced better returns than just buying and selling BTCQuote from: jackg on February 02, 2023, 03:15:02 PMI saw a thread on here recently about marathon, I don't know if they're directly invested in mining but they seem to be at the top of my Google results.They are, they have around 7 Exa with around 12 Exa waiting for being put online by the end of Q1, so around 4-5% of the global hashrate.LE, fixed the wrong quote, damn tabs!",
