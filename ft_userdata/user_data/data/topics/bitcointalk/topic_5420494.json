Manynkf their coins are on hot wallets, they are handling customers coins and large in number, the reasons hackers do more work for haxk exchanges.Hackers will find it more difficult or more impossible to hack if they use cold wallets. The best is to just setup a cold storage. If you want it to be online, multisig will be perfect. Combining multisig on cold storage or hardware wallet are most perfect.Noncustodial wallet gives full control.",

He should pass the level or the minimum withdrawal he can only do and stick to that everyday. (Im talking about a lot of money or whales). Also possibly that liqudity on dex might not be enough. Usually big pool or the market is on cex due to trading volume. But what you said is right, as much as possible keep on non custodial wallet.",

Unfortunately, until we introduce a community standard, and start boycotting exchanges which have wallets, this probably isn't going to change. I'm of the opinion that any exchange advertising their wallet services is shady in the first place. It's encouraging bad practices. Instead, wallets shouldn't exist. Instead, pay for your Bitcoin, but input an external address at the time of purchase, so that it's impossible to keep Bitcoin on the exchange.",

I did not learn this on time, but I was lucky not to learn the lesson the bitter way, that \"not your keys, not your coins\" sentence that is used many times here made me realize that exchanges cannot be trusted. The recent situation in cryptocurrency is enough for people who have not known this to learn about it now, but I still think some people will not learn and will never learn, even some who learn, may still forget about it when the importance of this is no longer stressed.",

I had suggested before that it will be better to split them into two or more exchanges depending on on the traders fund. At least its rare to have all exchanges having issues at the same time. Then monthly some of the funds can be moved to wallets. This could minimise the risk.",

I also believe that the current events with exchanges will be a lesson and same way sound a warning to everyone using centralized exchanges to take oft their life earnings and assets off from them in other not to be a victim just as in the case of FTX , we don't know which other exchange will be the next very soon because we are in the peak of market volatility and this has proof to be one of the means whereby some exchanges were exposed or being casted.",

Ironically to date nothing will stop people from having their assets in exchanges. They decide whatever they want including save their funds on the exchange.The last thing is, regret will come too late even if now everything seems safe. There are many exchange hacking incidents, it is the most feared thing but actually it also doesn't prevent people's interest from having funds in exchange. This solution is for those who care about the safety of their funds in the long term so they don't care about the fee incurred to transfer assets to a personal wallet.",

In fact, binance convinces its users with SAFU [even if that's not a good reason] so many of their customers believe that their funds are safe. I trust in a certain amount on exchange, but of course for the amount I can afford to lose. The right choice is as suggested, but certainly not really adopted by all users.In addition, storing funds in a wallet that is fully controlled by the user is also not completely safe if you do not understand and practice good security. One other smart thought is, don't keep your funds in one basket. But there's nothing wrong about the OP's suggestion, I full support for it.",
