  "content": "One of the safest method of having a secure wallet is the use of airgapped devices. If an airgapped device has camera, all needed is the use of QR code and the camera for the transfer of PSBT and signed transactions and nothing more than that. Which means after the device OS has been installed again and the wallet has been created on the airgapped device, the device does not need to connect to the internet or other devices again. If the Bluetooth and WiFi card have be removed, what about the USB port? I found out online that USB port locker can be used. I saw these two videos on YouTube:https://youtu.be/q1L3lCDVZUg?si=mLgi0uYnk6MHdI-shttps://youtu.be/BEtOV7RVK6s?si=vEUt2D9GbDbBOnGfIf this USB port locker is bought and used to lock the USB ports, is it like the house door keys that if another locker is used with the locked USB Port, the port will not be unlocked until the right one used to lock it will be the only one that can unlock it? Or are there ways attack can be able to remove the locker in a way the USB port will not be damaged? Or is it just a waste of time in a way that the locked USB port can be removed and replaced by new one? Is it worth buying?",

Older ones yes, newer ones no. With the next being said, if you are doing that then you have to power down and reboot the machine. At which point when it reboots. If you had your drive encrypted then they can't get to it now anyway.And, if you didn't have it encrypted. Then they powered down your machine and got the battery....they can just take your drive.Quote from: LoyceMobile on September 22, 2023, 03:29:56 PMAny half decent BIOS password can't be reset (anymore) by removing the battery.Keep in mind most of these are going to be on older machines so we are not taking 2023, but 2016....-Dave",

This process will probably take more than 5 minutes, because you will need to gain access to the board with the chip. For example, on laptops. Sometimes may need to go through nine circles of hell to get to the motherboard without damaging anything.  Here you can add a solution with flashing the BIOS using a programmer, instead of replacing a BIOS chip of an identical model from the exact same motherboard (which still needs to be found).In general, your message is correct - you should not rely entirely on a password-protected BIOS to block the USB. You can always find a solution to get around this (any) obstacle. It's just a matter of resources spent.",
