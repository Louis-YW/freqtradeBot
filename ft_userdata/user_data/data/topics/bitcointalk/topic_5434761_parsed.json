I thought it was just 127.0.0:8332?The IP should be a tor hidden service address like string of letters with .onion (abcdefghjkl.onion) which is accessible only via TOR network and I think cannot be accesed by a regular IP.It looks like you want to run your node as hidden service, so you need to configure your node by editing your torrc file and add the follwing linesCode:HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/HiddenServicePort 8332 127.0.0.1:8332 You will find the actual address of your node in the file named hostname in the directory you specified on the HiddenServiceDir option",

And there are some other way to fix this problem such as follows below:a. Your firewall possible is blocking the connection, in this case you can check the port 8332 is open and    accepting the connection in which is incoming. b. Your node configuration file of course must double check, to make sure that the configured with the ip address    correct were the port of your server (127.0.0.1:8332).c. Now if your node is running on a container, make it sure the port is mapped correctly same goes with the cointainer   is also correctly running. d. You also need to confirm that you have done this correctly with the bitcoin core daemon, and it should also be running    on the IP address and port specified (127.0.0.1:8332)",
