I don't mind having this type of market for a while because it won't last and the situation will change. It's because of the halving that we're having.Manipulations will be left and right and they'll do it to maximize the lowest price of everything so that they can get it mostly for Bitcoin.While we can see that the price isn't favorably high, that's favorable to them because they are trying to send the prices down for them to accumulate as many as they can. So if whales are doing this, it's time for those that have missed it to do something the same.",

This could potentially lead to increased mainstream adoption. As more banks embrace cryptocurrencies, it may also contribute to a higher level of trust and legitimacy in the industry, potentially attracting a broader range of investors.",

Some are already working with crypto while some are slowly restricting crypto by making policy that could limit a crypto transaction on their country. I see this as a normal one, but in other countries its already a good progress and adoption. Crypto is still a big threat to many, they are seeing it this way and we cannot just ignore it. Trading will be a big concern if Binance will continue to operate on a country where there’s a strict crypto policy, this could be a good move for Binance but too bad for the users.",

And even though government regulations seem too strict, we can still use crypto for many things, including long-term investments. That's what we should use for now.After all, the government can easily change or modify those regulations, so we still have to adapt to the latest situation that the government will issue.

The US government and other governments will not be able to stop the development of cryptocurrencies, but their enactment of regulations or bans will significantly affect us. You can still use and invest in crypto even if they ban it, but you won't be comfortable living a life hiding from them. Don't look down on the government, they still have their power and can get us in trouble if we keep going against them.",

The US government alone cannot cause why the market can crash and remain like that for a very long time. This is not even the longest bear market in the history of Bitcoin. Normally, there are still some factors that tend to lower the price of Bitcoin, but once the circle is complete, Bitcoin will spike again, and we will all see a long jump in the market.  If investors really had another source of income like other jobs they earn from, it would be profitable to even keep accumulating on the DCA strategy, but that's for anyone who still thinks they need to use the opportunity of the bear market to buy more Bitcoin, which is not investment advice.",

Bitcoin interacts positively with regulations and the rate of interest rate hikes can stop, so there are no factors that pressure the price.
