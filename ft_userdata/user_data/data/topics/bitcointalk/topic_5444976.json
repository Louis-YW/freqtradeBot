You can invest with less than $100. But there are certain things to do before investing. If you are new then you must acquire knowledge about investing. You need to know which position to buy and which position to sell. You have to learn well whether to wait long time or wait short time before investing. But if you try your best then surely you can get success from here.",

Generally, only invest the amount you are comfortable with and don't feel pressure that you have to invest more than you can realistically can because despite everything, bitcoin is still a high risk investment and it may take a while before you are in profit.",

And yes $100 is enough to get you started, you can get some coins for 100 dollars set up a non-custodial wallet, and keep the coin there until you feel the price is good for you to sell and if you're in for the long term you don't have to bother yourself checking the price of Bitcoin constantly only short term investors do that.",

But day trading is very risky and requires a lot of knowledge to make a profit; as a newbie, I don't think you will make a profit but only a loss. For long-term holding, that means you need to hold for several years to see a significant return on bitcoin. But I see, what you need now is knowledge, not profit, because if you are lucky to have a profit without knowledge, you cannot keep it.",

You can go for future trading with lower leverage if you want to earn a good profit. But remember one thing it's also very risky and can be liquidated all your assets if you use high leverage. Better you can use 3× or 5× leveraged tokens as they are now in a very cheap rate and can give you good return. So it's all up to you. I just tried to share from my experience dude.",

The most popular ones are Bitcoin exchanges or Bitcoin ATMs.What I would do: Choose a decent exchange, you like. Deposit your $100 and buy some BTC. You don't need thousands of dollars to get started, as it's no problem to buy just a fraction of a Bitcoin.If you want to keep your Bitcoin for a longer period of time, it makes sense not to leave them on the exchange, but to store them cold storage. For this purpose, you can use easy and cheap paper wallets or hardware wallets (for bigger amounts).",

If you are new and have a lesser amount even then I can say giving it a try is best because future trading and margin trading is the trickier I personally fall prey to these trading types, and lost money How? I was lacking Knowledge of Technical and General Analysis. Margin Trading: You borrow money from the exchange with average and at some liquidation price, if the token you had invested in goes below that point (in Long) then you will lose all of your money and vice versa. depending on your money this is the best option as with 100$ you can borrow 100 more and can earn more but that also doubled the risk of even losing your money too. long term means holding for a few years maybe months, and short-term means holding for weeks to months. Like you invested your $100 in BTC and wait for a few weeks or months until you make a profit. Once you knew which type of trading suits you best depending on your experience, You can start. And yes you can buy BTC for $100 all at once but i prefer you to do DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) in which you put little segments of your investment capital whenever you got an entry point this will increase your profit ratio. Yes, $100 is more than enough to start trading, let me tell you a short story of my friend's journey, He started from $7 in future trading and made $150 out of it but unfortunately, he lost $50 in liquidation. but he earned above $93. But a reminder he has a good experience as he lost too. when I see him I also start future trading and lost everything even my own. So I came back to Spot trading because in this if I buy btc it is my own it does not matter if the price goes up or goes down if I have 0.2 btc they will be 0.2 forever, But in future once the price crosses the liquidation price your money is gone.",
