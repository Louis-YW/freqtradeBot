They can't close your account or anything like that (a business account doesn't mean much, you can get one for free).The worst thing someone can do to harm your account is to leave you a low rating but he can't do that unless you have completed the order.Just report/block them as the support team suggested.",

I report both of them to the fiverr.com support team but the team advised me to report them just.These are scammers, as there are many buyers who have a business profile and put stock photos and message sellers in order for them to do something for them and they will pay them, but as you can see they are trying to keep you away from Fiver and drag you to Facebook or any social media platform so that you may send them the service on FB, Twitter. etc without paying you on Fiver, where Fiver is the mediator between the seller and the buyer to guarantee the rights, they want you to get out of the Fiver escrow and work for free, or they may try to hack you and steal your Fiver account, so anyone who communicates with you to deal outside of Fiver I recommend blocking and reporting his account and not paying attention to threats of these idiots, they can't harm your Fiver account because you didn't violate the platform's policies.",
