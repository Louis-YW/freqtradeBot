I totally agree with you as extra info is also needed when our posts get deleted. I think it's always better to avoid self-moderated threads in first place because they OP can do anything with our posts without any question. However, it's strange that 3-4 years old posts can be deleted as it's not necessary for any OP to delete posts after many years but the self-moderated OP can do whatever he/she wants and there's no-one to stop him/her for doing that.",
