      "body": "There are many exchanges to buy bitcoin aside binance, you can have a check at kycnot.me. It comprises of decentralized exchanges where you can buy bitcoins. The best on the list is BISQ and it is highly recommended by the forum. Concerning trading it is still a thing of worry that centralized exchanges are the best for this due to the fact that have more liquidity and more trading features. There are centralized exchanges like KuCoin, MEXC and the rest that are similar to binance and convenient to trade on. But do not leave your funds on them. My little secret is trade on two or more so that you don’t have to have all funds on one to avoid transferring funds in and out daily. So that when one has issues you don’t lose all your funds. But this is not also an advice to leave your funds on then too. If you are not into trading daily then you can withdraw them and then send them in again when you wish to trade",

How to buy and where to buy, or is it the right time to trade?Do you want to buy Bitcoin or trade ? If you want to buy from the safest exchange then you should choose Bisq Network which is fully Decentralized P2P exchange. Here is the link: https://bisq.network . Just download their official app and proceed.Anyway to trade Bitcoin there are many popular centralized exchanges which have much more features than a DEX which no one can decline. They have higher liquidity, user-friendly interface and much more features. To trade in non KYC exchange can try Coinex, Huobi Global and others. Just don't leave your funds in the centralized Exchanges. Move your funds to a non custodial wallet while holding period and after trade move again to your wallet.",

Binance is working in middle east AFAIK. Maybe i might be wrong like for specific countries but i hope you would find here in which country Binance is available currently.https://www.thecryptobreakdown.com/guides/binance-supported-countriesAnd if you do not want to buy from BN then you may find many other options which obviously based on availability in countries/region. If you have Bitcoin atms in your country then that's a better option if not then find any p2p exchange either it ks managed by CEXs or DEXs i will list a thread below for your easiness. Not your keys, Not your coins\" is not enough. In the thread, op has suggested some good options.",

How to buy and where to buy, or is it the right time to trade?Many people have offered you advice on where to buy bitcoin and what precautions to take when trading bitcoin on a centralised exchange. Don't ignore this advise; if you don't, you'll end up up losing most, if not all, of your funds in a centralised exchange. You should now understand why centralised exchanges are not recommended for leaving your funds on; individuals who ignore this always end up regretting for their careless behaviour. And you should now understand why decentralised exchanges are the ideal way to save money if you don't trade frequently. The disadvantage of this type exchange is that when you reveal your private key, your funds are lost. Privacy and security is important in cryptocurrency and you don’t have to joke with them both.",

This will give you the option to buy digital currency and exchange them to buy digital currency. Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken are cryptocurrency exchange companies. 2.You can select suitable or specific apptocurrency according to your choice to buy digital currency.  For example, Ethereum can be a good option if you are interested in blockchain technology. You can also buy Bitcoin if you want. 3. Use a secure cryptocurrency wallet. Your digital currency will play a role of security in this.

Do not risk more than you can afford to lose and you can use P2P if privacy is what you are looking for, for example like Bisq platform. If you are new to crypto as a whole its better to ignore investment right now and start doing your own research first, be sure to understand what and what not to do in crypto space because lack of knowledge and understanding will result into loss of assets. Also do not leave your assets on any exchanges, they can't be trusted, your assets are safer in a non custodial wallet that you own it's recovery seed, just do your own research before taking any steps or ask on here first.",

You can buy these cryptocurrencies on the crypto market, such as binance, coinbase, or kraken. There you can see various crypto assets that can be purchased. But if you are at this point, you must carefully choose the crypto assets that you will invest in or trade. Because there are many crypto assets that have bad quality (shitcoins) and can cause you to lose. So you first find out news or information about the crypto asset that you are going to buy, so you can know the origin and purpose of the crypto asset being made. So after that you will be able to assess how much potential the crypto you have chosen and you can analyze it.And for the selection of assets, I would advise you to invest and trade in bitcoins. Because in my personal opinion, bitcoin must be owned by anyone who has entered the realm of investment and crypto trading. Because bitcoin is the best and very safe crypto asset, even for beginners. But if you want to try other cryptos, I would also advise you to buy crypto assets that have a minimum rating of 15 and below. Because in my opinion, if you choose an asset in that ranking, at least it will be safer and has quite the potential too.",

As we are seeing most Decentralised Bridge platforms getting compromised these days and millions of funds being stolen while users lose millions of dollars also. I personally use CEX to bridge asset from one network to another by depositing there from one network and withdrawing via another network. Also, about the right time to buy BTC or not? The market is speculative. But IMO, this is a very good time to buy . Apart from the market experiencing volatile upward movements, US stocks rose, The market is awaiting US inflation data on Wednesday with core inflation expected to grow by 5% year-on-year e.t.c, there have been good news surrounding Bitcoin lately like Companies managing Trillions filling for Bitcoin ETF. Seems the era of measuring the market cap of BTC in Billions is gonna end soon.",
