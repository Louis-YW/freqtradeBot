Bitcoin is decentralized so it can be the safest place to store wealth because we don't need to depend on third parties and finally, bitcoin can be used as a peer-to-peer currency...It can be seen that it is a unique multi-functional asset in the world and how we use it depends on each person's purpose. You can view bitcoin as a financial game to make a profit because that's your right, but that doesn't mean others can't use bitcoin for other use cases. In addition, it would be a pity to ignore the great uses that bitcoin brings, because no one prohibits and forces us to only use one of the many use cases of bitcoin. Personally, I would make the most of bitcoin.",

When you‚Äôve been able to understand where the direction of the market is going, you can now hop in the direction that will favour you and once it begins to create that kind of psychological view in people‚Äôs mind, it becomes more like a game. I won‚Äôt argue with this your viewpoint as there is a lot of sense in it and only with this we have seen massive adoption and use of it today. It creates room to learn more and have knowledge about what you‚Äôre going to invest in unlike other assets that are basically base on your choice without much research about them.",

Having reached all-time-highs at the end of 2021, the cryptocurrency market experienced several corrections then. I also thinking about investing into Bitcoin BUT the question is: passive vs. active income. The same money i could invest into active business, like a supermarket in a sunny country like spain and the rendite will be maybe much higher, its a headache topic. What do you think, and what do you think about investing in Gold instead of Bitcoin?peacehttps://nj-sanitaerdienst.de",

I tend to think that bitcoin is used more as an investment tool rather than money. If anyone has statistical data, they can add this to my post. Personally, I can assume that an indicator of using bitcoin as an investment instrument is its high cost. That is, if used as money, supply and demand would be approximately equal, and bitcoin would not cost ~$60-70k. But due to the fact that demand exceeds (invested money), bitcoin becomes more expensive. Also, multi-million dollar investments from institutional investors are confirmation of my words. In other words, most of the bitcoin is hold as an investment and only a small part is used as money (how many shops and individual sellers accept it as a means of payment?). Based on this, I say that bitcoin is not money, but an investment asset.Quote from: balotelli on June 25, 2024, 09:50:33 AMSecondly, the price volatility of Bitcoin is highly enticing; it constantly alters our psychology, which is why I refer to Bitcoin as a financial game.What is our life? - a game!

The entire game ideology makes this very interesting, just like the Jumanji game where you try to survive. Volatility leading to upward and downward price movements has a big say in who makes profit and who makes lose in regards to how the rules are been followed. Following the rules teaches you the basics to surviving and not incurring heavy losses from the market's volatility.",
