  "content": "During World War II the world's major powers were bombed back to the stone age. With the exception of two nations. Russia and the united states. This set the stage for america and russia to emerge as the world's dominant superpowers leading into the cold war, korean war and vietnam war which followed. Both the USSR and USA enjoyed the luxury of surviving World War II with their territories and economies largely intact. Profiting handsomely by loaning capital to other nations to rebuild. While the rest of the world toiled under debt and reconstruction efforts.Looking at the current era a similar trend could emerge. America, the european union and china all carry large ratios of debt to GDP close to 100%. Russia's debt to GDP ratio is by far the smallest of any major power at around 20%. If a major recession hit global markets a case could be made for russia's government and economy being best structured to weather it. Russia is one of the most self sufficient nations in terms of raw materials, food and energy production. Russia also has many other world powers reliant and dependent on them for natural gas and other resources.Long story short russia has many advantages over the USA, EU and china if an economic crisis hits.If global markets are devastated by a crisis, russia is (in my opinion) the number #1 prospect to emerge as the next dominant superpower. To avoid this, I think the united states would do well to keep its economy strong. As a hedge against russian encroachment. There isn't much alternative deterrent.While russia's invasion of ukraine has stalled. Russia isn't trying very hard. They don't have to. They simply have to wait for the next big economic crisis when free money and support thrown at ukraine can no longer be funded. Then resistance may well crumble.The best deterrent against invasion and war may be a strong economy with enough liquidity to make invasion too high priced too consider. Our current era with high deficits and weak economies could be interpreted as an open invitation for ambitious regimes like russia to invade us.On the plus side if russia is the next dominant superpower they may be bitcoin friendly. At least that would be one positive thing we might look forward to in the horror show that could be the future.",

Here I see a clear advantage over the EU. It happens as with China. If it is about to surpass the USA in GDP is largely because of its energy policies.But for it to emerge as a superpower it would need another part of the equation, which is greater efficiency in the production of goods and services, and a better market economy. It is not enough just to have the resources, which is important, yes, but you have to exploit them well. Let's look at Venezuela for example, where having a lot of resources is of little or no use, because of the garbage policies of the government.",

Russians pay around 50% of the income tax that EU citizens pay. I think the median income tax in russia is around 16%. That could translate to efficiency gains and a more deregulated environment in markets and business. The united states proposed a 30% global income tax awhile ago. Which is roughly double the income tax that russian citizens pay. I am thinking high deficit and debt could have a crippling effect on the US, EU and china if (or when) economic crisis hits. The united states would no longer be able to hand ukraine $40 billion in free cash. Nor would we be able to mobilize our armed forces in the case of an emergency. Any nation russia invaded would have to fend for themselves without much support from the united states or NATO.The united states may seem to have no credit limit at the moment with the way we're spending capital. Eventually we will hit a wall and no longer be able to spend with hyperinflating the us dollar. Which could have catastrophic effects on american wealth, job markets and the economy. We won't be able to do much to help ukraine, or anyone else then. Could that be what russia is waiting for to commit to a stronger attempt at invasion?Those are my thoughts anyway. It seems like basic 2 + 2 = 4. I would be happy if someone came along with a better illustration of the future.",

The problem is, leader isn’t very calm and his commanding is not in the right direction. This will crumble Russia tactics themselves. Funding won’t stop from the other nations because as of now Ukraine stands as protecting wall to the neighbouring countries. They have long lasting fear that Russia has another plans and may go aggressively further to the EU region. This is why USA and NATO will not back out from Ukraine. On the other hand soon after Sanctions imposed on Russian country will start corroding Russian economy. This will be a slow process but eventually it will weaken Russia and they will be in higher debts. The debts won’t be because of taking loans, but because of higher inflation and underlying import of crude oils, rations etc. QuoteOn the plus side if russia is the next dominant superpower they may be bitcoin friendly. At least that would be one positive thing we might look forward to in the horror show that could be the future.If they become dominant then they will immediately switch to fiat friendly. They care about bitcoin right now because they have international sanction, ceased money overseas and only way to trade outside Russia swiftly is bitcoin with unlimited accessibility. This will definitely change after Russia becomes dominant super power which is however highly unlikely.",

If we do, it is not possible to predict because humanity may extinct!Otherwise if we don't see a World War then there won't be a single dominant superpower because the world has been moving towards multiple superpowers in each region where the world is split into small territories and a strong country forms alliances and dominates that territories while having relations with some of the other powerhouses, some friendly and some not.One of the main reasons why the West is not really helping Ukraine is because they want to prolong the war as much as they can to increase the cost on Russia and weaken at least one of these powerhouses.",

      "body": "There are too many points to respond to. In general, however, I don't think Russia is heading toward the direction of becoming the next dominant superpower. Judging by its current actions, it is actually heading toward the opposite direction. It is fast becoming a hermit country than one which dominates the globe. And I don't think a country which effectively isolates itself from the rest of the world has a potential of becoming the world's dominant superpower. In these times, alliances and partnerships matter a lot.In terms of self-sufficiency, Russia is generally not self-sufficient. Although, of course, not in terms of energy and gas. And although the country has only a very small portion of arable land, food imports have indeed decreased significantly and exports increased. Outside of these, however, Russia is highly dependent on other countries. As a matter of fact, extracting the country's topmost resources needs imported materials and technologies.And I don't agree that Russia is not trying very hard to invade Ukraine as quickly and as easily as possible. They simply failed. And this is another factor. A dominant superpower should have a strong military. Ukraine, with the help of western allies, has so far proved that Russia's military is not as mighty as it is paraded. Forget about Bitcoin. It has a very minor role to play, and any country could take a full U-turn in favor of it very quickly.",

But they proved to be economically prepared than the US economic sanction has put together. I would however turn to China being the dominant super power since they have already made lots of countries on their side through their Belt and Road Initiative project and as of now, they have BRICS. This alliance had invited poor countries in South America which could turn to military alliance actually like Venezuela. Today, they've cemented the Solomon Island to be an ally which Australia had been very angry since its pretty much a security breach for them.",

At least that would be one positive thing we might look forward to in the horror show that could be the future.Quite a few of the facts are wrong and quite a few of the conclusions:- UK was not bombed to the stone age in any manner. Only Germany, Japan, part of Russia... not even France as the defeat was quick and swift.- US profited from lending, the USSR simply kept the territories occupied against their will.Russia's GDP is negligible. Seriously, is even lower than Italy's. The strategy from Russia is to pump and hype: great army, great technology, great resources, nuclear power... yet when they are faced with an obstacle all that fades away:- Technology is reliant on western supplies and intellectual property.- The army is mostly from the 90's and unsuited for modern operations.- Their new status as invaders and a threat to any border country will damage their exporting capability.- Their status as sanctioned country will prevent investment in CAPEX, critical to maintain production in the mid term.- Re \"Russia not trying hard\" is wrong. It is trying to the limit of the resources that can spare. Russia has managed to make enemies of everyone around (even China is more afraid than friendly) and have to keep their best shots for self defence and to keep their puppets status - thus they have sent to Ukraine everything else.- Russia's GDP is set to severely shrink. What you call and advantage is actually despotism: keeping the population silent about the economic impact. Russia is looking half good due to sky-high prices of commodities, but that is cyclical not permanent.I do agree that US has to make sure this war does not pay, but Russia is gone as a superpower and may even not preserve the regional power status for more than a couple of decades as they are unable to sustain the technologic advances.Quote from: Ucy on May 27, 2022, 10:20:49 AMWell, Russia is already leading the World militarily ...Not in any manner. The facts on the ground show poor leadership, corruption and very limited applied technology. Russia is applying Sun Tzu's Art of War - \"when you are weak, appear strong\".

      "body": "Russia the next dominant superpower,what kind of joke is this?Saying that the sanctions have not hit Russian economy is a blatant lie,Russian themselves have asked that they can let the Black Sea ports open in Ukraine to ship the grains in order for the food crisis to stop but Western powers must lift their sanctions.As much as a food crisis may come Western powers will not fall prey of any Russian blackmail and rest assured just after a couple of months or maximum until the end of this year and Russia will be a completely isolated state.Saying that they are self sufficient is also completely wrong as people from USSR,people who lived at that era told on international news that on Sundays if they eat bread and butter was like a holiday or some major event to them,that is how self sufficient Russia is.",
