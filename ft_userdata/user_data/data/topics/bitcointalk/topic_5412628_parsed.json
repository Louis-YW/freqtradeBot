It's going to get at least a few people to start thinking more critically about where and to who they send their money. And that is more than worth it to me. It was fun If it was an actual scammer hiding behind a laptop to scam them, will they hate the anonymous scammer, prolly yes, but their hate will yield nothing, their money is gone, in this case they were refunded in full the money they ordinarily would/should/already have lost, thus anyone hating is absolutely kidding me; people should read, live and learn.",

No matter if it's useless NFT pictures, useless Meme-Coins, risky and flawed Defi platforms or just a shitcoin scam, where no real product was planned to be launched - people are still throwing money at it - ok, NFTs have lost volume massively. Unbelievable how easy it is for scammers to collect 300k USD...Recently, someone shilled Terra Luna again on our local (German) board, so I'm not surprised at all.  Sometimes, education needs time - and money.  Maybe a sign that the market will drop again?

Education always needs time. I general, you are right.  My intention was to emphasize learning to avoid such obvious scams because common sense should already teach us to stay away from it - even after losing money once (because someone shilled Terra Luna in our board a few days ago). I was embarassed.  So, for some people with a lack of education it's costing money. (because it's taking time to do research). And for some, it's costing money twice. Should be more accurate.  Quote from: fillippone on September 06, 2022, 10:43:00 PMMoney, I don't know.

That's true, only few will survive: scary bear markets, terrifying FUD, shitcoins, scams and hacks, and, of course a temptation to sell early and take profits.",

Once one or two people testify that a system worked for them, they will troop in believing it will work for them too. People are also too easy to fall for people that are influential and that is why the politicians play with the common people. People who does not understand how money is made keeps losing the money because it was given them or they inherited it. If you own money and understand the principle of money, you will know that bring one and take two without inputting any other thing is a scam.People has been the yield long ago and they Will continue to be the yield even in different ponzi schemes.",

Cause stuff like this could be a game changer for scammer and hackers as they could do it on high profile account and probably used those social profile for scamming. I think it happened a lot already but its a shamed how people can easily go all in. Anyway, degen term is really a hateful stuff on crypto but cant blame them cause some of them get rich due to those shitty projects.Its always better to invest on those good one rather risk it on a gamble with a possible scam.",

Research requires time and some knowledge. An absolute beginner who doesn't understand the market, the technology and the ways they scam people is not going to be able to make a conclusion based on what they research.Take bitcoin for example, searching could bring up a lot of FUD about how bitcoin is \"wasting energy\", is \"fraud\", used by \"criminals\", ... and majority of them are coming from people that a newbie could trust like CEO of a big bank like JPMorgan who was spreading FUD back in 2017 when price was barely $1000.And that's just FUD which is easier to figure out, the technical lies are harder to detect. For example take shitcoins that tell people that they are solving a \"problem\" that doesn't exist in reality just because they copied bitcoin's source code and changed a thing or two! They sell their shitcoin to newbies with the promise of huge returns. How is a newbie supposed to know this is all fake if they don't understand the code and how it is a exact copy of bitcoin?",

It's kind of sad to see people getting scammed TBH but like I always say, I believe that people will not learn unless they will experience it. If you got scammed once, you will know what to do in your next investments. Being scammed twice and there's a problem to you already. Doing research isn't hard because we already have \"Uncle Google\" that will give us all the information that we need. We also have Youtube videos that might help us in our investment journey. I just don't know why people are forgetting about doing research first.Investors here in crypto world are indeed gullible and can easily tricked by influencers. Lucky for me that I didn't get scammed in my crypto journey, but I feel unfortunate to those who are.",

Then he did, and already the money started pouring in. It's that kind of influence that someone has and could be taken advantage of. Imagine that power with someone sinister.

He provides some very elegant explanations of complex subjects that are also entertaining AF.Looks like this topic recently got moved from Bitcoin Discussion. Perhaps its because LUNA is an altcoin, but a lot of \"CeFi\" lending programs (many of them posing as DeFi) also accept BTC deposits and promise fixed returns. Some of them are now bankrupt, and all of them had problems of some sort:- Celsius- Voyager- Nexo- Hodlnaut- Vauld- SALT- PoolinSteering clear of such platforms is not just a matter of education; its also a matter of reeling in one's greed.Sadly the Bitcoin (and other crypto) taken from customers in such instances is being funneled into the hands of the very wealthy, rendering the system not much different from fiat... kind of destroys its purpose, but you can't stop folks from following their instincts.

But I would separate technical situations from common scams, such as the give 1BTC to get 2BTC back. If anyone did even a simple Google search on that common scam, they would get lots of reports on how it's a hoax.In more technical situations, it is best to take a skeptical approach, instead of looking for what's fake, rather start with disbelief, and look for things to prove you otherwise.If you instinctively distrust what you read or see and understand that almost everyone is trying to scam you, then it would take an extra effort to convince you otherwise.",
