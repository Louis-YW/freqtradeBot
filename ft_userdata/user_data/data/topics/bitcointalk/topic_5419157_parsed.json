Else, it's simple: get a hardware wallet, stay away of shitcoins (and metamask) and you should be just fine, especially if you are careful what websites you're visiting and what software you install / run.",

      "body": "Even if it exists, I think the effect would be minimal. And far more scammers are using more proven scam schemes like phishing sites asking for seed phrases, scam smart contracts, etc since some people are still getting scammed by that method.A truly genuine method is seriously to run your own RPC node! Since you verify and interact with the blockchain with your own node. But if you won't bother to do that, it would be the best option to choose the RPC link from the official source of the cryptocurrency site. Â Take a look over https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/getting-started/#node-rpc and https://polygon.technology/, there is information about the available public RPCs data.",

I'm sure that there aren't anyone here knows everything about cryptocurrency or how other new applications work. I know that you are just being careful with scammers, The important thing you need to do when researching is to verify the information that you found out. There are several credible website out there and there are also the company website which is metamask on your case that offers the tutorial to how to add Polygon. There are many trusted members here but I suggest to just copy straight from metamask website itself, Just Be careful of the clone websites though it is easy to know if the website you are browsing is legit.",

No, it's just safe to used Google and search for anything related to crypto as there are a lot of scammers in their.

In fact, the scammers are still doing this, making some phishing sites and also providing certain links to phishing in Google searches. We cannot deny that the risk is very high to always only use Google to search to do something and do action. However, if we are looking for the information about ways to do something. Even if you are browsing the information using Google search, I will also not suggest you follow the steps directly. You can go to the official websites, and search information over there. COmmonly, certain platforms will always provide articles about their tutorials on their platform. ALternatively, you can search the information on trusted and reputable websites and YouTube channels, and sometimes, you can find the information much better and more trusted. However, if you need to click certain links, always check recheck the link itself, even there are back ;inks or not. If the link issuspicious, it is better not to clikc the link to decrease the risks.",

If you haven't seen it yet, I've made a thread entitled: Beware of fake Coinmarketcap!And that has something to do with your question about searching through search engines like Google. It is very likely that you'll see some fake results at the top of your search and they'll be labeled as sponsored ads. And those are the phishing links that might be connected to the keywords that you'll search like that question of connecting or adding polygon to metamask. I guess this will it clear to you that it's very unsafe if you'll search for some crypto related stuff on Google and you need to be vigilant and aware of clicking the wrong links.",

Quote from: Outhue on November 02, 2022, 08:55:00 AMAre there no scam adding network to metamask yet? Did you meant a network specifically being created by scammer for the scamming purpose? People can know that easily even by seeing it. Quote from: Outhue on November 02, 2022, 08:55:00 AMIs there no way scammers are already using fake RPC URL to scam people? I need to ask.Fake RPC can be created but people can know that easily. that's why you shall always use official RPC that being listed in the legit site like an official site. Quote from: Outhue on November 02, 2022, 08:55:00 AMAlso do you have any solid genuine link where all chain data can be copy and past into Metamask instead of searching then through the web?. Just go to the github or wiki that created by the developers just like this https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/",

      "body": "There are activities, IMO that can make one vulnerable to attack: (1) Interacting with fake/malicious tokens. This is one new thing in the crypto space that is really bad and very disturbing. If you observe carefully, you notice that there are fake tokens that have the same symbol as the original one. It is very important to cross-check the contract address of the original token from their website. Failure to do this, you may find yourself interacting with a fake token. The bad thing is that, the fake token may have been programmed to empty your real tokens or perhaps collect other vital data. (2) Giving out your seed phrase for whatever reason. I have participated in an airdrop that they initially gave out the locked tokens to be unlocked at a fixed date. When the date approached, they did not unlock the token and the only way out according to them is to sell Â your wallet/give them the your seed phrase so as to give you the equivalent ( about $245) worth of the airdrop token. On the telegram chat of that token, the admin requests that you DM them for ways to receive your airdrop. Even though you may have to sell you wallet, I find it very disturbing - I guess they may have access to your future wallet especially if you are using metamask on the same phone or PC. This means that some newly launched tokens can be malicious especially if you are to receive the airdrop/buy the token using DApps. That is, connecting your wallet to their website to receive your tokens. Another thing is that such tokens don't ever talk about listing in Centralized Exchanges (CEX). In fact, they avoid listing in CEX. Currently, I am learning more about rpc and the risks.",

There are ways to fake the RPC but I don't think it could lead to a hack. I haven't bumped into a situation like that or read an experience from other users that they were hacked by that kind of scheme.
