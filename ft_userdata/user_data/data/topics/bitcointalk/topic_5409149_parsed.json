Either image the drive (make a copy) to preserve it in its current state or boot into a \"live\" Linux environment and attempt any recovery from a read-only mount.SystemRescue [1] includes some data recovery tools. One of them is PhotoRec [2] which (despite its name) can recover many different file types.It's unfortunate that you used a simple text file because they don't include a file header (except maybe a Unicode BOM), making them hard to locate in a byte-by-byte search. If you remember anything specific about the contents of that file (maybe some small part of your seed) then you might be able to use that information [3] to help PhotoRec find your file.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemRescue[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhotoRec[3] https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/Add_your_own_extension_to_PhotoRec",

That’s why, as stated above, it’s imperative to stop using that disk in order to avoid ovewriting the necessary sectors, or at the very least make a disk image.",

I've tried software like disk drill and other but none gives back that exat .txt file.As said, the recovery seed may be overwritten and unrecoverable.But you said nothing about the actual wallet (or hardware wallet) based on that seed. Is that still operating? Since a wallet like Electrum may show the seed and you can back it up again. Or, if the wallet is still okay, you can (carefully and with backups) maybe create a new wallet, backup properly the new seed and send the funds from the old wallet to the new one (just, again, make sure the old wallet got a proper backup, we don't want to lose that too). And if you're not sure about any step, ask (for example you may want to create the new wallet in a safe environment).",
