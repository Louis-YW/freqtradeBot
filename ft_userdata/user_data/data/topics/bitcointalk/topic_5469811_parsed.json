  "content": "Once scammed, now learning core node. I am using Bitcoin rpc calls. I generated an btc address, and accepted many times btc on that. So, I can easily track how much received on the address. Also this address is provided to one user on the code , I am working on. Now that guy wants to withdraw the btc from same address. How can I do that ? Please help",

      "body": "What exactly do you want to achieve? Instead of using RPC calls why not use it as a normal wallet? Bitcoin core is easy to use in the GUI you can just click the Bitcoin core shortcut and manage your wallet there.Do you remotely control someone's wallet through RPC calls?Can you add more details about what do you want to do through RPC calls?Here's the RPC calls below for sending BTC you can place the same address under bitcoin_address from the command below.Code:bitcoin-cli sendtoaddress <bitcoin_address> <amount>More samples here- https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/sendtoaddress.html",
