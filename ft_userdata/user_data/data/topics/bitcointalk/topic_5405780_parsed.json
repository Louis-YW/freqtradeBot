There is no some sort of \"deleting logs\" because that would be a surefire recipe for a disaster especially for complaints like this one.",

There's a clear proof that the site is cooperating with OP, so let's wait for the final explanation of Duelbits and I believe if proven wrong, the site should compensate the waiting time, imagine the stress that this gambler feel, if the site see the irregularities they should say it right away.",

I do think that for a processing even if worst comes to worst you don't have to wait for more than 3 days, therefore right now I do believe that duelbits needs to either consider his case, make sure they pay him up or legally provide an argument so as why they are not doing that already.",

It is a good thing that you brought you it up here since Duelbits is active here, I hope they resolve it very soon since you have been waiting for more than 2 weeks now. It's not good if you'll ask me. But keep being patient and wait for them. 16 days is a long time frame IMO, perhaps Duelbits can share some overview about your case (what is the account's issue and so on) so we'll also be enlightened about this one. As per my experience, I have no bad experience depositing, playing, and withdrawing with Duelbits. I also been there since 2020, but I'm a smaller gambler compared to you OP.Goodluck",
