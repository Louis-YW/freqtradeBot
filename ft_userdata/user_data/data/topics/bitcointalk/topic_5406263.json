Eh.. probably try looking at the current charts.BTC is currently still a risk asset. It could be an inflation hedge in the future, but definitely not today.I wanted it to be a hedge against inflation and track against the stock market (tech).  So far it has done neither. So between old school Munger and Buffet and tech/bitcoin probably is a middle ground of a balanced and managed portfolio. People get hyped up in moms basement and make to the moon youtubes by looking at candlesticks, absurdity. Sure we all want it to the magic elixir and certain \"200,000\" bitcoin this year the pumpers say. But lets keep our expectations and exposures reasonable.I think it's tough for a 90 year old to embrace the new. Get off my lawn kid.PS If I was 90yo billionaire the last thing I would be doing is chasing money",

They might well be right, Bitcoin might not turn out to be the best cryptocurrency - it is a very successful proof of concept in connection with the transparent blockchain ledger, but that does not mean it will stay number one forever. Telephones started out as switchboards, then morphed into ring dial land lines, then morphed into brick-type mobile phones, then you had tiny but rugged Nokia type dumb phones and now we have super advanced smart phones. Technology can develop and morph over time, do not assume that Bitcoin is the best just because it arrived first. It's worth remembering that Charlie and Warren are heavily invested in a credit card companies like American Express and Visa, so they have ulterior motives in undermining rival payment systems.",

But my question is that if Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet, Bill Gate and other prophets of doom know much about economics and the financial market why haven't they solve the issue of inflation and the stock market losses. Bitcoin has proved to be an outstanding alternative to fiat and the stock market and these anti-Bitcoin forces would do everything to discourage investors and cause massive selloff. But regardless of how much they try, the truth would always overtake lies and manipulations.",

Not sure if you're referring to Munger here, but if so he's definitely not been a victim of the US government or of the traditional banking system.  In any case, he's entitled to his opinion of bitcoin--and he probably wouldn't keep giving it if he wasn't being asked for it by the media.  And believe me, the media knows what his and Buffett's thoughts on crypto are and are just trying to drum up some harsh criticism of it at the behest of whoever their overlords are.Hell, I read an article in the MIT Technology Review recently entitled Crypto's confusing consumer promises (it's in print, so I can't quote excerpts easily enough), and I was baffled as to how they'd allow such inaccurate claims as bitcoin can't be used to buy things and so on to be published, but they're in that article.  The media loves to call things a scam--and sometimes they're quite right--because it makes for a juicier story than heaping praise on something.In any case, Munger isn't an idiot and is right to be a skeptic of bitcoin.  We all should question something with the seductive power it has, but I do think he's being overly harsh on it.  Buffett probably would be (and actually has been) a little bit more diplomatic with his language regarding it.  Lol.",
