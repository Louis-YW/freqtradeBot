I have just a few suggestions for you; if this is an ANN thread then do well to edit it and make it look more professional, cause right now there‚Äôs nothing in your thread that talks about the site that you‚Äôre promoting so do well to edit it. Secondly, I‚Äôd recommend you purchase copper membership as that will enable you post images here in the forum since you‚Äôre still a newbie, so buy a copper membership and add images of your site in your Op that will also stimulate forum members to engage in discussions here.",

Without being registered, one should be able to access the above mentioned features or functions on your website with ease. OP I think you should work on your website in improving your graphics and other aspects of the webpage packages. You can not be a strong contender with such presentation here as members are also moved by what they see here. First impression matters alot so do well to do a good presentation of your casino.At first, upgrade your account to copper membership for you to be able to upload image content of your casino here for easy viewing and lastly, I will advise you seek the expertise of a reputable manager to help you in your casino promotion here as I think doing it alone will definitely make no sense.",

I ask this question because I didn't see the curacao license in your casino and I saw this in your casino's TOS:Quote from: https://knight.bet/terms7. KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER.7.1. knight reserves the right, at any time, to request KYC documentation it deems necessary to determine the identity and location of a User. knight reserves the right to restrict service and payment until identity is sufficiently determined.source: https://knight.bet/termsI read in some places that when a person opens a company, it is very important that this person is kind and very polite to future customers, and for this person who ends up opening a company to show good politeness, this person talks about the reason for having open the company, goals he intends to achieve by opening the company and what good things customers will be able to benefit from when using his company. He talks about the difference between his company and the companies that are already on the market. He talks about himself, his private life and the experience he has in that line of business. Now look at yourself and ask yourself: are you satisfied with the way you did this thread?close your eyes and for a few minutes forget that you created this thread and put yourself in the position of a future customer, now open your eyes and take a good look at this thread and read it and ask yourself: do you think this thread will attract customers ? What is in this thread that would attract any customers? then look at the remaining threads that are about casinos that are on this forum and see how your opponents make announcements and ask yourself: why would people stop using those casinos that have a good thread, are old and honest to use your casino that doesn't It has a good thread and you didn't include relevant information.",
