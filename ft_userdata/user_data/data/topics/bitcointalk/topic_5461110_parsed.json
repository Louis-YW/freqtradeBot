This was posted for auction with a starting bid price of 0.09BTC, didn't get one bid and then posted up for sale for 0.12BTC? I'm confused Initially, I had indeed posted the coin for auction with a starting bid price of 0.09 BTC, hoping to receive bids that would meet or exceed my target price of 0.12 BTC. However, despite the beautiful nature of the coin, there was no bidding activity within the auction timeframe, which led me to reconsider my approach.Considering the lack of bidding interest, I decided to take a different route and offer the coin for sale directly at the price of 0.12 BTC. By doing so, I wanted to give potential buyers, like yourself, an opportunity to acquire the coin at a set price without the uncertainty of an auction.Furthermore, when I mentioned in my new thread that I am accepting offers, it was to give buyers the chance to negotiate a price close to my target if they found the initial price slightly higher than their comfort zone. I am open to discussions and willing to consider reasonable offers from interested parties.If you have any further questions or would like to discuss the coin's price or any other aspect, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks -bitcoinbass",
