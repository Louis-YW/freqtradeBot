  "content": "QuoteWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, the most aggressive step yet in its fight against a 40-year high in inflation.“Inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing. We’re moving expeditiously to bring it back down,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said during a news conference, which he opened with an unusual direct address to “the American people.” He noted the burden of inflation on lower-income people, saying, “we’re strongly committed to restoring price stability.”That likely will mean, according to the chairman’s comments, multiple 50-basis point rate hikes ahead, though likely nothing more aggressive than that.The federal funds rate sets how much banks charge each other for short-term lending, but also is tied to a variety of adjustable-rate consumer debt.Along with the move higher in rates, the central bank indicated it will begin reducing asset holdings on its $9 trillion balance sheet. The Fed had been buying bonds to keep interest rates low and money flowing through the economy during the pandemic, but the surge in prices has forced a dramatic rethink in monetary policy.Markets were prepared for both moves but nonetheless have been volatile throughout the year. Investors have relied on the Fed as an active partner in making sure markets function well, but the inflation surge has necessitated tightening.Wednesday’s rate hike will push the federal funds rate to a range of 0.75%-1%, and current market pricing has the rate rising to 2.75%-3% by year’s end, according to CME Group data.Stocks leaped higher following the announcement while Treasury yields backed off their earlier highs.Markets now expect the central bank to continue raising rates aggressively in the coming months. Powell, said only that moves of 50 basis points “should be on the table at the next couple of meetings” but he seemed to discount the likelihood of the Fed getting more hawkish.“Seventy-five basis points is not something the committee is actively considering,” Powell said, despite market pricing that had leaned heavily towards the Fed hiking by three-quarters of a percentage point in June.“The American economy is very strong and well-positioned to handle tighter monetary policy,” he said, adding that he foresees a “soft or softish” landing for the economy despite tighter monetary policy.The plan outlined Wednesday will see the balance sheet reduction happen in phases, with the Fed allowing a capped level of proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off each month while reinvesting the rest. Starting June 1, the plan will see $30 billion of Treasurys and $17.5 billion on mortgage-backed securities roll off. After three months, the cap for Treasurys will increase to $60 billion and $35 billion for mortgages.Those numbers were mostly in line with discussions at the last Fed meeting, as described in minutes from the session, though there were some expectations that the increase in the caps would be more gradual.Wednesday’s statement noted that economic activity “edged down in the first quarter” but noted that “household spending and business fixed investment remained strong.” Inflation “remains elevated.”Finally, the statement addressed the Covid outbreak in China and the government’s attempts to address the situation.“In addition, Covid-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks,” the statement said.“No surprises on our end,” said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. “We’re a little bit less aggressive on our expectations than the markets are. We do think another 50 basis point increase in June seems likely. … We think inflation is close to peaking. If that shows some signs of peaking and declines later in the year, that gives the Fed a little leeway to slow down on such an aggressive pace.”Though some Federal Open Market Committee members had pushed for bigger rate increases, Wednesday’s move received unanimous support.The 50-basis-point increase is the biggest increase the rate-setting FOMC has instituted since May 2000. Back then, the Fed was fighting the excesses of the early dotcom era and the internet bubble. This time around, the circumstances are quite a bit different.As the pandemic crisis hit in early 2020, the Fed slashed its benchmark funds rate to a range of 0%-0.25% and instituted an aggressive program of bond buying that more than doubled the size of its balance sheet. At the same time, Congress approved a series of bills that injected more than $5 trillion of fiscal spending into the economy.Those policy moves were followed by clogged supply chains and surging demand as economies reopened. Inflation over a 12-month period rose 8.5% in March, as gauged by the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index.Fed officials for months dismissed the inflation surge as “transitory” then had to rethink that position as the price pressures did not relent.For the first time in more than three years, the FOMC in March approved a 25-basis-point increase, indicating then that the funds rate could rise to just 1.9% this year. Since then, though, multiple statements from central bankers pointed to a rate well north of that. Wednesday’s move marked the first time the Fed has boosted rates at consecutive meetings since June 2006.Stocks have tumbled through this year, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off nearly 9% and bond prices falling sharply as well. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which moves opposite price, was around 3% Wednesday, a level it hasn’t seen since late 2018.When the Fed was last this aggressive with rate hikes, it took the funds rate to 6.5% in early 2000, but was forced to retreat just seven months later. With the combination of a recession already underway plus the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Fed rapidly cut, eventually slashing the funds rate all the way down to 1% by mid-2003, shortly after the Iraq invasion.Some economists worry the Fed could face the same predicament this time — failing to act on inflation when it was surging, then tightening in the face of slowing growth. GDP fell 1.4% in the first quarter, though it was held back by factors such as rising Covid cases and a slowing inventory build that are expected to ease through the year.https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/04/fed-raises-rates-by-half-a-percentage-point-the-biggest-hike-in-two-decades-to-fight-inflation.html....Some are saying rate hikes could be related to bitcoin's latest downtrend.Rate hikes make fiat based investments less attractive. Increasing demand for alternatives. Which in turn raises demand for bitcoin and crypto based assets. Rate hikes could have a positive net effect on bitcoin's price. For reasons similar to high inflation in the us dollar or euro causing many to seek bitcoin as an inflation protected asset.The fed proposed rate hikes when Trump was acting President. They claimed it would help prevent the US economy from overheating. There are so many different ideas and competing theories about what rate hikes do and what the motive for them is, it is difficult to have a clear perspective of what is happening.",

For reasons similar to high inflation in the us dollar or euro causing many to seek bitcoin as an inflation protected asset.~Not sure about this. The stock markets around the world crashed as soon as the news regarding rate hike was announced. And if you check the cryptocurrency exchange rates, you can see that Bitcoin prices went down by more than 40% during the last one month or so. This is the pattern we are witnessing for quite some time. Theoretically the demand for Bitcoin and assets such as gold should increase when the stock market goes down. But in reality, we are witnessing the reverse pattern. Whenever the stock market crashes, cryptocurrency market also crashes.",

The downtrend of Bitcoin has nothing to do with the hike rates.Prior to the recent depreciating rate of Bitcoin, first countries like United States of America and European banks have seen increase in inflation,this are mostly Bitcoin skeptics cooking this up in other to console themselves. I think this rise in inflation will lead to stagflation and eventually investors will have too look for other options than bank's as a means to store them fund's.The United States are currently in a big debt, could this be as a result of funding too many (NGO) organizations? WHO! UNICEF! UN!I'm not American though, but I won't want to see him once more as POTUS, He's a fat liar! talks about this related to him is so he can come back for the re - run?",

Honestly they were too aggressive in giving away the stimulus package to the residents and in the process they initiated the bumpy ride of printing money. That was first instance where US first got into debts actually. They over spent on the health care system. Many of you would say health concerns were SOS at the time, true agreed. However there are other nations with enormous population and less money available but they managed to get out of the outbreak. US, failed in its plan and execution. They driven the whole thing in political manner - by giving free stuff they were like attracting the votes! The whole thing turned into disturbed supply chain, less money for spending and limitless money printing. What US doing today is their own fault. They already need huge supplies from the China and some other countries which is now interrupted as we speak and whole business thing is turned into inflation today.",

Rather shocked to see it slow after the conflict in Ukraine. March's inflation numbers were not reflective of the price increases due to war and so I expected a sharper increase with April's numbers factoring in for war related expenses. Regardless, the prices of goods will not come down even as the inflation rate lowers. Reminder that CPI calculates the rate of increase in consumer goods. Even if the rate of price increase slows down a little, the prices are still increasing.",

It's not a matter of just the interest but it's also a matter of how much goes into that pockets, additionally bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are definitely at a benefit. Some people are basing their opinion of decrease in the market price because of fed, I don't think so because this seems like a temporary state that will only benefit the super rich with actually a lot of money in their banks.

Rate hikes actually decreases the attractiveness of alternative investments like bitcoin. Because people can't stand much volatility, are likely to move to fixed income plans based on fiat. You mentioned it being a pain for borrowers only. How many corporations and publicly traded companies regularly use credit and loans from banks? This places additional strain on credit and loan dependent entities who are represented in stock market averages. Who comprise the majority of GDP statistics. Its an additional difficulty for doing business in the country that is stacked on top of supply chain shortages and rising fuel costs.Businesses and stock options declining under credit restrictions introduced by higher interest rates, make bitcoin and crypto alternatives a more appealing investment.Higher rates also encourage capital flight and investment outside the country.(The only gains made by higher interest rates are banks having a better margin.)BTW who is moving to fixed income plans based on fiat? None of them come close to delivering greater ROI in contrast to inflation. None of them deliver returns as high as crypto based alternatives did. Celsius network paid out 10% to 20% interest rates on accounts, before it became available to accredited investors only.",

Low interest rates was an easy way for countries to support the economy during the covid pandemic. But things changed in the last 6 months, having inflation rates of close to 10% becomes very dangerous for developed countries. There is no way that the average people can offset the increase in living expenses. Food and energy prices already skyrocketed this year, leading to probably all other sectors also increase prices. In my country we can already feel the rise of strikes and angry worker who demand a raise. With inflation at such high rates there is a risk of a downward spiral, rising prices and inflation leads to higher salaries which in return leads to higher prices again. For people with large amounts of fiat cash this is the worst situation to be in. The only real solution is to start buying more crypto currencies and stocks.",
