Altcoins can be very volatile and some of them can become shit coins and later become dead. I will prefer bitcoin.You mean people will borrow money from bank and bank will demand high profit from them to pay back. That is true. But some people borrow from bank and they are able to pay back after they use the money for the business they want to use it to do. Some  people use it for business and the business did not bring any good return and they have no other means than for the bank to sell what they used as collateral. You can invest in bitcoin and make money, but have you forgotten that you need money to invest in bitcoin? If you can start a business without borrowing from bank, that would be better. Not also good to borrow money to invest in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies.",

Banks are not stupid, if they do not give you better conditions it is because of the risk/reward ratio of your profile, as usually a 10% down payment is enough. If you have that 40% you can look for another property that you can pay cash for that amount and forget about the banks.

And you are right banks are here to make money so they are not going to appreciate the ideas and give loans based on that. In my experience, banks will chase you to give loans.And if your only goal is to make money the ways are countless and of course, you can do it via cryptos too but no investments comes with zero risks and guaranteed returns that is why bank ask for collateral, guaranteer and a lot of legal procedures when they are giving you the money.",

You finally said DCA cryptocurrency? When talking about hedging and asking for cheap taxes, why not far away Bitcoin offers an offer without any interest. In using the word cryptocurrency, it is too broad so what coin do you mean? if it's anything other than Bitcoin the risk is much greater than property. No matter how bad the property is, you can still use it as a place to do business, but in cryptocurrency which you yourself didn't mention, I assume the altcoin is rubbish, very easy to manipulate.",

You have made a valid point, I was thinking the same, no one wants to lose their earned money. Either its the OP or the Banks. They want to earn from each other as they can. But,  OP do have a point that by doing DCA in crypto he can earn more and could get more profits. But foe OP, I have only one suggestion, that if you are a businessman then you must know the rules of business. You must have some expectations of profits and for how long you are planning to hold the assets you are going to buy. Either it is land, property or cryptocurrencies. Point is, BTC is a good hedge against inflation but you will get to see the results in the long run. So please make a mind set that is required to do earn profit by accumulating BTC. And it does not matter how you accumulte BTC, like you can do DCA and Lump sum too. But if you are planning to invest in some assets that could generate you high profits and you don't have to pay huge interest and you want full custody then investing in BTC is better then anything. But be aware that I am talking only about BTC. I will not recommend one to start investing in alts for holding purposes.",

Before a bank will agree to offer any credit or loan facilities they will do an in-depth evaluation of your business proposal, profit margin, and interest rate. If they are not sure of the business they will take collateral to serve as a guarantee. But to be candid, I didn't see any thing innovative in your business proposal. You just applied for a loan to buy a property which is very common among the populace. Although these bankers rend to be too greedy I won't blame them much, they have bills to pay.

But if your target is to invest in bitcoin, you can make some money depending on how much you invest and how long you are willing to hodl your coin.

I had to do my best to connect the dots to make sense out of some statements.From what I get,You went seeking a loan and you were offered a mortgage at an outrageous percentage, you as well sort out a property in real estate to invest in but, it’s been offered at yet another high price and they still won’t let you inspect the property for damages or devalue it.Hope I got all that right though! If that be the case,Then that’s just how crappy the situation could be when you’re hoping to make meaning of your life from the bank. It comes at a high price but, you can’t get that in cryptos.
