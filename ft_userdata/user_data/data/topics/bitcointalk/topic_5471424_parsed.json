While many define wealth as having more than enough money and living a comfortable life, I believe richness goes beyond finances to include moral and emotional well-being.

In my opinion, people have different views on defining wealth. Materialistically, wealth is defined as lots of money, lots of property, being able to invest anytime and anywhere. For some people, wealth is not always calculated by how much property they have, they define rich in a very simple way. For them, wealth is measured in terms of the health of themselves and their families and having money to finance their family's needs.Wealth is relative to each individual. It depends on which side you judge the meaning of wealth.",

But we are not here for that at all.Hence its all a matter of how you see things. But if you want to get rich, none of the above two are easy.",

While many define wealth as having more than enough money and living a comfortable life, I believe richness goes beyond finances to include moral and emotional well-being. It's about finding a balance in all aspects of life that hold significance.When we talk about wealth, we immediately think of money and property, no one thinks of happiness, emotions or morality. If someone has a stable career, a happy family, has everything and they are satisfied with life, then that person is successful in life. I think rich people will be different from successful people in life. Money is only a measure of a person's wealth, not a measure of a person's success in life. But when we have a lot of money, our lives will be easier to achieve happiness, love, and health than when we don't have money. Therefore, money is very important and is the premise of many other things.",

I don’t have that type of richness. My richness is life, forever.” #bobmarley🎥 Bob is interviewed by reporter George Negus (60 Minutes Australia) at 56 Hope Road in Kingston, 1979.https://twitter.com/bobmarley/status/1458512404443119620?lang=en+++So it's not really about the money for me, as long as I survive in this world with a comfortable life, I wouldn't be chasing a lot of money as I also like to retire spending time with my family, just be happy, I think that would make you rich already. Even Steve Jobs, in his statement he regret working to hard that he sacrifice his happiness already. Quote\"I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others’ eyes my life is an epitome of success.However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to.At this moment, lying on the sick bed and recalling my whole life, I realize that all the recognition andwealth that I took so much pride in, have paled and become meaningless in the face of impending death.https://medium.com/@vikasjangir/steve-jobs-last-words-d79012fad236",

You do not have to work for the money... your money works for you. 4. You have good health5. You have the love of a family and a lot of true friends. (not fake friends) 6. You have zero debt7. You can \"Pay it Forward\" (fund charities or help other people with donations)8. You are true to your religion.  Once you achieve these 8 things in life, you are rich in my opinion.... and you will prosper in life.",

Being able to experience the things you dream of is wealth. Our dreams must have a limit and a logical basis. Except for some people, no one will ever experience the highest level of everything. Therefore, if you determine the limits of your dreams, you may be able to achieve them. We should not forget that most people are insatiable and are unhappy after achieving what they want.In fact, wealth is a mental work. If you educate yourself well mentally, you can enjoy life and make your environment better, even if your financial situation is at a normal level. In my opinion, this is one of the greatest riches.",

They will answer different definitions of rich from your question, because the definition of rich is relative to each person. In my opinion, poverty only happens to people who always feel like they don't have enough. Meanwhile, rich people who always provide for themselves (feel they have enough) are essentially truly rich people.It could be said that the definition of being rich is for those who are good at managing finances in three aspects, namely income, management and expenses. Income must be greater than output, management is directed at obtaining other income (investment). They can use their money to get more money, like a slingshot, pulling back to shoot forward. Rich people are simple and don't complicate themselves. Always buy anything with cash, never credit. Has a lot of business, investments everywhere, and he will give charity without anyone knowing.",

QuotePerhaps looking at the issue of wealth beyond the scope of material things (money), it also includes other intangible things that we accidentally forget such as intelligence, health, spirit,...  Because of my limited understanding, I cannot fully understand the problems in which people can use it in different positions to get effective results. But maybe the problem is that I first see money as just a useful tool for our lives, fair and not by being intertwined in the macro environment. And using it to meet personal needs is really very small because the nature of our needs is often quite easy. I think using money in a beneficial way and avoiding waste is the way to help us. we get a little happiness from this tool. Sharing material things with those in need, yes this is very necessary and should be done. Besides, it is also necessary to share intelligence, health, spirit,...  with everyone, and a truly rich person is someone who is always free in every decision they make.",

To define riches differs from one human to another but if I were to define it, riches in terms of materialism means the ability to own a significant amount of money or you own possessions of significant monetary value. Meanwhile, in a general context, to use the word rich in relation to something means to have plenty so it can't be limited to money alone. One can be rich in money but do not have the rich knowledge to use the money judiciously.Measures of material wealth; both income and GDP are closely related to give human satisfaction and those who have money are known to have more happiness than the one that doesn't and these are the ones who feel materialism can give happiness more than contentment. For me, being rich is not about material wealth alone but the combination of knowledge in other areas of life as well and the ability to be content with it.",
