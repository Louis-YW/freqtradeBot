Many follow match after match and even place bets to win money.According many trusted source, news and google, i've found same answer if World cup 2022 started from Nov 20th, which mean it already running more than 2 weeks, so i do believe it can't be called \"few days\" anymore.QuoteThis makes me wonder if many of you have won more money than usual. Because when compared to usual days, this World Cup provides a temptation to place bigger bets to win bigger money.Current world cup resulted many new countries faced on semifinal, ex. Croasia. So i think lot of people losing their money because they betted on few big names before.QuoteI made a poll to find out how big you are winning from this World Cup. And if you compare it to the usual day, how much is the percentage of the increase from that? Thank you. I believe it's even goes negative",

      "body": "I’m only betting using small amount of money on promotional bet offer such as double odds or odds boost. I rarely bet on regular 2x1 pick since I have limited analysis on world cup. So far I already accumulated a total win of 200+$ by just doing calculated bets on matches that I know that it has a high success rate. Tonights matches is tough and probably close match. This matches are typically what I’m avoiding. I only bet on match that one has clear advantage on the other. Thanks God I’m not available yesterday or else I will lose big chunk of my profit on Brazil bet.",

I don't usually place bet in the world cup or football matches as I am not really familiar with it (Familiar with the game but with the team and players are not). But I do place bet in the previous Dota 2 TI and managed to have a profit around 250-300% of my total bankroll.If you are enthusiast of the sport event you have the advantage to analyze it easily and therefore earn good profit from it.",

If you get it right you win money. I'm not expecting to win this since there are already at the top of the poll but there are still more win to go before it ends.",

Thankfully there are a bunch of sportsbook promos that bailed out some of my losses and i'm doing pretty well so far in the playoffs so I might be close to breaking even.",

Because when compared to usual days, this World Cup provides a temptation to place bigger bets to win bigger money.I know the temptation to place bigger bets to win bigger money is there, especially to betting on the underrated teams for every clash because of their bigger odds. I know that the potential to win is also equal to the potential to loose my big bet, so I am usually discouraged from betting with more money than anything usual. I don't know if anyone feels like me in this competition, but I have not overcome that fear of loosing if I bet with more money.",

Mainly because I've been influenced by my colleagues, friends, and families, most of us are currently excited about watching the World Cup and they were recently introduced to online gambling by one of my family members and we are now making our individual bets depending on what we have discussed and decided to bet on. Mostly, we bet on just one country but some of us disagree and bet on the latter team. To be honest, it's more on about having fun than getting money right now as we all now are checking and watching the matches. But still, if ever some of us will be addicted or have lost some, we still managed each other to avoid overspending or overbetting.",

Your pool is making confusing the meaning of this:>$100-$500<$1,000-$1,000If you make between (-) better to don't make it < or >, because greater and lesser symbols are useless, and that <$1,000-$1,000? what this, maybe 500 - 1000?.So back to the topic, when we talk about percentages of winning, I'm pretty sure if the professional gambler was in here for a long time wouldn't share about the winning, they will silent and didn't make the noise as people did, it is something that is not important to share, that something washing time.  So if anyone here shares his winning and proof, I really sure is not more than $100.",

Moreover if you want to increase the money from betting or from a single bet, then you need to bet on games with higher odds. If a game specifically world cup game showing high odds and and you place a bet on that and suppose you win that match, then yes you can increase your money from that bet.
