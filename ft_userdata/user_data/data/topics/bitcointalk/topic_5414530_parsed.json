      "body": "You can compare withdrawal fees for all assets that are on the exchanges that you mention:Binance Deposit & Withdrawal FeesBybit Deposit and Withdrawal FeesThere are similar reference tables on almost every exchange. Let's compare fees for crypto you mention before (for binance):Litecoin: 0.001 ltc (0.051491 USD)Algorand: 0.008 algo (0.00295807 USD)Calculated with https://3commas.io/converter/ltc-usd and https://3commas.io/converter/algo-usdYou can also find the minimum withdrawal amount in the tables above.If you want to withdraw in stablecoins and if there is a small amount on the balance, it is easiest to withdraw TUSD to the BNB Smart Chain (BEP20). Minimum Withdrawal is 0.44 and fee is 0.8If there is at least ten dollars on the balance, then you can withdraw it for free as BUSD to the BNB Smart Chain (BEP20).",

Do you think these 2 coins are the best options to use when withdrawing?Those coins are also good option when withdrawing your money from the exchange sites. The fees are quite small for litecoin but i will prefer to use the stable token rather than it. It's caused by the volatility may sometime affect total amounts that you have withdrawn it from the platform. Quote from: david678345 on September 22, 2022, 06:28:38 PMIs it good to take the risk?

      "body": "Used to do withdraws on litecoin way back, although I find it somewhat expensive at times and slower compared to XRP. In Ripple, I get my transaction done from one exchange to another in less than 2 minutes, and the fees don't go over 10 cents at most. Since I found out about Ripple's fees and confirm times, I never tried to look for an alternative, although of course it will be helpful if I can find a 'better' alternative than the one I'm using right now. For those who frequently move funds from exchanges to exchanges, XRP is a good choice if you're looking for fast transactions and cheaper fees.",

I have been withdrawing money using P2P and the prices don't change much.Secondly, if you need to test the withdraw first, you need to withdraw the minimum amount set by exchanges. Every exchange has a different value and it is usually greater than a dollar",

And aside from that, it only takes a few minutes to confirm. Dogecoin also is asking for small commissions and fees. Well, we also have to check if our receiving wallet accepts those coins I've mentioned above otherwise, it gives no option but to just use BTC or ETH as this likely been supported by all wallets.",

The other day I tried to withdraw 4 dollars with bybit and binance and I got the message: the withdrawal is less than the minimum allowed.first, compare from stable coin, algorithm and and lite coin. which one is more efficient. this is indeed every excanger has a minimum withdrawal especially the 2 markets you mentioned. I did a survey and it turns out that xlm and trx may be lower in some markets for fees. And if you are looking for an affordable minimum withdrawal and spend why don't you choose Hotbit from the start? all of them already have regulations and terms of condition for each of these managements and as a customer, like it or not, you have to follow the rules.Quote from: indo1 on September 23, 2022, 12:53:39 AMAs far as I make withdrawals using stable coins there are no problems whatsoever. but I prefer to use TRX because it is cheap and fast. Some say that stable coins sometimes also have their own risks, because there is no clarity whether stable coins are really backed up or not. but I'm sure if it was BUSD they would be safe.yes trx is quite special and the speed of delivery and cheap, quite a favorite to be an alternative also for me when the trx network is needed and quite often used by some people, especially deposits.if you talk about busd, it's definitely backed up by binance bro. it means that you have less intuition which guarantees stability of universal coins like usdt. but looking at the giant company, at least it's pretty convincing. although I rarely use busd.",

I understand the risk, but so far I haven't encountered any on USDT so I still prefer to used them.So what I do is from BTC->USDT if I'm doing P2P in Binance. I know you can do it BTC right away, but I prefer to convert it to USDT first.As for altcoins, Doge or Xrp, I used them before for depositing in an exchange and gambling platform, they are very cheap as fast. So look for them as good alternatives as well.",

I don't suppose you would hold $4 worth of altcoin so it's best to just use the P2p market and trade it for your local currency.In bybit I guess you can use the XRP I think these are the easiest and fastest altcoins that is widely used.",

To be safe and avoid paying high fees for withdrawals as well as the risk of price fluctuations while waiting for withdrawal confirmation, you should choose USDT or stable coins. I don't remember the exact withdrawal limit or withdrawal fee of other coins but for stable coins it is usually fixed at 1USDT for Tron network or other networks except ETH network.
