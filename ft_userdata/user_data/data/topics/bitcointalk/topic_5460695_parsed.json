  "content": "Bitcoin is being invaded by institutions. Is this a sign that Bitcoin will be pumping hard or just a bull trap? This time we will discuss institutions around the world that are raiding Bitcoin Busily and want to enliven the Bitcoin ecosystem. Either just being a retailer for Bitcoin, becoming a custodian, or even issuing a Bitcoin ETF. So, Let's discuss.American institution.Well, shocking news came from America. Because Nasdaq will provide crypto Custody services in mid-2023. Currently, the largest ones providing this service in America are Fidelity and BNY Mellon. And this is a big move for the Nasdaq. Wow, is it possible that one day the Nasdaq will become a Crypto Exchange too? Or stocks on the Nasdaq can also be issued onchain. And right after binance and SEC broke things off, BlackRock announced it would be launching a Bitcoin Spot ETF. And this decision is actually just waiting for a signature from Gary Gensler. And and a unique thing is, in a TV interview about 5 years ago, Larry Fink said there was no interest in crypto assets, he even said that crypto assets were only for money laundering. In June 2023, BlackRock proposed a Bitcoin spot ETF called iSHARES Bitcoin trust. If approved, this will be the first Bitcoin Spot ETF to be approved by the SEC. Well, not only BlackRock is proposing Bitcoin Spot ETF. But also bitwise, Wisdom 3, and Flacray. And you know what ? All about the SUE and the PROPOSING already cleared for now, right ?The ETF market in America alone is worth more than 7 trillion USD. A giant market. Where Bitcoin's market cap is only less than 600 billion US Dollars. And BlackRock itself has assets of 9 trillion USD under its management. And while BINANCE US and coin base are being sued by the SEC. Fidelity, Schwab, Citadel created their own crypto exchange, namely EDX. In the midst of the SEC lawsuit and claims of crypto assets as securities by the SEC, it turns out that this has not dampened traditional finance's interest in entering the digital asset sector. Or is there already a scenario that way? Well, EDX was founded on a combination of several traditional firms such as Charles Schwab, Citadel securities, Fidelity digital assets, sequoia capital, paradigm, and financial firms. Another shocking info came from the IMF. This time the IMF said, the crypto ban was not the best approach. Even said that regions or countries must be able to focus on demand for digital assets and increase transparency. From the last America, the first Bitcoin leverage future ETF with BITX Ticker was approved and will be launched at CPOI. The difference, twice the leverage of the ETF future with this ETF future is in the leverage. This means that the return on investment is twice that of futures ETFs like BITO. But Bitcoin leveraged Futures ETFs also have twice as much risk as Futures ETFs.German institution.From German Deutsche Bank, the biggest bank in Germany applied for a license as crypto custody. No kidding, this is the largest bank in Germany with total customer assets reaching 1.4 trillion US Dollars. And it is estimated that Deutsche Bank will work with Galaxy digital. While the second largest bank in Germany, DZ Bank also works with Metaco and creates a crypto custody platform for institutional investors in Germany.Swiss institution.After the state bank post Finance officially sold Bitcoin and crypto last April. Now XEROF, a financial institution from Switzerland, is launching a certificate in the form of Bitcoin worth 100 million US Dollars. Now based on a report from UPS, 68% of families in Switzerland will maintain their investment in crypto assets. While 27% are trying to increase their investment portion.Institution from France.One of the largest banks in France, CACEIS bank obtained a license from French regulators for crypto custody services. Well, this bank is also one of the largest banks with total customer funds of 5.1 trillion USD.Hong Kong Institution.Now in Hingkong, the Hong Kong government is actively trying to attract institutions to enter Hong Kong and also has ambitions to become a crypto hub in the region. Even the Hong Kong monetary authority forces 3 banks such as HSBC, Standard Carter, and Bank of China to provide services on crypto exchanges. Well, there is another Greenland financial technology application for a license in Hong Kong to trade crypto, carbon credit, and NFT. Well, Greenland financial technology This is a real estate group that is 46% owned by the Shanghai government. Hong Kong has also provided a budget of US$6.4 million for the digital asset sector booster in Hong Kong.Institution from Japan.In Japan, Japan is pushing for regulations to lift the moratorium on trading using leverage. Well, actually Japan in 2020 was a country that allowed trading using up to 25 times leverage on digital assets. But in early 2022, Japanese regulators limited it to only two times and trading volume dropped significantly.Institution from Singapore.Good news for XRP Army friends from Singapore because ripple has obtained a license from a regulator in Singapore. With this license, Ripple can offer cross-border money transfers and digital payments in Singapore, we know that the case with the US SEC has been completed.Well, that surprised me. When BINANCE and Coinbase were sued by the SEC, this should have been logical, friends. Institutions should be afraid. But why are institutions on the contrary, competing to apply for licenses to their respective regulators and open digital asset services? If institutions have entered, Pump should be unavoidable. Moreover, it coincides with the halving in 2024. And by chance someone asked this. If institutions are already in, it means we can only buy Bitcoin from them. Yes, actually we can also buy from peer to peer. From friends for example or from other people. But when institutions enter and the bitcoins are in Custody by them, the Bitcoins on the market automatically become scarcer. Plus because of the halving. So there is potential for the price to be more expensive because it is rarer and there are fewer in the secondary market. What do you think friends?References :- https://cryptopotato.com/nasdaq-to-offer-crypto-custody-services-by-mid-2023/- https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/20/deutsche-bank-applies-for-digital-asset-license-in-germany-as-tradfi-pushes-further-into-crypto/- https://www.xerof.com/news/xerof-launches-100-million-active-managed-certificate-bitcoin- https://cryptonews.com/news/hsbc-standard-chartered-bank-of-china-pressured-by-hong-kong-embrace-crypto-exchanges-next-crypto-hub.htm- https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-principle-approval-payment-institution-license-singapore- https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/23/crypto-ban-may-not-be-best-approach-to-balance-risk-demand-imf/#:~:text=The%20International%20Monetary%20Fund%20said,stance%20towards%20the%20crypto%20industry.",

As soon as government knows there interest in Bitcoin, as there can't control Bitcoin they will seize the opportunity to control the institutions as an indirect control to Bitcoin causing this institutions to tax individuals who use there products more. it's vis-versa Bitcoin gets more increase, individuals get high taxations.",

Because many big institutions even IMF has made many announcements in favor of Crypto. Which is definitely a bullish news. And all of the news that you have shared are bullish.But wait, where is the impact they are making, they are making just slight impact on the market nothing more. What could be the reason, like are they just want to excite newbie to get into market or wanted to streamline the adoption of BTC by encouraging other people who still think of BTC and crypto as scam. I do not have exact idea. So, it might be a bull trap, or mentioned companies might really wanted to make some legal profit by ETFs or wanted to streamline the pathway for others to adopt BTC just like i heard Indonesian are going to release there own national exchange. Such news are bullish but why BTC is not going in bull run. I think when such news will come true like other than just announcing them, when they will be executed then we might see bull run but till then we should not blindly trust every news because when one party changed with other, such announcements are get delayed by new governments.",

We need to remain flexible, as the market is likely to change due to the entrance of institutional investors.Politically, these changes indicate a growing comfort with digital currencies, which could lead to tighter controls and better safeguards for traders.Nonetheless, vigilance is warranted. While the introduction of such institutions may cause an initial spike in the market, such expansion may not be permanent.

This time we will discuss institutions around the world that are raiding Bitcoin Busily and want to enliven the Bitcoin ecosystem. Either just being a retailer for Bitcoin, becoming a custodian, or even issuing a Bitcoin ETF. So, Let's discuss.You know, I've heard stories of many losing players or \"burned-out\" ones (dropping out) at work, which essentially means \"game over,\" and every time you hear a tale as if it's about battling some monstrous \"Whale\" or \"Mr. Market\" or \"Institutions\". But in reality, it's called \"I lost hope and don't know how to play,\" and its author is \"Mr. Whiner.\" I don't know, maybe they do have problems, but I don't. Listen, guys, to win this game, you don't need Bitcoin ETF, knowledge of mathematics, mathematical statistics, probability theory, programming, a 666 IQ trading strategy, artificial \"intelligence,\" multi-billion capital, insider information, access to matching engines at the speed of light, leverages, working 14-hour days, or owning an exchange... all you need to win this game is hope, and to have hope, you need a preacher. Just take control of precisely 2.625 Bitcoin in the market and move it to a cold wallet. No more, no less. That's the optimal bet in this game.Yes, it's all as simple as biblical truths. You don't even question why you are entitled to one wife. You don't think that two wives are better than one. And three wives are better than two. You live in a society where the consensus is that one wife is what you get, regardless of whether you're Jeff Bezos or a plumber. What if one (with a 50/50 division of men and women) is the optimum?",
