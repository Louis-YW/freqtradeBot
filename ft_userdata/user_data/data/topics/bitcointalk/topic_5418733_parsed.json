My take on the bear market is, that it is of course a bad thing overall but at least we have a chance to invest into big and established projects with a massive discount.",

ATH is not the point here but rather there's a great recovery for project that survives this bear market since investors will surely buying spree any token that still not moving to catch up some profit on a bull run market. ATH is still very far since the current marketcap of crypto is just 1/3 of the marketcap during ATH but that doesn't mean that crypto won'thave a good recovery if it didn't reach the new ATH.",

People are afraid to buy Bitcoins in this bear market, so definitely they might have forgotten the altcoins. Nevertheless we should keep a watch on the top 10 coins at coinmarketcap. These coins have great marketcap and will definitely rise in the next bull run. Let’s hope for positivity in every aspects.",

Most certainly tons of them will survive and be around for the next bull season, but that does not indicate they are for the long term.",

Even most of the top 10 coins in the marketcap cannot give us an assurance that they will always be profitable and reach their new ATH when bull run comes. So probably, let’s just focus more on bitcoin and ethereum for long term hodling as they will eventually skyrocket again when bullish market is here. Although we can always invest with the rest of the coins but never expect too much price increase from them as they will just follow whatever the path of bitcoin takes.",

But it's going to be tough, I mean we still have a whole year in 2023, so they will be tested. I think not only projects but mid to lower exchanges (that does not scam), will have a low rate of survival.And the thing with this coins is, if you have been lucky to invest in bearish market, hold and then in the bull run they become of the hottest projects and investors pouring their money on it, for sure it's going to be a big windfall for you.

It's unlike majority of shit tokens that were doing dead during the bearish market happened. Bitcoin is showing a good sign caused by the FED has been stopping to raise the interest even higher. US has been confirmed to avoid the recession. This gives so many hope for crypto to make its comeback for the next season. Im still waiting for another good news that may come very soon about crypto especially bitcoin. The good news about bitcoin may be able to pump the price of all crypto that is still survive right now.",
