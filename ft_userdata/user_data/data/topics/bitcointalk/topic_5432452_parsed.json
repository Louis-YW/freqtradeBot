Because over time you will also trust Bitcoin more after reading and discussing more in this forum for Bitcoin. After all, it is a very natural thing when you don't really believe in Bitcoin when you don't know more about Bitcoin.But by reading more and discussing and also buying Bitcoin with the amount of money you have, I think you have done the right thing because the price of Bitcoin is currently still at a price that is not too expensive and this could be the first try you in Bitcoin and hopefully it will be a very pleasant experience for you. So don't hesitate or hesitate to continue discussing and asking questions in this forum.",
