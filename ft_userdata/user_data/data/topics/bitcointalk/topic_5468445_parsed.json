  "content": "Hey BTC talk, first time poster here.I've been lurking for a while and signed up to a few crypto casinos thanks to the lovely help from people on here. One such site recommended was the domain sportbet.one.They had a welcome bonus to which i deposited 0.3 eth (around $500) and received 125% on top. I had to wager this X amount of times which I completed last night. It was almost exclusively done on the sports book, at their odds.Today i woke up to find my bonus had been cancelled (after I'd wagered the required amount). I went on live chat and they said management had cited the following terms:1. No minimal risk betting2. No more than 1 account per person/Ip etc 3. No more than 1 bonus per person/Ip etcI asked them what I'd actually done, and they just kept repeating the above. Apparently I've broken all of these terms!Firsty, I don't even know what on earth minimal risk betting is. I was placing 1 bet on a match/game, then another on another game etc, so that is just outright false.Secondly, I've never had an account with these guys as I was only made aware of them about a week ago.Thirdly, it's convenient they waited for me to spin up my balance before cancelling the bonus fraudlently!My ending balance was around $5,500, so they've stoled $5k USD from me for absolutely no reason. It's outright fraud.Does anybody know what I can do in this situation? I know they are unregulated, but are there any means I can sue the owners? As I can't find any information on them anywhere but I'm willing to take this right until the end if so. This is actually a criminal offence.Please, any help would be appreciated guys and gals! https://gyazo.com/36c2425f093657035a4be44bf22a1905https://gyazo.com/c6f894fa09f5c140247162ec2c32ddb6",
