I can move the thread without any problems. The App is in Beta Test for the moment with a giveaway of 25$ given to the first 3 places.We are looking to increase our exposure to advertisers at this exact moment to offer surveys, rewards with games and others but all takes a tone of time with emails and implementations. If you run the APP 1 hour at this moment you are fighting for the first 3 places on Beta Test from there onwards we looking 1$ or more per survey and 0.5$ hour watching videos. As I mention we are in early phase and looking to expand with more users to get the best deals.Regarding the permissions I did not understood the question.One more time thank you your support Best WP",

We will share 25$ for the first 3 places instead of paying the coins earned since we still finding out what would be the ration coin/$. The numbers in the website are matching 100% the numbers on the backend. Proof can be given.Many thanks for all the kind supportBestWP",
