      "body": "So this makes it a sort of anniversary to celebrate the launch of the logo as we know it today.Haven't really paid attention to the origin of the Bitcoin logo up till this point, but it's a topic worth discussing, considering it's relevance in the spread of Bitcoin, of which images play a vital role in marketing.Tried searching for more references on the origin of the logo and any information which could have been missed in the articles shared, but I'm yet to find any at this point in time.Could there be some other unidentified creator who contributed to the design?",

      "body": "A lot of topics about Bitcoin logoEvolution of the Bitcoin LogoBitcoin logoBitcoin logo (another topic)I have to quote this oneThe second version is used until nowadays with a modification in the background color, from the color in that version to orange. Rarely seen, but sometimes you can see exchanges or platforms that are still using the second version with the old color (not orange).Quote from: Little Mouse on October 16, 2022, 07:44:32 AMNot sure how much degree the B is, I can't remember whether I have ever read this anywhere. The initial Bitcoin logo wasn't this which was later even changed by Satoshi Nakamoto into the current logo of bitcointalk forum. Later on, bitcointalk user bitboy came with the current version though his thread doesn't show the image he posted. Check here- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631.0 though you can check the original; thread here- https://web.archive.org/web/20130524191250/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631.01st Version2nd Version by satoshi, is Bitcointalk logo now.",

      "body": "It turns out that the birthday of the bitcoin logo (orange with a slope to the right) is November 12? This day can also be included in the calendar of holidays of the bitcoin-community, if it has not already been done. How about celebrating this event? What ideas are there for this? For example, we can make an art competition a for the best performance of bitcoin logos, including both drawing, handmade or any other creative implementation. At least in cooking, as long as it reflects the essence of the bitcoin logo as much as possible. I understand that in part all these contests have already been held and therefore, you can add some feature to this one to match the spirit of the bitcoin logo. In my opinion, this should not be missed, because this logo is already a global trend, by which bitcoin is known.",
