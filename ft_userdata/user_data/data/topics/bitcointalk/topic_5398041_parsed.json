It is common to see people thinking regretting they didn't bought bitcoin at 30k... But when it reaches 30k again, people are afraid to buy it.I can really get why people do that. Because they think it was easy for us to buy bitcoin 2-3 years ago. But it wasn't. It is always risky to buy bitcoin. It was never really \"cheap\" at the moment.Does bitcoin looks cheap for you now? I don't know, but my guess is that everything (from stocks to bitcoin)  is cheap now, and it is worth getting exposed to different risks and assets.Bitcoin won't go to zero. But if it does drop to 20k, I know most people will be afraid to buy it. This is when we need to be brave and greed. Not when it is in ATH.",

How will you be at that moment?I would buy as much as possible if BTC went back down below a dollar and I would hoard it like a maniac. It feels weird to respond to the question, because there's no way that all of the bitcoin would just disappear or be scammed without there being something imminently more important that caused it. That being said, nothing lasts forever and I'm sure there will come a time when we get beyond BTC.",

Many already trust bitcoin as an investment, just look at the price now of bitcoin from how much it started, it's because of the adoption and how people trust and sees it's importance. Being too negative or having fear too much to try will not lead us into any profit. And Im glad I try and trust Bitcoin even before and how it is capable soon to recover from this bear again.",

How will you be at that moment?When creating a what if scenario it is not enough to introduce the scenario, you also need to explain how it could come to happen, I say this because there is no way for bitcoin to reach a value of zero.Is it possible for the price of bitcoin to drop significantly? Yes, and we are seeing that right now, however a decentralized network in which you can exchange value without the banking system will always have value, so the scenario you are bringing is simply not possible.",

Because if bitcoin reaches $10k, lots of people will buy it, or if you are thinking about $0. But I don't think it will happen because no one will sell bitcoin at $0. So the buyer has to increase the price of bitcoin to buy bitcoin. So the bitcoin price won't dump until the seller sells it. So $0 is a useless number. Now if I lose the wallet access, then there is no option except to start a new beginning. That's my opinion. Thank you.",

How will you be at that moment?First scenario; Bitcoin going down to $0. That would be a huge shock on my path, I'll probably be stunned for quite a while as I cannot think of any logical reasoning for that to happen; and my first step would be to know what might have caused that, let's say there was a hypothetical reason that made Bitcoin to lose all of its market value but doesn't inherently affect how it operates, I'll definitely possibly buy more and hodl, hopefully the world comes back to its senses soon. I'll be wary of such situation happening again.If it was a situation that does affect the integrity of the network, I might hesitate a bit to determine to what extent, before deciding if to buy or not.Second and third scenario; are literally just wild assumptions. An individual can make a mistake and their bitcoins disappear or are stolen, if I were to be in that situation, it would be a huge burner and I'll have to start building from scratch again to grow my Bitcoin portfolio.The entire network cannot disappear or get stolen.",

How will you be at that moment?Although this is materially impossible (unless there is a global-scale movement against cryptocurrencies), then I think this would convince me to purchase at least a thousand BTCs and HODL them for long-term. Even if there would be a movement against such cryptocurrencies, the value of purchasing them relative to the hope of their prices increasing in the near future is high. I guess everyone would exactly do this movement and its price would skyrocket eventually in the market.To the people who decided to stop investing, that would be a huge mistake. Again, what drives the price of BTC is the law of demand and supply. Assuming that this were the case, then everyone would be purchasing cryptocurrencies in the market, thereby increasing its price.",
