      "body": "Quote from: SeeBiscuit on February 04, 2023, 02:06:02 PMI want to professionally translate my project thread one day into multiple different languages so others can read into it more that don't speak English.I am able to provide you a team of professional translators for Romanian, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Greek, Turkish and Indonesian languages. It's possible that soon to be able to come back to you for being able to translate in some more languages. All the users from the team have Sr. Members, Hero and Legendary ranks, all have a good reputation inside the forum and they are also experienced with translations.Please check your PM for more details.SeeBiscuit, I could not stop noticing that all the offers you received so far came from Newbie accounts. While I don't want to point the finger at anyone, I would advise you to be very careful with new members or users without reputation / background / positive Trust score, as you don't know anything about them nor you know if they will do a proper job or not, unless you have a method to verify their work (e.g.: have a native of respective language to check for you if the translation was done using Google Translate or it was done in a professional manner).Besides, translations made with automated tools are breaking forum rules. To be more precise, according to Unofficial list of (official) Bitcointalk.org rules, guidelines, FAQ:Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM27. Using automated translation tools to post translated content in Local boards is not allowed.",
