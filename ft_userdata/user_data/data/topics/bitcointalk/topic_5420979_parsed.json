  "content": "Could it be ?Some influencer posted very incriminating information on YouTube recently... can't find the link anymore, but it talked about the alleged murder of Nikolai Mushegian, CEO of Maker Dao and how Nikolai was about to blow the whistle on SBF and had received death threats and all. The video goes on about alleged connections of Epstein to SBF and Alameda Research. It's mostly speculation at this point but if you think about it, Epstein may have been behind SBF's sudden and unexplained fortune around 2018. No doubt Epstein had heard of crypto by 2018, and he may have tried to establish a dominant presence through SBF... let's face it, SBF becoming a billionaire through \"arbitrage\" within a year is the most ridiculous thing you could ever imagine. You needed several 100 million dollars to begin with, and no bank would lend money for high risk crypto trading even today.Anyway, I will keep searching for that video link and update my post if I find it !",

We need to be careful, because now tons of conspirations will be created around SBF for views and clicks. There is a legion of social influencers living from this kind of invention and polemics on the internet.",

      "body": "It could be and why not? There are so many theories appears for shit head SBF who scammed my money. I lose some on FTX caused by i can't withdraw it. Was not it funding for SBF was coming from the various companies before? Yeah it has been starting with low volume but since FTX can use momentum during the bullish market and it more people trust it in the past but they got fucked up by FTX. Even gary gensler may have connection with caroline as a shitty girl who knows nothing and he became CEO of alameeda who managed all of liquidity from people who trades on FTX. I just wanna told you that if it's not all of exchange site needs to start with 100 millions USD. binance was also starting from nothing to something. It has only 2 million marketcap at the launch. It's about how can you make people trusting their money to your site.",

I know, but SBF presented himself as a trader who became a billionaire through arbitrage. Not only this but he claims he did it within one or 2 years ! I have not heard of anyone else who has become rich through arbitrage in such a short amount of time. For those who bought lots of Bitcoin around 2010, yes, it is possible to make a fortune but not for arbitrage traders.",
