I've used it before and the developers of it were also developers of MEW. By the way, why you don't just want to use MEW? It's allowing you also to import PKs if you've got the file. I'm not sure if I do understand correctly about the #2. But both wallets, I've mentioned allows you to do the #2 but MEW isn't a desktop but a webwallet.",

I don't have experience yet with that wallet but if that's all the features you're looking for that's good.And now that you've found it, it's now all come to pass that you should lock the thread as you've made the purpose of it and got the right one.",
