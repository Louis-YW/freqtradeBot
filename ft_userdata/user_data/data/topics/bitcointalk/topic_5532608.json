How many times would an attacker have to perpetrate the routine to get lucky once?I haven't seen any extensive research where someone follows these coins and reports back. It would require a simplified blockchain analysis where you'd first find all these outputs (where sender's address looks similar to the receiver's) then simply check if there is any case of coins going from the \"victim's\" address to the attackers.Logically the success rate of this attack has to be very low because normally if someone wants to copy their own address they'll go to their addresses tab which exists under various names in all wallets. They don't go to their receive tab or history tab to copy the receiving address of a transaction they'd received before.",

Hence, you get trapped from your own funny behavior with the address. Should you stay cool, you would be just fine.Dust attack,,, their mitigations would have been the fees really.",

This happens on many blockchains and I've heard the same stories on TON (albeit with some differences ofc, but the idea remained the same - use somebody's lack of attention to make some transactions).",
