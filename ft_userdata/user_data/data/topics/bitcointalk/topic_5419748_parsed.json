  "content": "Alik BakhshiStop lying!      No need to lie! When Russia conquered Transcaucasia, there was no Armenia. There were Azerbaijani khanates that were part of Persia, and one of them was the Karabakh khanate, with the vast majority of Azerbaijanis. By the way, the same composition of the population was in the Erevan Khanate. In the city of Irvan, Armenians and Kurds were 5% each. Here we should dwell separately on how much the Armenians distort history, referring to reliable documents, but at the same time slightly changing their text, which leads to the possibility of misinterpretation and, as a result, to a false conclusion that has nothing to do with the truth. This is especially true for Wikipedia. For example, from Wikipedia (Turkmanchay Peace Treaty - Wikipedia (wikipedia.org)): “Under the Turkmanchay Treaty, the territories of Eastern Armenia, the Erivan and Nakhichevan khanates, departed to Russia.”    Consider the true text of the Turkmanchay Treaty between Russia and Persia of February 10, 1828:Article IIIHis Majesty the Shah of Persia, on his own behalf, and on behalf of his heirs and successors, cedes to the Russian Empire both the perfect property of the Khanate of Erivan on this and that side of the Araks, and the Khanate of Nakhichevan. As a consequence of this concession, His Majesty the Shah promises, no later than six months from the signing of this treaty, to hand over to the Russian Authorities all Archives and public documents relating to the administration of both of the above-mentioned Khanates. (Turkmanchay peace treaty (msu.ru))    The text does not indicate either about Armenia as a state (1), or about the Armenians, who, according to the Armenian version, are allegedly the main population of these khanates. Armenian historians deliberately miss the well-known fact of the settlement of the Erivan and Karabakh khanates by Armenians, which was carried out by Russia in order to have a Christian population in the South Caucasus along the border with Persia and Turkey. At the same time, the Russians forcibly deported the local Muslim population. As a result of this genocide of Azerbaijanis, Soviet Armenia appeared on the territory of the former Erivan Khanate and an autonomous region, the so-called Nagorno-Karabakh, on the territory of the Karabakh Khanate. Thus, the Russians created an artificial enclave in the very center of Azerbaijan with an Armenian population.    Moscow's policy continued in the same direction, and in 1920 the Azerbaijani population was deported from Zangezur, the entire territory of which became part of the Armenian Soviet Republic, and the territory of the Derbent Khanate (Dagestan) was annexed to Russia. As a result of the forcible redrawing of borders by the Kremlin cartographers, Nakhichevan was cut off from the main territory of Azerbaijan, receiving the status of an autonomous republic.      This is the truth that Yerevan and Moscow hide. During the 30-year occupation, Armenia blocked the Baku-Nakhichevan railway, part of which passes through the territory of Zangezur transferred to Armenia. After the victory of Azerbaijan in the 44-day war, under the peace treaty signed, Armenia undertook to restore the railway connection between Baku and Nakhichevan, but still does not fulfill this clause of the agreement.1.

The Persian Empire lasted 2000 years. After the fall of the Seleucid Empire, the Parthian kingdom arose again, after which the Sassanids came to power. The Sasanian Empire is the last empire of the Persians. She fell to the Arabs. The Arab Caliphate was suppressed by the Turks and Mongols. Two powerful Turkic empires arose - the Ottoman Empire and the Ak Koyunlu Empire, which was later replaced by the Safavid Empire (also a Turkic empire), the Turks in Persia who were at enmity with each other. The Turks ruled Persia until the true Persian Pahlavi dynasty came to power, which replaced the last Turkic Qajar dynasty. The Turks in Iran were also called Azerbaijanis (Azeris). So the Azerbaijani Turks ruled Persia for quite a long time from the fall of the Arab Caliphate until 1941, when the last Shah of the Turkic Qajar dynasty Ahmed Shah was replaced by the Persian Reza Pahlavi. It was Pahlavi who changed the name of the state, which became known as Iran.",
