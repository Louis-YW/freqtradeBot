  "content": "Working remotely is now a common thing, and some persons may quickly choose that option of work if offered by a company. Working remotely can become as hectic even more as working in the office if care is not taken. Before sharing tips on how to effectively manage working remotely, some major disadvantages and problems this can cause are;QuoteDistractions and lack of boundariesMany people work from home because they want more time to spend on their hobbies or with their family. But the lack of a concrete boundary between work and home can lead to distractions such as interruptions by the kids or doing domestic chores during work time.Knowing when to stopAs a remote worker, it can be difficult to know when to unplug and stop working, making work feel never-ending. In one study, 39% of remote workers reported working longer hours than they were supposed to.Loneliness and isolationTo effectively combat those issues, here are some tips;QuoteFind the right spaceWhether it’s a room in your home, a shared workspace, or a favorite coffee shop, the environment matters when working remotely. Make sure temperature and noise levels are comfortable for you, you have plenty of space for your equipment, and it’s somewhere you’re not likely to be disturbed. Look for areas that offer natural light to help you feel energized. Set a scheduleWorking remotely often means more flexibility – so you might have more choice about when you do your tasks. But while this can be a very good thing, you might find that not having such strict deadlines means work bleeds into other areas of your life, which can be stressful. So it’s important to set yourself a schedule and stick to it as much as you can.Get dressedNo, seriously. It may be tempting to work in your pajamas, but it won’t make you feel professional. And it’s not a good look on a video call. Clothes influence our mood and emotions, so wear something that makes you feel motivated, professional and confident. Getting dressed for work will also help you mark the distinction between work and home life, helping you switch off when the working day is over.Plan breaksWith no prompts to take lunch and coffee breaks, remote workers can find whole days passing in front of a screen. Taking a break is energizing, especially if you can get outside, so set yourself a schedule and make sure every day features at least a walk around the block. If it’s not possible to go out, get some activity going indoors.Communicate, communicate, communicateWorking remotely requires more communication – not less. Use instant messaging and group chat to stay in the loop with colleagues and projects, video call into meetings, and above all, check in with colleagues and managers.source",

The problem is that there isn't to many workers. I have heard of complaints from teachers here in my place that working from home has actually made them a lot busier than it was when they worked at school. They're now heavily loaded that the time they're spending working has actually increased. So while you're working from the comforts of your home, it isn't a big deal since you're still too absorbed in your work.",

At least have to agree that it's probably not the easiest lifestyle to live and accept where people won't care about your needs except ourselves. so, we must be careful to avoid friction and not belittle the environment in which we work so that we can be calm, and productive while doing activities even from a distance.One thing that is very important make sure you prepare yourself with a fast Internet connection.",

      "body": "There are two aspect that I want to consider in the challenge of working remotely, yes you have mentioned communicate or communication but in the midst of that I'm looking at communication regarding internet connection since it is done remotely I assume it is also should be in remote area that lacks modern facilities and tops amongst that should be active internet connection. This will slow down the pace of work because bad internet connection is one hack of frustration in doing office work at home or remotely. For example during the covid-19 pandemic where people took their office jobs back home, the reviews were that the internet frustrated the pace of the job. Offices are located in the city and so the internet are better in such areas to compare remote places.Supervisorship is another point. People tend to work better and produce better results when they are supervised and under controlled environment, so a remote worker apart from being lazy and distraction from family and children they are likely to yield result even when they are alone in the house and not disturbed.",

Focusing to your work is really difficult to do at home because there are really some unwanted noise that you can't avoid from your neighbors or people living in the same house. Telling them to stop is not that easy because it will also make them uncomfortable at their own house.Quote from: Queentoshi on September 16, 2022, 07:38:06 AMGet dressedNo, seriously.

Developing a proper discipline is a lot better to become an effective remote employee. Plus I don't think employees that work remotely will bother to get dressed properly, they will think that it will just give them extra laundry if they wear proper clothes. Remote workers usually just wear a proper clothes when they have an important meeting.",

It’s like you are being forced to work at home, the place where you make memories with your loved ones, home is space where you get out of your daily routines and be comfortable. However these days peeps who work in IT sector are mostly being dragged away from the offices. The mindset changes heavily when you work at office, you are surrounded with like minded peeps who are focused on completing the work. Obviously there is also lot of fun at work but that’s with your colleagues and it’s another life really. Mixing with WFH has become tedious and monotonous too!",

My interest in working from home has recently grown, and I take my routines very seriously for the sake of my mental health. When you have a timetable for everything and treat them seriously, you can control the disruptions that co-family members cause at home. Despite the fact that I enjoy brainstorming in groups, I still prefer working alone. Everyone has a different method of working comfort, and we all select the method that works best for us.",

I don't take advantage of being working remotely. There could be some, who might be working on time, not just slacking before they are in their home.

If a job is such that really requires doing something that can't be done from hope with as much quality, then I'm alright going there. But if it's all on the laptop and thus can totally be done wherever a person is, as long as there's a laptop and Internet connection there, it's unreasonable to require this person to waste time on going to an office, limiting the time that could be spent at home. Of course, it also depends on the home and how quiet it is, which can be different for different people. So I think it's more reasonable to allow a person to choose. Some might prefer the office atmosphere, while others find it unbearable. I've never had a problem with my time-management and organizing myself, and I've never really had a strict boundary between work and home, so I prefer to do what I can from home.",

The effective way is to separate the workplace by getting a \"temporary office\" which is a bit far from the home area even though it only contains 1 small room to place a work desk. To overcome irregular working hours can actually be circumvented by several methods, such as using scheduled public transportation to go to the \"office\".",

Such reasons could be to reduce the risk of clustering at work, the  risk of accidents to and fro work place and it generally reduces welfare costs. I work from home but all those things listed above at least I'm a victim of one or two. Working from home  I see myself overworking myself, I even work at weekends which would not be so if I go to office to work. But that does not mean that I would like to go to office for work, I still like it at home. My company recently resolved that everyone would be reporting to work like three times a week but employees revolted, there's no need going to office if everyone delivers from home.  I can't go to work  anymore, I like working from home.The article said that working from home we should try to address professionally. Lol... I dress so casual and work, during our calls, it's only the team leader that appears on video, we get our fvcking video muted.
