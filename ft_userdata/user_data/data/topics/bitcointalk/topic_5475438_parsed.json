I remember reading topic like this on reddit long time ago when I first involved on DeFi investment.In crypto, Simply it means the usable token(Bitcoin, Eth, Stablecoin and other asset with high valuation) that backed a certain token for easily conversions to usable token. Without liquidity, Token has no value which you can’t use to purchase something that has value.You can read the ELI5 discussion about this topic here: https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1xgfsf/eli5_liquidity/",

      "body": "Liquidity is a term related to the economy more than cryptocurrencies. In short, it is the availability of cash necessary to conduct the transaction, as transactions are between different pairs, for example, your bank account is in dollars against cash or dollars against the local currency. To implement this procedure, both parties need to have enough cash to complete the transaction. In cryptocurrencies, liquidity is provided so that when you execute any buy or sell order, the order is executed directly without the need to wait.",

Any idea some tips ?In simple terms, Liquidity in crypto basically means how easy it is to swap one coin for another or for fiat without affecting the price too much.  If its liquid, you can trade big amounts without seeing the price budge. Kinda like trying to dump a swimming pool into a lake versus a kiddie pool - the lake's volume can handle it better.  More liquidity signals a healthier market overall, with enough buyers and sellers present so things stay relatively stable.  Definitely something to watch for with smaller cap altcoins especially.You can find some more info here: What is Liquidity in Cryptocurrency?",

When we buy or sell, liquidity makes our deals. Our orders will be waiting if there is no liquidity.*One of the examples of liquidity that we see in exchanges is the \"order book\". The only thing we view as orders in the order book is liquidity. There is no liquidity if the order book is empty. Maybe someone asks, why the price is still moving even there is no orders in the order book in the exchange? We must consider that cryptocurrency may be listed on multiple exchanges, including CEX and DEX. So, if there is no liquidity in this exchange but strong price action, it means that liquidity exists in other exchanges.",

What you explained there are the ones who mainly work in a centralized exchange but I think on a decentralized one or those who are quick/instant exchange, it is possible to sell even without those sell orders because I haven't seen them being displayed.But, I think it is possible to check if there is a liquidity in placed for some decentralized/instant exchanges. If there is then it is possible for us to trade here. I prefer this to be honest because they are less hassle and I can trade with lower amounts. For those who are serious traders, they mostly use centralized exchanges.",

However for better understanding, I am giving you another definition which said that liquidity is the process when someone buys or sells a cryptocurrency without affecting its price significantly.  For more information I am giving you a link go and read it,  you will understand easily from. https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/what-is-liquidity/",

Otherwise, the angle you are pointing at, is bleak. Please expansiate.Both of you are correct only that you are taking it too far towards the operational angle. Liquidity simply means cash/funds/assets and the availability and accessibility in businesses or in the industry at large.It's actually what is needed for operations and to keep the businesses running, but not necessarily in that regard alone, it could be used to store value and must be readily available upon request. Some people call it capital base in this regard and it shows the actual strength and worth of an asset, company or the industry as a whole.",
