  "content": "Since the same things keep coming up:1) Yes you can force a RPi2 or 3 to run a node but it is going to be a slow miserable time and you will have lots of issues.2) Yes you can download the entire blockchain and run a node on a 500GB drive. But you WILL run out of space and then probably have corruption and then have to buy a larger drive and start again. And you might not even be able to copy the data from the old drive if the corruption was bad enough.3) Yes you can use older equipment to do it. You can even use 10 year old laptops with a 2nd gen core i5. But much older then that the pure performance issues are going to be a killer. And as time goes on it's only going to get worse.4) You can even use an old 5400 RPM drive and store your OS and blockchain on it. But if for whatever reason you have to do a full re-scan of the blockchain I hope you have a couple of days to kill.5) Yes you can do it with 2GB of RAM, but your IBD is going to take 2 days short of forever and general performance is going to be miserable.n0nce made a nice post about doing a node for under $60. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5364742You can do it for a bit more, you can do it for a bit less. Don't try to cut that price in 1/2 unless you are technically inclined and can work around the issues. Otherwise you are going to have a miserable time.This is not to stop people from trying, far from it. This is a post letting you know that it WILL WORK. But the time and effort you are going to put into it, although probably a learning experience is going to be a lot more then having SLIGHTLY better equipment and doing it more efficiently.-Dave",

Additional cores won't speed this up.)Memory: 4GB RAM (healthy buffer for dbcache)Disk: 1TB HDD (7200RPM separate from OS - but only because 1TB SSDs are still fairly expensive.)Network: 50Mbit/s (anything less than that and block & tx download/upload will affect your connection quality)",

And you might not even be able to copy the data from the old drive if the corruption was bad enough.It's a very informative post, thank you very much for it. I did intend to \"cut corners\" and see whether it would work (and also how badly!) with the intention to just use the (few) hardware I have at hand.Luckily I didn't have the time for the setup, so, again, this helps me a lot.I will also vouch for the 500GB HDD \"approach\" problem. Right now my setup works with an external 500GB HDD for the blockchain and I already got rid of txindex in order to make sure it doesn't suddenly stop because of the lack of space (and that hurts badly my local block explorer, obviously).Of course, one of my problems was that I've thought late to make myself a local setup and RasPi are overly expensive for now, so I'll keep the current setup (that unfortunately doesn't run 24/7), but I still have to look for a HDD soon.Quote from: BitMaxz on May 22, 2022, 11:59:34 PMYou can buy low space SSD for OS which is cheaper than buying 1TB SSD and you can split them with HDD for blockchains just to improve the syncing process.That's correct. Even more, if you have another high spec computer (with SSD), you can use that one for the initial sync and just use HDD (some temporary symlinks to SSD and copying of files will be needed though).While a normal spec is great, I think that SSD can be seen a bit \"overzealous\" by those very careful with the costs.But: SSD is silent, HDD is not. SSD is probably much more energy efficient. So one has to make his choice properly for the long run.PS: is there any info available about how much heating a RasPi do if used as a node? I fear that anything under RasPi 4 may need active cooling too (again, noise...)",

I fear that anything under RasPi 4 may need active cooling too (again, noise...)I think given the price to performance as well as the longevity aspect, the energy efficiency of HDD vs SSD would be negligible or simply a dollar or two extra per year, maximum. The price of a HDD is ridiculously low compared to SSD of similar size. The noise produced by HDD is actually quite overstated most of the time and it is barely audible.Regarding the cooling required for RPi4, I ran into some throttling with RPi4 during synchronization and slapped a heatsink, which more or less solved the issue. Active cooling wasn't really necessary in my case. Never really an issue with the previous revisions though (7w vs 5w). It is still painfully slow regardless.",

That is over TOR and indexing the blockchain and the other stuff to run a lightning node.A RPi3, not a prepacked node setup, just the bare RPi software and bitcoind with a 7200 RPM is still churning through just the IBDÂ  after 2 1/2 weeks. Both are behind the same router on the same cable modem so it's not bandwidth just purely a performance issue.-Dave",

The price of a HDD is ridiculously low compared to SSD of similar size. The noise produced by HDD is actually quite overstated most of the time and it is barely audible.Some disks are creating more noise than others, but if the HDD noise is the problem, I found easy solution for that by purchasing silencing case enclosure that almost totally removed noise from my HDD.It is made from solid metal from inside (I think copper) with combination of foam and other materials that makes drive cool and quiet.I found this very cheap, but I guess you can easily make something similar if you like DIY projects.Quote from: ranochigo on May 23, 2022, 09:23:40 AMRegarding the cooling required for RPi4, I ran into some throttling with RPi4 during synchronization and slapped a heatsink, which more or less solved the issue.

My preferred setup is adding a large HDD for data that doesn't need to be on the (smaller) SSD.I usually try to avoid investing into hardware, since its price keeps dropping sharply just after buying. I've bought my laptop in 2017 and I've already been using your strategy: I've bought the laptop with SSD and then added a HDD to it.My data stays on a NAS that seems to be aging pretty well. I've upgraded there not long ago an 500 GB HDD to 4TB (I feared that bigger HDD won't work there) and now that 500 GB HDD I use for the blockchain, plugged into a thingy that I can connect to on USB3. Clearly suboptimal solution, but I just didn't have the hearth yet to throw away that HDD But you're right. My laptop's HDD is indeed silent. All I can hear (when I take my headphones off, that is) is the cooler the laptop stands on.---I usually don't have the hearth to throw away old stuff, but this topic may be just the thing to convince me do it! I have yet to find a device I can leave running 24/7 without fearing it'll set the room on fire, but I find today's 150-200 EUR too much for a decent RasPi (board only).",
