If you want to mine bitcoin, you need ASIC. The best ASIC producer is Bitmain. You can check their website:https://www.bitmain.com/",

The RTX30x0 series are better for mem intensive algo. Avoid the RTX40x0 series, too expensive for the hashrates.Also AMD cards getting cheaper and cheaper.",

Make sure you are dealing with a legit company or sellers with a warranty it won't be ok if you deal with random people in China.You can give us a link here where you plan to buy a batch of these cards. So that we can check if that company or seller is legit.",

The fact that the prices are low compared to how they were during the bull market or before ETH went POS means it could be a better time to buy rather than the time of FOMO or when the bull market has climaxed.I would encourage you to buy with spare money if you are passionate about the idea of mining but make sure you buy from trusted sources or you will get scammed.",

Buy China GPU´s is smart at the moment. RTX3060 12GB under $120 or 70HX for $123 or AMD BC-160 for $70. Keep your costs down and you are faster back in green. And i am sure the GPU prices will go up. RTX4000 production stopped, bullmarket is coming (mid - end 2024 - mid 2025), so mining profitability go up and you can sell your old used cards from china for more  We bought many GPU´s from china the sellers are super friendly, helpfull, i get videos from tests before they sell it to me. Some GPU´s come with brand new coolers, thermalpaste and thermalpads and the whole card looks new. So why not using it?",

I myself would gladly buy at such prices, but I would sell half so that the second half of the video cards would be free for me. In Russia, such a video card costs $300.

      "body": "I think it will be ok to order video cards from China for mining. However, there are some risks involved. For example, the video cards you receive may be counterfeit or of poor quality. The Chinese government has been cracking down on cryptocurrency mining, so there is a risk that your order may be confiscated.It depends on a few factors, such as the specific video cards you are ordering, the current market conditions, and your own risk tolerance.Some sources suggest that miners in China are selling off their graphics cards amid a crackdown on cryptocurrency: https://www.techspot.com/news/90267-miners-china-selling-off-their-graphics-cards-amid.htmlwhile others report that a Chinese company has developed a new GPU with GDDR6X memory that could compete with AMD and Nvidia: https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chinese-xindong-fenghua-gpu-announcedI would recommend doing your research and carefully considering the risks involved. If you are still unsure, it may be best to order from a more reputable source.",
