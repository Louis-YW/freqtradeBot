Would like to hear more from the community. Thanks in advance.Well all stable coins pegged to the us dollar are under real pressure.why is this?all us citizens are allowed to buy $10000 worth of i bonds every year.330,000,000 x 10,000 is a big pool of possible cash.3,300,000,000,000 this is 3.3 trillion pot of cash possible every year .normally I bonds were paying low interest. 1 or 2 or 3%. so while they are perfectly stable and pegged to the usd rates sucked.but now buy 1500 get 9.62% for six months say april 1 to oct 1 1500 get 9.62% for six months say may 1 to nov 1so on and so forth this means a ton of money leaves crypto and goes to 9.62% coinsespecially stable coins which are known to crash and burn and don’t pay a lot more than 10% in any case.the few that did crashed out badly.So I think binance knows many stable coins are in a lot of trouble 😈 so I hope to see more coins pegged to the USD suffer due to these high interest I bonds.",

Binance is just removing the other stable coins where there's high liquidity in their platform. As for Tether, it's the most known so they can spare it. While the others, they're a big competitor for BUSD.",

      "body": "In the long term, the irregularity and obscurity of USDT as a viable asset could force itself to be removed entirely from the exchange. When investors turn away from it, they will turn to USDC and TUSD. USDC is faster and cheaper than TUSD but less decentralized and offers fewer privacy features. It will be interesting to see what emerges victorious in this case but there probably won't be one unless another stablecoin is launched in the future and I don't think it's new to see exchanges deleting coins although it's a bit surprising that Binance did this immediately after listing them.",

You still trade these tokens on any other exchange even after 29 September.Quote from: fuer44 on September 06, 2022, 02:14:00 AMmaybe binance has its own reasons why stable coins will be removed, for example they will only convert binance to dollars or conventional currencies and not to crypto which has stable. because lately stable coins actually get price drops and in fact they also convert them to conventional currencies and not always exactly the same as dollars.The reason given is that they want to enhance liquidity.QuoteThe move is intended to enhance liquidity and capital efficiency for users, the company said in a statement.SourceBut I doubt that they have taken this step because of recent depegs.",

I think the trading pairs with USDT is really high and would affect their exchanges negatively. So USDC, USDP, and TUSD which have lower volume aren't a problem for them.It's hilarious they will convert those stablecoin to BUSD, they shouldn't do that and just make any people can't trade with USDC. USDP and TUSD. This is why centralized exchange is bad since they can do anything.",

If we don't convert them on or after Sept 29, they're automatically gonna convert them to BUSD. Yeah well that is not really surprising to me. In the end Binance is probably the biggest crypto company out there and they are trying to get more and more influence and power. One way to do that is to ban most other stablecoins from their exchange. USDC is from coinbase as far as i know so obviously Binance is delisting USDC to hurt coinbase. They can not do the same with USDT because USDT trading Paris usually have by far the biggest volume of all stablecoin pairs. So if they would stop the support of USDT then they would hurt themself way more than USDT.I always dislike it, when one company becomes to powerful within a certain field of industry.",

Binance wants to “enhance liquidity and capital-efficiency for users” and focus on there own stable coin. This is good for there company since this new stable coins is starting to share on there BUSD market especially the USDC. The only reason why USDT stays is because it’s the largest stable coin in the crypto market and it will give Binance huge loss in case they will include it to the removal.This is a very good move by Binance to capitalize on the market while they have the control on the biggest trading venue on crypto.",

I think this step is correct, it is very natural that Binance as the owner of BUSD takes the full stable of the coin, or I also have other thoughts. it could be that binance only provides BUSD so that events like Terra USD don't happen again.Stability of BUSD has nothing to do with it. It seems to be about enhancing liquidity according to the article. Also they won't probably want anything to do with lawsuit issues if other pegged tokens suddenly break like what happened with terra.Also it helps busd reputation when people mainly use their token. It's a no brainer for them.",

Well, it was expected and kind of inspired from FTX, however got more strict into that. Here is the reason why i said, binance got inspired from FTX. In FTX exchange, they use USD as a stablecoin for liquidity and anyone can deposit TUSD, USDC, USDP, BUSD, HUSD from different chain and those stablecoin will show as USD in there. For withdrawing USD, you will also have option to select which one (TUSD, USDC, USDP, BUSD, HUSD), you wanna withdraw, even in which chain. So this is the scenario of FTX for stablecoin of USD. Fun fact, binance got inspired from that step and they became more strict to remove all rivals from there exchange, lol. I'm saying this because binance previously got inspired from leverage token of FTX and introduced later on in binance trading.   So i'm happy to use both exchange, however ftx is always preferred from myside as withdrawal fee is zero and also have option of different chains.",
