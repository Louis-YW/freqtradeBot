You should swim in cash.Makes no sense -> no loan .PS: 1xbet is a total scam site , if you would actually win there they would never pay out, haha",

And btw why are you even trying to frame him for what he knows nothing about? Is it because he's constantly exposing your true intentions behind your unsuccessful loan seeking?If you had channeled all the time you have wasted in searching for who will give you loan into a business, I bet that business would have grown to some extent now.",
