  "content": "I just Came across this name \"Superex\" when i was scrolling my twitter i said let me visit the exchange and see what's happening in their. created an account and registered, performed some task, and was airdrop 7 of the token which was worth over 196$ as of the time of registration, i just logged in the exchange now and what i saw was 117$ token price which is the said exchange native token have drop from 28$ which i equally saw it to 13$ as of the time of this post. The all time high was 35$ per the token Trading and withdrawal of the airdrop token is disabled until one meet some certain rules which is are :Â  -Join twitter page-join telegram-deposit-Start trading etc. This deposit part is where i am really seeing scamming, how can an exchange want you to deposit before you can be able to withdraw from their. They already have a developed app on playstore and Apple Store. Their Link: WebsiteTwitterDon't know if anyone have come across this exchange and how legit do you think it is. They also have a dex attached to the exchange which i didn't take the risk of connecting my wallet.",

      "body": "You should move this topic to service discussion board.Don't waste your time with this shit exchange or else you will even get scammed. The UI alone looks similar to that of Bybit a couple of years back ( I have used bybit several times, so I am familiar)Check up the negative reviews on Google Play Store, looks like you are not the only one complaining about the locked token",

      "body": "That's likely a scam.It's known strategy of these developers that they'll make you crave for the value that you're seeing on your account and token. But with such requirement especially the deposit, you know that they're up to.They're just for your deposit and will not matter to them anymore whether you get that shit token or not as long as you're able to deposit the amount that required you to do so. Just forget that account and don't fall for their deposit scam scheme.",

Task 8: Every time the total transaction volume of all invited friends reaches 100,000 USDT, and you will get ET rewards every 1,000,000 USDT;they don't actually provide airdrops, they make business. That nominal amount can only be reached by whales, and then which whale will use this exchange and is the 45ET reward worth the $1m risking? And yeah, they will eventually unlock the rewards based on their interpretation.Quote14. SuperEx.com has the final right to interpret the terms of service.",

If you want to get money, just take a job in your real life or become a freelancer with some skills you have.",
