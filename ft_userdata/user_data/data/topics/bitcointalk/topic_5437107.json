  "content": "I have been around crypto for few years already and it's a shame that I still don't understand fully how crypto wallets work, I remember that in 2016 when I first installed my BTC wallet from the official Bitcoin website I use a lot of data to sync and download the blockchain data, now that we have mobile wallet for Bitcoin like Electrum how are they functioning? I install and start using wallet without downloading the blockchain data, I know it can't be cloud data, does this syncing has something to nodes?",

Some of them are [single] server dependent and have to only connect to the centralized server that the company provides (meaning 0 privacy for users), Electrum is not like that since you can connect to any Full Node that has the implementation of Electrum protocol (basically indexed its blockchain to be searchable by address).It is the same when it comes to the verification they do. Electrum downloads and verifies all block headers (each header is just 80 bytes) and it is capable of detecting chain splits and can verify things with multiple nodes.

You can literary connect to any full node on bitcoin network and send them a simple getheaders message with a \"locator\" to receive at least one header and either sync or verify your local headers file. Not to mention detecting chain-splits. All in bytes.That is basically what the protocol is doing now. It uses hashes and the height alongside a hard coded deep header \"checkpoint\" to limit the verification.",

Rather, each node checks each new transaction it receives against its UTXO set. This allows the existence of pruned nodes, which download each block from the genesis block in order to verify them and build their UTXO set, but do not need to store them to be able to verify future transactions.",
