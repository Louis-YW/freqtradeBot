So to me I think printing it out would be more better storing it into where you could get more access is more preferred.",

Once I know that if the passphrase is forgotten, I will lose my coins, I have the passphrase backup separately and yet using the letters, numbers and characters that I can easily remember.",

I have no idea what Kurt Cobain is talking about above, but if the melody is good, we can remember any combination of words.Not a bad idea but i would rather be sticking into traditional ways considering that storing or saving up your keys via song is never been that ideal.You could eventually forget these things on long runs.I would rather be saving it on a steel plate and would be hiding it as much as possible away from others attention which could really be a devastating thing if someone do find out your keys.Well, if someone do find this seed phrase song integration is  something that convincing on someones approach then its up to them but not for me.There are things which is more sensible rather than on doing this.",

Everyone has his own way to go about it but I go with the names of footballers. But from your lyrics don't you think someone can unscramble those seed phase  Better write them safe in a laminated paper and check them after three months regularly you can also share to your wife or kids if you trust them",

This is dangerous to rely on only. You have need to save or store somewhere again to avoid misplace of words.

      "body": "If you can't memorize the 12 words, then any lifehacks like making songs aren't going to help you in the long run. The problem with memorizing is not being able to bring it up from memory in one week, but keeping something in memory for many years. It's easy to forget refreshing your memory because of some events in life, and then realize that you forgot your seed because you didn't repeat it in a while. Human memory was not created to store data the way computers do, our memory was designed for storing concepts and associations, not raw bits of data in precise order. Anyone who decides to store their seed in their memory need to understand that it's so unreliable that they should treat this backup as if it doesn't exist and rely on other methods first.",

So only he could pass the game and reach the password.So, you can cypher your seed phrase with lyrics, but how much can be efficient? You can store it safely but when u need to use it, can it be save you from hacker or etc. ?  If you are successful in this, congratulations you can keep your investments safe",

As for me, I totally forgot about it. I can't even remember a single word from my seed phrase. But I think this is totally understandable knowing that you don't make use of it every now and then. The last time I made use of it was years ago; that was years before the pandemic. That's a recovery phrase and recovery doesn't happen all the time.I think it helps crossing very unfriendly boarders not to raise suspicion about listed words or words engraved on a piece of metal. So writing sentences or poems or, yeah, songs that contain those words might help.",

Only you can recognize them but I am doubtful if you put a dot on seed word or anything similar, others can see it too and make their guess.I don't support this idea because at the end, if you store your backup safely and very secretly, you don't actually need this misleading method that might cause trouble to yourself too.",
