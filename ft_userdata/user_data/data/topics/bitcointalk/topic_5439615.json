But there is no need to create a cult of personality from himselfThis is precisely what attention seeking isIn other words, that is a portfolio thread of a specific person. If I am a translator and I have been doing translation for a long time, but I do not have any kind of portfolio, nobody is gonna know what I did. If I apply somewhere to be a translator for their service, they will ask for a portfolio. If I am nothing, they won't pay attention to me. In the case of LoyceV or nutildah, they mentioned their username because that is the name they want to spread on the internet. I don't think they have the intention to apply somewhere for jobs with their portfolio, but still, they can be proud of what they doing for the Bitcointalk community. So, I don't think you should have any hate for their work. They are just getting their credit for their work. Nothing more.",

Quote from: Pmalek on January 11, 2025, 01:14:37 PMI see no problem in adding your username to the subject line where it makes sense.  Sorry, but I get the impression that he either thinks everyone are blind or he is an commercial (due to signature presence) attention seeker. It looks very stupid, to be honest. If I like a topic, I go to the first page, looking to OP's nickname and giving a merit to him. As a reader, I don't need to flash any nickname in the topic title.Frankly speaking, it even repels and becomes boring. A nickname will soon start to irritate everyone, you'll see. He himself will remove his nickname when he realizes that he is annoying his audience with it.I don't like it when unnecessary information gets in the way of my eyes. Besides, the topic's name becomes longer because of it. Why this unnecessary information load? I am for brevity   Look at it yourself and see how flawed it looks.Nutildah's bounty cheaters & ban evaders thread = Looks ridiculous, isn't it? The word at first \"nutildah\" is annoying. He could at least put it at the end.Thread of bounty cheaters & ban evaders by nutildah = Alternative variant. Special for nutildah. Less annoying, isn't it?List of bounty cheaters & ban evaders = Looks laconic and reasonably",
