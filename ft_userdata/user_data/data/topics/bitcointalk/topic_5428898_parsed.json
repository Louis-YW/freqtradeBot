  "content": "Hello.I deposited $1435 on Sportsbet.I won and two withdrawals of $3000 and $3240 were successful.I kept betting and won $8060.And I went through the security measures as they have done to many people recently and it was successful.Then came the multi-account email. You started making the same accusations to everyone.The problem here seems to be that monetized accounts are banned completely.My account was closed before my $8060 balance in my account was paid.I hope my problem is solved. I still want to trust Sportsbet.Balance Informationhttps://i.hizliresim.com/2izabtk.jpegEmail informationhttps://i.hizliresim.com/rg8qcwn.jpghttps://i.hizliresim.com/7mqmgmy.jpghttps://i.hizliresim.com/the4360.jpgAccount activitieshttps://i.hizliresim.com/36c1811.jpg",

He can still withdraw his deposit, his winnings got blocked. how about you?",

This time the review.First time no problem, second time why is there a problem?I think it's just something that happens to accounts that make a lot of profits.Will everyone using VPN count as multiple accounts?",

I sure every one can create our account name with similar and seems not enough reason with your account close as multiple account after unique name linked with another account. However you have success made twice withdrawal from $3000 and $3240, seems they are not happy with your lucky after won more than $6,000 success withdrawing and last chance more than $8060 they will try with habit reason all casino gambling about multiple account created.",
