  "content": "What are the names of some of these devices again? I'm struggling to find them:A year or three ago I came across various devices that had a private key inside them, holding a certain amount of bitcoin.I think they ran off external electro-magnetically induced power (like a credit card) to power its chip, which could prove ownership of its key to an external device that had a new-enough copy of the blockchain for verification.Like a hardware wallet it would destroy its private key if an attempt was made to get inside it, perhaps willingly exposing it after the HTLC time arrived?I think they held a HTLC balance for proof of it being able to 'hold its value'.I forget if they had a way to prove that a particular card was the only card that held that key. (I can't think of one; what would stop the manufacturer reusing the same key on more than one card? Possibly some way on the lightning network or similar? I've no idea.)I searched for half an hour and failed to find them. Anyone remember some of their names?Thanks",

      "body": "By all this information and based on my understanding of smart contracts, you are not actually looking for a wallet but a contract type. But note that the Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) is a conditional smart contract that you have to follow promptly.If I were you, I would rather go for the normal escrow service instead of this, unless you are considering the cost of multiple transfer and want to explore the likes of the Lightning Network through it.",

ThanksPaper wallets could also do something similar because they have printed private key, and there is also several projects that made bitcoin paper notes that look great and can be used the same way like cash. Here is one of them called offline.cash, I think I remember them from bitcointalk forum, but only reservations are available.",

I guess a list could exist to ensure that the used address did not exist anywhere else. But yes still some trust given to the manufacturer I suppose.",
