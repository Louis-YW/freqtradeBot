      "body": "Thanks for the links, yes it's easy to do an online search but I was hoping to get somesuggestions from UI UX designers here on the forum.I see from those 4 links the first recommendation from 3 of the sites is a \"general\" designbook - 1. The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman are they just copying eachother or is that book really the \"Bible\" of design?",
