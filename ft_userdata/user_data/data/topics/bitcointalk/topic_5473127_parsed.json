Omo I can relate to this kind thing, because I don dey this kind situation before. The best thing to do as you dey with person for the same house na to go solo, because e no get how close people dey, them go one dey get issues, way fit lead to quarrel or fight, so the best way na to go separate ways make every dey him dey. That first time way two of Una first combine money rent the house, Una go enjoy am, but trust me with time Una no go dey tolerate each other excesses.",
