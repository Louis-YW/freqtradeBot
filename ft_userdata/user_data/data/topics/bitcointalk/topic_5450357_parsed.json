Not every recruiter looks for the complete list of experiences mentioned in the job description. In case you have incidents that can prove you are a fast learner, there's a high chance of getting hired. One more thing, lying in the interview is never a great idea.",

      "body": "There was one time I went into an interview. It was one of my first interview and a friend was able to get me the interview. It took over half an hour for the wait time in the waiting room. I was sweating so much, I did not know what to do, they didn’t even have a water fountain in the waiting room or did the receptionist offer any beverages. I remember it was extra hot on this day. I could tell already from the employees’ faces walking around were unhappy and then I was called in. I only knew that I was interviewing for an administrative position, but I did not know that it was in a type of field that I was not interested in. I bombed the interview and knew next time I will be more prepared.",

It took several failed attempts for me to land my first job. Although it's not the best idea to pretend you got everything, settling for less could be more damaging as you become an easy catch for a toxic workplace. Most of the time, being genuine and showing genuine interest to learn works.",
