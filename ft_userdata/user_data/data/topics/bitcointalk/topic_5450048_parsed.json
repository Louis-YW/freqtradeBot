This is why as a newbie or an established bitcoin holder; you must find a strategy and focus greatly on it. What is the best strategy? For me personally, i believe the best way t enjoy bitcoin investment in the bear market is to invest in satoshis; invest so much into satoshis such that your aim will be 1 BTC or 0.5 btc or 0.1 BTC. That way; your target and focus is simple and easy. When the bull run comes; your rewards is obvious too in a simple manner.Think Bitcoin, Think Satoshi!What do you think?",

There is nothing to be scared of, you just need to get hold on your bitcoins and don't check the price too often it will scare you if you are a newbie. If you have cash make the bull run work for you, buy more bitcoin at discount and hold them till the price got stable. Always don't invest the money you need for your living, invest for long time and live stress free during bull run.",

Stick to your plan to avoid making sudden changes in response to short-term market changes.This is where the problem lies because many people actually don’t plan well and that is why you see people losing in bitcoin. Although bitcoin is regarded as one of those stores of values but that doesn’t mean one should invest everything into it. Diversification of funds into other assets (investing in Altcoins are not diversification of portfolio) saves one from panic selling during the bearish period. Also have fiat at hand so that when the bearish period prolongs there’s somewhere to turn to for financial emergencies",

Even if we bought at a higher price, all we have to do is wait long enough for the price to recover again, right? I mean, this has already happened in the past, so there's no reason why it shouldn't happen again, isn't it? It's important not make impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations.

They are definitely going to lose money. I think most, if not all, of us went through that \"panic-and-sell hell\" and I believe it to be part of the learning experience. And any money that the newbie investor loses should be considered a tuition fee. He will have learned a very valuable lesson which he will not forget in the future. And honestly, I think that that learning experience will make him a better investor for it, in the long term. So thats why I no longer go around warning newbies or trying to catch their attention by throwing caution to the winds. What will be will be. I am sure that there are quite a few smart ones out there who know who to listen to and actually trust in their words. But they are the exception to the rule.Those who do not listen must suffer",
