  "content": "Here is what happens to my friends and me and I am sure this is a reflection on different financial values and life attitude in general. Well, I don't drink any alchohol while a few friends of mine love drinking very much. They would gather to have dinner/drink almost every day(at least four times a week). I am often invited but due to my no-drinking habit, I usually turn the invitation down. We are all family men but they are a few years older than me. Their children are much older than my kid so probably they don't need their fathers' attention and time. I always put my family first so this is also one of the reasons I don't join them that frequently. Financially, every gathering meal/drinking is not cheap because it involves a lot of drinks and dishes. The average cost of such dinner/drinking is equivalent to 1/5 the average monthly income in the city where we live. So every month, the cost for these \"gatherings\" consumes all the income that a man can earn for months. This is considered a huge waste of money in many people's eyes cause most people don't earn much. Although I don't drink, occasionally I will treat them and pay the bills for the guesture of friendliness. Do you think my friends' lifestyle is a waste of money and time ? How much do you spend on such gatherings on average ? Please let me know.",

      "body": "There are lots of gatherings that require some level of financial stability before you get involved. This kind of gathering is really not meant for you and your clue because you are all salary earners, and small salary earners at that, so spending that much is not advisable. At the end of the month before salary is paid, every responsible man will map out all family needed expenses, and if this fund is enough to foot those bills, there will barely be enough for other expenses. So I assume that for them to live such a life, they really don't look back at their family. Maybe they have seen this kind of gathering from people around who are far above their financial class. Let me use myself as an example: I have a few neighbors with whom I spend time almost every weekend; two of them are offshore workers who work two straight weeks on duty and two straight weeks off duty; whenever they are around, they want us to gather to chill, have fun, drink, and eat together. me knowing that their pay is stable and mine is not, and most of the time they are paid very well. Before I go out like that, I always hit them up and tell them that I barely have enough to spend. We laugh over it. At least I have told them about my financial capability, so it's left for them to either say \"follow\" or I quietly sit behind.",

While everyone has different values and priorities, spending such a significant portion of one's income on socializing and alcohol can be unsustainable and irresponsible. It's important to prioritize family and financial stability, especially in today's economic climate. Personally, I believe in finding a balance between socializing and saving money for the future.  I do not have a personal average spend on such gatherings, but it's important to evaluate the cost-benefit of any activity and ensure that it aligns with one's values and goals.",

To someone who has so little, seeing your friends drinking, smoking, and whatever their vices is, It is always a waste of money for them. But to someone who wants to enjoy their life to the fullest (life is short mentality), money doesn't matter as they can be replenished, but the time passed is something we cannot live again. IMO, there are 2 answers for this and that depends on a person's perspective in life. This is either a waste of money or enjoying life while you're still living.",

Four times a week seems a lot if you count it in months they drink like 16 times? OP also mentioned that isn't just a simple drinking session so you wouldn't expect a cheap alcohol drinks. Having gathering for like weekly if it continuous it will drain their money. Even if I like to join them for drinking but knowing the fact that OP stated obviously I would turn them down.

I have never forgeotten this quote from the first day I read it. Taking alcohol is not good or bad. Everything should be done in moderation.

Despite you all being married, sooner than later, you will come under peer pressure or influence to join them becasue you wouldn't want to feel like the odd person out or you will be tired of them teasing you.

In this case, yes it's a waste of money. However, drinking/socializing can generate income if its purpose is work-related entertainment. I mean, when you are in business dealing with clients that can make you more money than you spend.
