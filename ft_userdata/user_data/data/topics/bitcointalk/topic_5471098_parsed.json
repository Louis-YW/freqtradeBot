      "body": "To be honest, this sucks. I had ordered their card a few years ago; not only was it free, but I had also received a $5 USDT bonus on my spot account. I didn't frequently use it, but it was handy to have it at any time since I always had an available balance on my account. It generally was a useful and convenient service, with minimal fees and a cashback loyalty program that was quite reasonable; with a single BNB, you could get up to 2% cashback in BNB in every transaction, which is not bad if you ask me.However, it seems to me that Binance has been facing more and more issues in the past year: first the SEC lawsuit, then Euro deposits were ceased, and now it's announcing the end of their debit card program, which, in my opinion, is attracting a lot of users. From what I've just read in another article, it claimed that they were running the program without a valid license. I'm wondering if that will also have an impact on BNB's price, quite possibly. I'm not sure of the available alternatives at the moment; Crypto.com is certainly one of them, although to start receiving cashback rewards, you need up to €350 of CRO locked in, for just 1% return, and for 2%, up to €3.500; that's a lot.https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/binances-visa-debit-card-services-in-europe-to-end-by-december/P.S I believe this thread should be in Service Discussion in general, not in the altcoin section.",

I haven't read that from Binance, though, but from third-party sites. Supposing that it's true, I don't understand why a huge corporation like Binance chose to operate without one, putting a risk on their business and their credibility. Ultimately, they've been found to be breaking multiple EU and US regulations, and they're now being targeted with a valid reason. I highly doubt that a solution is going to be found; they only mentioned using alternative methods, such as Binance Pay, which is not even remotely close to what the debit card serves.I had bought approximately a whole coin to take advantage of the 2% cashback, but now I'm considering selling it and swapping to Bitcoin.",

Too bad for the people who are fond of using that maybe this can be fixed in the future if both parties can remedy the issue on taxation or any regulation when it comes to digital asset.
