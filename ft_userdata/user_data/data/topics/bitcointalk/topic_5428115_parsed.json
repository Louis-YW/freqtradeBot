I wonder if his girlfriend will cut a deal or already has which is why he is being arrested. _______________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________Anyway, check this one out:Sam Bankman-Fried on Luna, Genesis & 3AC [UNRELEASED AUDIO]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_Sue4Ca0dI",

The fact that his arrest effectively prevented his testimony makes it appear that corruption in the doj was involved in the timing of his arrest. It appeared that SBF was not taking legal advice from lawyers, and he would likely have incriminated himself while testifying.",

His activities in supplying funds to Biden and the Dems didn't simply happen because he loves the Dem Party and what they are doing. Rather, he did it under instructions, and the Dems and Biden need to get him into their direct control before he spills the beans about how they directed his activities.Sam Bankman-Fried is one of the first dominoes to fall. His failure is just the first. Many in Congress will fall right along with Biden... possibly because of what Sam Bankman-Fried might reveal, if he is allowed the time to talk, and especially if he is allowed to be depositioned.",
