  "content": "I have a watch only Bitcoin Core descriptor wallet with \"avoid_reuse\": true. It has pubkeys from different wallets imported, and I use it to keep track of all my balances. I also use it to get new receiving addresses and also to create unsigned transactions, so I want \"avoid_reuse\" to stay as true.But, I also want to see total balance of all addresses in GUI. Now I only see balance of all unused addresses beside \"Available\". To see balance on reused addresses I have to use \"getbalances\" in console.Can I keep \"avoid_reuse\" true but also show total balance of \"trusted\" and \"used\" on main GUI?Thank you.",

And why would I lose my privacy and use online third party?

And depending on how much privacy you want, Bitcoin Core or lightweight wallet which use BIP 157 with Tor or VPN are your only option. If you ask details about mutiples address or master public key to single block explorer or server, they might assume those belong to same people.",

This website is exactly the same as using mempool.space block explorer.When you add, for example, 3 addresses to bitcoindata.science, the website makes a request for each address in mempool.space API. So, you have the same privacy level of checking 3 address separately in mempool.space",

If you ask details about mutiples address or master public key to single block explorer or server, they might assume those belong to same people.Using SPV wallet (lightweight wallet) like Electrum wallet, without Tor and connect it to other servers to use and check balance is not good for privacy.It's explain why professional people are favorite to use Bitcoin Core, full node, Tor to do their Bitcoin transactions.Use Electrum wallet with Tor.Quote from: bitmover on October 26, 2023, 03:22:33 PMNothing is better for privacy than running a full node and checking the data by yourself...I agree with you that using third party data is not the best.Thank you to have you here and no one can disagree about risk from third-party tools but I don't imply you do something shady with your tool.QuoteThis website is exactly the same as using mempool.space block explorer.When you add, for example, 3 addresses to bitcoindata.science, the website makes a request for each address in mempool.space API.
