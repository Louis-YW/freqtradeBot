  "content": "Anyone here watch horror movies?Recently watch \"Pearl\" in the theater and then rented \"X\" the other day.....Looking forward to \"Maxxxine\" Also in the queue is \"3 From Hell\". Have seen the other 2 movies \"House of 1,000 Corpses\" and \"The Devil's Rejects\"Tons of other great ones out there...From sci-fi horror like the \"Cube\" series.. to silly horror like \"Rubber\"And even the \"V.H.S.\" series of films is great... definitely some good mini-horror movies there.Or even recent films like \"Barbarian\" and \"The Invitation\"Would even include some of the \"Black Mirror\" episodes from Netflix.. some great stuff!!And even classics like the original \"Friday the 13th\" and \"Nightmare on Elm Street\"Not into horror movies in the \"possesion\"/Devil/The Nun/Ring/etc category... too cheesy for me.And I do give credit to the original horror movies like \"Frankenstein\", \"Nosferatu\", \"Psycho\", etc.. I enjoy a more modern take on my horror.So what's your favorite movie or category of horror films?",

I always think that the modern horror movies are lacking in quality so will be good to check these out.",

They say it's even useful to watch them - this is how we learn how to behave in stressful situations (which we are unlikely to encounter in the real world, but knowledge can be extrapolated). But of course, it is more important to maintain psychological comfort",
