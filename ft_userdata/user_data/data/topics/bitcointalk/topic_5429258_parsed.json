One of the reasons why XRP is becoming irrelevant and less valuable is because of the fact that other networks in the layer2 category have made Bitcoin transactions scalable with low fees and less Bitcoin network congestion so has had no future just like thousands of altcoins it's its class.",

      "body": "Some of the past altcoins were also shaky and uncertain, especially after the bitcoin crash, many past altcoins dropped dramatically and even new altcoins disappeared and could not compete with others. XRP is just one of the few successful past coins. His twin brother also experienced the same thing, namely XLM, there has been no drastic increase so far.Currently XRP, XLM or other altcoins are only used for speculative purposes not for real use, the use of XRP as a bridge to convert coins to Fiat is no longer popular, there are other coins or other networks that are much cheaper.",

Yeah, I do agree that some coin that has been hype around 2017 has lost the spot on the top as they have been replaced by new ones.XRP was touted to be the next big thing for cross border payments not just for gambling. And there are many 3rd party remittance who partner with them way back 2018 but so far I haven't heard any now. Probably it's because bitcoin transaction has become so cheap right now that probably affected the market of XRP and they've lost some ground. It could stay in the market though, but not sure if they will get the support and the consensus like before.",

I think that's because XRP had a great/big community, same with Dogecoin and Dogecoin was also being bullied for being a meme coin, yet it was still standing strong. Only those who think or talk negatively about XRP are maybe just a hater of it and they are only spreading a FUD. XRP isn't the same as the 2017 mania coins but again like Dogecoin, XRP is much older than them.It was created on the year 2012 to be exact while Dogecoin was created on the year 2013. CBDC might work like an XRP but I can't tell for now if it's better than XRP. Let us only see once CBDC became more established because they are still a new thing for now and they aren't supported yet by many platforms.",

Before 2017, its price was way below $0.05. With this kind of profit, Ripple can actually pay big time if it's just what SEC wants. Unfortunately, SEC wants more than that and the rest of the altcoins will have an uncertain future also once XRP fails.",

I think in the past it was stronger because there weren't that many camps in altcoins. And i have to admit, price was working well for the early investors. I didn't buy it because even back in early days i didn't see any more point to it then i see now. These days i am including idiots into my calculations when i am considering if something is worth buying. Because for a profit maximalist it doesn't matter when we talk about the short time gains that what tech will get used in the end. They don't care how centralized or worthless the tech is.",

Its clear that all they cared about was using the XRP owners and their transactions for their gain and this has been going on for waaaay too long.

But XRP has lost some of it's community if I'm not mistaken.
