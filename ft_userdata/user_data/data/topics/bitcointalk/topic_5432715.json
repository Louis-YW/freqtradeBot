      "body": "The transaction which paid 50 BTC to that address did not pay that address at all. Rather, it paid the public key associated with that address, as Charles-Tim has pointed out. Most wallets and block explorers will therefore not show the transaction or not show it correctly, although some do.The private key 5KGLRScL6BqRkWnB8kTtoJmj21GT2W4KHpHJ2AA6vewuqM3tFVM gives the following uncompressed public key:Code:044e01f16fe203dbfd8110fd636f42e69bd2fa9e0fef913f00554e4412cb1cae070296f95c6b64f3fdcb7ee9dc838f20b992077e839703b3c2c5427e90e5afd0d1That uncompressed public key gives the address you have shared.Let's look up the transaction which looks like it pays that address 50 BTC: https://mempool.space/tx/4ff149267a5b1e55e3d90a5a5b451dd6d3c2c82b26b96a599dda0ed5585f1f3dIf you click on \"Details\", you'll see that the locking script is simply OP_PUSHBYTES_65 PublicKey OP_CHECKSIG, and the transaction type is P2PK (pay to public key).And so, because this is a P2PK transaction paying a public key, and not a P2PKH transaction paying an address, Electrum will not display it. It will however show up on some block explorers, for example here: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1NChfewU45oy7Dgn51HwkBFSixaTnyakfj",

The only reason why that private key (of the already empty address) is known today is most probably because the real owner sold it later on to a shady person on the internet who wanted to pull some sort of scam or possibly used it to claim some shitcoin (like CLAM or something like that) and it got leaked.",

Why?Import it to non-descriptor Bitcoin Core wallet instead and those P2PK transactions should be scanned without issues.That's if you're already running a full node or want to set-up one for that purpose.",
