  "content": "You may hate me for this speech but to my mind, patriotism is bluff! I live in Germany and Ukrainian \"refugees\" who came here, those who are rich and wealthy, party all the time, you can't even notice here that there is a war between Russia and Ukraine.So, I was thinking about the soldiers and men who stayed in Ukraine and are fighting against the Russians. For what? Ukraine is one of the most corrupted country. Rich and wealthy people, business owners and corruptionists and their children and family members will not war, they will get a business class ticket and leave the country with their wealth, they'll continue their comfortable life and they won't feel the negative effect of war, they won't die in this war.After a little time, this war will end and you know what? You will be dead, people in the government will negotiate with a happy smile on their face, shake their hands and continue good life. When you are in war, you are protecting business owners, criminals, people in governments, rich, wealthy people while you are poor and dying for nothing. At the end of the day, if you survive, you'll lose a leg or hand but get medal that has no meaning if you have to continue your life in pain with physical disabilities.My point is that you should only fight and protect your family members and close friends, not others. It's really pitiful when I see some part of Ukrainians are fighting for these wealthy morons who got shelter here and in some other countries and go to the beach, don't miss a parties while their brothers are fighting.",

People can't spend all days in sad mood. You're helping through donates and maybe volunteer work, then you go to chill a little. This is how it's going. But anyway, there really a lot of people who used this terrible war to emigrate to the EU.Quote from: Synchronice on June 22, 2022, 06:29:35 PMFor what? Ukraine is one of the most corrupted country.

I know a lot of businessmans who are at war now (not oligarphs, but owners of small and medium business). And a lot of wealthy people staying here. Some of them with their families.

Â Quote from: Synchronice on June 22, 2022, 06:29:35 PMMy point is that you should only fight and protect your family members and close friends, not others.Yep. Most of ukrainians fighting for their families, or for the reasons that russian soldiers couldn't come to their homes. Again, because they're not rich to flee if it will be needed. Fight or die.

It's really pitiful when I see some part of Ukrainians are fighting for these wealthy morons who got shelter here and in some other countries and go to the beach, don't miss a parties while their brothers are fighting.People are fighting for their country and their future freedom because they do not wish to be ruled from Moscow by a despotic psychopath. It does not get any clearer than this. It is actually the RF young people who are trying to avoid the draft because they, logically, do not trust Putin's intentions and they know may end in the front fighting in a war they do not believe in on behalf of the kleptocrats of Moscow so that they can buy a bigger yatch while he awaits in the trenches hoping that the next shell does not have his name written on it.You present an image of Ukraine that is completely biased, not to mention that corruption, kleptocracy, prevarication, xenophobia and gay-phobia are the trademarks of Aldolf Putin's government and the system of the RF. You should ask yourself why should anyone allow Moscow to decide their fate and their lives. At least if you have independence you have a chance to change things. Falling under Putin's thumb kills any chance of economic development and political growth.",

I have few contacts in occupied Melitipol. They tells that if you want to do something good for people (buy them food or meds) you need to cooperate with russian occupation administration. Without it they'll not allow to do any of this kind of stuff. Russians tries to cover as much ordinary people as they can. Or you re looking at starving oldies, or you helping them, but from now you tied with russian occupation forces.This is typical \"gang/mafia\" behavior: They'll not allow you to get out if something bad will happen",
