      "body": "A coin or a token can not be traded before listing. If a coin is not yet listed on any exchange, no one will want to trade it. You will only be able to buy the token which would be presale, a price lower than the price the token would be when it will be listed. This has been the way many people will buy coins and it would become a scam as the fake developers just dump the project. I do not know about decentralized exchanges using BSC smart contract, but I know of Binance Dex.",

As long as you can import the token contract address, decimals, symbol, and other shit associated with that token, etherdelta or forkdelta does not give a shit. The problem is if a token isn't known by the public, who's gonna buy your useless token?If I were you, you should stick with bitcoin or other altcoins with great use-case instead of vaporware tokens -- because those days are gone.",

If not i see no reason why one will want to sell purchased token below sales price.",

Nothing like that exist and much better if you stay away on this since to many scam tokens on BSC ecosystem and none of them are good to trade with. But if you are curious well maybe try to check this site https://poocoin.app/swap but be careful always I really don't recommend trading on any BSC dex since its more safer to do it on Binance and trade those top potential coins.",

I'm mostly trading on pancakeswap for BSC tokens but I also remember those times when there have been a bunch of ERC20 tokens in the market a few years ago and you can do all of those trades with forkdelta and etherdelta.But AFAIK, they both are almost dead and have totally been forgotten. What coin are you thinking of doing that advance trade OP? And I guess that answers your question if somebody doesn't know from the forum that there's one existing, if there's any, we have to wait but most likely that's it.",

Therefore, if you come across a token that you can only buy in presale before it is listed, be careful because it could be a scam.Before you buy a token at presale, do your research first (DYOR), the potential for the token, the team behind it, the background of the project.

      "body": "Yes, there are BSC (Binance Smart Chain) DEXs similar to ForkDelta, where you can trade tokens before they are officially listed. One such platform is PancakeSwap. PancakeSwap allows you to trade BSC tokens, create liquidity pools, and stake tokens for rewards. It operates similarly to Uniswap, but on the Binance Smart Chain. To trade BSC tokens before listing, you can use PancakeSwap's \"Trade\" feature. You'll need the contract address of the token you want to trade, and then you can create a custom token pair to trade it with other tokens like BNB or BUSD.",

      "body": "You are asking wrongly. Trading a currency means that there is an initial value for that currency that is traded around and there is a party that sells and buys that currency. Therefore, the currency must be listed on a central platform such as Binance or liquidity tools such as Pancakeswap, and these two types of listings need a team to provide liquidity for trading That currency and the presence of a third party that buys that currency from developers or miners next to you.What you are trying to reach is the distribution of these currencies, which is what is known as a airdrop or what happens in bounty campaigns, as a value is set for the currency before listing and you are carrying out a task such as promoting that currency in exchange for that initial value and promises to maintain that value upon listing.You can buy and sell before listing, but there is no guarantee of value for you, and therefore the seller is often the developers in an attempt to make the project attractive.",
