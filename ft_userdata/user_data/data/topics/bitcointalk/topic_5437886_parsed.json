Besides that, any person regardless how old is welcome to read and learn about bitcoin from one of the most experienced bunch on the web.It is a good move for me. You would have to follow them up and check their Private messages from time to time to ensure they do not fall victim of scams and stop any unsolicited conversation, also teach them basics of safe surfing on the internet.- Jay -",

The only thing I can think of when a child is on a forum is that they frequently ask questions that have already been asked multiple times so educating him/her about the rules will suffice.Nonetheless, learning bitcoin does not discriminate against age,sex or nationality, unless he is doing some sort of trading or gambling which is a BIG NO.",

This forum does not have any limitations regarding discussion, anything can and deserves to be discussed.Because of that, it would be very dangerous for that person if he/she got into a discussion that should only be appropriate for adults to discuss there, just for example like on this board: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=56.0, these days, crypto is no longer a special discussion, even without joining forums, one can still get crypto knowledge from platforms like YouTube. So it would be wiser if he/she wanted to know more about crypto from mainstream platforms only.",

As mentioned above, the gambling boards should not allow underage users to avoid confusion about gambling --so guiding them should be a must.We are a decentralized platform so there is no problem with the age, as long as he can understand our terminologies and can speak and write the English language, that is fine. Just follow the forum rules because that is very important. However, if he only speaks your local language --we have also local boards that he can hang on.",

      "body": "As a general guideline, online forums and communities tend to have a minimum age requirement of 13 in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). However, as mk4 said, there is nothing stopping someone under 13 from registering on a forum, just as there is nothing stopping them from using other social networks or online services, unless a KYC (or at least DOB) verification is required. The responsibility for protecting minors of this age online falls on their parents and legal guardians, therefore it is crucial for them to monitor their online activities, checking the sites they visit and ensure that they are not being exposed to harmful or inappropriate content. In addition, it's a good idea to teach them about staying safe online, like how to keep their personal information private, how to avoid being bullied online, and what to do if they come across something that makes them feel uncomfortable.Quote from: Ryker1 on February 03, 2023, 07:50:08 AMWe are a decentralized platform so there is no problem with the age...No, we are not.

He seems interested in crypto and he wants to learn, I believe he will know a lot through this forum than going online for answers. Good move or nah? Due to the marketplace (namely the gambing section) and signatures (which are mostly gambling related) I would have to say no. Those under the age of 18 would be very likely to wind up trying these platforms and forming some form of unhealthy relationship with them. Aside from that I would say that the forum is a perfect place for them to learn about Bitcoin and participate in its discussion. I suppose that if they don't try gambling from a young age and face this temptation and its effects from a young age, that they may wind up trying it when they are older anyway. It would be a shame for BitcoinTalk to be the avenue of that lesson though. This does spark an idea to create a bitcoin friendly forum orientated to minors. Young minds are our future after all. That could be a good prospect if there is a solid community participating in it from the beginning. I think that would only be possible if a large group of people from here helped nurture that initiative from the beginning though. Otherwise lack of activity will be its downfall.",
