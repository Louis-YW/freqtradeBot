The NFTs that Memeland has currently released include \"The Potatoz\" and \"YOU THE REAL MVP.\"How Does NFT Index Work?The well-selected NFT artworks are purchased by MEXC, which divides them into a specific number of pieces before listing the relevant NFT Index.Users who trade the NFT Index can obtain comparable amounts of NFT.Users who acquire a total of 1,000,000 units can get in touch with MEXC each week to redeem a full NFT if MEXC divides a total of 10 NFT artworks into a series of 10,000,000 portioned Index! The redemption occurs later the rarer it is.Once a user exchanges a complete NFT, MEXC will buy a fresh NFT. It will still be split at a ratio of 1:1,000,000 with the newly acquired NFT.No more than 10% of the entire number of the series of NFTs will be owned by MEXC in NFTs.Please Note:The project team's tokens have no connection to the NFT Index, which solely links to NFTs.MEXC does not use any on-chain NFTs; it simply splits the NFTs that were acquired.We will airdrop tokens for you in equal percentages based on your holdings of the NFT Index after the token airdrops for the NFTs you own have been delivered.The amount of Potatoz NFTs that MEXC buys and holds will depend on the market's demand. NFTs won't be added separately in the future, it won't be announced.
