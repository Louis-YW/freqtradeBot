It was a really expensive (time and money)  process of 9 months and had to pay extra as coins kept breaking. Had to change design 15 times. Had to return coins multiple times. At this price we are at loss.  Plus three different trials with stickers. As stickers won’t fit. Overall it’s a 3x more effort than Vibyor orange coins. Originally we want to keep the cost as 499usd. But we are hoping if we sell all we can make money from version 2. Lots of costs involved. We also want to do custom capsules but no more time.RegardsTeam RC",
