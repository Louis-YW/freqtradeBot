Campaign manager (Hhampuz) was informed to hold payment.Long story short:Another Mixin Safe member failed to submit review in time even after giving extensions. At some point when asked for refund they are not even refunding the payment that was sent upfront.Quote from: Royse777 on August 21, 2023, 05:39:38 AMQuote from: Royse777 on August 20, 2023, 08:15:56 AMQuote from: Royse777 on August 16, 2023, 04:31:25 AMCode:SUPERSAIAN~snip[~You missed your deadline. Please have an extended deadline until 20th August 2023 @23:59 UTC. That's the best I can do.There are still nothing from you two. Please don't miss today. I would hate to see a bad ending. SUPERSAIAN, please check your PM and refund the 0.003 btc to the address given in the next 24 hours to avoid negative feedback. This leaves us with a new opening spot. Please apply. I will pick one in the next few hours and your deadline to submit the review will be in 25th August @23:59. Depending on your reputation I may send your reward after you finish the review (considering the experiences so far, it's those one or two people who will always ruin a good experience)@SUPERSAIAN, I will leave you a neutral feedback stating that you are not fit to keep your words and doing business with you means wasting valuable time. If there are no refund in the time then a negative feedback will be added with an scam accusation.Edit: Your campaign manager was asked to hold any payment you earned or is going to earn from the signature campaign until you refund the 0.003 BTCTx ID: 900a75669f59873892dfd11191a3ff2a3f04616664facf027c10703f8ae07c68Amount : 0.003 BTCI am leaving a negative feedback for now. A flag will be created tomorrow. Just want to give him this warning that if in the next 24 hours he does not take it seriously then the account will lose everything only for 0.003 BTC.",

      "body": "Campaigns do not like to pay upfront just because of these stupid people. I don't remember if I have even seen this legendary guy on international boards. His participation in the local board is appreciatable. But, he should be responsible for the money he owes to submit a review. It's not like he is inactive and not writing anything in the forum. Did he give you any excuses Royse? Is his computer broken or will he refund you within a time frame? I guess if he gave you the time frame, you wouldn't create this thread. I am interested to know what is the reason for not writing the review not refunding the funds.",

I checked his campaign and he get paid for $70 per week, pretty close with 0.003 BTC. I believe he will either refund the payment or create the review ASAP in order to not get kicked from the campaign.",

Such a high ranked member should have them activated via telegram bots and be aware of the mentions in the forum, but who knows, maybe he missed them?I guess that the OP not only mentioned him, but also wrote a pm. What unfortunate. Unexpected events happen, and out of 100 participants it is reasonable that a few fail in meeting the deadline, but the corresponding refunds should not be a problem in these cases.Well, let's see what SUPERSAIAN has to say about this case.",

      "body": "Who knows his or her way about because for such a high profile user to be silent for only 0.003btc is something not unthinkable while in a campaign that should gives the amount in such a little time without thinking it twice, I will suggest to reach out another reputable user from their local board to know what is happening with him for not refunding the amount, even as the instructions were clearly stated on the thread it still surprised to know that some people still fails to meet up with the deadlines.Why then did they spend their funds without even working before exhausting what they are being paid to carry out the task, I believe there are other members who participated and they couldn't meet up their deadlines they refunded while some couldn't had the time to complete their review they made it open for another person to replace them.From what I am sensing he doesn't have anything left and his manager holding his funds would still results as not paying, all Less the amount would be paid to you directly from his manager if only he accepted to assist with that help. Hunan beings are so unpredictable, well give him time to pay I believe too well that his profile is too old for him not to pay so let's expect something positive from him or her to clear their debt.",

The campaign has a target of 100 reviews from 100 users and they finished the campaign already. So, this member has only one option which is to return the fund to the campaign manager. He cannot write the review anymore since the campaign thread is already locked.This is not a good choice to behave like this and show irresponsibility after taking the payment upfront. There is no reason for a legendary member to ruin their reputation just for 0.003 BTC which they can earn every week from their campaign.",

He doesn't want to ruin his account for not refunding the amount sent for the job that has not been done. Considering he is currently in a long-term campaign, it would be a big blow to him if he does not do the right thing.I'm sure Hhampuz would be willing to help settle this problem, but it shouldn't reach that level. It's just a matter of responsibility, and he has failed to do what was expected. Therefore, a refund is warranted.",

Just want to give him this warning that if in the next 24 hours he does not take it seriously then the account will lose everything only for 0.003 BTC.This review is one of the best I have seen in terms of management and payment. Everyone accepted their wages upfront and was given timeline to submit. The manager was also lenient in extending the deadlines of some participants. I can't tell his reason for not honoring his part of the contract after he had received his payment. But it is not because of emergencies such as illness or lack of access to the forum. The reason for my conclusion is that the user is still active in the forum completing his campaign quota. He has been given enough time to complete the review or refund the money, therefore any action taken by the company review manager is justifiable. He is in a reputable campaign in which less than his two weeks' income can clear his debt. Destroying a legendary member account because of $90 is not the preferred option. Taking a loan to repay this debt is better than the impending danger.",

Such a high ranked member should have them activated via telegram bots and be aware of the mentions in the forum, but who knows, maybe he missed them?It can be seen in the first post that Royse also sent him a PM 3 days ago so not having Telegram bot is not a valid excuse for a not knowing that he is supposed to send money back. Based form his post history, this is guy is very active and posts regularly so there's no way that he doesn't notice PM meaning he just doesn't give a fuck. Seems illogical to basically ruin high ranking account over 0.003 BTC but people tend to do stupid things.",

When Royse sent a message, I didn't even realize that the review time had passed, but I told her that I would send the money as soon as possible. I just sent it to him today. Thank you very much for his understanding, he is just trying to do his job properly and I have seen that he is a very understanding manager towards the writers in this regard.Sorry again for the inconveniences.Best Regards SUPERSAIAN.",
