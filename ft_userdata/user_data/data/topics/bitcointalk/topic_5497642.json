  "content": "There's this advice my dad gave to me some years back. He called me and say, \"my son, if you want to archive success in what ever you do in life, learn to take advice mostly from those that have archived success in the area you are seeking to be successfull. learn from the mistakes of those that tried and fail but don't allow them discouraged you. \"Some people wanted to invest in Bitcoin but took the advice of some one that have not invested into Bitcoin and the person convinced them not to invest.Some people invested already and where holding their coins but a non investor adviced them to sell their coins and they sold off quickly and regret after the market boom when they have sold off. The ecounragment on this topic are: if you want to succeed in your crypto journey, learn from someone that is a real investor or someone that have a very professional knowledge about Bitcoin, draw your advice from a successful investor, learn from the mistake of those that fail and make more research so that you will not make the mistake they made. Don't allow yourself to be discouraged by someone who is not on same race with you and someone who has never run the race you are about to take. A teacher was once a student, a doctor was once a student, an engineer was once a student and to balance the equation in the professional work of these people I mentioned, they can only take advice from someone in the same profession with them.  If a surgeon want to operate his patient and has any challenges, he can not take advice from a common man who doesn't have knowledge about surgical procedures, he can not take advice from a musician nor from a football player, he will take advice from a senior surgeon. So, why will you take advice from a non-inevestor and become discouraged not to invest into Bitcoin too? The person you are taking advice from doesn't even have a decent knowledge about Bitcoin. What is the best advice you got from your parents that have always been a tool of reference through your journey in life?.",

No one will congratulate you when you increase your purchasing power and no one will feel sorry for you if you lose money, quite the opposite, there will be people wanting to rob you if you become rich, or people laughing at you if you become poor.Finally, understand the fundamentals of what you are involved in, this is what takes you forward",

This was years ago when not that a lot of people have invested on it and can be said one of the earliest still even if I have considered myself to be late. I have never listened to them because I've done my research and knew what I was doing.Quote from: Mrbluntzy on May 24, 2024, 10:35:26 AMSo, why will you take advice from a non-inevestor and become discouraged not to invest into Bitcoin too? The person you are taking advice from doesn't even have a decent knowledge about Bitcoin. This is a common problem for the newbies. They are asking questions to non investors/non coiners and seeking their advise what to do. Good thing that I have not asked any from them and even so, I won't be discouraged by any of them.Quote from: Mrbluntzy on May 24, 2024, 10:35:26 AMWhat is the best advice you got from your parents that have always been a tool of reference through your journey in life?. I am so fortunate that they've told me to invest but that was already after when I was able to make some profit in BTC. But still with that, it's about diversification and investing in other assets too.",

If you ask someone who is into real estate what's the best asset to invest into, what will come out of his mouth will certainly aim at demeaning any other investment option out there and will certainly recommend that you go into real estate. Same is what's applicable to someone that's a core Bitcoin enthusiast. As a person, you have to decide which one is best for you and seek advice from people who are already in that sector and have seen good result by working from that sector.At some point, your parents aren't even the best persons to take financial and carrier advice from most expecially if they are not in the same carrier part you're going into. You've got to know who to listen to. Listning to the wrong person will mean that you're endangering your mind to getting fed with the wrong information that will certainly sware you into the wrong part. Talk consistently with somebody that believes in always waking up in the morning and rushing out in pursuant of 9-4pm job and he will talk you into believing that it's most decent to take that part. Listen to someone that's into meme coin and altcoin and with time you're bent on stacking those shits field up in your portfolio.The people you listen to matters a whole lot and if you allow a non investor to discourage you from stacking Bitcoin when he obviously have zero Bitcoin experience, you're directing killing your energy and potential to ever become a true Bitcoin enthusiast.",

Sometimes, you can learn from people who are not successful, but it all depends on you to keep learning. The person who introduced me to Bitcoin was not a successful investor. He introduced me to the sector, and I took the time to verify what I learned and went further to acquire more knowledge. QuoteSome people wanted to invest in Bitcoin but took the advice of some one that have not invested into Bitcoin and the person convinced them not to invest.Some people invested already and where holding their coins but a non investor adviced them to sell their coins and they sold off quickly and regret after the market boom when they have sold off. There are fudsters everywhere, so you should always verify before you make any decision. Your ability to verify the information you get from individuals and news outlets is what makes you a mature investor. You should be responsible for your decisions because they money belongs to you.

The person you are taking advice from doesn't even have a decent knowledge about Bitcoin. Most likely those who get discouraged by non-investors are beginners or people who are not confident about their knowledge and skills in investing or trading. Obviously without much knowledge and experience, they might just take any word from about anyone. But once you have learned even the basics, no one can convince you otherwise that investing in cryptocurrencies is a bad idea. I don’t think I have ever met an investor who was easily influenced by non-investors, most of them hold their stances because they know just how profitable investing is.",

Some people always criticize Bitcoin and its investors, causing FUD and deceiving others not to invest in Bitcoin, so it's not wise for anyone to easily feel discouraged about the FUD from Bitcoin haters. If anybody want to invest into Bitcoin, they have to learn from some informative material on the internet or make inquiries from those that have a good knowledge of Bitcoin.

The problem is, people can lie or at least overdramatize their success and failure stories, which can make learning from those experiences harder. Moreover, I don't think Bitcoin investment is something that requires that approach and expertise. Learning from mistakes of others is still relevant, but it can be done by following this forum, its relevant threads, or media articles about scams and hacks. As for investing, it's a decision one must make individually, regardless of being encouraged or discouraged.",

Trust your own in the end of the day since its your money that would really be that make use to invest not theirs, but somehow it isnt really that bad on making yourself that listening someones advises but of course just like on what been said or mentioned that you would be specifically be listening out into those people who do have that proper knowledge or someone who is really that having the experience and skills.It would really be just that common sense on whom you would be following but just like been said earlier that in the end of the day, you are the ones who would really be making such decision.It would really be giving out that huge regret that you are really that following someones advises. So it would be best that you should really be following on your own instead.Getting those advises from my parents is that, i should assure on having a business or investment rather than on focusing on acquiring or getting those wants that doesnt generate income or revenue.One of the main things that do goes into my mind or had been instilled deep insider. Learning up from others experience isnt that bad to consider or to look out but just like been said earlierthat you are the ones who would be making out such final decisions.",

My answer at the moment would be, no I would never sell bitcoins adopted in my DCA method on the advice of non-investors. Maybe four years ago if someone had told me that the price of bitcoin is not future or that bitcoin is a scam, maybe I would have believed him at least and sold my invested bitcoins.But at present I know about Bitcoin what it is and what it is made for and how its future is going to be. So there is no question that I will sell my bitcoins as suggested by a non investor, rather I can call him reverse crazy fool public. Currently holding fiat currency is the biggest folly, because the value of fiat currency will decrease as day goes by due to inflation. On the other hand, if you follow the Bitcoin DCA method and continue to invest little by little, then in the long-term your profit will be much higher.",
