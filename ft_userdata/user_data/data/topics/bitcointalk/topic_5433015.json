I've heard about the digital currency since 2019, but I guess I'd blame my reluctance to do something on skepticism and a lil bit of FUD, if not, I would have been able to purchase a handful because the price was a bit low then( I think, about $7,200). But I fully started in the year 2021 and despite it's ups and downs due to volatility in price, I'm still pushing. I think the best way to enjoy trading in BTC is if you trade with what you can easily dispose. heh, because you won't wanna get suicidal when your investment falls down like a pack of cards",

I think a better heading for your topic would be “What year did you get into bitcoin and trading” but that topic also has probably been discussed a couple of times already. I think the demographics of bitcoin users, traders and investors are more of the younger and middle aged people than of the old elderly people. Most of the elderly in my opinion, are more conservative and traditional. It would take a whole lot to convince them that bitcoin, a currency that you can’t see and touch is real or as valuable as people say. They don’t think crypto isn’t good for them, they actually don’t believe it’s a real legit thing.",

Because they think that crypto is not good for them.You have made your assumptions based on what you know and the very few insignificant number of persons you know who are in bitcoins compared to the total number of bitcoin hodlers worldwide. Age is something of the body, it does not determine how accepting someone will be when introduced to bitcoins for the first time, what determines it is how accepting the persons mind is to new ideas and innovations, and this is not restricted to only people who are young in body and age. Some people who are old in body and age, but young and accepting at heart and mind have accepted bitcoins and are hodling, at the same time, you will find people who are young in body and age but not accepting at heart and mind still holding opinions that bitcoin is a scam.",

I could also buy Tesla stock 10 years ago and be a millionaire and my parents would say they wish they bought Microsoft in the 90s You're never too late to invest. You may be too late for one thing but another one pops up in its place. Even IBM who most old timers consider a failure of the computer industry because it lost 2/3 of its value in the early 90s made people 5x in the end. If you were patient with it and didn't sell you made money on it. The most important things when you invest are avoid scams and have patience.",

A major number of older persons still find it difficult to use some social media apps, introducing them into bitcoin would be a hassle and they'll make lots of mistakes. The few of them in this market are tech savvy and understands the goal of bitcoin. Additionally, old people shouldn't go into a risky investment like bitcoin; life savings is what most of them got left after retirement. Throwing them in bitcoin is not a good decision. On the contrary, younger persons are in the era of bitcoin and digital currencies, so their numbers are expected to be higher than older people. And the young investors see many reasons to join bitcoin and understands them easily. However given a little time, the young people of today would be older and such disadvantages won't exist anymore.",

I do think that there are more older people who are actively participating in the Bitcoin market than what the survey says so saying mostly the 15-30 age bracket is the majority of the crypto population is somehow refutable, especially the 15 -18 years old bracket.",

Since I was a college student then, I thought I was going to be distracted by it. I just wanted to focus on my studies, get good grades and graduate. It wasn't  until 5 years later that I took it seriously having lost money in some shit coin project which some of my buddies had encouraged me to invest in. In my country, young people are more receptive to bitcoin than the older generations. Maybe this is because they understand it better or they see it as a way to escape the rat-race and oppressive government.",

As far as I remember, I've learned trading \"late\" 'coz it is a bit complex and even at this point I am still not that 'good' into it. Sinply proves that there are no easy ways to earn profit in this industry in contrast with the impression created towards it by some non-crypto users. In my general experience, I'd say this technology really helped me a lot with finances and as a curious individual.
