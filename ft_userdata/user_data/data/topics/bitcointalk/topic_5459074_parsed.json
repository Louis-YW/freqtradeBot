Not because it is translated, but it would be more visible for Nigerians (especially the newbie Nigerians) to see how they can post image on this forum.

Personally I dey against having empty threads as they sometimes represent less activities but for the sake of having more threads on the board I welcome the suggestion. Like this now as I dey write this post finish I go lock that thread and we can see how it goes. I pray it turns out to be very fruitful as all successful things here dey add glory to the board.Maybe that is why the OP decide to post it in a separate thread.",
