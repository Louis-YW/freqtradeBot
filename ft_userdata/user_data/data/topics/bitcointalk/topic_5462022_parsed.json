Are those papers written in pen supposed to prove something? I don't think they would have much value in court unless it can be proved that they were written by the company's accountant.",

And to us here on BTT, I don't see how this is our business, once BC.Game does not scam any of us, then we are good to go.

IDK if you can just edit them and arrange them accordingly so that we can understand what transpired between you them.Sorry to ask, you said your friend account was closed, right? What country did your friend access the site from? Because from what you said gambling is ban Thailand so is your friend not going against the law that way? I’m just asking out of curiosity, I’m fully aware that bc.games does not restrict Thailand from assessing their site.",

Now op only provided chats that few people would waste time to go through because it will not go anywhere because it won't prove anything against an alleged offender.",

You should move this on investigation or scam accusation thread depending on what's your goal here. Finding more evidence to help your case against BC.game or send a warning here through scam accusation but you should provide a solid evidence like legal documentation that there's indeed an actual case against Bc.game since your allegation is very serious. I think start proving first that Bc.game have an ongoing case regarding the title of your thread. There's really some cases here that involves bc.game but there's no solid proof so everything is ignored.",

Well, best of luck with your legal actions against them with the DSI in Thailand! As for the discussion on the bitcointalk.org forum, it'd be great if you could share more details and make your case more meaningful. Can you explain to us what those numbers listed on the handwritten papers mean? Also, your screenshots of the chat messages don't follow the actual events and seem taken out of context, making it hard to tell what the problem actually was. I think we can all agree that it is important to have clear information and facts to back up any claims, especially when it involves serious allegations. So, why not try to keep us better informed and make sure you've got the evidence to back it up?",

Because if all you have are some scribblings on a piece of paper and a few screenshots of a conversation, then that alone might not suffice as evidence. If you are so sure of yourself then you need to seek the counsel of someone who knows how lawsuits work, especially on how to win them. A judge might look at your \"evidence\" for all of 5 seconds and decide that it means nothing. So you obviously need something more concrete.I have heard many accusations against BC.Game within the last year and I am sure that you might find some supporters there. They might even help you with collecting the required evidence as well as all the legal mumbo jumbo.",

I don't understand what is the purpose of those hand written documents on the paper. Maybe OP should have explained more about the evidence details by details given that this forum is full of fake scam accusation to bring down a casino. A more and detailed evidence would be nice aside from the chat screenshots. May be the frozen bank account, transaction id's and other possible proofs that can help OP's case.

In the past, there have been cases where people were upset about certain casinos but didn't provide substantial evidence. To form a credible opinion, we need more substantial proof.Other than that, I see the Thai government banning gambling, which means if you engage in gambling, you will face legal consequences.
