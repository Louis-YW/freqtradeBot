There are some tips that are good but they tend to be hidden in a bunch of rubbish comments in threads on many pages. To learn about personal finance it is better to go to a forum that specialises in the subject. A good one in Spanish would be rankia.com.",

If you are unable to make progress in your current job role or business and if everything to try turns out be against you, then it is not the financial issues but rather it is something related to your skills which you are not competent at or perhaps you do not know how to run a particular business and always end up in a loss.",

That is why they are having problems financially because they can't find another source of income or are scared of taking risks like finding another job with a better salary or having multiple jobs because they are scared of sacrificing things. Though again, we do have our own reasons. Right now, I can't relate to having enough money and having problems on how to spend it. I always have problems because, no matter what I do, I always come up short or just enough.",

If you are making a fixed income every month but due to inflation the cost of your living may be gradually increasing due to the inflation but your income such as salary will not be increased according to that, especially in developing countries.a) Reading books related to finance may give an idea about what you can do but most of them are theoretically possible not in a realistic way for most of people.b) Bitcointalk is a place where you can learn collectively about money but it's not really a place to get financial advice.c) Watching inspirational videos will never change anything unless you implement it in your life.",

How can we move ahead if our expenses are more than our income or if the entire family depends on you and you have to bear all the expenses of the family then it will take a long time to reach your goal. If we have a family responsibility then we must wait for a good time and be patient to fulfill that responsibility only then we can reach our goal.",

True about the life story in the current world money is very important but it should not be considered everything, as I know it is a connection, knowledge development, health, spirituality, .. and then money will come as a matter of course with the living capital that we have.

But sitting for days on the forum and reading motivational posts will not add a penny to the wallet. In order to have money, you need to work, and it is better that there are no friends and relatives who lend a shoulder every time a person is left without money. It is at such moments that people who do not know how to build their own budget and live according to it begin to think not only with the thoughts of motivational speakers but also with their own heads.",

Those two are different issues that should be addressed differently.For someone who always has money but always finds it difficult to manage it because they give so much concern to their wants rather than just making their needs their top priority and learn how to manage their funds properly in order not to run into some kind of financial difficulties, those kinds of people need your option (A) in order to be able to learn and upgrade on their level of financial thinking.As for those who do not always have money, they should focus more on how to make the money they don't have rather than just always complaining without doing anything. But I think the solution to the problem is not included in any of your suggestions, as what they need is a paying job and not financial advice or any sort of stuff that will help them manage their finances.",

Otherwise, you won't be able to handle your finances well and everything may run out when you already have money.I make notes about any expenses that might exist this month and write down the amount of expenses. Before I use the money, I'll take 5%-10% to my bank account as a reserve fund and take the same percentage or less to invest in Bitcoin.And record every expense that I have made while ticking what I have done. Until the middle of the month, I still have money to continue what I haven't done.

Well we can get a lesson from the talk of those who have had success. We can learn from them. even they can be a good relation for our business.And being more active in economic forums is also a good thing to do. As long as we also know the basics of economics.

But in fact living up to the points you mentioned is not as easy as writing on paper. The reality of various people's problems cannot be summed up just by reading books and watching motivational videos. Do you just watch or read financial motivator books? but forget to face the real conditions in the environment. That is the root of the problem, always daydreaming about other people's careers and success but not developing potential that can actually be put to good use.Focus on sweet words, even though the process that goes through between you and other people is very different. For example, you come from a rich family and then become a motivator so that other people follow the process you are going through, until whenever it will not materialize.",
