If you want to keep it simple: pass KYC first, don't withdraw very small amounts, instead withdraw after more smaller buys if it's the case.",

      "body": "It's a pretty reputable exchange, but it gets a bad rap among most Bitcoin communities because of the strict AML/KYC requirements. If you're fine with AML/KYC requirements, then go for it. On the other hand, go for the less convenient peer-to-peer exchanges(HodlHodl, LocalCryptos, etc).",

As long as you don't keep your bitcoin in Coinbase and transfer it to any mainstream hardware wallet -- you're fine.No matter how large the exchange, as long as you limit your exposure to these risks (e.g., account freezing, bankruptcy, unable to have full control) by keeping your coins off of exchange as much as possible  -- you're good.",

I’d also go through their Trading Fees and withdrawal fees & limits. Whilst being at it, regardless of the Exchange being used, I’d also go around the forum reading about self-custody and all that it entails.",

Localcryptos website now are referring people to Localbitcoins and Paxful which both require KYC. We should not refer people to the site again for decentralized exchange.Quote from: Charles-Tim on January 12, 2023, 08:19:35 PMQuote from: Dunamisx on January 12, 2023, 07:45:36 PMhttps://localcryptos.com/If you click on the site now, you will see this:QuoteLocalCryptos is winding downLocalCryptos — the original non-custodial P2P crypto marketplace — has decided to wind down after five years, however there are other marketplaces where you can buy and sell crypto in a peer-to-peer fashion.
