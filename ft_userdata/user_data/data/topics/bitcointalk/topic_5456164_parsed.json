If there is a very good reason to report an old message (malware, doxing, etc...), report it and a mod will handle it (normally).Spam posting in old threads that are several years old that may have been buried deep and doesn't seem to bother forum and readers anymore. So that might be the reason why mods don't moderate old posts.",

But if you will report old post, mods will handle report too and they will delete it if it will be needed.When you want to post in a thread that is more than 120days old, you will have a warning telling you not to bump the post unless you have something absolutely important to say, otherwise consider creating a new thread.This simply implies that older spams are hidden¬† than the recent ones. I believe before this recent development, in the backend, reports appear to the moderators according to the time of report. Which means a 1 year old post reported last week would be treated before today's post reported today. There is an obvious deficiency in the model.With the recent development, it means newer posts take precedence when reported even if they were reported later than the older posts.",

But if you will report old post, mods will handle report too and they will delete it if it will be needed.I've reported some amount of old posts that I'd consider spam in the past - but as it happens, mods have tag it as a bad report because they don't moderate it anymore [unless it's something dangerous]. Since then I haven't reported any old posts although I was really want to report it after reviewing a few user profiles - but I no longer do.The effect is - my report count tends to go down although I've still had some good reports so far. So now is not the time to dwell on old spam that has been buried by tens and thousands of spam, but recent spam posts are makes sense focus.",

I think since any post or thread had survived a particular number of years or months - according to Thier specified annual statistics - then, they don't seem to worry much about it because they feel it's been a good one to have survived that long innit...Secondly, they all know just like anyone would that old posts can't be made by rookies....and any old, prominent member wouldn't dare to make threads that'll need to get reported afterall...so all they would rather go for are the new posts - whether it comes from an old member or not - since we've still got alot of old-time dummy's in here too...

For the first time, changes about sending old posts appeared on April 11th. I'm surprised the OP doesn't know. It has been discussed many times that no one in their right mind would read old posts, much less pay attention to useless posts. As someone recently said, reporting old posts is interesting to someone who is looking to improve their reporter stats, nothing more. But you need to think about what kind of burden you add to the moderators by parsing old posts.At the moment, the topics are just as full of garbage, especially from those who use the toy of the AI tool. It would be more useful to clean the forum from such rubbish, as it has been proven that very often information from AI is incorrect.",

Maybe it should be clearly stated from this context that old post can be bumped as long as it content has no any form of attack by any means and also have the reason why such could be revived, if not there's no necessity for rising up old threads if there's no need arising for doing so, we can also how new threads were coming in everyday with current informations on what's going on in cryptocurrency, yet there's more need to see members actively engaged in their discussion than old bumped threads that are not invoked on current happenings.",
