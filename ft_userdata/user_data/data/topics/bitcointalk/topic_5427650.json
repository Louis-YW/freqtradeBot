As of today there is bitcoin, and apart from that there are 21,999 shitty alternative cryptocurrencies, created to try to compete with it, but they are not even close to it because they are not decentralised to begin with. And even if tsomeone tried to make a truly decentralised alternative, it wouldn't make much sense because not many people would jump on the bandwagon, as bitcoin already exists. The normal thing would be to try a fork or something as was done in the past, without much success as we have seen.",

It's just an observation that humanity makes progress. I'm sure at some point in history Bitcoin would fade away, maybe the network will even effectively stop. But it might not be described as a direct replacement. Bitcoin could be used less and multiple other things could be used more. If we think about narrower terms, like another coin replacing Bitcoin, that's highly unlikely. Historically Bitcoin always remained number 1 because it's a project that at its core is honest and doesn't have any hidden motivations. Unlikely altcoins, which are created for profit. So, anyone who truly wants to make a decentralized currency would rather work on Bitcoin then try to invent a wheel by forking Bitcoin for no reason.",

People believe in Bitcoin because it is the only decentralized cryptocurrency, and this is something that no other project could do regardless of how much money, time and everything else they invested. My personal opinion is that in some distant future, Bitcoin and the whole concept of the financial system may no longer exist because people will move to a higher level of existence. Until then, Bitcoin will exist as an alternative for those who feel that they need something like that, and whether that number of people will grow over time or not, only time will tell.",

They are centralized and their supply is in full control of the company that issues them and on top of that they don't have to be backed by anything. Like Tether that has a high chance of not being backed by real USD 1:1 and they can issue more at any time they want.",
