That is not going to happen because they are already benefiting from the luxury of crypto through there one nation and two system scheme, which means they are one nation which consists of China and Honk Kong (two system). and you might aware of the adoption level of Crypto in Honk Kong. Well, market after bearing huge dumps due to SEC's actions against Binance, Coinbase went into correction and during this correction huge amount of BTC were bought by big institutes but this buying was through buying the shares of Micro Strategy. I have already shared this infor before Quote from: Faisal2202 on June 19, 2023, 04:53:16 PM sourceWell, after this, the dominance of BTC increased 51% which was a good sign for market and then Binance started to spread its reach towards new places such as Kazakhstan and then USA declared his own exchange idea of EDX. Which also act as a good factor.",

Additionally, recent legal developments have helped resolve the allegations against Binance, further stabilizing the cryptocurrency market. These positive events have had a notable impact on Bitcoin's price, prompting increased buying activity among investors. Consequently, the market charts have shown a significant upward trend, indicating a bullish market sentiment.",

There is even a news that states Bitcoin spikes to as much as $138k on crypto exchange Binance.US, it was a short lived though since it goes back to normal as soon as it spiked that much.  It was told to be a liquidity issue between the pair BTC against Tether.[1]Well, it looks like the Bitcoin ETF and the US announcement of the new exchange really push the price of Bitcoin up[2], after the Binance and coindesk issue which make BTC to plummet.  Bitcoin did it again, surprising and shaming TA's on their prediction about BTC crashing further.[1] https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/21/bitcoin-price-spikes-to-138k-on-binanceus/[2] https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etf-fuels-29-k-btc-price-breakout",

If we consider this year is the last year of a bear market in a big market cycle from 2020 to 2023 and some early months of 2024, the market must recover and to recover strongly, it must have some big news to bounce.Like Bitcoin Futures CBOE and CME in 2018, now we have Bitcoin Futures everywhere and Bitcoin still dropped in last two years 2022, 2023 and do Bitcoin Futures are strong enough to save Bitcoin price, they are not.Bitcoin ETFs will be like Bitcoin Futures and they will be a new normal term a new product we use in Bitcoin market.",

Bitcoin is still in demand and in very limited supply. Declining supply in the long term. It is better to buy now if you are going to HODL for 10 years, a couple at least, but it seems to me that you are not thinking about that.",

We can understand that US plans to have its own crypto exchange, they can take advantage of it. I'm pretty sure that there are many big whales in US, they've bought as many as Bitcoin when SEC accused some top crypto platforms. Now, they may think it is enough for entry time, it is time to boost the value of Bitcoin by spreading positive news. Let's see if the plan for the US crypto exchange is really true or not!",
