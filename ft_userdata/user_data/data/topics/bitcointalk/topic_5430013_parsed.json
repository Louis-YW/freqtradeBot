What do you think will happen when the block reward subsidy is 1.5625 BTC in a little over 5 years?As long as the bitcoin price doesn't tank, recover and records another ATH, I think 1.5625 BTC is still sufficient for the miners to sustain their activity.",

Satoshi probably intended the block reward as a temporary subsidy to bootstrap the network and pay the miners until there was enough economic activity that miners have sufficient compensation from transaction fees. So, shrinking block rewards isn't a problem, even if BTC prices don't rise much from here. Just my 2 cents.",

My mean that if Bitcoin mining fee is 0.01 BTC per block and reward is 0.01 Btc Per block than Prices of Bitcoin will be skyhigh cause there will be no Bitcoin to mine and there will be no pressure of selling and also bad News regarding Bitcoin. Currently we have been listening to the China Mining Fud and eventually it will be gone by the time.",

I think that block reward + tx fees should be compared with the fiat cost of mining a block, and then we would see how much one Bitcoin worth.Of course, various modifiers have to be taken into account, from the more performant machines by then to many more using very cheap energy from the sun. Also don't forget the inflation of fiat.But that's all. I don't understand why you've tried to overcomplicate the equation, but I see no problem with block reward going lower than the tx fees, even though I expect that happen significantly later than your predicted time frame.",

So, shrinking block rewards isn't a problem, even if BTC prices don't rise much from here. Just my 2 cents. I also think this is the case. Lots of systems implement these \"early\" incentives for users to make sure they get a lot of users on their platform, and then gradually remove them. As long as their service/activity stays the same, the user will generally still use their product. So, I believe as long as the network is still valuable for people (whether they classify BTC as money or an asset/store of value) it will continue to survive. OP, you might want to search for other threads that discuss this topic. I don't remember which one is it, but I'm sure there are several discussions surrounding this topic in the past.

For example, if all other variable remain same (same Bitcoin price, ASIC type, etc.), the difficulty will be adjusted to only 1/2^13 of current difficulty.In addition Satoshi design that halving in hopes that in due time adoption is already proliferated that the tx fee can give more than enough reward to miners.  Aside from technological advancement, difficulty adjustment, I believe adoption is the key factor for the Bitcoin economy to survive, after all the market relies on supply and demand.Assuming that the block mined is nearly zero and Bitcoin demand keeps coming in, it only means that the supply is already near to exhaustion, and with the proliferating demand, there is only one way for BTC market and that is to uptrend.The increase in difficulty and halving of reward can be offset by adoption and technological advancement.  In a case where supply is already exhausted but the demand keeps on piling up, this will make Bitcoin more valuable and expensive that can compensate to the halving of the block reward. And if the reward isn't enough that makes miner discouraged to continue, Bitcoin developer had addressed that problem by difficulty adjustment depending on the hash power solving the block, the only problem is the last block to mine before the difficulty adjustment kicked in but after it will be a breeze for miners.  I do not think the difficulty adjustment is created for the profitability of miners but instead to secure that the network will continue to flow regardless of the hash power being pointed to the network. Profitability is probably just the side effect of the difficulty adjustment because miners can then use lesser hash power to mine Bitcoin/BTC tx fee, which reduced their cost in solving  a block.",
