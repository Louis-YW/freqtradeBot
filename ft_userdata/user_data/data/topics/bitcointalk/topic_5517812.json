  "content": "Do you think Bitcoin still has all original devs contributing, a few or none?It will seem like I'm going on a tangent, but stick with me. I've been going down the crypto rabbit hole for 10 years now. the last few years I stopped using bitcoin for payments & shifted to Monero, as I wanted privacy by default, however lately I've lost confidence in XMR's privacy due to the possibility it may have a vulnerability in key image analysis & may not be fixable. theoretically speaking, it allows Chainalysis to quickly connect transactions together using AI. They may not be disclosing their ability to trace it for numerous reasons. there's only a few coins that actually have privacy by default, and more specifically, that have privacy by default & OG cypherpunk devs. given all the evidence lately that has surfaced about bitcoin's hijacking, do you think it's possible that the OG dev's have moved to other coins. 2 that stand out to me are Dero & Piratechain. I think Monero has some OG devs too, I just don't know if they're very aware of key images analysis threat yet. You can't be ignorant in these times & have to keep an open mind. yes Dero has a bug & it's been de-anoned (apparently a patch is coming), however key image analysis isn't a problem because it uses account model & not UTXO. from what I've read, I'm no expert, DYOR of course.I want to place my attention where the OG dev's are. Not here to shill or trigger anyone. Crypto is suppose to be private. All these surveillance coins are just leading us closer to the impending dystopia. My only wish - I want to use the best tech available to fight the NWO. IMO, they installed trump & made him pro-BTC, and now they're going to make it a very sly CBDC. Most of it is already KYC'd & centralized - they don't need to control the base network. They will use the interface of government to enforce the rule of law (threat of violence) onto the people. The Trojan horse almost no one is expecting.This is a bitcoin topic BTW, because bitcoin was suppose to have privacy. it all started with bitcoin.",
