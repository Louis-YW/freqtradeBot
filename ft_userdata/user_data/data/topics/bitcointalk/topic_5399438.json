This tournament is completely free to join. The winner will win $500USD + 3 NFTS. When you sign up; for free entry you must use the bonus code: WIN500Best of luck and hopefully someone from here wins!!Website: FCFPOKER.com https://i.ibb.co/tXzmZDd/C9-D10-B38-7755-427-B-B763-25377-F097-FB9.jpgEdited for Karen’s of Bitcointalk “I am not an owner. I am a player”. There was a free tournament so I told people about the promotion and the code I used to play. It was a mistake by me. The site is no longer free. I don’t know if bonus code does anything. Play at your own risk. I apologize. I will be there playing. I have nothing to gain except beating you on the River of a no limit Holdem game. Sorry for posting. The end.",

Not for the freeroll, which are usually a waste of time for those of us who play regularly, but to see the room in general, but I see that the terms and conditions are laughable. Besides, is it non-kyc? It would be even more laughable. Good luck trying to attract players to the room, surely the freeroll will attract some.",

But I’ve played and cash out. Just shared for anyone who wanted to take a free swing at $500 and 3 NFTs. Not sure of there value. Every now and then you can get a good game going. So really was just sharing because maybe some people would like the site and one day play and I can play against them and take their cash. So sorry I will not be posting anything fancy. I didn’t have to KYC. I will say that if you decide to play with cash; then Bitcoin is the slowest route. Requires 7 confirmations while bsc deposits take 2-3 minutes max.",

Only downside is they are new and less than a 100 players right now unless they do a free roll tournament which they do every now and again. My best advice is check out the free roll game and see how the game play is.",

Good luck trying to attract players to the room, surely the freeroll will attract some.I believe when I signed up I gave my name and email and the bonus code. Outside of that; I didn’t have to leave any identifying information. I use crypto to load my account and they haven’t asked for anything. I guess I could’ve used any name as there was no verifications. I did notice when I ran outta money and tried to deposit more in game there was pop up for KYC; but I just closed it out and pressed cashier and added more bsc and since then no problem. Has chat inside. Game play was kinda slow; but they are tweaking it and getting better with turbo tournaments etc.",

I don't try it on phone, on my PC also a ready pop-up to install the application. As I know in application mode, chat mode is always available and you can see the statistic with each player.@johndurston you have to use quote and don't multiple posts like that.",

I play on the site; but since it’s new not many players there.If you are a player on the FCFPOKER.com poker site, tournament information or in any form for free offered by gambling sites, it is enough for you to know the process of playing poker yourself, Who is responsible for other users, if something unexpected happens, for example: the user wins the poker team does not want to pay or after winning there are other conditions that must be fulfilled by the user.You know that gambling is high risk, you unconsciously direct other users, in a high risk game, obviously you say the FCFPOKER.com site is new and players don't exist either, like you put a rope around your neck.Quote from: johndurston on May 20, 2022, 02:40:47 AMWhen you sign up; for free entry you must use the bonus code: WIN500What is the code above, your referral code is personal, someone else signs up and the deposit bonus and winnings will flow to you a certain percentage.",
