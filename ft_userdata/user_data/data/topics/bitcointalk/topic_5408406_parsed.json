Considering your disappearance, the constant questions who you are, where you are, and why you created the network you did, was it worth it? I would also ask him/her if he/she thinks the Bitcoin community is worthy of this creation. I would like to know whether the way we use Bitcoin today coincides with their way of thinking. Some feedback would be great although that's never going to happen.Personally, I don't think satoshi is happy with how much dependence there is on centralized services and that's not what they had in mind.",

I have gotten very useful information in the Crypto currency space. I really enjoyed reading the article on the link. And also your explanation for the OP question is nice for me but you have not really nail on the question based on the OP. He or she is a newbie, so your explanation would been straight forward after given the instances or before the instances (example). As a educationist, there is a way we answer questions that the person who asked the question would understand. I do not think the OP understand you but he has gotten new information from you but if you evaluate him or her to know if he or she understood you. I doubt.Quote from: Faisal123 on August 02, 2022, 02:52:47 AMWhat was that thing your mind was thinking when you struck with the idea of decentralized blockchain? This question is directly to Satoshi Nakamoto. And in the forum, those who have known blockchain and are the representatives of Satoshi, so they are answer... I believed he created the blockchain because of the National Government Authorities control over citizens fund without their conscience. So blockchain is decentralized digital currency in which no governmental Authority will have access or control your funds.",
