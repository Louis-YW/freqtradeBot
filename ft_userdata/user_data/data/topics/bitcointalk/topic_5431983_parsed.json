  "content": "QuotePetrol shortage has persisted yesterday across the country, as Depots and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria, DAPPMAN, continued to sell petrol at N215 per litre to marketers. This is an excess of N67 per litre or 31 per cent when compared to N148 per litre being charged at the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, NNPCL depots.Independent marketers that patronise the private depots sell the product at over N220 per litre, while the major oil marketers sell at N170 per litre at their filling stations. Checks by Vanguard showed that many filling stations across the country were shut and the ones with stock continued to sell the product to motorists and other parties at far over the official price, while the ones selling for below N200 had long queues.Source: https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/12/scarcity-nnpc-sells-petrol-for-n148-private-depots-n215/amp/I see this story this morning e just remind me of wetin I go through yesterday to buy fuel for my side. I finally see am buy but na N270 per liter for filling station and still e no full my fuel rubber wey I been dey use N4,500 dey full before and this na N7,000k fuel I buy so oh. Abeg wetin be the problem with fuel for Nigeria for December period and how the country go fit solve this issue. Fuel Scarcity na very strong discussion for this country and our politicians no dey talk anything about am self and how them go solve am if we give them power. The thing come belike say na part of our living. Abeg how much you buy fuel recently for your area and how the supply. The scarcity reach your side?.",

      "body": "Yes this really a major issue for the country and even my place now sef to get fuel buy na very serious issue. This fuel scarcity problems na one of the issues wey our politicians dem just dey overlook, at least you fit try see am for 270 buy. for my Area here na so so black market retailers na dey sell fuel for road side with the price of about 350+ per liter. Me i just feel say this bunkery business too dey affect the fuel price because when this bunkery cookers dey always temper with the oil pipeline, dem dey suck and divert this oil go other places and this dey cause some shortage of oil for the country somehow and sometimes the pipeline sef fit burst resulting to serious oil spillage and the rest. But the funny thing be say even this bunkery wey dem stop sef don make fuel and other petroleum products scarce because i fit recall many times wey i don see this fuel station tankers too wey dey buy bunkery fuel and kerosene wey dem dey later sell to us say na better products them. So this na serious issue and government need to do something about am",

      "body": "It's a pity that a country blessed with crude oil could be facing the situation we found ourselves in Nigeria with regard to the fuel of all classes. Particularly, the petrol as @CryptopreneurBrainboss put the figure at N215+ per litre, but specifically in my neighbourhood, the private stations are selling it at N300 per litre. This is preposterous! It started like a play with a country that is being ruled by corrupt and selfish leaders. I don't know what happened to our refineries that no one is talking about it. Is it that Nigeria as a country could not build new functional refineries from the scratch, let alone not have the capacity to revitalize the old ones? This always baffles me, and I hope God will deliver us one day.",

This always baffles me, and I hope God will deliver us one day.One problem Nigeria get as a country na we no sabi maintenance, the building no be problem but how maintenance go be and the major reason for this na because we no get continuous government. Every government wan create their own legacy wey go help them contest for the next election so instead of focusing on maintaining wat we already have, dem go abandon am go build their own wey we fit no even need.Oya see our teaching hospitals them and other government buildings wey dey available, na so so unkempt wey all of them dey now if them build this refinery who go look after am. Personally I think the government should privatized the whole refining l industry make companies come in come make things easier and make dem pass law wey go prevent demselves or relatives to get involvement (but dem no go gree). The government is too corrupt to be incharge of the refinery instead dem fit they regulate am but make dem allow private industry take charge to see how the thing go play out.",
