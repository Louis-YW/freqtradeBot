I am not surprised that young people are the ones who are most familiar with cryptocurrencies. This is because they are the ones who interact with social media and websites all most time, and most of this cryptocurrency awareness are spread through sites like Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Facebook, and many more. Since many older people don't deal with social media or spend time much of time their, the majority of them are unaware of its existence of cryptocurrency.

People should be careful when it comes to trying new things. And especially, they need to do research. Not spend all of their money on something just because it's popular.Also about some coins that made a big fall: the same happens in Forex or other regular exchanges. Companies come and go, sometimes they go bankrupt.But I also see here a chance for people from all over the world to earn money in crypto - a legit way. And it would be good if they could spend this money in their country. The one thing that is needed is good education about what crypto is and what possibilities come with it.",

In my country, the government is trying to get people to get rid of paper money, by adding higher fees to their credit cards. Eg. you need to make at least 5 transactions per month using a credit card; if not, you will pay a higher fee. I even heard about situations that have place in Sweden (if I am not mistaken) when the government sees where families with children spend their money. And if they saw there were a lot of transactions for alcohol, they sent a child care worker, to see what the situation was at their home. And it all leads to it. My big concern is the fact that not many people realize that.Quote from: Slow death on March 06, 2023, 10:10:55 AMI ask you: where is the privacy? we no longer have privacyHere, I don't agree with you. I would say our privacy is limited, BUT - if you do your best, you can hide some of your actions and remind anonymus. Pay in cash, don't share your location with Google, and use a VPN, for example. When it comes to money that comes from crypto, I can only refer to how it is here, where I live. From the money that I earn in exchanges and there is KYC, I need to pay tax. But if I have some other money, that is not related to my (aidrops or exchanges that don't require KYC) I can withdraw this at an ATM. Some amount of money, like 1,000 euros per transaction and 15,000 euros per person per day and this is without KYC. And its up to me if I will reveal the money.",

Most of the time, it comes from jealousy and the fact that we take actions to achieve something.In general, people don't like to see how others succeed.What I suggest from my experience is to \"dream big.\" Don't let anybody tell you what to do. And if they laugh or are not supportive, they are not real friends. So don't take time to bother about them.Focus on what makes you feel good.And there have been many times in my life when I tried something and then abandoned it because it didn't work. But I did not give up. People learn from every experience in their lives. We gain knowledge, and the next time we do something, it may be better and bring us profit.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",
