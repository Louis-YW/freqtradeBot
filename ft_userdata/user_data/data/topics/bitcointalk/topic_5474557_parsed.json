  "content": "I have been here for some time now and I have seen zero engagement on topics that are on the child board. My question is why? Why are we not checking the child boards? What different are we doing than those who are not assigned a full local board? Take this for an example, one of our child boards had a review campaign for their product. I saw it and found spammers applying for the campaign. It was about the Utopia review campaign - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5470663.0Are you guys who are active here using Bitcointalk notifier or the Telegram notifier? I am not into Telegram and therefore I use the forum notification using my email ID. I request everyone who is always checking the local board to check in the child boards and you will find a lot of opportunities to make extra income.",

      "body": "As for me, I have read all the topics in the Child boards for now - \"light blue\" colouration at the moment, and whenever I visit the India section, I check if any of them turned \"dark blue\" and would visit that and read it.As for engagement, some of them have been spam so I have reported content of such nature as well and they have been taken down and sometimes I dont think the topics deserve a reply from my side.Participating in campaigns is a personal choice, so no comments there.I dont use any notification bot, the activity here can be managed by a once daily visit, so thats what I prefer to do.",

      "body": "I do visit the child boards and frankly, I can only see a lot of spam there. I do report them but I do not find any topic to start a conversation, what we can do is we can create a few threads on the Altcoin board and on Press & News. @Bitcoinsmith does post news on the main board and so did I in the past. We can create a single thread and post information on those threads so that we do not spam them. That would encourage others to visit the child board and get them activated. What do you guys think?",

It is a bit slow but delivers what is required from it, I got a notification today from the Off--Topic sub-board about this topic: Let's Discuss About Movies and TV Shows!. I feel that we need to create a few more threads like this one created by pakhitheboss to make other ones active. Marketplace, mining, buyer/seller, and regional language are useless whereas in altcoins & news one can have a single thread like the one created on off-topic.",
