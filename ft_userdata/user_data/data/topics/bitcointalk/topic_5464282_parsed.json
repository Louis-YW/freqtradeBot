Are some countries willing to lose their financial independence and use someone else's currency?Of course, all central banks follow the recommendations of the IMF and BIS, but this is a very radical idea.It is not something that Argentina would be the first in, because some smaller countries have been using the US dollar as their national currency for decades. El Salvador has been on that list for more than 20 years and still uses $ as its official currency. I am not a supporter of such moves, although I can understand that at some point an individual country may find itself in such an economic situation that it looks for a way out by changing the national currency.When you look at the European Union in relation to the eurozone, it is easy to see that there are countries that have accepted the common currency without any problems, but also those members who still want to keep their national currencies. I am of the opinion that every country should have its own national currency, but it is also a fact that there are very few countries in the world that understand what it actually means to have a state.That guy from Argentina seems to me like some kind of anarchist who doesn't need a central bank, but would be happy to transfer the problem to the FED and foreign currency, which is not something that characterizes a good politician.",

Instead, base it on something real. Like backed by gold. Or 95% gold and 5% Bitcoin.--Knight HiderIt is obvious that the banking system in Argentina will continue to exist and perform its functions. In this case, some body is needed to manage the banking system and make quick and correct decisions in this industry, providing a unified approach to solving constantly arising financial problems.Presidential candidate Miley plans to hand over the keys to the central bank to economist Emilio Ocampo, his unofficial adviser on the dollarization program, so he can shut it down. That is, in fact, the functions of the country's central bank will be performed by an unofficial adviser to the president. What does it change? Instead of a certain independence, the banking system will be under the strict control of one person. How good this person will be in managing banks, time will tell. The stability of the national currency, in this case the Argentine peso, largely depends on the stability of the banking system, which will continue to exist in any case. At best, it's like reinventing the wheel.",

But I also think that nations should have their own currency and not depend on other strong currencies. The US will make monetary policies to suit its economic condition and it might negatively affect Argentina. Argentina has it's peculiar economic challenges and policies should be made within the country to curb it.

The question is what steps will he take when he intends to close all existing central banks when he is elected president? Indeed there are many people now starting to doubt the real benefits of a central bank, but realistically (in general) there is still enough need for a central bank at this time important. The inclination of people toward central banks can be seen from how large a percentage of people are still using these services and whether the country is losing interest in existing central banks.He must offer a solution to the failure of several central banks to operate, both in terms of serving the people and the interests of the country itself, not promising otherwise but never having the courage to take a step like that of El Salvador's president Nayib BukeleQuote from: zasad@ on August 23, 2023, 11:26:05 AMAnd what's the problem?

Does anyone else believe in this? Before the elections, each candidate promises to move mountains, and after - as usual they become so invisible.Promises to make efforts to avoid default? Will Javier Milei be up to this task? The problem is serious and cannot be solved by words alone.If Argentina closes the central bank, will it be the first country in the world without a central bank? It will be funny to look at the consequences of this, it will be a spectacle. A unique precedent is being planned, but I would not want such experiments to be carried out in my country, because no one knows what will happen to the economy. It could get even worse.In fact, it is difficult to talk about the economic freedom of countries when all world trade is conducted in dollars (reserve currency) and in fact, local currencies are the same recolored dollars. So, the presence of the national currency (peso) does not mean financial independence for Argentina.",

To some countries like Argentina taking up another currency like the dollar would be the most sensible move they can make if they don't want the people to die of starvation. It's not about principles and shit at this point, it's mostly all about ensuring the proper survival of your economy. Although I don't really think the closing of its central bank is the \"best move\" as they can easily just sell their exports and all that at half the price or something, but I don't know man Argentina's case is a pretty tricky one in my opinion.

Argentina has literally faced many decades of poor governance from politicians, that doomed it's economy and thus prevented the central bank from doing their job effectively because they were always fire fighting. They might as well do it now, since the government has crippled the monetary situation in the country and it basically works off a black market US dollar economy anyway, however instead of it being a bold and strong act, they are really just accepting that they are so poor at handling money that they pass over the responsibility to America instead, completely weak.",
