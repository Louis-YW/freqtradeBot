  "content": "Sourch img: m.bisnis.comThe food crisis has always been a hot topic of discussion. Because basically this also concerns how we survive and how to avoid crises that occur in the food sector. Of course there are many reasons behind why there is a food crisis, whether it's due to drastic climate change, crop failure, floods and natural disasters, war, hoarding by irresponsible parties, declining interest of young people in agriculture, and also increasingly narrow land. agriculture has turned into factories. or many other reasons.But I am currently curious about what is happening in each country regarding the current food crisis. Has it gotten better, gotten worse or hasn't there been any change?In the country where I work, the food crisis has really been resolved. everything is back to normal.Even though the food crisis is over but although food prices are still high and have not come back down. but the consumer's ability can still offset the increase that has occurred so that it can be said that in this country the food sector is under control and sufficient. and how about in your country?",

I used to think that if the food crisis in this country could be resolved or avoided then prices would gradually come back down. because food stocks from farmers and in the market are also abundant. but it seems it is not happening quickly. there has been a price drop. but not back to the price before the increase. so that it can be said that food prices are still high. although it has decreased slightly. but does not return to the previous low.but now I just realized that the sector that keeps all prices high is because the price of fuel oil is still high. and maybe this is the trigger for the still high food prices even though the food stocks in the market are abundant and far from lacking. Maybe farmers now have to use more capital to cultivate agriculture due to rising fuel prices.",

It is a country in Southeast Asia, after the war they were almost a country of poverty and daily food was a burden for every family. But with their reform policy that has helped them gradually become a developed country in many different fields, can someone check for me about Vietnam, the country I am talking about.However, looking at the general global context, we look back at what has happened to see the fact that everything repeats itself and it seems that people do not like a stable life, until some achievements are achieved. After all, they like chaos. I wonder if it's really human nature, envious competition, and greed that are driving us up and down, and it's like evolution and degeneration are intertwined in every stage.",

Sure at first it was because of Covid and then the supply constraints however lately there shouldn’t be any supply constraints and prices should of either leveled or declined a little.

I think this is the main problem that must be done by the government and related parties to carry out Disaster Mitigation to overcome the food crisis and provide assistance to those in need.Glad to hear that the food crisis has been resolved in your country as high food prices can still have a significant impact on people's lives, in my opinion here It is important to continue working towards a sustainable and accessible food system that can support everyone, regardless of their financial ability and inequality economy.Apart from that  in my opinion, related parties are trying to address the root causes of food insecurity, such as climate change in the event that there is a need for Mitigation efforts and must be started now it can be in the form of steps such as improvement of irrigation infrastructure in the form of construction of dams, irrigation channels that are standard both primary and secondary channels so that the distribution of water to farmers is fair when farming.On the other hand, efforts to increase investment in sustainable agriculture are deemed necessary, such as providing financial support to farmers, improving food distribution networks, and promoting education and training in agriculture. Thus creating a healthier and more resilient food system for everyone.Quote from: Jatiluhung on April 29, 2023, 03:30:00 AMbut now I just realized that the sector that keeps all prices high is because the price of fuel oil is still high. and maybe this is the trigger for the still high food prices even though the food stocks in the market are abundant and far from lacking. Maybe farmers now have to use more capital to cultivate agriculture due to rising fuel prices.Exactly, this is a valid point to consider indirectly. The price of fuel oil has a significant impact on the production and transportation of agricultural products, which in turn affects food prices. the correlations are mutually reinforcing As the cost of fuel increases, farmers have to spend more money to buy fuel for machinery and transportation. This resulted in an increase in production costs borne by consumers. In addition, transportation costs also rise, leading to higher prices in the market. Therefore, the current high fuel prices are important for the government to address in order to maintain food price stability and support the agricultural sector.",

Just as where you are, prices where I'm staying have also increased and that's due to the inflation.

Ukraine has some agricultural exports as well but they're not as big as Russia. When the war broke out, there were legitimate concerns for food shortages because the supply chains still weren't completely recovered after the COVID-19 stall. Famine affects poor countries the worst, as the richer countries can use government funds to subsidize food. They'll end up paying a bit more for everything, but no one's going to starve.Most of all that's subsided anyways.",

However, the quality is debatable, but at least, the poor can still eat and the rich can buy organic foods. It's a win-win... Regarding war, it's so far beyond my country's border so it has no effect. Also if you think about it, every year is a crisis, I mean there are different problems affecting different countries and somehow we can prevail, and that's because of trading.

      "body": "A look at the problem of the food crisis, from Ukraine.I'll split the answer into 2 parts:1. Food crisis after a wild terrorist attack on the country.2. Food crisis, and the grain marketAnd so now in detail.1. Food crisis after a wild terrorist attack on the country.As you know, Russia's attack on Ukraine took place in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea and the occupation of part of the eastern regions.If you google and find a dynamic graph of changes in grain production for 2014-2022, there will be a lot of interesting things, but we will return to this a little later, but for now we use data for Ukraine.The regions of Ukraine that were hit by large-scale terrorist attacks were industrial (primarily) and agricultural. About 25% of Ukrainian agricultural products were grown in these territories. A terrorist country, in the best traditions of Nazism, that which it could not capture, simply destroyed. You can find a huge amount of photo and video materials of how Russian terrorists simply set fire to fields with grain in the summer of 2014.In the graph mentioned above, you will see a noticeable dip in production. A number of agricultural holdings were also destroyed. All this affected the provision of the domestic market with food products. In 2014-2015, it was noticeable by a decrease in the range of food products, and some price increases. But in 2015-2016, Ukraine was able to adapt, many agricultural holdings restored or even expanded their sown areas. The expansion went through the cultivation of new lands in the southern and western regions of Ukraine. Those. we have gone through this period quite \"simply\" without a noticeable deterioration in the situation on the country's markets. And without a noticeable DECREASE IN SUPPLY TO THE WORLD MARKET.2. 2022, Food crisis, and grain market, situation in UkraineAs you know, without stopping at the occupation of part of Ukraine, Russia launched a global attack on Ukraine in 2022, with the official goal of DESTROYING my country.From March to June 2022, approximately 25% of my country was occupied in total. The capture did not take place by seizing the authorities, but by a total \"scorched earth\" approach, or \"everything that we cannot steal, we destroy.\" A huge number of key industrial enterprises were destroyed in the south / east of Ukraine, in the central and northern regions.In the south and east of Ukraine, elevators and warehouses full of grain stocks were seized. And here \"suddenly\" a \"global food crisis\" arose.It turned out that although Ukraine produces less grain than Russia, it produces more quality grain. You can read the standards, for example, of bread produced in Russia - there is full swing used forage grain, instead of grain of the highest and first grades. Deliveries from Ukraine have stopped, because. The main channel for the supply of grain to the world market was the Black Sea ports, which were either captured, or destroyed or mined.And here, in the world market, there was a huge shortage of grain. Plus, let me remind you - since 2019, China began to buy grain on a huge scale. Either he knew about COVID, or he knew about the new global terrorist war in Europe, or both, this is a question from another area.As you know, although Russia occupies a leading position in the area of sown areas, they have significantly lower yields, dependence on Western technologies and techniques (processing and harvesting), and, as I said earlier, most of the grain is not suitable for export.The year 2022 and their terrorist attack on Ukraine also disrupted their ability to both grow and supply grain to the world market. Russia found a \"solution\" quickly, and in its usual manner - STEAL GRAIN IN UKRAINE and sell it under the guise of its own. At the same time, the whole world knew, but decided to pretend that \"nothing happened\", it's not their grain, it's someone else's Let's go back to the chart I was talking about. If you look at it, then supplies to the world market stabilized just in 2018 (since 2014 there was a drawdown, but not significant). But in 2022, suddenly Russia suddenly increased the number of shipments to the grain market. Guess due to what? Or more precisely, it is more correct to ask - at the expense of WHOSE grain?Now we are slowly but surely clearing our land and fertile fields from the brown plague of rashism. We will have to work hard and hard to restore fields, farms, and agricultural companies. But we will do it, and we will give the world, as before, a lot of high-quality agricultural products. So the duration of the crisis is directly proportional to Russia's terrorist aggression against Ukraine. And the sooner the terrorist threat is destroyed, the sooner the world will be fed and will live stably!And another part of the food crisis is the manipulation of the oil market, which directly affects the cost of food production, logistics, etc.",

But, even in such conditions the food supply is still far higher than the demand. That's why I won't consider the high prices as food crisis in my country at this time.As a general perspective food crisis is something that can impact our lives in one way or other and it should be tackled on the global level in order for everyone to avoid the circumstances that we may face if this issue isn't solved. Many countries are going through a rough time where food is not available in abundance. If the problem is tacked on global level then those countries will have sufficient food supply. People won't have to face any problems if the food supply isn't limited but more than enough to fulfill their needs.Food crisis is something for those people who can not afford to have enough to fulfill their basic needs. I feel very bad for them even they have access to food in their country, but due to poverty they can't purchase enough for their basic needs. And, these days poverty is really on rise, I have seen families who really work hard but still are not able to fulfil their basic food requirements.
