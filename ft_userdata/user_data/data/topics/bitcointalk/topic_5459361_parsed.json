  "content": "it's a complete scam. they are thiefs.I was able to make a first withdrawal of money without problems, but as soon as I started to earn some money, the other two withdrawals I made have been blocked for more than 15 days, saying that it was a problem with Binance when it was obviously their problem. finally, after acknowledging that they won't let me withdraw, they ask me for a verification of authentic madness, asking me for documents and surreal photos. I send them absolutely everything they ask for and they keep asking for more and more without end. For example, they have asked me for an invoice for the last month with my ID on it, and now they tell me no, that the proof of address has to be from the last 3 days, not enough being within the last month.Obviously they have also blocked my bets. that is to say, I cannot bet or withdraw, and they ask me for infinite documents for verification when I have sent them absolutely everything.authentic scam. run away from this place THIEVES",

Did you know that you can send money to scammers and the scammers will let you think the business they offered you is real and make you profit and send you the profit. Sometimes scammers will think the victim will send more money after testing their fake service out. Although, that gambling site is not fake, it has license from Curacao, but not having good reviews. Next time if you want to join a gambling site that you do not know how legit it is, ask the question on the gambling board on this forum and you will see good answers.As for the site, it is not worthy to be used because their customers have bad reviews against them.",

Also reputation and user review of this site isn't satisfactory so try to research a little bit before choosing your desired platform.There are many well known and long time trustworthy gambling sites in this forum with their official account. You can say Stake.Com, Duelbits, Rollbit , TrustDice and many more. They can no controversy and even someone face problem they can reach to a solution by discussing with forum representative. Always choose most secured, reputated Gambling sites and try to stay far from newly launched sites or from unbelievable offers.",

The site GG.Bet has been tagged by the users of Trustpilot as a scam because out of 1,087 total reviews almost 47% of people have rated the site with 1 stars and that show clearly that the site isn't doing any good type of business, and they are following fraudulent activities. Here is another scam accusation against time site from 2018 in which they have done same type of scam with a user who later reported their scam on the forum. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4815179.0It's always better to read some reviews about a site before starting your gambling with that particular site which can later turn out to be a scam. It is now almost confirmed that gg.bet is a scam site and anyone who deposits money on that site could end up losing their money without any advance notification.",

The rank of the accuser doesn't mean much and it doesn't change anything. What matters are the proofs and evidences presented to support the accusation.OP didn't provide any evidence to support his claims, not even a screenshot for his conversation with the customer support. I strongly advice him and any other member who wants to make an accusation to follow the proper format.",

They are using their unclear TOS against players. I have not seen their Trust pilot score before today. It does not make sense when a casino asks for a document that is less than three days old. A player cannot collect documents every three days; they may ask. Is it written on their TOS that users must provide documents less than three days old? If not, they cannot force players. If yes, it's still shady. Basically, they are forcing users on the hard way to verify KYC.",

OP sounds funny you know but the truth be told, such casinos are just nothing nut scammers looking for ways to drain gamblers fund. I believe they were very confused when they saw your continuous winning and could not hold anything against you rather than demanding for kyc as a way to delay your payment and possibly nail you when you become furious with them. I think you should be patient with them while giving them a benefit of doubt and allowing them to exhaust all opportunities they have before actions against them.While waiting for them, it would be nice you present verifiable proof to back your claims OP because that alone would help members to speak on your behalf in resolving the issues otherwise nobody would take your complaint serious when there is no evidence to prove you had a deal with the casino you accuse.",

What I am yet to understand is that most of these accounts as newbies are likely established members here that do not want their identity to be revealed who have engaged with these new casinos thinking it would be as they have planned but it turned out to not be as they had thought.",
