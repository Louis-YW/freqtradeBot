  "content": "There are three most watched and elaborate movie sub-genre in the world today and these sub-genres are derivative of a larger genre, \"Fiction\". The sub-genres are post apocalyptic WW3 fiction, post apocalyptic pandemic (zombie incursion) fiction, and post apocalyptic AI invasion fiction.To a limit, I do fancy all of these aforementioned, there's a chance that these fictions are telling the possibility of a frightening future.   IT IS NOT SO IMPOSSIBLE ANYMORE THAT WE MAY BE EXPERIENCING ONE OR ALL OF THE AFOREMENTIONED BEFORE THE END OF THE 21ST CENTURY. Chat GPT is an interesting innovation for the ordinary minds. But for individuals like myself, that crap is damn scary and anti-educationist!Humans necessarily don't need such level of mental escape, as this generation and the ones after may be bred into absolute mental and psychological handicaps. By that I mean, gross morons and blockheads who may not be able to express themselves even to their fellow friends, on texts because an AI will do it for them. Not to talk of writing an essay, article, an application or  an official email. To crown it all, we now have some members generating threads and discussion through AI chat GPT  but am impressed of the resentment of by some campaign managers by preventing AI domination in their campaigns among participants which is something I think every educationist should replicate.Surprisingly, the whole defense to this gradual human limitation by proponent of this AI chatbot is that it makes life easier and simpler. What a weak defense it pose!https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/",

      "body": "One thing that I have noticed with ChatGPT is that it allows you to explore various fields in which you couldn't excel without a mentor.For example, a non-programmer would never be able to code out their idea and now with the help of AI, they can surely understand how things are done.Not saying they will be able to deploy it with the help of AI however it provides you with a complete roadmap to your final goal.On the other hand, AI like Midjourney is going crazy with unlimited ideas and imaginations being converted into reality.I have seen enough when I saw a Santa wearing US military uniform and carrying a RPG lol.Overall, I am really positive towards AI.",

With every passing subjects, these AI bots become smarter, and don't think that the consequences would be evaded. We see loss of human jobs and a systemic inclusion of Ai in decision making and analytics. I love the idea, but it seems more like a cheat code to the complexities we as humans are exposed to at a time. No doubt tech is advancing fast, but we should remember that if AI should take away human jobs, enough time would be spent fighting and quarrelling and this could result in WW3.",

      "body": "People are more skeptical about chatGPT now, but I don't think they are scary for humans. They are meant to help humans and with the right use of Ai we actually can get profited from them. For example, if you want to make a good article first you have to know how to give the right input to chatGPT so that it can make you a great article outline for you. If you don't know how to get the best out of chatGPT you will fall behind others who can. But chatGPT or Ai does have so much data to work with that scares me, because no human brain can not hold that amount of information at a time.",

What a weak defense it pose!Every technology or invention that has been created has both positives and negatives of its own, now it depends on an individual or simply the world how they will use it. ChatGPT is a great invention, it helps you do a lot of things that you may have always wanted to do but couldn't do for any reason that you may have, and it needs to be used for positive things.A student having access to ChatGPT can use it to learn things that they find difficult with examples and everything, but if instead, they use it only to find direct answers or use it to write their homework and enjoy other things themselves, I don't think that the technology is to be blamed for things like that.From what I have seen, ChatGPT is actually a convenient tool to workers especially if you don't have the knowledge and idea on how to construct an informative statements that are based on facts. My experience to it is that I don't know how to construct a sentence to an formal email to my coworker, then my sister introduced the ChatGPT and guide my to use it like \"Can you make an formal email about something?\" then it just dropped a whole email message that are actually formal. Still I used it as reference since I'd want to make it on my own words.But for students, I agree that it might causes them to not take education seriously as they can rely on the information that ChatGPT gives. It's helpful to study still let's be real here that some of them might use it to their assignments, task and projects which is from AI not from them so in short their professor might give a grade to an AI instead to the student. Its helpful but it depends on the users of the technology if they only rely on it without absorbing knowledge.",
