The prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other coins fell steeply in aftermath of FTX’s shutdown.",

If they continue at this pace, then in less than two years some, if not most, platforms will disappear.I do not know whether the financial position of this platform is so bad that any regulatory decisions lead to their closure, or is there a problem with the structure of the work of these platforms? I think that one of the most important problems is the lack of guarantee of clients' money or the lack of separation between their money and the developers so that the money is spent for their personal interests.",

I don't remember if there is a law regarding those things when they do an ICO, but it seems like SEC is going all the way to make sure they can milk exchanges dry. Kinda hard to guess what's their goal other than enforcing more control and making sure they can gatekeep any US crypto business in the future. CMIIW.",

If cryptocurrencies had no future, then this process would be more peaceful. Howey Test from 1946 does not correspond to current realities and therefore any issuer of coins, tokens, stablecoins can be charged and fined. The BUSD ban is a prime example of arbitrariness in the US.QuotePaxos Trust Company, the firm behind Binance’s stablecoin, was unable to administer the token in a “safe and sound” manner, a spokesperson for New York’s chief financial regulator told Reuters on Monday.The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which has ordered Paxos to stop issuing Binance USD, found that Paxos “violated its obligation to conduct tailored, periodic risk assessments and due diligence refreshes of Binance and Paxos-issued BUSD customers to prevent bad actors from using the platform,” the NYDFS spokesperson said via email.

So obviously they are the next exchange that they are going after, and it's a big fish. I'm not seeing Coinbase though going without a fight here like Beaxy Digital Ltd.

Binance, which has said it was disappointed by the suit and would continue to work with the regulator, isn’t supposed to have Americans trading on its global exchange under the regulator’s rules.On Thursday, Behnam said that the operator of the world’s biggest crypto exchange had intentionally broken CFTC rules. If you are going to offer futures contracts in the US, there is a clear understanding that you are registered with the CFTC and comply by the law, he added.The CFTC is just one of several US bodies that have been investigating Binance’s activities. The Internal Revenue Service, as well as federal prosecutors, have been examining Binance’s compliance with anti-money laundering obligations, Bloomberg News has reported. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been scrutinizing whether the exchange has supported the trading of unregistered securities.\"___Binance has very big problems, because the SEC and the CFTC are working against the exchange.
