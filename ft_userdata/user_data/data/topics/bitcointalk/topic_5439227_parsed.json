  "content": "What I have said in the title. Selling bitcointalk account is allowed here? Yes, we all don't like the seller, Once they make a bitcointalk account selling post, we create a scam accusation or tag him instantly. But I wonder if it's not allowed here, why do moderators not delete their selling posts?¬† Where it's directly related to the bitcointalk itself. I know mod does not moderate scams. But account selling is directly related to bitcointalk. So should not be the selling post deleted (if it's not allowed)? For example, user AccountsLegend recently made an account selling post here , I curiously visit his account and see out of 17 topics that he made 16 topics are about selling bitcointalk account. People tagged them, but the post and his other contact address are still there.So if it's allowed then ok, just ignore this topic. But if it's really not allowed, I think those topics should be deleted as spam posts get deleted.",

At least for me.For this very case: https://ninjastic.space/search?content=%22selling+accounts%22+%2Ballowed+%2BbitcointalkPlus, it's also part of forum's (unofficial) rules (point 18).",

In regulation number (18) I take a concrete example that reads.Prohibited recreation rules:\"Swimming in the lake is allowed, but it is not recommended to swim in the lake‚ÄùMeaning: If anyone is determined to swim in the lake then do it at their own risk, because without us realizing it and seeing that in the lake there are many crocodiles, snakes, blondes and so on, it is very possible that it can harm the swimmers themselves.Back to rule (18).Quote18. Having multiple accounts and account sales are allowed, but account sales are discouraged.I'm quoting the sign (,) hereQuotebut account sales are discouraged.Point: if someone still insists on selling the account, if one day it will be known, of course there is a risk that both the buyer and the seller accept.Conclusion:Mod, can't prevent users from selling accounts, buyers should be aware, if they buy a high-risk account, chances are the account can no longer be used, with various reasons to be marked red paint.The risk of loss is greater on the part of the buyer.",

It's not Mods who have a say in this it's Theymos and the last time he touched this subject (as far as I know) his opinion was that even if we would attempt to cut on these kinds of trading happening on the forum they will just move over in private deals, so, there you have it. And from the number of accounts we run into every day that have changed from speaking perfect English over a long break of a few years to being active only on local sub-forums, I'm pretty sure a lot of them those deals are indeed not happening through opened topics.Besides, when you say these harm Bitcointalk directly, so do HYIP schemes as obviously it's going to be forum members who get tricked but we still have a section full of them.",

No one really knows what accounts that were sold violated because buyers usually don't do due diligence, and some of them get banned for plagiarism.Account sales are allowed; but it is not liked because of the many cases of fraud and hacking of accounts that are sold. Besides, most of those accounts will only be used to increase spam on the forum, [obviously not liked by the community]. Whether bitcointalk is detrimental or not really depends on what the purpose of using the account is, but whatever reason, many furum members, especially DT, don't like this movement.",

There are minor differences in terms of restrictions on creating posts and photos, which can be bypassed by purchasing a copper membership or contributing some effective posts and a little waiting.Therefore, most of those who want to buy accounts are either to participate in signature campaigns or any activity that generates income for them because of the membership of those accounts.When you buy an account, you will not be banned, but you will get a negative trust that prevents you from making income with the account.As for the ownership of the posts, it is not for the forum but for the individual.

(Please someone correct me or give topic ID I cant remember it)I can't remember if this has happened before, but I haven't come across a case like this in the last few months or I may have missed it.Ban should still be possible because the account did something against the rules if done before the hack. It's a different matter if the hacker commits plagiarism so that the account is banned, while the main owner who succeeds in proving ownership of the account also succeeds in convincing the moderator that the plagiarism was carried out by the hacker, not him. In cases like this, the owner deserves unbanned and his account back.hugeblack, after some searching, I haven't found the thread you are referring to.",
