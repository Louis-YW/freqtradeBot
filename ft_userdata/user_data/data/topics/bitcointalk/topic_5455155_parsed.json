  "content": "Long story short: Timelord2067 (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=131361) tagged me red without any reason.1) This infamous and lying person accused me and Alterra57 of investing in Ponzi and of being the same person.2) He  did not open a scam accusation on the appropriate board: to avoid being contradicted he opened a self moderated topic in the lending section (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5446327.msg62330423#msg62330423).3) All his theses have been denied directly by other users who have opposed the flag ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5157698.msg62352496#msg62352496)4) Every time I replied to his post, posting evidence that he was wrong, he obviously deleted the messages.I write this post in order to defend my integrity and my honor in this section of the forum, because it is here that I have found so many kind and helpful people. And I did the same, always honoring my debts.These are the screenshots of the messages we exchanged with Alterra regarding the loans he granted me, confirming that we are two different users.Instead, this is the confirmation that the coward continues to delete the messages where I post the evidence that he is wrong, because he doesn't want to admit he was wrong.",

      "body": "It´s a bit scary with people that ain't big enough to admit when they are wrong and apologize.It that really your goal Timelord? To make people abandoned their account even that they haven´t done anything of what your accusing them for?Whats your end goal here? To be alone on the forum? Satoshi created this forum for everyone!First I think your goal was to have a scam free forum, but after look it up a bit more i am shocked of your behaviour.Please stop to harass people like this, its not nice in anyway! And it´s not cool to act like this in an anonymous forum.Why cant we all just be good to each other???And yes maybe I haven´t been here on the forum for a long time, but I am old enough to know how humans should behave to each other.",

      "body": "First, move this topic to the Reputation board, it belongs there, not here. It will also be more visible to a larger number of members there, many do not come to the Lending board. Likewise, the thread opened by Timelord does not belong here, but in the reputation section.Next, There is no need to enlarge fonts, it will not increase the importance of the whole thing. It is perfectly fine to use the default forum font size.Also, if you can reduce the size of the images you posted it would be much more pleasing to the eye. Instead of Code:[img] tag, just add Code:[img height=xxx width=xxx]So for example your images can be shown asCode:[img height=1000 width=460]https://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/06/05/wsd3m.png[/img][img height=1000 width=460]https://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/06/05/wsXS1.png[/img]",
