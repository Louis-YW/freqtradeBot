So we might see the first Spot ETF in the U.S soon[2][1] https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1696532002189857272?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet[2] https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/29/first-bitcoin-etf-could-be-coming-soon-as-court-rules-in-favor-of-grayscale-over-sec.html",

If it breaks above $29k, we might see a bigger leg up as it will be breaking the resistance trendline which its holding for some time now. I am quite sure that this pump will continue now. Glad I opened a long trade on BTCUSD yesterday as my system gave me a call.",

Perhaps I am being a bit too pessimistic but when it comes to Bitcoin ETFs we have had too many disappointments in the past. I don't think they have any other reason to reject or delay it now as to do that they must have to come up with some solid proof but according to there own words: Quote“The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale’s proposed bitcoin ETP,” Means they need something solid as metal to delay these ETFs. I am also not a lawyer but if SEC wants to delay or reject the case then they need proof otherwise the news just paved way for other agencies.",

Lots of different players are waiting for this kind of product to come in.This is will make buying bitcoin a lot easier and more secure (in some people perspectives)I believe an ETF launch in US can trigger a bull run",

Right now bitcoin still needs to perform very well, probably back to 29k if possible before the monthly close, or else all this won't stop more bleeding coming for Bitcoin in September. The month of September could also be one of the best times to invest in Bitcoin, I think this month we will slowly start to recover.",

I believe this will pave way for smooth sailing for other spot ETF applications that have been piled on SEC chairman's desk.This is really good news and I'm glad for the climb to the price of Bitcoin and I feel this would be a good way to end the month of August if it's prices continues on this up trend",

      "body": "Hey don't be in hurry guys.It is not a win to convert the fund to a Spot ETF. They just ruled Grayscale's petition for review be granted & the commission's order be vacatedIt’s only won the right to apply and the SEC can of course reject itAnd it won't happen in 2023.QuoteCLARIFICATION NEEDED 🚨:  While Grayscale's legal victory is a momentous event in the ongoing battle between the crypto industry and the SEC, it does NOT guarantee the approval of a #BTC Bitcoin spot ETF. The court ordered the SEC to review Grayscale's previously rejected application. That's it.It does NOT automatically result in a conversion to a spot ETF.👇The decision has illuminated the SEC's inconsistent policy approach, compelling a mandatory review of Grayscale's application. While the decision appears to be indicative of a positive step toward broader institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, the SEC still retains the latitude to deny the application under different grounds. There are still alot of uncertainties and NO guarantees. Grayscale's win is a step forward, but it is not the final word on the subject.https://twitter.com/Invst_Informant/status/1696543653915705505",
