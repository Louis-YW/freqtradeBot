  "content": "Russia: Supreme Court Bans “LGBT Movement” as “Extremist”Source: https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/30/russia-supreme-court-bans-lgbt-movement-extremistQuote(Berlin) – Russia’s Supreme Court ruled today that the “international LGBT movement” is an “extremist organization,” jeopardizing all forms of LGBT rights activism in the country, Human Rights Watch said today. In a closed hearing, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Justice Ministry’s lawsuit accusing the “LGBT movement” of inciting social and religious discord. Russian authorities should immediately end this perverse persecution of LGBT people and concerned countries should support LGBT people and their advocates facing extreme risks and persecution in Russia.“The authorities’ move apparently serves a dual purpose,” said Tanya Lokshina, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “It is meant to increase the scapegoating of LGBT people to appeal to the Kremlin’s conservative supporters before the March 2024 presidential vote and to paralyze the work of rights groups countering discrimination and supporting LGBT people.”Since I have yet to see a dedicated thread about this matter, I have decided to open one myself. We all are aware of the aggressive policies the Kremlin has applied in Russia when comes to their citizens who happen to be LGBTQ as well. When we are surrounded with news about Gaza, Israel and Ukraine is easy to overlook these kinds of domestic events going on in Russia. What do you think about this new scalation by the Kremlin against an already marginalized and stigmatized community in Russia? Do you agree with it, do you disagree with it? Would would expect more people from Russia to apply for refuge status in your country?  Let us discuss and please let us also be civilized and do not call for violence against any group, regardless of your personal opinion. Thanks.",

Anyway, Russia is one of worst places to be part of LGBT community as majority opinion about is very negative here. And at the same time it's very strange that Moscow or St Peterburg is full of gay clubs...Currently in Russia there is trend that if someone isn't supporting Putin's policy, war in Ukraine and, declare them as enemy. Like calling them as extremist organization or if people have different opinion, declare them as \"forgeign agent\". And they're doing it without having any proofs that this person, media or organization is getting funding from foreign country.I doubt that we will have many refugees from Russia in my country because of it. And I don't really want to see more Russians coming to my country as we have already have more than enough local z-patriots. Anyway, we have one simple question to understand who is good Russian or not - just ask them \"Whose is Crimea?\".",

Ruzzia is quite broken if they need to resort to this type of shit to justify themselves before their people.As far as I understand, when the Wagner group operated and was under the control of the Kremlin, they were the one who attended to the Russian prisons and offered a deal to those with kinda long sentences: to join the war in exchange of their freedom, assuming they managed to survive in the frontline. We would be talking about common criminals, murderers, thieves, etc. The situation would be different with those imprisoned because their sexuality. Wagner is not more the armed mercenary group of choice of Putin and my guess would be that those in the Russian army would rather physically and mentally torture a peson who is not heterosexual, rather than being willing to convince them to fight for the same Country which procecuted them. A thief can assume part of his punishment and understand he did something wrong and can earn back his freedom somehow, even by becoming a mercenary. On the other hand a person whose only crime was not being straight won't have the same perspective of their situation.",

If the core values of most Russians, are against LGBT, then it's better that gays in that country, to move to other countries that are LGBT friendly. Personally I'm against LGBT, because I think that it's unnatural and should be discouraged, sometimes I wonder that what if people begins to have carnal knowledge with their pets, in the name that it's their sexual preference, will the society applaud them? So what I'm saying in essence is that in a democracy, let the will of the people prevail, if the majority embraces gay rights, then it's all good, if not, the let the gay LGBT community respect the wish of the majority by relocating to many LGBT friendly countries. My apology if I offend anybody by my personal opinion, at least I have a right to it.",

Leaving that to one side, it is quite obvious most of the American population is heterosexual.You may have gotten that incorrect perception from the way news and stories are handled on social media, where that movement indeed seems to take the spotlight, for the sake of pushing political ideals from certain media corporations and parties. I don't even know whether one could find a country where LGBT people are the majority, instead a minority, by the way.",

We all have the liberty to do whatsoever we like but we should also know that a day of judgement will be right before us in time to come.

They are everywhere they brainwash our kids in their school by teaching about them and in the company where I work I receive dozens of event related to PRIDE every week I had to put them in spam list and discussions about their rights happens at corporate level where they are utmost safe but still their ideology is drilled down our brain.
