  "content": "So, the recent update at BC GAME.They will force you to take the deposit bonus, there is no option to cancel it. Once your deposit is bigger than 30$ it will instantly lock you with a 40x wager on slots or 120x on house games or 800x on live dealer.Because I didn't want the deposit bonus I chose to make 2 x under 30$ deposits and play without rules.I made 57.5$ and tried to withdraw.Keep in mind they added a new system that says you must wager your deposit 1x - okay, understandable anti-money laundering right?But I had wagered my deposit around 10x at the point of withdraw request and the system still says I can't withdraw.So about after 30 minutes waiting for a support answer they tell me to wait 2 hours for the wager to be updated. Can't get more predatory than this, looool?!I wait about 30 more minutes.So here's where I lose my patience and just play a bit, after losing a bit was down to 40$. Decided to do an all in buy for 40$.Thank fuck I have everything on recording, they would try to deny everything otherwise. What they would usually do on a case like this is to say the buy was 0x and tell you to piss off. You can clearly see that after I bought the bonus I had an instant error and the free spins never played out. Try proving that without a recording.VID1 - Start of the bonus buy: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yeCbuP3ArWdBeKFsfmXeZZudn5rcBPid/VID2 - Support conversation, transactions and refresh of the game: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iNUQo2ntZb1qG8g8F76foKwTdKXhJD0h/You be the judge of this.",

Part of it has to go with users fault with losing their patience but casinos should have a fast withdrawal system. Most of the reputed casino's has fast auto withdrawal system so always use those sites rather than ones that makes you lose you patience.",

Judging from the video, there was indeed issue with your bonus buy/free spins round. The game hasn't allowed you to play the free spins which you bought. However, the live support agent won't be able to resolve such issues. You should send an email to support@BC.GAME to get a better response.Seems like you have a lack of patience. You have made the deposits today, and didn’t try to get help from email support after facing the issue. Have you even asked the live support agent about your issue for the second time? It would have been better to reach the email support first instead of creating this thread.",

Many of them find it easy to keep going even though they are not well managed in bull markets because even a fool can make money then.",

It's unfortunate that you didn't get to watch the result of the bonus play out. Win or lose, seeing it happen is a big part of the experience. We aren't in control of the performance of third party games but a report has been sent to the game provider along with your screen capture. Seeing as how your balance was updated from 0.09 to 0.11 shows that your bonus buy was not profitable. Furthermore, the small win that that you can see on payline #8 where you hit three 10's would only credit to your balance upon completion of the game round. Croco is a small game development studio and they are very receptive of criticism so I am sure they will be looking into if this is a common bug or a one off glitch.That being said, we aim to provide a high quality igaming experience. When a third party game interferes with that goal, depending on the circumstances of course, we will do what we can to remedy the situation. Send me a DM with your UID and I will refund your $40.",
