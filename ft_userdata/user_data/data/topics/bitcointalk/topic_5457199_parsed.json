The fact that HOLD has to watch the news makes me quite skeptical about how to approach the market, because it is not in my mind, when the market phase is in a bear cycle, the study of crypto accumulation will be my interest. If you choose, instead of making money in the short term, build a long-term plan to prepare for the next price rally, and of course it will take time, money, health,... The recent price response has made many people turn themselves into machines for the market to control.",

Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21million and the large part of 92%+ generated could be liquid and we should consider We were around the bottom for a while now and bitcoin's price has just crossed the 30K mark again. The main strategy for this time is to accumulate during the dips and keep your coins safe. I personally treat cryptos as stocks, there mostly are no dividends but the probability of yield on investment are higher. Anyone buying bitcoin around 20K already have a 50% profit today.",

Now make a choice whether to invest right now, having beliefs that the market value would continue increasing, or to wait for things to fall in order to invest more. Eitherway would give you a chance to make profit fron investing into this industry. However you have options to diversify your funds to different tokens in this industry. Investing into one bucket, as we all know, won't be advisable. There are other options to choose from given tgat all tokens has its own potential.

Would be hard to determine especially as early as it is in the present. Rejection in $31k may still take place but it also has the tendency to breakthrough especially if buyers would support such market price movement. On my end, I'd choose waiting 'til the ideal market value on my end  shows. There's no need to rush in the first place, so better wait for trend to be more obvious.",

It all depends on the goals that an investor wants to achieve and of course also how much time you have to keep track of the market movements, the rumors and the news and also social Media. If you don't want to invest a lot of time, then buying and hodling is the best strategy in my opinion. If you want maximum possible profits, then you need to trade actively, but then you can also lose money more easily.",

Even me, if I have some assets on an exchange, I will instantly decide to withdraw that and put it into my wallet as a safety precaution of what might happen next. Everyone are just scared that they might be a victim, just like what happened to those who are affected on the FTX scandal before. The volatility is always there and always be, the FUDs like these are just one of the factors that is boosting that volatility.",

The development will always need process as well as the adoption by ordinary people. Bitcoin investors shall not always change their strategy. Just stick with bitcoin for long term is profible for their portfolio. Since the bitcoin supply is already limited and i don't care so much about the increase of supply of illiquid btc.

I do not get it, why do people want to risk it and get some small altcoin that has a \"potential\" that might crash, when bitcoin is great and you could invest and you know what to expect from it. It's just a strategy if I see it, maybe those who do it have a special assumption that there is a potential profit from the stability of BTC and the growth of certain altcoins. By relying on BTC and allocating a fraction to altcoins, they can mitigate the risks associated with the speculative nature of crypto investments.Quote from: el kaka22 on June 22, 2023, 04:06:15 PMIt will never be a problem on the long run and we should keep investing into it.

This can be seen from the track record and trust of many investors who have strengthened their position as a reliable asset. By contrast, investing in smaller altcoins carries higher risk, as their growth potential is often accompanied by greater volatility and a higher probability of a price crash.",

Any investor in Bitcoin must be aware from the start that this is one of the most risky investments (in the short term at least) and that the price movement is very volatile.What is happening with the Binance and Coinbase platforms recently is very healthy and has contributed to raising awareness of the need to deal cautiously with centralized platforms and learn to deal with private wallets.",
