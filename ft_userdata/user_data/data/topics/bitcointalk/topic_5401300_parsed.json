  "content": "I am not sure if this is the appropriate board to post this. But I am posting it here.I know I am not eligible for any signature campaign. But I am interested to know a few things. Because I saw a few signature participants (1xbit) got tagged because they promoted scam websites. I think this topic will be helpful for other new members too.How much do you care about the signature that you are wearing? There are a lot of platforms promoting their business. But, Not all of them are legit. There are some scam casinos like 1xbet. But, There are a lot of bounty campaigns that offer signature campaigns. But, half of them (even more) end up scamming their participants.Do you research before Apply?Do you research the platform background, or do you examine its legitimacy? I am asking this because I never played on 1xBit, and I didn't get scammed by them. Before joining their platform or signature campaign, I wouldn't know they were scammers. Not only 1xBit. What about other platforms? For example, if A new casino platform offers signature campaigns, Or an exchanger offers a signature campaign, Would you join their campaign without researching their platform? If you investigate any platform, What is the process? How do you check if they are good or bad?Do you feel like they hired you?When they accept your application, and you wear their signature, Do you feel like they hired you? If it sounds like a non-sense question, Here is why I am asking this: I noticed some 1xbit participants trying to defend their platform. Even there are no requirement on the campaign. I saw Chip-mixer participants doing discussion on Chip-mixer thread and most of them are Chip-Mixer Signature participants. That's all.",

      "body": "I'm also not yet joined any campaign, but I have thinking about this matter.I will do research before I will join the campaign because I wouldn't want to promote scam project, hence I got paid by them it's like I got an illegal money since they're scamming other people. For me it's just unethical to get an illegal money, but some people wouldn't think about it. Money is money, no matter what it's come from, as long as they can earn, they will do it.I agree with mk4 it's a sponsorship rather than being hired, you're not worked for them to defend their sites. It's a paid shills where they're don't care with anything and just protect their project even though the project is scam. The reason why in Chipmixer thread has a lot reply of Chipmixer participants, because they're before joining already research about the project and familiar about it, or even often use it. They're different with bumping shills, I guess you know the difference between shitpost and constructive post isn't?Many DT members will tag 1xbit participants because they're promoting scam, but honestly speaking, if joining a scam project didn't get tagged by DT members, I believe almost all users will promoting 1xbit since they have nothing to lose. The reason many users didn't join on 1xbit are they're worried to get tagged.theymos ever mistakenly promoted 1xbit on forum ads, read in this thread Question to theymos but he already removed it because he's agree this forum shouldn't promoting scam. Even we can freely promoting any project, but that doesn't we can promote anything without knowing the background of the project.Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5271782.msg55079759#msg55079759Removed. A service with this reputation should not have been allowed to advertise, but because the bidder was fairly established and had no negative trust, I didn't do enough research, and I missed the scam accusations and the other account. Apologies.Quote from: mk4 on June 04, 2022, 03:06:37 AMFirst I'd dig through Bitcointalk first, then do some Google searching. If the platform ends up being really new (hence literally no reviews but has a legitimate working product), I might consider joining if I wasn't in a campaign yet, but I'd leave the moment I see clear signs of fraud.Personally I will only search the project's reputation on this forum alone, since our signature mostly visible on this forum, not on google. Because there are some articles or public reviews e.g. trustpilot isn't really giving correct judgements. Take an example of Chipmixer reviews on trustpilot where there's only two users give their opinion, the old opinion is good and the latest opinion he said Chipmixer is scam due to poor support, if they're only rely on this review, they might worried to use Chipmixer.",

I would definitely check brand new casino/exchange signature campaign before joining. I even busted one brand new bitcoin signatures campaign that had some fishy things going (iirc it was some wallet and they copy/pasted their whole content and concept from another project) and that was hosted by a known manager so in case of a new campaign I would recommend to do proper due diligence and not to rely on manager to do it for you.Quote from: AnotherAlt on June 04, 2022, 02:59:46 AMWhen they accept your application, and you wear their signature, Do you feel like they hired you?

I saw Chip-mixer participants doing discussion on Chip-mixer thread and most of them are Chip-Mixer Signature participants. No matter how you feel, they did hire you. Then again, that doesn't mean that you have to defend them and no reputable signature campaign will ever ask that from people that they are wearing their signature. With that being said, people do tend to defend the business they are promoting (in case of a long term campaigns), but I think that has more to do with the fact that they are either using that service or it has good reputation on the forum rather than just because they are paid to wear their signature.",

This is the reason why doing your due diligence is critical before joining any campaign as you'll be getting negative trust when that platform goes south.Quote from: AnotherAlt on June 04, 2022, 02:59:46 AMDo you feel like they hired you?Yes, technically speaking! Because the manager extensively examines your account history before accepting it. It is crucial to note, however, that there is no actual agreement that you must actively discuss or advertise them in each and every post you make.A signature campaign is similar to product placement advertising in that the product is shown under the participant's profile through discussions in various sections of the forum without being explicitly stated. It's entirely voluntary.",

The first campaign I have back then last December 2017. They are doing well back then and their token was pumping like crazy before the great Bitcoin crash.I was too greedy that time so I only ended up cashing out $700 instead of more than $3,000 because well, greediness!!! Then I joined another signature campaign that lasted 12 weeks I think, but it was the greatest lesson I have learned in which I was not paid very well and their trading volume that time on LAToken really sucks. However, I had to move on and continue joining campaigns. Right now, I am in good hands with the current campaign that I have in which they are one of the longest paying signature campaigns ever.",

Certain Hero and Legendary member participating in some signature campaigns are far worse than some Member or even Jr.Member ranks. Yes, I know about the limits regarding signatures in terms of rank, this is probably the biggest obstacle why no one wants Members in campaigns, no colors in the signature and avatars are obviously not too interesting.Quote from: AnotherAlt on June 04, 2022, 02:59:46 AMHow much do you care about the signature that you are wearing?

But, half of them (even more) end up scamming their participants.I have never participated in any campaigns that paid in tokens/altcoins. Although there are some campaigns in which I wish I had not participated because they later proved to be something that turned into at least suspicious business - but it is a risk that exists with anything that any member promotes on the forum.Quote from: AnotherAlt on June 04, 2022, 02:59:46 AMDo you research the platform background, or do you examine its legitimacy? I am asking this because I never played on 1xBit, and I didn't get scammed by them. Before joining their platform or signature campaign, I wouldn't know they were scammers. Not only 1xBit. What about other platforms? For example, if A new casino platform offers signature campaigns, Or an exchanger offers a signature campaign, Would you join their campaign without researching their platform? If you investigate any platform, What is the process? How do you check if they are good or bad?Of course, it is only logical to research what you will promote, at least for someone who cares about the reputation on this forum - for those others who do not care, this approach is obviously completely meaningless. As for online casinos, those who have been in business for a long time also have a good reputation, and the problem is those new ones who have yet to earn their reputation. If you promote such a new casino you always risk that at some point it will turn into a scam, but that does not mean that you are a scammer.Quote from: AnotherAlt on June 04, 2022, 02:59:46 AMDo you feel like they hired you?When they accept your application, and you wear their signature, Do you feel like they hired you?

I saw Chip-mixer participants doing discussion on Chip-mixer thread and most of them are Chip-Mixer Signature participants. There is definitely a kind of business relationship between the one who participates in the signature campaign and the one who chose him to promote a service. There are terms and conditions that both parties accept and all campaigns rely more or less on similar rules or conditions. What may be strange to you is the fact that we used to think that participating in a signature campaign was primarily a privilege to promote what we believe in, and that the reward we receive is just a reward, and not a salary for some kind of full time job.Well of course the CM participants will discuss what they are advertising, we all aim to know what is happening at any given moment, and we are here to try to answer all the questions someone asks in that thread.",

The signature campaigns that I participated into can give you a brief background about the company. Mostly, signature campaigns have been started by gambling companies since their purpose is to advertise their online casino against hundreds to thousands of competitors in the market. If the campaign manager of the signature seems to be a trusted member, then there is no reason to doubt the campaign itself as the manager already did the work of background resarch.QuoteDo you feel like they hired you?Oh definitely! Once the campaign manager chooses you to be part of the campaign, you have this sense of responsibility to do your work and to achieve the weekly quota in order to receive payment.But in most cases, the reason behind the advertisement goes beyond the payment. Every time I participate in these campaigns, I feel like they gave me the opportunity and privilege to work under them- like the campaign manager reviewed my post history and checked that I am qualified to represent the campaign for the period. With this, I feel like they chose and hired me for this purpose, in which I do not take for granted.Unfortunately like you mentioned, people who applied in 1xbit campaigns are people who are just chasing around for payment. Everyone in that campaign consist of people having negative trust- like the campaign itself is plagued by spammers and untrusted people.",
