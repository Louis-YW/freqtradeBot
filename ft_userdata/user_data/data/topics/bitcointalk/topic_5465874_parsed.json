  "content": "Clickbait title? F*** Yeah pretty much!I've been reading about the new \"spam\" attack, about how the pool is again growing bigger and bigger how it's best to postpone transactions, how the fad that was supposed to die 3 months ago will die again and I was thinking how the whole narrative changed.Many here say Bitcoin is the liberator, it will bring the new world order, it will fight against the Cabal, it will dethrone the petrodollar, it will change the economy it will revolutionize everything, the system that is run right now by the evil occultist reptilians will be broken.But till that final fight, a bunch of jpg monkeys (ordinals) are clogging the mempool, making transactions more expensive, driving some into paranoia mode thinking this is a CIA operation, and all the while forgetting something, if Bitcoin can't deal with this kind of \"spam\" how could it possible deal with real usage on this level or what is needed for a global currency, 1000 x times more?So, from jokes to more serious things, there are a few issues here I keep seeing being brought up in denial mode:1) When the block reward is gone, miners will get paid from fee!Current fees are 3% in reward, you will need fees to be 30 times more expensive to give the miners the same revenue and offer in return the same level of protection.Before you even mention the rise in the price of coins, think twice, if the market cap of Bitcoin goes up 100 times but the hashrate stays the same, will the protection be also the same? Guarding a market with 500 billion market cap with 3 million machines worth an average 2000 is one thing, protecting a 10 trillion one with the same hashrate stops being that secure, isn't it?Bottom line for point 1, if you ever said the network will run from fees, prepare to pay those fees!2) The immense cost of hosting a node if we double or triple the block size:In 2009 Â the cheapest hdd was priced at $0.09 per GB, right now the price is $0.0125. <added $ sign!Maybe paying $100 dollars extra for a node that would still hold the blockchain for the next 4 years even with blocks 4 times as big won't be that much trouble if you plan on dethroning the banking system, just saying.3) The lighting network dilemmaWhile the LN keeps \"growing\", it's also stalling. If you look from a BTC standpoint yeah, everything is fine, but LN was supposed to be for fast payments, moving instantly value, so the true metric here should be represented in the value locked, and if we look from the $ perspective (orange line) we're well below 2021 levels!!!!I've always heard, high fees will drive people to LN, not really that trueAnd guess what, from doing 20-40k tx a day, Doge has again spiked to 100k in the last 24 hours.Of course, coincidence, right?So, with these in mind, I do wonder what next and if there is actually a plan or if we go- 1btc=1btc who cares about moving that BTC at all- the having will be here, everything will be fine- Bitcoin was never about being a currency, is about moarr returns/rant over, beachtime and michelada for me.",

      "body": "Some people are here with the purpose of making money out of BTC, ALTs or NFTs etc. From anything directly or indirectly related to BTC while they have hell lot of money in there banks at the same time. They are money maker. They do not care about spamming the BTC blockchain with Ordinals shit instead they only are here to make money out of it. There have already been many discussions on the topic of \"Bad Impact of Ordinals on BTC blockchain\".People made millions dollars from ordinals and that created FOMO among other people too. So now they are also investing in Ordinals. And since then numbers are still increasing. Point is, this ordinal problem helped many people to make hell lot of money that if they have to pay high fee (the problem of high fee in your first point) In future then they might not hesitate to pay. Because they could bear it. While the middle class users/merchants have already gave up on using the BTC as payment method. I read 2 or 3 topics in which OP announced the removal of BTC as payment method. So definitely they will go after easier one like Doge (which is a coin and also in hype).",

And the fees are not painful enough to force people to start looking at LN. 10-15 sat/vB is not that much right now. If the minimum fee will consistently be $5 or more, than LN will start looking more attractive.LN can justify $50 on chain fees, because they will be like a fee for opening and maintaining a payment card with instant zero fee transactions. If the channel will last for a year or two, that's not a bad deal. But the worst possible scenario is low Bitcoin adoption with low on-chain activity and as the result low fee rewards in blocks - together with halvenings it would indeed knock a lot of miners out of the game and make the network less protected. Our last line of defense will be treating low confirmation counts as unreliable. If right now 1-3 confs is enough, 10-20 might become the new default requirement.",
