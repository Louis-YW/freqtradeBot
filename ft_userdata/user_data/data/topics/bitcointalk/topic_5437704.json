The upcoming update will only increase the credibility of the ethereum network and this coin. If validators get the opportunity to manage their coins again, this does not mean that they will begin to sell them in bulk. Perhaps for some time we will get such a short-term effect, based on the fact that in some of them unforeseen expenses could arise during this time, but in general, such an update will only benefit the survivability of this network.",

At first, as regular human being//noob me, I was like...there's gonna be a HUGE dump. I just got back from long hiatus in crypto after the 2020  5k dive and reading the news about this ETH Shanghai makes me really think what's the next move for me.Then when I read Fundamentals Of reply, I was like...yes, this makes sense. The news didn't give the good side of what will happen after the hardfork. The liquidity and the gaining of more trust from the supporter because they can easily withdraw and stakes and move their investment will create more robust ecosystem.Quote from: yazher on February 02, 2023, 09:04:36 AMWith this kind of update, surely they will gonna be attracting investors and it's really recommended to hold your ETH because the price will rise, and no doubt about that. I don't have much but I will surely just HOLD for now;DThere are many changes in crypto world and I want to educate again myself before doing anything.",

Ethereum as one of altcoins must follow Bitcoin in big bull runs and we will have to wait for Bitcoin bull run first.Bitcoin won't make its new all time high before its next halving so let's be realistic about Ethereum performance after Shanghai upgrade.",

However if the drop won't instantly come there will be some people panic buying it. It's a toss of a coin. But it would be hard to imagine that nothing happened to price.",

When they released this update, the price of Ethereum pumped already (I just don't know when the news released). Now when this is implemented, there is a high chance that some will apply the \"sell the news\" quote therefore, they will sell it immediately.On the other hand, there is also a chance that the implementation of the update might not affect the price negatively, but looking at the update where those who staked their Ethereum can un-stake them, there is a chance that they will sell the Ethereum that they've bought earlier at a profit. As for me, I'm a long term investor so any dumps for Ethereum is an opportunity for me so I want Ethereum to dump as Shanghai will be implemented.",

Well usually i would say the news about an upcoming update is always a positive thing because that means that the project is alive and still developing actively. Of course in this case this could be different, because if that many tokens can now be withdrawn this could also mean that a lot of tokens could be for sale at the same time which can have a pretty big and negative impact on the price of the coin, even if it is a project like Ethereum that has a huge trading volume.That being said, i don't think that we will see a heavy dumping after this upgrade and also not shortly before. Usually such activities are happening as soon as they are announced or even before.",

I was looking for a more positive outcome of this upgrade in the net and most of the news I see pointed out how this hardfork can cause dump. Thanks for enlightening me  In the first place Ethereum is a trusted altcoin. It is not just one of the thousands of shitcoins out there. So that itself is already a reason why stakers are confident of it. If shitcoins have stakers, how much more for Ethereum? If they trusted Ethereum and staked their coins back when staking means having your ETH locked without a definite withdrawal time, they will trust Ethereum more this time.It is purely a wild imagination to consider that by the time withdrawal is allowed all stakers would dump their ETH. That is without basis. They are sufficiently rewarded. Why would they stop what they are doing? I am looking forward to more stakers with the Shanghai upgrade.",
