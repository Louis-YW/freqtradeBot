If there is anything true, it's actually the opposite. Cryptocurrency markets are more volatile and therefore one can make a higher ROI in a short period of time as compared to stocks where they may have to wait longer.For example, Bitcoin moved from $16K later last year to about 31K recently, and it's not even a bull run. How many stocks can make such a move in just a few months?",

      "body": "You are absolutely right many newbies leave the crypto market after losing their capital in bear markets. They don't have proper knowledge about crypto trading and start crypto trading without getting the necessary skills that a trader must have.I agree that crypto is way more volatile than stock market, and in crypto market any bear run could impact the price of a coin way more than 20-40% in a few days. Many pump and dump coins lose more than 99% of their value in such bear markets.Buying at right time and holding for a long time is the only working way to earn in crypto market for new traders. Experienced traders can earn from crypto market in bear markets as well, and the earnings from crypto market are way higher than any other market. There is no luck in crypto world, only those traders win who can control their emotions, and do everything with proper planning.",

Their initial reason and plan to start trading will decide how long they will be ready to let their position opens and their capital will still be safe.If they have no plan at all, they are gambling and they can try to let their position opens with hope to get profit. In fact they don't have plan to close their position and exit the market just to protect their initial capital. That will lead to serious loss if market goes bad enough.",

The high market volatility means that liquidity can pump and disappear in a short time, so it is the wrong time to invest because it is the end of the wave, and then you will only find yourself on the beach and not in the middle of the sea, meaning that it is a period of money withdrawal and not pumping it.Quote from: usekevin on April 17, 2023, 09:26:02 PM1.Crypto currency is not a stock market trading,you need to wait longer period as compared to the stock market.In stock,you can earn 5% in short period,but in crypto it take short or longer based on the market flow.Here is spot trading and futures trading, and therefore the same options.

The challenge however is not knowing when that volatility will come and that is why at the little drop some people will panic and sell. The market could be manipulated some how for weaker hands to run out and that is exactly what happens sometimes with the price.",

And the reason is quite obvious. Stability in the stock market compared with the crypto market.

For the decentralised coins it’s always high volatility and no one can control the market at all, the volume could be very high at times while it could be less at the other times. But in many instances the new comer would just think it’s the old strategy they have to implement and they go all in without second thoughts. They definitely lose before they could get hang of it.",
