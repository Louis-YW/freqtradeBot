There is plenty of stable coins offered staking like BUSD, USDD, DAI,.. You should spread out over them.It is a good idea to stake more than one stablecoin for security purpose but it is equally important to chose a reputable platform with proven track record  to stake where investors funds are secured and guaranteed. Also if the funds in question is small, splitting them on multiple stablecoins won't bring a reasonable reward since the apy of stablecoins are usually smaller than normal altcoins staking so if the @op decided to split the funds into different stablecoins it won't generate good reward.However, if @op also wants to stake some good altcoins for a reasonable reward - (an average of 14.98% apy)  mycointainer is one of the good platform to stake, there is a guide on how to get started. Remember to always do your due diligent in all investment option. NFA",

But DIA is a decentralised peg so you can choice this also now it is totally your wish. this 3 peg is good",
