Good fundamentals doesnt assure that you would really be that able to hit up the right project but since we are doing our research which it is a must thing then it would really be indicating that this one is really that having the potential.It is way more better compared when you do make out some investment decisions without any basis because on this method on which you arent following any steps or analysis then you are just simply doing gambling in the first place. We know that dealing investment on this space does really involves that kind of risks on which it is really that normal that you would really be needing to take further step for you to be able to get the chance of progress.You wont really be able to know unless you do try. To those people who do really take up the risks because of tending to involved into something are the ones who do have that kind of possible opportunityon making their good profits on which it is really that a common approach or things that could possibly happen but of course losing money is always next in line too.",

Investors won't just throw money if the project doesn't have a reasonable fundamental use-case. If the team were able to show that clearly and the roadmap somehow made sense, investors might think that it's worthy investing in. The next one is the critical part, how the team will manage the project along the way and that's the key in making a strong backed community around the project.It's really tough to choose a project especially risking money for startups that's why a good-decision making should always be a priority.",

The tokenmetrics of existing altcoin projects are largely experiment and inflationary token supply has become a new shift in how token supply are structured. Instead of having all the supply available at launch (and unlocked) which could impact the price, most teams just lock some of the token supply and unlock it linearly. It's not the best approach and it has its downside but it's the best for now except someone comes up with a much better way to structure token metrics in the future.",

Yep, one example of that the projects that is mentioned in the OP has the same characteristics but managed to make a good way for their own community to trust them. There are so many deciding factor on why would you trust a project but I think investors make the inflationary characteristic a passable factor. Maybe the burning or the product usefulness can't be overseen that's why the \"cons\" of unlocking a certain number of tokens is still manageable.
