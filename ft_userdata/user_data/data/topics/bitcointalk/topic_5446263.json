  "content": "Hello everybody,I am new to Bitcoin and I did setup my own lightning node with Umbrel 0.5.3 to learn. Everything worked like a charm (opened channels, connected wallet etc). This morning all of the sudden my On-Chain balance is lower than yesterday and thats why a deposit I made 2 days ago is missing although yesterday it was visable. Does anybody have any idea what could happend? And no, I did not spent anything yesterday while I was drunk (kidding)   Thanks for some help for some kind of frustrated new Bitcoiner.....",

Remember the deposit address that you get from umbrel changes every time you use it so is the bc1qxdgkknc53cl9wvc95klzyu65fvfeerwtu98c92 address the one it's showing now or the one that you used before?What does the Bisonapp account show for outgoing transactions to you? Does it show that they were confirmed? Any other info?-Dave",

You need to contact Bisonapp. Since umbrel gives a new address for every transaction I am guessing (100% guess) that the address the OP gave was the next one in his wallet, which would be the one that is showing now. Even if the TX is double spent or dropped it does not display the old addresses. Umbrel also keeps the default size for the mempool. So it's entirely possible that since transactions with under a 4 sat / vb are being purged at the moment, that it *was* sent, and *is* out there BUT his node does not see it. And unless the OP has it someplace there is no easy way to see what the old address was unless he gets it from Bisonapp. You can get it by sshing into umbrel and using bitcoin-cli and get it from there but I have no idea how to get it from the GUI.-Dave",
