  "content": "The ambivalence between the governments of various countries over Bitcoin is that Bitcoin mining causes massive damage to the environment.  Bitcoin mining in particular requires materials such as electricity, fuel, oil and petroleum, which produce a large amount of carbon dioxide/CO2 during mining, which greatly harms the environment.  Every year, 100-200 million tons of carbon dioxide is generated by mining bitcoins, which is a threat to the environment. All this carbon dioxide acts like a greenhouse in the atmosphere which allows sunlight to enter the earth but not leave it.  The amount of carbon dioxide is increasing day by day, causing global temperature to increase at a record rate due to greenhouse-like processes.  As a result, the deposits on both sides have started to melt and the low-lying areas of the earth are going to disappear into the ocean.  Moreover, the carbon dioxide produced and constantly increasing is destroying the balance of the environment.  These carbon dioxides are causing severe diseases among humans.  Considering these issues, the governments of different countries around the world are taking a hard stand against Bitcoin mining.Moreover, Bitcoin mining requires oil and electrical energy.  This requires min 30-131 terawatts Ref of electricity per year, which is equal to the electricity consumption of 30 middle-income countries.  As a result of this waste of electrical energy, the amount of energy in the world is decreasing day by day and the price of fuel oil is constantly increasing.  Moreover, for many other global factors, governments around the world are working against Bitcoin.Finally we can face following Global Affects. Power Consumption: Bitcoin mining consumes power, energy I,e oil, Electricity, petroleum and fusil fuels etc . Produce Pollutants : it produces CO (Carbon monoxide), C02 ( Carbon dioxide) , So2 (Sulpher Dioxide) HCN( Hydrogen Cayanide) , CH4( Mithene) and huge amounts of Electric wastes. Global Warming : Above gases and Pollutants causes Global Warming in the world significantly. So Ice in the both pole are melting and lower areas in the world ie , India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and others are undergoing sea levels due to temperature increasing.Soil Pollution, water pollution : All above Mining wastes mixing in the water and soils , hence both important environmental element polluting heavily.",

      "body": "sorry to inform you.carbon does not affect the atmosphere and temperature as much as WATERyep clouds and rain and snow affect temperatures more then carbonwhen you look at whether channels and look at temperature charts they are more measuring sunny days and manipulating raiy days to what they think is a sunny day equivelent to push up the reasoned temperature.just doing this makes it appear like there was less colder days per year which changes the average real temperature to a higher manipulated average temperatureoh and by the way.. when looking at the \"parts per million\" content of airif there is 400ppm that is 0.04%without adding any extra carbon. by removing just 0.1% if water. raises the carbon parts by million to make up for the gap when trying to could 1m particles .. isnt maths fun.. yes humans are affecting the climate. but not how you think. changing how natural water cycle works has changed the water cycle.water bottlenecked into reservoirs for hydro electric dams and then pushed down pipes has caused less water to naturally flow across land evaporate. to then form cloud to block heat coming in. and stops the rain from cooling the land at ground levelthe surface area per gallon has changed where by less water gets to evaporate because its either taken off the land thus gets no surface area of thin layers to easily evaporate. or is saturated into reservoirs where the under waterline is too much water to also prevent much evaporation..the carbon game is not an ecological game. its a economic gamesince the 1980's they know oil reserves will be depleted by 2050. its what triggered the gulf wares and such to raid other countries of their reserves. and now power companies have to diversify over the next 30 years or go bust. so they are trying to blame x,y,z to then get alot pr profit/grants to fund their diversification without them going bankrupt..as for bitcoins impact on climate and environment.. think about the coal, gold, mines. the land that is wrecked.. bitcoin does not wreck land. bitcoin is not gas powered. its electric powered. an asic does not burn a lump of coal. power companies do. so blame the power companies for not offering clean production. its not asics fault. ..you are already seeing the power industry not mention, but actioning in the direction of nuclear, solar and wind. and avoiding(moving away from new) hydro-electric sector.. you now know whybrazils RAINforest is called a rain forest and not a carbon forest for good reasondo your research, not media rehearsenow lets deal with the bitcoin mining power amount .. you say 131TWlets just do some actual matha antminer s19 is 140thash for 3kwif we imagine the entire year was non stop mining at an even 280exahash mining(bitcoins peak) (using this number for easy visible maths even you can check with your head)that is 2million asics.meaning 3kw x 2m=6gw per hour6gwh=144GWh a day=52.5TW a yearbut that is if mining was 100% always at 280exafun fact. average hashrate for year actually is 212exa for year not 280exawhich is 39.7TW per year.. not your 131TWsee im using actual asic stats and actual hashrate stats. to get actual numbersyou are 3x incorrect",

      "body": "Yes OP you are right about climate change but seems like you are buying into the myth about bitcoin mining.You state a couple times mining requires electricity AND oil, petroleum. It doesn't require fossil fuels. It requires electricity. Some electricity comes from fossil fuels. Big difference between those two statements.Also you specifically say the electricity used on Bitcoin mining is wasted. It isnt wasted, it is used. Would you say the electricity used on anything else is wasted??And it's actually the opposite. The world actually does waste any enormous amount of the electricity generated because power plants have to maintain it level of energy production far in excess of what is used most of the time so that we don't have brownouts or blackouts. The funny thing is that Bitcoin is the solution to it. There are already companies that run Bitcoin miners directly at power plants to use that wasted energy. They're also companies that use the wasted energy of flared oil to run Bitcoin miners. So to say that Bitcoin waste energy is actually the opposite of the truth. Society waste a huge amount of energy and Bitcoin is the only solution we have to making that energy useful. In doing so this greatly strengthens video economics of energy production for the world. This is just a side benefit of Bitcoin, but it is a huge benefit for society.Also let's not forget that for many years now bitcoins use of renewables in Bitcoin mining has been like 30-40-50%, something like that. Which is very high compared to the amount of renewables used in other industries. So Bitcoin is actually leading the way in usage of renewables.Bitcoin also allows us to use stranded energy. So this would be say renewable energy that is found not near society. It is not profitable or useful to gather stranded energy. But thanks to Bitcoin it is. It's foreseeable that in the future we could harness stranded energy for Bitcoin mining and then use the profits from that for other societal needs.Pick my mind could also be used to make power plants in new areas profitable from the start rather than making a power plant and hoping enough people move there to make it profitable.Bitcoin mining is such a powerful and beneficial force for society. Not only does it secure the most secure network in human history and the most fundamentally solid money in human history, but it strengthens the energy industry, is leading the way toward higher renewable usage to stop climate change, allows us to use stranded energy, and allows us to stop wasting enormous amounts of energy and put that energy to good use, and it can also make power plants in new areas profitable from day 1 when residential/industrial demand for power isnt there yet. Additionally it allows people who have the startup costs to buy a Bitcoin miner to make a side income.Does Bitcoin mining use a lot of energy? Absolutely. But none of it is wasted and it has very large side benefits to society. Bitcoin mining will need to continue to move toward 100% renewables just like the rest of society to stop the worst effects of climate change in the coming century. But it is doing a good job so far, better than the rest of the world. Only people who aren't educated on Bitcoin mining vilify it as some sort of climate disaster or just in general a bad thing.",

      "body": "I somehow when someone says bitcoin is a disaster for nature then I really think that is a crazy assumption. Bitcoin is not bad for nature and bitcoin mining is not as bad as say. Obviously mining requires electricity and resources but when the electricity provider has a good solution for nature then renewable energy is a must.Some people blame bitcoin and its mining as one of the most destructive to nature, I don't understand that claim and I will never justify that claim. If anyone is to be blamed, I think the government and its regulations are to be blamed. If large mines still use electricity that is not from renewable energy, then that's a problem for nature, whereas if these large mines already use electricity generated from renewable energy, then what's wrong?",

Thats not how it works. Bitcoin doesnt waste ANY energy. It USES the energy. None is wasted. It all goes to securing the protocol. Bitcoin is the most secure network in human history because all that energy is USED to secure it.Also the energy use has nothing to do with transactions. The energy used secures the network. Bitcoin could use a thousand times as much energy or a thousand times less energy and still do the same transactions. Transactions =\\= energy. Energy usage is dictated by the economics of mining rewards, not the number of transactions. The only reason bitcoin mining uses a lot of energy is because the economics of the bitcoin network allows mining to use that much energy and be profitable. There is always more economic output in Bitcoin mining and there is economic/power input.As for fiat, well that uses an enormous amount of energy, far more than Bitcoin. So if you're comparing Bitcoin energy used to fiat energy use Bitcoin wins by a long shot.And you mention crypto as well, well no altcoins are money, they are tokens mostly for apps, or failed attempts to compete with bitcoin so it doesn't even make sense to compare them to Bitcoin because they cant do what Bitcoin does.",
