Institutional investors will not be able to take away majorrt of Bitcoin from circulation.Quote from: fathafraink on July 08, 2023, 10:49:23 AMand that means potentially Bitcoin will become more expensive as it becomes scarcer, and more numerousless?Bitcoin can grow in value when as the supply thins out and the demand grows cause the trader sentiment is positive and the general intention is to buy more.",

It depends on factors such as market demand, investor sentiment, regulatory development, etc. The reason why you are seeing positive sentiments at the moment is because of ETFs submitted by known financial institutions to SEC. If the ETF gets approved then you can expect institutional investors and retailers investing in Bitcoin. If you look back into halving history, you will see that Bitcoin has always created a new ATH after it. I am expecting Bitcoin to pump before and after halving.",

That means that there's lesser in the circulation and that makes bitcoin more scarce. I do remember IIRC last bull run, there's even the limitation on how much everyone can buy Bitcoin off exchanges. And that's possible to happen again when the demand has increased, the law of supply and demand has always been applied on this market.",

The halving will have a significant effect on the price of Bitcoin because the number of bitcoin that miners will mine after the halving will reduce twice of the current number. This will lead to increase in price because it will be limited in number. Also some people will buy when the price is high due to FOMO. As long as there are will be no FUD on bitcoin,and ETF gets approved,the price of will pump and if",

But people letter realized that their is little to be worried about, the SEC don't own Bitcoin neither is it controlled by any of those exchanges executives. So people realize that their is more to Bitcoin than being attacked by the Feds, so most people use the opportunity of the price dump and fill in their bag's. Base on the previous price movement, Bitcoin price seems to always be moving up after the halving some times months after the halving why some times years after the halving, but before the halving their is always a small price movement which looks seems to be as a result of increase in demand.",
