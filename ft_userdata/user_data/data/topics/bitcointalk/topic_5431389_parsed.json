They are one of the best in the industry too. Check this site https://crypto.news/top-5-emailing-services-that-support-crypto/The author mentioned Aweber with other four but I checked Aweber payment method and could not find an option to pay with crypto yet. Maybe I am missing something in the process.",

I advise you to try the free plan on one of these sites first to see the features that suit you, each of these sites has different prices you can choose and pay according to your monthly or annual budget.[1] https://www.pyypl.com/",

Unfortunately, these two do not accept and you can hardly find one with a good reputation in the newsletter or autoresponder business that accepts Crypto as payment, some of them are not even accepting Cryptocurrency related content like Mailchimp you have to settle with Paypal or credit card but be sure that the one that you are going to pick can accept Cryptocurrency related content.",
