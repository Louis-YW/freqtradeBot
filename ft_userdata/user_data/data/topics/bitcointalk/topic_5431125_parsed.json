      "body": "There are exorcism expert around here to give you the correct answer, but in my opinion this has something to do with magic, satanic rituals, as I have heard, if you intentionally open the door (portal) for them by using magic to conjure them into our dimension they will have free access to your life, so being possessed by them is inevitable.It's like bringing a prostitute to your house, you both know what happens at the end, even if you claim that you weren't going to jump on herðŸ˜…, at the end we know you are just fooling yourself. WrongÂ  analogy? Sorry couldn't help it, unable to ignore sexuality in everything.",

      "body": "It's believed that there are people really are gifted with this type of ability. Have you heard about the third-eye thing? I believe that it's true despite I don't have that.But I've seen situations that someone who has it really tell something different and accurately that happened even if he's not even there. He said that an entity or wisp have told him that incident from an specific place. I guess you've heard the same story as before but aside from that, too many paranormal things I've witnessed as well so it's either they're gifted or someone has helped them to have that ability of discerning people or spirits.",

      "body": "So why be hypocritical sometimes? Why, on the contrary, be frank? And is it right or wrong... many philosophers and psychologists have looked into this question, but it is still difficult to answer.For Laurent BÃ¨gue, professor of social psychology at the University of Grenoble, hypocrisy - like laughter - is part of \"human nature.He specifies that to understand the logic of a hypocritical person, it is necessary to \"distinguish two important aspects: the moral valorization sought by the individual, who hopes to show himself more virtuous than his acts reveal it, and the gap, voluntary or not, between his words and his acts.Hypocrisy is therefore the gap between the image we give (or wish to give) and our actions.The word hypocrisy is a very old term which designated, in Greek, an actor of theater... Thus, in the literal sense, we are hypocrites when we play a character other than ours.â€ˆWhen we perform an action by directing it to produce a better impression if it is judged by others.\"Also in this article, \"individuals would be hypocrites because they need to manage their social image.\" Thus, one is a hypocrite because one does not assume what one would say if one were sincere. Every person is concerned about their reputation, and acting is sometimes a solution when we don't dare to say what we really think - because we think it's wrong or unethical.For example, we will compliment someone on their haircut - even if we don't think it's pretty - because we don't want to hurt their feelings and appear mean to others. We may even say something to one group of people and the opposite to another group a few minutes later, simply to avoid disappointing either one.As the author points out, \"We know that if we appear immoral to others, the price we pay is high: exclusion from the group and loneliness, which have dreadful consequences for physical and mental health.\"Sometimes, some people even compare hypocrisy to politeness or diplomacy - which are also forms of \"unspoken\"",
