But as i de see am, di fear of di government fit be di beginning of wisdom for dem because maybe dem no want di government to de see to dem matter if dem first di government to de use and accept bitcoin to run dem businesses. Aldo i no go de surprised if these billionaires de codedly run bitcoin things, because di decentralized digital currency guarantee privacy where dem fit keep dem money without any centralized authority go de monitor. If dis top private sector players fit take di bull by di horn and de accept bitcoin for dem businesses, e go really go a long way to promote di usage and investment of bitcon for inside Nigeria. Di move go definitely challenge our government to fully adopt cryptocurrency, and remove di stigma of CBN ban, wey de  discourage most Nigerians about bitcoin.

Even with the restrictions way government put for cryptocurrency, boys still dey do there thing dey go small smal.I believe say e get where e go reach, government will be forced to  renounce their stance. Because bitcoin is like the inevitable innovation in this current world mapping. Because people are always moved to adapt with new innovation that will ease there stress. Bitcoin is decentralised and it allows you to keep your financial activities very private, so gradually bitcoin will have a chance in Nigeria as it has already started.",

I also know there is a clear distinction between accepting BTC as legal tender and simply overlooking its practices by not banning Crypto exchanges and wallets from operations. In countries where crypto is banned, exchanges or wallets barely work, and if they do, the authorities better not catch you with it on your device, else you be prosecuted.  Think about it. Bitcoin does have a chance in Nigeria, but only the right government with its knowledge can successfully implement it.",

After when CBN told the commercial banks to stop making cryptocurrency transactions for like three weeks, the then vice president of the country Professor Osinbajo came on air to say that bitcoin can be used p2p. I can still remember that he said something good about bitcoin but I have forgotten what he really said. And from the source of information I have gathered, the money Dangote is using, a % is own by Nigerian politicians, where they are hiding their wealths. And even those capitalist invest in bitcoin government can still illegal it and this what is displaying in UK and USA though they are using it but it I or yet legalized.  But if they invest in it, it will help in a long way.",

For instance how many people all over the country know about bit coin, have they been informed about the advantages of using bit coin and the disadvantages of using it as well because these are the things that needs to be looked out for before one can make comparison if it should be used on not.All over the country, a low population of people are aware of this bit coin and just as a saying that \"a tree cannot make a forest\" we will see that the few people that knows about bit coin cannot take decisions on behalf of the country.There should be a massive awareness and sensitization that should be created on the use of bit coin so as to convince the larger population to be in unism towards implementing the use of bit coin that's the only step to guarantee a unanimous support from every sector of government and it's citizens.",

Thereby making it harder to seize and track when they're out of power cos its invisible in the banks. They're not Ignorant to the fact that Bitcoin is the future but I'll tell you something. The reason Bitcoin and crypto in general was banned in Nigeria was because people would be very  much independent of banks and government, remember that most of these politicians have great share in respective banks. Bank revenue became lower as people felt more comfortable keeping their money where they have  more control over what happens to their money as compared to banks which will debit   you anyhow and stress you so much in its operations. The banks experienced low available funds and it affected their returns to the government, so banning Crypto was one major way to make money return to the banks. But I believe it there a turn in government policies on Bitcoin, it'll boost the economy readily.",
