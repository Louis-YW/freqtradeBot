If you wanna create the new token and why don't you try to take a look some announcement thread as your reference and think about the unique ideas that would be very useful for the community. In here almost all of members are actually aware about how to know the different between scam or legit tokens. You can also make your own announcement thread as well. This is far better to searching for someone that interested to create a collaboration with you.",

How would someone contact you since you are newbie? better to put social media accounts, proof of works(if there is any)  emails and at least any thing that will provide legitimacy from your team.you cannot lure costumers that will take your service if you will just post something like this here .Quote from: X-ray on August 06, 2022, 11:21:30 PMIs that mean if you are offering your service? if that was true and why don't you create your own service thread? that will be more attractive to the users.

Looks like you are not truly interested in this forum or in anything , because you are just here to  try having a thread but never give any interesting idea or even place where to contact you.I think if you wanted to gain support and to be part of collaboration then you need to be active and bring your group here instead of asking us to be in yours.",
