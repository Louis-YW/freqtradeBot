  "content": "I searched the internet for the cause of the mempool congestion with these words \"What is the cause of mempool congestion?\".The below answer was given me.\"A surge in Taproot usage and ordinal inscriptions has put pressure on the Bitcoin network. This has caused transaction fees to skyrocket and the mempool to clog up\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/08/binance-pauses-bitcoin-withdrawals-for-the-second-time-in-24-hours/#:~:text=Binance.Without winding my head much about it, I read down the article and discovered where Binance after pausing and resuming BTC transaction is working on implementing the Lightening Network as a solution to the congested mempool. I think this is the perfect time for Lightening Network to prove its importance to everyone and even its doubters.If you open a channel, you can continue your transactions in the channels and will only close it when the mempool is decongested. I think bitcoin on its own have a self healing medication (the LN).",

Please ignore my less technical background in the field of blockchain and how it works, I am still prospering on that side.Not exactly sure what you mean \"to be the same case with LN\". LN needs the L1 and it is supposed to need as it's the base layer that provides the critical features to all layers above, such as decentralization, security and all other properties. And LN is actually helping the base layer to handle the bourdain of handling the increasing number of transaction and also handling the speed that we can make transactions, theoretically competing with other fiat systems such as VISA.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on May 11, 2023, 07:01:12 PMQuote from: Flexystar on May 11, 2023, 06:36:42 PMSo what happens when Lightening Network gets flooded with endless exchanger transactions and acceptance from more and more exchangers in the future?Bear in mind that Lightning is still very much in its infancy.

This would significantly decrease the on chain footprint of Lightning channels.Yeah, I'm quite anxious waiting for channel factories. I think it's one other very needed and handy feature for the LN. Once more this will allow to decrease a bit more the amount of transactions on the L1 by allowing us to manage channels without having to constantly close and reopen channels due to lack of capacity!From Bitcoin OpTech, put simple:QuoteChannel factories are a multi-user contract capable of opening payment channels without putting the channel-open transaction onchain.For example, three users create a channel factory by each of them depositing some funds to an onchain 3-of-3 multisig address. Using non-broadcast (offchain) spends from that address, they open payment channels with each other (e.g. AliceâBob, AliceâCharlie, and BobâCharlie). They can then use those channels with the same security as if they had opened them onchain because, if necessary, they can broadcast the channel-open transactions. However, they donât need to broadcast those transactions if both parties act cooperatively, allowing them to reduce the amount of block chain data used.For large numbers of users under ideal situations, channel factories can reduce the onchain size and fee cost of LN by 90% or more.https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/channel-factories/",

I used to make a transaction of 1 sat/vbyte. The lowest transaction that I noticed which was on weekends on last Sunday was 17 sat/vbyte. Almost all the time over 20 sat/vbyte now. If compared to 1 sat/vbyte before, it is 20 times higher now. Another thing is that these coins may survive, an example is the meme coin called pepe, it is also existing on other blockchain like ethereum blockchain. We may think that the tokens may become shotcoins and die, but what if the hype follows the bull run? Bitcoin blockchain would be congested at that time, followed by Ordinals and Inscriptions making the congestion to be far worse because the tokens and non fungible tokens are hyped during bull run and it is a bull market for them too.",

If LN transactions are stuck somewhere between 500000 monkey and dick pics there's little use in LN.I'm honestly curious if you're frustrated by the monkey pics per se, or by the fact that the miners prioritize transactions which pay more than you do. Quote from: Zoomic on May 16, 2023, 06:52:27 PMCan you please explain to me how LN improves bitcoin privacy?When you send a payment, the receiver doesn't know which lightning node sent it. The intermediary nodes which route transactions neither know the sender nor the receiver. They only know it goes somewhere, from someone.",
