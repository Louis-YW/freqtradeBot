Once you withdraw them to metamask you won't be able to recover them. Better find the right wallet to receive BTC just like what they suggested above but if your purpose is to reduce fees you can only use other networks when you need to transfer it to another exchange that supports that network.",

One of the proven ways I've seen blockchain and web3 companies is to do one thing and do it well. They might at some point support Bitcoin down the road but the Consensys team currently has other priorities and products they are building.",

But do not worry WBTC also work and it is maybe not recommended by most users that's because there is another best option available so they care about you and want you to adopt other good options. Such as Electrum wallet or any other you prefer or you can store BTC in Truswallet too but if the amount is small then otherwise move to open source wallets such as Electrum etc. Which are better in every way than the Trust wallet and Metmask. Well, I should mention a thread that will help you to choose better options to store BTC. It also contains Hardware Wallets to store BTC. Wallet Software Discussion",

Why will you even advise anyone to swap their Bitcoin? After a careful investigation in this forum, I have come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as swapping one's Bitcoin because the Bitcoin blockchain doesn't support any bridge from its main chain to any other EVM-compatible chain. Adding to what Upgrade00 said, All that's done there is just a criminal way of convincing real Bitcoin holders to hand over their Bitcoin in exchange for something else; that's what con-artists do. Those tokens you call BTC might some day lose their value in the market if the entity in charge happens to file bankruptcy. They will all be like shitcoins with no value. You can take the Luna stable coin UST as an example.",

Bitcoin remains Bitcoin, it cannot be changed. Installing Electrum is very easy and is also available as a mobile app.",

You should use another wallet like Electrum to receive BTC or to accept BTC as what you have said if you don't get what I mean. There's no way you can receive BTC to your metamask because metamask only supports chains like what OmegaStarscream. EVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine and there are chains that are like that. Since you installed trustwallet, you can also use it ti receive BTC.",
