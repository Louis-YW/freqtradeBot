The diversification of scammers has long been happening where the trend is that's their next target, the writing is already on the wall on this meme coin they have been warned thousand times by experts and those who know the trend in the ICO all of these meme coins rides on the trend Dogecoin started they don't have something to offer to the community, no usability, all have the same features, huge supply encouraging people to promote to get rewarded, its like a Ponzi scheme yet people come to invest because of the promise of huge profit.Investors should learn to focus on projects that have long established themselves and if they are going to invest in new projects dig deep and forget about meme coin, go for use cases and developers who are true to their promise.",

Whatever the hype currently is where the scammers are. ICO's are hype, scammers are there to scam newbies. DeFi projects are hyped, they are there as well. NFT's are hyped 2 years ago, they are also there, and now meme coins are now the hyped project, and they are there. It's like an Owner-Dog relation where the hyped project is the owner, and the dog are the scammers. Wherever the hype/owner is, the scammers/dog is also there.  My apologies for that analysis.

Investors really don't learn from mistakes don't they? Whatever the hype is, investors will try their luck, and invest into some new memecoins out there hoping that they will earn money from it. 24 meme coins in just 10 days? It's just unfortunate to see investors losing money in these type of projects, but at the same time, I feel like they deserve to be scammed because they aren't learning. I just hope that those who lost their money investing into these meme coins learned their lesson already.

Just focus on the coins in terms of market cap. Lesser stress, lesser risk. Yes lesser rewards, but that would be better than investing into some shitcoins out there that has the highest risk. I mean it's my own perspective to focus on the top market cap coins because I don't want to get stressed in terms of my investments.",

New projects are always risky to invest and it's not the best time to analyse the potential cause it may sounds too good for the future but the person behind had no intention other than nothing then it's not going to save you from scammers with all the analysis. Atleast better wait for a couple of years to start real investment on a project but if you feel it's good and gonna spend few dollars like tip amount then it's okay.",

They can plan and take advantage based on the situation of the market and taking their opportunity with the NFT and meme coins during their hype is absolutely possible. That is why we should not pull ourselves into an investment that we have never done research. Honestly speaking, the current sentiment that happens to meme coins these days is gaining more attention and increasing demand which this gives a huge opportunity for the scammers to fool people and fall into their trap.",

In my own way, every tokens are pump and dump, some just stay longer than others.If you can look at the chart of Bitcoin since 2009 to this day you will see how bullish the chart has been, the lower price of Bitcoin is always not completely down, unlike altcoins can always drop down to -98%, it's why many call altcoins scam because the bigger play is still pump and dump. Â Do you know how many altcoins are looking like this right now?Yet some people still believe in those projects like Jasmy and VictoriaVR just to name a few, why isn't Bitcoin chart looking like that? Why can't we buy bitcoin at 500$ again since that's the lowest in 2015/2016? It only happens with altcoins.it's very hard to accept this but, majority of all altcoins are pump and dump and they will never go back to their all time high again, if you are holding coins and tokens that already did well in 2021 you are deceiving yourselves.",
