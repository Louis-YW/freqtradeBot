It was during the time when I was counting the posts that made within a week let's say March 6 to 12, during the time total posts let's say 4880 then later on, the total posts are now 4877 without receiving notifications in telegram app and also a message in MY Messages that I have posts that are/is deleted.",

If there was a big recount, then apparently this is a very rare occurrence, because in almost 4 years of my active presence on the forum, for the first time I encountered such phenomena that a bunch of posts simply disappeared. This issue happened to me few times before and I couldn't explain how it happened exactly.I never cared about that so much but I noticed this difference in campaign spreadsheet and I couldn't find the real reason, that was probably related with some older topics and topics, and maybe previously deleted posts are the real reason.Note that I never checked if BPIP and Ninjastic websites are showing the same number of posts or not.",

      "body": "I have been observing similar phenomena with the posts counter for quite some time. Periodically it happens that 1 post disappears. For example, it was 100, but after a while it is already 99. Of course, I notice the difference. Just like you, there were no private messages from the forum (with the exception of a couple of cases, but then the posts were deleted for the cause). Without attaching much importance to the deleted posts, I continued as usual, believing that perhaps they deleted the old topic in which I left a comment. But it means that this happened to other users, and on a large scale. I was also curious to know what the reason for the deletion was, but I don't even know which posts were deleted. So, I confirm that you are not the only one having this happen.",

And not a single notification of a deleted post in PM. Now here's a riddle for me (2 riddles) for the rest of the evening: Which topic was deleted from the forum, that there were already 20 of my posts in it? There must have been some heated discussion.  And what is the reason for the removal?Most likely, these questions will remain unanswered.I agrees with that of the reset on post count and that's only applicable for those following up their post count, but I've also once experienced deletion of recent post made within a week without receiving a notification or PM on that and it was not moved to off topic, I don't know maybe this could also be part of the reset of shrinkage unaware, just the removal of post without any information, but i believe this would have been experienced by many but it mean nothing to have much concerned once a regular check is made, this should also be considered.",

As mods/admins recounts posts and it happens the real number of posts doesn't tally with the present post count the user should at least get notified of new changes and why the ended up with new values in their post count because some times i wake up to see my post count reduced but yet no notification and i wonder what post was actually deleted or moved.",
