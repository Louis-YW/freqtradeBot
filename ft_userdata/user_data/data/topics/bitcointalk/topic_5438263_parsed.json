Bitcoin does not need biometric authentication to become more secure, so we do not need to discuss ways to make it more secure.Explore existing ways to make bitcoin more secure such as avoiding electronic back ups, using fully airgapped device and generating keys safely.- Jay -",

The biometric security is safe as long as the company storing the data is well calibrated to avoid any major hacks. If you are planning to securely store your cryptocurrency, always go for a hardware wallet or a cold wallet rather than storing your coins in any online wallet in your mobile, it is not secure even with biometric facility as it is easier to hack a mobile and hijack your biometric data stored in it.",

In this case, a deepfake can manipulate video or sound so that the biometric authentication system is unable to distinguish between genuine and fake.To avoid this problem, it is important to use more sophisticated biometric recognition technologies and verify user identity with other authentication methods, such as multi-factor validation. The system should also have mechanisms in place to monitor and identify abnormal behavior, such as hacking attempts or unauthorized access.This shows that while biometric recognition technology can be a secure and practical solution for authentication, it is important to continuously monitor and update the technology and ensure that security systems are kept up-to-date and effective.",

Cold storage for people sophisticated enough to do this and accept the risk with doing so. And custodial (banking) type solutions for people that are not.Similar to how someone can have cash in their position if they want to or use the banking electronic system if they want to.",

You should not store any life altering amounts of money with just that as security.The amount will vary person to person. What I care a lot about and consider life altering amounts of money is what Bill Gates would not waste his time looking for if he did not remember where he left it YMWV on the amount. But it's all the same in the end for using fingerprint or face recognition for security.-Dave",

I tend to think about the risk of device damage or maybe the risk of losing the device rather than the expected security. I may prefer to remove the wallet from my android as way to minimize risk, but only after I have backed up the private key or wallet seed and stored it in a safe place.But what is clear, every security measure made must have its own vulnerabilities to solve. To be honest, I don't know if this biometric authentication can be broken, but maybe someone can practice it on their respective android manually. After all there are many ways to fake fingerprints and some people may have duplicated them for some reason. Youtube can give you some information about it.",

I prefer the verification to be done peer-to-peer in at a physical location by randomly selected verifier, or done online via a split method I illustrated in the past. The first method requires a user & the verifier to be physically present in a safe location or location authorized by a Decentralized Community. Once the verification is completed offline with special equipment or equipment own by the biometric owner (this's to ensure the the data only remains with the owner or never copied by the verifier), the data is hashed, properly encrypted and stored on the decentralized system. But if you don't want to store the data on the shared system you can store only the hash.You can use the verified data for online/offline authentication.",
