  "content": "I performed my first Bitcoin transaction April 21st.. Someone sent me 1000 dollars. The bitcoin came to me then went right back out o2f my wallet. It appears from the reviews that this is pretty standard practice by them. They are presenting themselves as a company that provides secure bitcoin wallets while in actuality they are disseminating software that obviously has a backdoor in it. I contacted support in the app but never received a response. I can't believe I didn't read the reviews first. When I go to their site their is a Godaddy page saying it is for sale but then when I go to buy it it says it is owned. Luckily there is a broker for Godaddy there who can negotiate a sale with the current owner lol. Seriously it gets out that someone can just intercept your transactions and pull them back out as soon as they go in people will panic and the current decline in the Cryptocurrency prices will seem like nothing. Here is the TX ID. If anyone can tell me at least how to get this app off google play I would be very grateful. Help me get my money back and I'll give you half. And I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty getting it back. below are the TXIDsIn 5db0519a08e7a1492b6f687be8dfb0743b38d79c33cbf6c152347acfb19d9173Out575b44c9edb22d6cf692e5a53b553fce83a3c870de291690e8f9fa34359fbe27In06f868fa564cad124f9b0b010f8ca92e0b7b994be4ce493ba7aabdb21f24da95Out09754bd2220ff85bfe04e7888011f10f7ffa425ceaea5c3daa3e59fa375cba37",

You used BTC without finding out what's recommended or not, and that's why you lost your money. Download Electrum wallet and verify it to be sure everything is safe to use, it is a recommended open source BTC wallet, and you should start using it forthwith, or buy a hardware wallet if your money is big.Quote from: ElmoMentz on May 04, 2023, 10:37:01 PMHelp me get my money back and I'll give you half. And I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty getting it back. I am sorry your money is gone and you cannot get it back because transactions on the BTC network is immutable and irreversible. If anybody chats you with the promise of recovering your lost funds, block them immediately, they are scammers!!!",

      "body": "There is no other way to get rid of scam apps from the Play Store or other app marketplaces other than mass reporting the apps to the market owner, which is Google in this case. Don't expect a fast response though, you'll probably need to wait for days or weeks to even see that your report is having an effect. While there is a report of Google removing thousand of scam apps from their store, it doesn't really help if people can still post new malware apps easily.Why would you download and use this app in the first place if there are dozens of alternatives with better reviews/download numbers.",

It doesn't have to have back doors but because the wallet is closed source we can't know what happened, the seed you generated may have already been generated so the scammer will link it to a high speed bot that will withdraw once deposited.since you have downloaded the application and given permissions, it may search personal files or even try to spread viruses such as clipboard viruses.You must delete this application, stop using any address that it generates, format your phone, and change the passwords of all your accounts.Let's dig a bit, we'll limit the transaction to this address bc1qprkkdtsh6ghdvdpkxjalg7r2vde3wsjc4tatkd, which appears to be a Binance address, Binance ask user to complete KYC.Go to the local authorities in your country and open a theft report in information security with Binance withdrawal address.Then contact support team and inform them of the fraud case and all the necessary details, along with attaching the legal data.If your country helps process this transaction, there is a good chance that you will be able to get your money back.",
