I was curious to know that and I realized that it is not a good investment in my opinion.I saw in CMC that his market volume is only 1650$ in 24hrs where the price of each coin is 0.8$, it's obvious that it's just hyped and there are no investors who are mostly here because they don't have a good development seen here in the ash token you speak of.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ash/",
