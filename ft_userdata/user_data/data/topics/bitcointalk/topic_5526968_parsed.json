Many investors especially the newbies when they just hear the current value of Bitcoin they become optimistic to become a millionaire overnight without know what the system entails. Most investors don't know that the magnitude of the stash of Bitcoin you have in stock and the time you hold the Bitcoin is directly proportional to the profitable of the investment.To be successful in Bitcoin there must be a sgnificant investment and also the perseverance to hold the Bitcoin for a very long time regardless of any occuring financial needs of the investor within the life cycle of the investment.",

As for the words I made bold in your statement, you really need to understand that in the world of cryptocurrency, their is no diversification because no other coin is as trustworthy as Bitcoin, any other coin aside Bitcoin is like a game where you are not that certain wether it might recover if it crashes in price, unlike Bitcoin that always rally back to even better height, so their is no diversification in cryptocurrency, unless you just want to take risk on alt and meme coin.Then as for constantly taking profit from your holdings. If you are actually withdrawing from your holdings, does that still make you a Holder? Because you are actually selling for minimal gains when you should be looking for ways on how to accumulate more and increase your stash, that's a traits of traders not investors to be honest with you.",

Of course bitcoin investment can be a life changing investment depending on the stash of bitcoin you have in your portfolio. And also being patient enough to hold on to it in the long run. this are the key that defines your success as a bitcoin investor if you can be able to accumulate enough bitcoin in your portfolio and also hold on to it for  decade. of course is rest assured that you're going to make a huge profit from your investment.",

People can change their views once they have market experience and when they fully understand how this works. I may not be seeing it wrong because being optimistic drives us to be more courageous than doubts and fear. I'd rather encourage them (newbies) to think like that rather than think negative things. People who have a lot of worries in their minds can't think wisely. But those who are optimistic will certainly find a way to solve problems when it happens.",

The following link is for 9 year of DCA.https://dcabtc.com?sd=2016-01-20&sda=9_years&f=monthly&d=9_years&ac=10000&c=falseTotal invested capital is $10,800 with $100 monthly DCA for 9 years, ROI is 2,041%. In future, Bitcoin will have less price growth rate so ROI for next 10 years will be smaller.If you can hold your bitcoin more than 5 years and 1 month according to Bitcoin history so far, you will have profit.https://hodl.camp/",
