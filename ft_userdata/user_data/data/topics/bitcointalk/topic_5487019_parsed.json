      "body": "that would be terrifying seeing such, even when it was a glitch. Seeing your asset in $0 that indeed can  cause psychological effects. Through such event alot would learn that leaving or holding your asset in a cex account, is not a smart move and it's wrong. Most people actually leave their asset in a cex for trading purposes. While some leave their asset in exchange due to not having a proper knowledge about this space . At first I ones have such mindset of  thinking that holding your coin in an exchange is safe till the event of FTX collapsing  occurs. And other users here always emphasize on how is not safe to hold your coins in an cex account. This information is actually nice would make those that Are still holding in an exchange to be more cautious and should stop it ( expecially those that aren't trading) but holding, Dont forget not your key Not your Coin.",

It is just ridiculous seeing people on X/Twitter having a mental breakdown over this even after hearing about \"not your keys, not your coins\" so many times.Those people that keep their coins in an exchange are gambling with their coins, and I will say that they are the ones putting themselves into panic, because I don't see any reason why someone who is not a trader will turn deaf ears to the advise of using a noncustodial wallet, despite all the news about the flaws in exchanges, and still continue to keep their coins with third party.Imagine assuming it wasn't a glitch, but an exit scam or a hack. These people will start blaming Coinbase, instead of blaming themselves for not learning from what happened in the past to FTX. I just hope that other investors who  still keeping their coins on exchanges will learn from this, and also these panicking Coinbase customers will also transfer their coins to a noncustodial wallet after the glitch is fixed. It is 50/50 using an exchange to keep your coins, and don't be a victim, because the risk is higher than what you benefit from the exchange. Anyone with High Blood Pressure might collapse, when he checks his account in Coinbase and sees $0",

You don’t need to be a tech savvy person to relate to what OP said, if you’re knowledgeable enough to buy any coin from the exchange you’re knowledgeable enough to take them out to your wallet. Leaving coins at exchanges is more of a convenience thing than a knowledge thing to me Quote from: kro55 on February 29, 2024, 08:31:50 AM In addition, a more interesting thing is that no matter what we say, CEX is always the place with the largest liquidity in the market.

One can use any exchange they want to get a coin but the warning is never ever leave your coin on an exchange no matter how big or how much liquidity you think they have. Using of DEX is to avoid KYC for privacy oriented people",

It makes no sense, because a software wallet like Electrum isn't something you lave to take lessons on how to use like it's a university course, it is literally just a software program like Google Chrome, VLC, and Adobe Reader.Do you take lessons or tutorials to use any of those? Of course not. That is because they are intuitive to use. The same goes with wallet software. Except for full nodes but those are not included in this discussion.There are even convenient non-custodial mobile wallets such as Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet (LOL) which you can access by opening an app. There is literally no excuse for normal people to go to an exchange website and sign in in order to access your coins.edit: missed a word",
