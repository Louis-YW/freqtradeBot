Because such person might still come out and decide to continue to scam more people.I just hope that other people like him would learn from him, but it seems like scammers don't care about what has happened to the previous scammers, but they will still continue as long as they have not been caught. I am happy that Justice has been done to SBF.",

      "body": "He is even lucky to get a 25-year sentence after the whole thing; he should just accept it instead of trying to appeal his way out of it. He is not supposed to get anything less than 20 years in prison so that he can also feel the pain that others who lost their money and lived as a result of his selfish decision feel.  Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years for multi-billion dollar FTX fraud I watched somewhere on the news where the parent made a statement, “We are heartbroken and will continue to fight for our son.” Is it that they don't know that their son is guilty or what, or are they using the love they have for their child to blind themselves to what's right?",

He is also to pay $11 billion in forfeiture, which will make him totally broke. At the end of his prison term, he would be 57 and would have a limited time to pursue his goals and ambitions. He is fortunate that he is not from some authoritarian nation that would have sentenced him to death or life imprisonment. The US has one of the best prison systems that give convicts the privilege of getting parole after some years. So it is possible he could get parole since the sentence is not without parole. But his parents said after the sentence that they would continue to seek justice for their son, which means the judgement will be appealed as soon as possible. Quotethis might make a few other scammers realise trading in crypto does on alleviate them of the law, a scam is still a scam no matter what the asset/value/currency isThroughout his trial, Sam Bankman-Fried has never accepted that he committed fraud or scam. He has always maintained that FTX went bankrupt because of a liquidity crisis. When he was lying to investors, living in luxury and giving donations like Santa Claus, he never knew that it was wasting other people's money.",

However, if am not mistaken, I think this happened around November 2022 and till date the whole maters was conner sided (although is was still on investigation process then) but now it's already revealed to everyone that they are guilty of the crimes and they should serve the government for the tim/years that was given to them.Just imagine how they ruined the live of the innocent people when they scammed them, now they have to start they investment from below, the age they have passed they still have to go back and continue from there (very bad). @Nwada001Quote“We are heartbroken and will continue to fight for our son.”That's bad of them, the parents are supporting their child because they don't believe their children is already guilty of the crime committed. The USA judiciary system is very corrupt that's the reason why they always prolong the matters from 2022 till date.",

A 25 years sentence is more than I had wished. He's still a young guy, but he'll be old and broke when free. It's also quite likely he will still have plenty to pay back to the people he robbed, meaning that whatever job he'll get, part of his salary will be seized, and that he will remain poor for the rest of his life.Tough for him, but good for crypto. This is an example to other crypto start-ups and exchanges. Now, they know that they have to behave, otherwise they'll end up in jail.",

I guess that his friends in high places are going to make sure he gets moved to a low security facility and then to a prison camp for good behavior, health problems, or whatever. Finally he'll be released early. I give him 10 years of actual prison at most and he's out enjoying private jets, yachts and all that.",

Just my subjective opinion.my views are also that rapists and murders should get life that means life.. and those crimes should be hardened and made harsher first..and then financial crimes dealt with less harshness below that.. but..but when financial crimes then cause physical harm(people commit suicide due to losses caused by others) then added charges of manslaughter should be added to a financial crime and sentenced accordingly... but even without single suicide/death.. many people would have individually filed for damages of mental injury(stress, depression) which cumulatively would have added up to decades/centuries.. which would also then be fair.. and so when you read sentencing guidelines that have different timescale categories about numbers of victims, amount of value victimised.. you start to appreciate that they TRY to find a fair balance..what i dislike is the whole concurrent policy vs consecutive or where \"life\" no longer means lifeif he had 7 charges totalling 108 years.. that should be the end sentance",

If they can't channel those properties into funds, they can use all that to pay back some of the affected victims and not convert it into government assets if they have the intention of doing that. Banning him from managing or having any business for the time being is also a good decision, as he has proven himself not to be trusted with public funds, and as such, he should be revoked of such access.",
