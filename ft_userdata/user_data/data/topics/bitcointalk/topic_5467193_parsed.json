  "content": "Guys, this might look funny to you, but it's not funny. Actually, as I'm writing now, it's a mix of feelings of laughing and anger within me. Of course, you could have known the reason for the laugh, the money is so little, why the rant? But the second part which is anger is worth it as well, because no matter how little the money is, Coinbase doesn't have the right to confiscate it, it's my money, not theirs.Frankly, I'd forgotten the money there since last year until recently when I persistently received messages that I needed to move all my money. I last saw such a message last year if I'm correct, and I remember I couldn't move the money which was why I left it then.I tried again a few days ago, but I can't withdraw my little money of $0.89 due to the restriction of 0.0001 BTC withdrawal. Come to think of it, they want to go, should they go with people's money as well? I know that they have their withdrawal policy of 0.0001BTC as a minimum, but should that apply also when they are leaving? This happens so much in fiat, but shouldn't be in crypto, this is why it gets me annoyed.My quick surf shows that Coinbase had 108 million users as of 2022, but let's assume that just 20 million of their customers have a low amount in their accounts they can't withdraw like myself. They can't make less than $15,000,000 from this singular act. Because by the calculation through the current bitcoin rate and their minimum withdrawal of 0.0001BTC, they will seize from $2.71 lower, which is a huge amount in millions.I must tell you my mind, this pains me despite being a small amount. I prefer to give miners the money than exchange. They've been mailing me three times a week now to withdraw the money that I couldn't withdraw due to their imposed restriction. They are trying to show that they did their part before locking the account forever. I'm still pondering if I should send an official email to relevant institutions to look into this potential scam. I'm particular about about their cunningness.It's not about the size of the money but the manner in which one's hands are tied as Coinbase preaches hypocrisy.",

      "body": "Yeah we all agree that exchanges mostly the centralized ones are just there to enrich themselves and that is part of the reason why it is Crystal clear not to save fund on them But mate I don’t think they did anything related to hypocrisy here because the rule to have a minimum withdrawal of 0.0001 btc was pointed even before the current saga, so before you even deposited there and left that amount you know you ain’t getting it back and the only way is to top it up to reach the minimum. So i don’t see the reason for the fuss here, it would have actually been annoying if only they brought up the rule at this time. Also if they should allow the number of such withdrawals, how much will be left if the charges applied are deducted? Personally I don’t see this as an issue to write to them.",

If we should leave the withdrawal fee aside, even bitcoin network transaction fee for bitcoin is not far lower than $0.89. Right now with 27 sat/vbyte, transaction fee that will get 1 input and 2 output transaction confirm is $1.03.

They have the right to confiscate your money because you are keeping in their custody. They are offering a service and as such you have to abide by their rules. You should have red their T&C when you signed up. It is not a charity organization it is a business entity. I also received the same email and I would like to point out that it was stated specifically that there is going to be a fee charged for withdrawal. See it\"This is a friendly reminder that we will be discontinuing services to your above-mentioned account.Please note that you will be able to access Coinbase.com or the Coinbase app until 25th September 2023 and should withdraw any funds held in your account by such date.Your funds remain secure with us, and you are able to send funds to other crypto wallets or services (subject to standard network and transaction fees), including Coinbase Wallet.\"",

It's mine, not theirs.In addition, being a custodial wallet is not a justification for not letting me withdraw the money, it's just their own company's rules.

But what about the exchanges that their customers will make a slight mistake that will lead to loss of the customers coin and nothing would be done after the exchange has the coin becusse they have the private key? This one you are talking about is still better and I think it is something that the affected people should just overlook",

I understand what you are trying to convey, when it's in the normal operation, it's never fraudulent for any company to have their minimum withdrawal. But in this situation of Coinbase, the condition is no more normal, they are forcing everyone to withdraw their funds, so they should have a special condition for this. The amount is little but there is no fairness and justice in tying our hands to enrich themselves due to their restriction. If truly they want the low-balance user to withdraw their money normally and not just preaching hypocrisy, they should have lowered the minimum in this condition and let us decide the fate of our money whether we want to leave it with Coinbase or waste it on the miners.The value of my money should be around $1 now since the Bitcoin price was about $26,000 when I made that post last month, the coin is way more the value now.",
