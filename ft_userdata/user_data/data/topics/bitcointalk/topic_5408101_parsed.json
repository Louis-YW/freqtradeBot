When the next jump comes I just hope I wont make same mistake Yes same thing happened to me with Ethereum and Doge. I thought Doge was going to $1 and did not sell at 70 cents. I thought Ethereum was going to $20,000 and did not sell at $4,800.But the flip side to that is if you sold Raven Coin at 25 cents you would have had to pay taxes on $625,000! Or do you live in a part of the world where taxes are not an issue? All of the exchanges I know of that allow you to convert from crypto to local fiat are KYC so there is no way to dodge the tax issue.Then again even after paying taxes you would be better off than hodling down to the bottom.",

Bitcoin is the main controller of all cryptos in the market so whatever happens to its price, others can also follow with it. I do believe that btc can soon reach 100k so buying and then mining some raven coin is a good idea to do.@OP that's a sad story, missing a good opportunity but don't worry because a lot of us here do also experience that but maybe not specifically in raven coin but on bitcoins and other top cryptos. All I can say is don't give up and don't down yourself too much because this wasn't the end. I think that raven coin isn't a bad coin like meme coins and other hyped coins so there's still a chance that it can recover and pump up.",
