  "content": "Thoughts on Tether's new audit report & HUSD losing its peg?Tether recently got a new accounting firm to oversee its asset reserves, probably aiming to calm down the storms regarding its reserves (or lack of them?)They reported $66.4B in asset reserves and holdings, also reporting that Tether’s cash and bank deposit holdings rose by 32% in the period.With all these scares regarding Stable coins like the UST crash, and HUSD losing its peg and going as low as $0.85 cents, What do you think the future is looking like for stablecoins?https://twitter.com/thetokenist/status/1560285238537887749https://tokenist.com/tether-publishes-first-audit-report-with-new-accounting-firm-66-4b-in-reserves/",

In cash tether have only a few percent of its portfolio, the rest of the funds are hold mainly in corporate bonds, short-term debt, government bonds and other mainly debt-related securities:Those are safe stuff. But not so much if you need to dump everything in one day because of attack. Especially now, when everything is down. TLT (ISHARES 20+ YEAR TREASURY BOND ETF) is down 36% from its ATH. Its just short term papaer loses that will sooner or later recover because its just bonds that will pay back invested money + interest but not if you are forced to sell on the lows.Quote from: dungEater69 on August 19, 2022, 09:03:07 PMalso reporting that Tether’s cash and bank deposit holdings rose by 32% in the period.As far as I know they only had like 5% in cash. So its now 5%*1,32 = 6.6%?Quote from: dungEater69 on August 19, 2022, 09:03:07 PMand HUSD losing its peg and going as low as $0.85 cents, What do you think the future is looking like for stablecoins?https://twitter.com/thetokenist/status/1560285238537887749Its back to $0.9943. Whole event was triggered by news: \"This follows news that crypto personalities Sam Bankman-Fried and Justin Sun were in talks to purchase large stakes in Huobi Global.Huobi Global does not explicitly issue HUSD but Huobi Capital invested in HUSD issuer Stable Universal in 2019.\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/34234I think its just FUD.",

      "body": "Stablecoin has no future aside for short term holding as many traders using that to save his money from dump, so there's no point to holding stablecoin in the long term, it's same like you're holding fiat money. I'd say if you're looking to hold centralized fiat, it's better for you to hold your local fiat on your banks rather than centralized coin. Another option is convert it to decentralized stablecoin e.g. DAI.",
