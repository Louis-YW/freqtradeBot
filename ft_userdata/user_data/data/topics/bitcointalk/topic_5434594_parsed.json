Every election cycle every political parties has their own voting bloc; yet it does not determine seh dem go de get the votes every 4 years. With different level of shege wey eye don see over 5 years now, no governor fit direct anyone who to vote for. everyone knows who they are voting for",

Because im get influence in di political space in di kwantri. That is why if Wike tells di G-5 governors to support any presidential candidate, I believe dat candidate go win. Before Wike dey tok like dat, im no dey tok for imself but 4 all im supporters. Bcuz one man can not make a society. Tinubu (APC) and Obi (LP) nai dey contest 4 dis year election, as for Atiku im name no follow again. And Tinubu APC and Obi LP go bi a tough election. We pray make obi carry di votes.

Some people go dey feel say all those things e dey do nor dey get influence on people even people wey dey both under the party and not under the party, but e dey get effect. The decision of one influential governor matters, the decision of one influential past official matters, the decision of those integrity groups matter to some certain kind people, The decision of traditional rulers matter, The decision of religious leaders matter.

Wike and other G5 governors most especially Oyo state governor Seyi Makinde get influence on top their people because of their excellent work. The only difference between what this influence do in the past elections and this coming one is the fact that Nigerians don’t just follow blindly but they do their own research to determine which is better. As for the G5 governors choice I think they have to also make a decision that could shape their political career and or end it. Makinde has the hardest option than the other four. Because he is the only one contesting and a decision could affect him too.",

As a governor of a state, you get command over everything wey d happen for your state even for election period. Wetin I wan talk be sae, the only place wey Wike go get maximum power na for em state ''PH''. No be for another mans state. As for the G5 governor's wey Wike belong, they can't even decide who go run the country. This country na big country for one peso to come talk sae na this peso go rule am.As this coming election dey so, so many things come with am. The tension the too high for peso wey we think sae em go win. All man just d pray make Peter Obi win but will it be easy for him cos people wey d run the same race with am, no be small people for Nigeria policies.",

So do you think that buhari wey b our president now go support tinubu to win this election.Yes.. in politics there is a team called \"Political Wizardry\" in a political candidate is withdrawn from contesting the election in a day to di election. So what Wike is saying is di truth but nothing and di truth. For instance, if Wike and the other G-5 Governors withdraw from PDP at the deadline, it will affect Atiku very strongly, because it will cause chaos and reduce di voting strength of Atiku. Remember di G-5 governors have a large number of followers. But let si weti go happen 4 di election. But no doubt Wike oo. He knows how to play di political game. Dat is y he dey very confident to say anything wey im like to tok",

I remember one election like that maybe two previous election for River State wey Wike, use e pressure rass all the polling unit with e boiz wey dem no allow any other party to vote apart from PDP. This one happen for my friend community under Kana LGA. So I believe say na e make am dey make noise because e believe say him go fit deliver him state to the party wey e dey support. Buhari still get the power to give the president to APC because na the incumbent president e be. Na Goodluck Jonathan carry power give APC,if not na PDP for still dey rule. Therefore, I still see say if no be free and fair election Jagaban don win already,because if una see the assurance and confident wey Tinubu dey use declare himself as the winner of this forth coming election you go tire.",
