      "body": "I don't have an answer to your question since hardware failure depends on the hardware. I reckon it shouldn't be only 2-3 years but much more. I have no proof to justify my words though.However, you shouldn't worry about it, since you can have a dual backup of your seed phrase and then you don't really care if the wallet (device) loses data. In fact, you can even destroy it and don't lose anything at all, as long as the only thing required to retrieve the wallet is your seed phrase and your passphrase (optional).Personally, I have set my device to \"temporary signing\" meaning it erases memory when shutdown. So I use the \"malfunction\" that you ask for, as a feature!",

It's possible that ordinary users may not power up their hardware wallets for 2-3 years or longer.I broke my previous hardware wallet by just not openly it for a year. Hardwallet needs to be open even once a month as per the general care description of the device. I believe the year of storing the data is not important since you can always recover all your assets stored on broken hardware by importing the seedphrase on any software wallet that support wallet import. The durability of the hardware wallet is your main concern rather than retaining the data inside since it will be there as long as the device is working.",

Flash memory drives used in hardware wallets are not TLC so unlike USB which uses TLC (Triple-Level Cell)which is aimed to store more data in a cell has less durability and 3000 P/E cycles.Whereas hardware Wallets uses SLC (Single-level cell) which provides the highest endurance possible with expected 100K P/E cycles so technically it can last longer than the USB drives but I don't expect it to last longer, than 5 to 10 years because the durability is affected by various other factors too so even if you keep HW safe you need to have physical backup(s) of your recovery seeds.Quote from: Wapfika on September 28, 2023, 10:51:13 AMI broke my previous hardware wallet by just not openly it for a year. Hardwallet needs to be open even once a month as per the general care description of the device. I don't think so because the HW wallets are built to last long and the firstt thing that can break down in HW is the battery used to powerup which means lesser you connect the most life can be expected. So there is no reason for your HW to broke unless it damaged physically or exposed to extreme weather conditions.",

For example, what if there is a fire? Perhaps this risk can be mitigated by using metal instead? Another risk is theft. We can try a different approach. For instance, we can write down 15 out of the 24 words on papers. And encrypt the remaining 9 words (using WinRAR or 7-zip, AES256 encryption, with a strong password) and store them on encrypted USB drives and in email accounts. The papers can be sealed and stored in several locations, so even if a fire occurs at home, there is no need to worry.",

I have encountered somewhere across mentions of something like ten years of average lifespan for non-volatile memory used in HW, but you have to take into consideration that to prolong memory's life device should be kept at optimal conditions. The loss of charge in memory cells is temperature dependent - the higher the temperature the faster the leakage.Probably, keeping  it in fridge (and preventing  from being exposed to  moisture there ) will  increase memory's life  .",

If then went cheap, then you never know....The other thing to keep in mind is the battery if it's not USB powered. Lithium batts can get so low that they just die and can't be recharged so you have to take the wallet apart and install a new one.Or if it's one that takes regular batteries, make sure that they don't do the sit for years and leak all over everything death.And if it has a screen I think everyone has had at least one cell phone / monitor / whatever screen just up and die.So, it's not just the data but the unit as a whole.

It's possible that ordinary users may not power up their hardware wallets for 2-3 years or longer.This question must be asked first of all to each specific manufacturer of HW devices. It's surprising that users of trezor and ledger (the most popular and widespread) hardware wallets haven't done this yet.What prevents you from periodically turning on the HW device? This process takes very little time.In addition to having backups of seed phrases, it is necessary to have alternative action algorithms in case you need to immediately gain access to your wallet with crypto assets, and the HW device is broken (the display is broken, the internal drive is out of order, or something else).
