Right now, no one has scammed yet. But if you are not comfortable with their site, it is your prerogative not to deposit on them.Everyone starts from somewhere. They may have a cloudy start but they can still redeem themselves.Just keep your eyes open and be open minded with things. Let us wait how they will disclose their bankroll to prove their financial capability.If they are sincere to put up this business, they will find a way how to gain the trust from the gambling community.",

That's why we don't require KYC from users.This response means you are 100% non-KYC casino which is a good thing, and what most members here always look out for from a casino and spiroll being a brand-new casino will definitely attract the right audience from this forum being a private site that does not require any form of verification from players. All the same, you will still need to spend time to build your reputation and a good way to do that is by offering some bonus like you already did $10 welcome bonus is good enough to attract new players that will give out feedback in the coming week.",
