I totally agree with you about getting a Cooper membership, but as I mentioned in my message, I'm having some financial problems and unfortunately I can't afford it right now.But thank you again for your kind message.Copper membership will just cost you 0.00108934 BTC or 28$ approximately but as an alternative. You can use https://talkimg.com/ to upload picture of your coins and probably put a price on it so that buyer will have an idea about the price.I’m interested to purchase some antique coins since I’m always seeing some of this on pawnstars show. Don’t use telegram as mode of communication because there’s a lot of scammer in there that will try to impersonate reputable member here just to scam you. Good luck with your sales.Btw what country are you located for shipping cost estimates?",

Try to find a service that allows the creation of an album that lets you easily scroll through everything. Ideally you can add some info on where you obtained the coins, if you do have a certificate or other credentials etc.Good luck with your sale.",

      "body": "Krytohaberweb,Welcome to the forum and I am very sorry to hear about your financial pressure right now. This is going to sound like I am a hater.I really know nothing about foreign coins so maybe there is good value there. I hope so. The USA coins in my opinion are not worth anything at best and they are a scam at worst. The 6th picture of several USA quarters, dimes and nickels all look like they are worth face value to me. They are in bad shape and are common. The Lewis and Clark nickel has either a hair or an error around the 'C' in cents. This may be a 'struck thru error' or a clash that would make it worth $2 - $5. Trade dollars in 1879 were all proof coins. Grades in MS60-62 are considered low grade and not very appealing. Yours looks like it has been heavily circulated and would not grade anywhere close to MS. Just to give you an idea, here is an MS 63 on Ebay (link below). I think your coin grades at least 20 points lower. The difference between a MS63 and an MS62 is a lot of money. An MS 45 proof is not going to sell for much.https://www.ebay.com/itm/185966156679?hash=item2b4c725b87:g:LQwAAOSwwwJkn3H0&amdata=enc%3AAQAIAAAAwDW%2BBHVNZXZjzE0hNLrV%2BGClm3l4CCRIoD8yufGZ%2FbQXeFw%2FCmG1ojRGvPtLJOg6kgu3Ng%2BKfBEPLiGMtFQ0VAeBzEJwJqwDuEpPlstrhlYDuGA1epr32X1qho2B8ipw1dQEnrdsW6GK5K9XsoNQp1DiM0svmIl70xgrISv2HFjiAM3Xs6%2BCcTGWSaPHvO5ifXfms1xom63RLTQlHhUXbwU0HhLflZ%2FIKI8dgnN2UbLaHIXL7a2VairolQGZJ2PE0Q%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR6qzqs-3YgIt's still a scarce coin so maybe you can find a buyer for $300 to $400. However, It looks fake to me. I wouldn't buy itThe Walking liberty is fake. They were not made in this year.The 1865 Washington is considered a counterfeit coin and not worth anything except as a curiosity. https://coinquest.com/cgi-bin/cq/coins.pl?coin=13689Your post isn't adding up very well. I would not recommend these coins to anyone on this forum.  You say you have thousands of coins and that you are an accomplished trader but this comes across as a scam. If you are down on your luck and truly in a bad place then I am sorry for that and hope the best for you.",

Any exchange that accepts coins will pay way below that (50-70%).Even worse... The other coins you showed seem to be \"pattern\" coins that don't have any numismatic value either. These are commonly found in markets intended to dupe buyers into thinking they bought silver. They are modern fakes made in China. For example: https://ibb.co/2YCz30DNo such quarter exists. The quality is the same across the other pattern coins. ---In the event that the seller posts the rest of his collection...There are many high quality counterfeits that make images insufficient to be able to authenticate. There are also examples of correct weighted coins (such as the saint gaudens $20) which were faked in the Middle East before 1970 to get around US gold restrictions.So if any higher end coins are listed by the seller... I strongly suggest to potential buyers that they have the coins tested while in escrow.Caution is advised.  ----To the seller... If you could, I suggest you post clear images of the rest of the collection. You can use sites like numista.com to catalogue them.",
