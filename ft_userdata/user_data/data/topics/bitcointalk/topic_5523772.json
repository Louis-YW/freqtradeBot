  "content": "Hello,I am trying to \"generate\" bitcoin addresses from 2014 to see if they have some satoshi. It's for a friend who think he has the passphrase and wants to see if the addresses have Bitcoin! I am using AI to create a script to do the following:write a script to create bitcoin P2PKH and P2SH formats valid addresses starting from several passphrase. Print the passphrase for each address indicating the address formats. Check also if the address has bitcoins. The scripts works but I do not know if these addresses are correct. I check on https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/ if these addresses exists and it tells me if they are P2PKH and P2SH format.Any ideas?Code:import hashlibimport base58import requestsdef generate_p2pkh_address(passphrase):    # Generate a public key from the passphrase    private_key = hashlib.sha256(passphrase.encode()).hexdigest()    public_key = hashlib.new('ripemd160', hashlib.sha256(bytes.fromhex(private_key)).digest()).hexdigest()        # Create P2PKH address    p2pkh_prefix = '00'    p2pkh_address = p2pkh_prefix + public_key    p2pkh_address_checksum = hashlib.sha256(hashlib.sha256(bytes.fromhex(p2pkh_address)).digest()).digest()[:4]    p2pkh_address += p2pkh_address_checksum.hex()    p2pkh_address = base58.b58encode(bytes.fromhex(p2pkh_address)).decode()        return p2pkh_addressdef generate_p2sh_address(passphrase):    # Generate a public key from the passphrase    private_key = hashlib.sha256(passphrase.encode()).hexdigest()    public_key = hashlib.new('ripemd160', hashlib.sha256(bytes.fromhex(private_key)).digest()).hexdigest()        # Create P2SH address    p2sh_prefix = '05'    p2sh_address = p2sh_prefix + public_key    p2sh_address_checksum = hashlib.sha256(hashlib.sha256(bytes.fromhex(p2sh_address)).digest()).digest()[:4]    p2sh_address += p2sh_address_checksum.hex()    p2sh_address = base58.b58encode(bytes.fromhex(p2sh_address)).decode()        return p2sh_addressdef check_balance(address):    response = requests.get(f'https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main/addrs/{address}/balance')    if response.status_code == 200:        return response.json()['final_balance']    return Nonepassphrases = ['passphrase1', 'passphrase2', 'passphrase3']for passphrase in passphrases:    p2pkh_address = generate_p2pkh_address(passphrase)    p2sh_address = generate_p2sh_address(passphrase)        p2pkh_balance = check_balance(p2pkh_address)    p2sh_balance = check_balance(p2sh_address)        print(f'Passphrase: {passphrase}')    print(f'P2PKH Address: {p2pkh_address}, Balance: {p2pkh_balance} satoshis')    print(f'P2SH Address: {p2sh_address}, Balance: {p2sh_balance} satoshis')",

That's what my friend was doing.So we are trying to generate valid bitcoin addresses (not on the blockchain, nor wallets), to check if those addresses contain bitcoins.I am trying to help him by having the script generate valid addresses but since 2014 the hashing to create the private/public keys have been changed so I am trying to figure out if the script above is valid to create bitcoin addresses created at that time.Does it make sense?thx for the comments!",

I'm assuming that you didn't use any wallets like Electrum, Bitcoin-qt (back then), Armory, etc? The hashing hasn't changed and P2SH and P2PKH were the most prominent address types back then. If you cannot remember how it was generated, then it would likely just be like finding a needle in a haystack.",

But if so, there is no way to find the coins without a wallet backup.",

The miner/wallet he used and such!If the script is correct and creates a valid address (for 2014 code) than I guess the passprhase/password he has are not correct since those addresses I generated with the script do not contain any coins!I will continue digging the issue to see if I can trace back to 2014 enviroment.Maybe will go to check the Bitcoin code back than.Thx for the help and if you get any idea pls post here!Happy Holidays!",

May Santa Claus be generous with you.I do not know how in 2014 mining worked in the sense, wallet and mining to the btc address happened at the same time?It was transparent to the miner? Not sure.From what he told, he used a password or passphrase which then lead to a BTC address and than mined to that address.He does not have a wallet file.Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on December 22, 2024, 04:13:37 PMQuote from: ganzocrypt on December 22, 2024, 01:21:45 PMIt's for a friend who think he has the passphrase and wants to see if the addresses have Bitcoin!

He knows that he mined some coins.I do not know what process was back than. I am guessing, enter a password and than everything else was not so explicit and than started to mine.I am not trying to brute force anything. As I explain we have a \"known\" passphrase / password and want to use the script to create the pkey which leads to an address to see if it exists and contains coins.The script above takes some passphrase or passowrd, creates pkey, than creates a valid address and than it checks if the address has bitcoin.",
