I guess it should be people who have forgotten their assets on the platform for a long time ago or have even lost access to the platform, which might have made them lose interest in the funds on such accounts, so it's possible that when the administrators realize that there are still some customers funds on their dashboard, they just have to forward mail over to all their customers instead of going through the stress of picking out those that are affected one after the other.According to the date on the content of the mail, the mail is supposed to have arrived in individual mail boxes before today. Because I received such mail today and the deadline for withdrawal is already two months away,  the mail could be considered obsolete. Or maybe the mail was sent to you a few months ago and you just happened to see it recently in your mailbox.",

We must have in mind how that site started when bitcoin price was really low, we are talking about $300 each BTC, and people used to move big amounts of bitcoin in those times, so, lost coins should be a big amount. By the way, I was taking a look to their block, and they say it was a business that generates $26M/year. i don't see a good reason to close it.",

In their own statement it's actually a very vague statement. Despite decline in trading volume and more, it could also be some regulatory pressure, like trying to force them to perform some kind of KYC or EU AML rules overhead. Midth of 2019 they had to stop offering in-person cash trading which might have been popular for some shady guys. (I'm not saying that in-cash trading is shady per se, but it is certainly interesting for criminals to launder cash.)Quote from: LocalBitcoins will discontinue its serviceDear Valued Customers,Originally LocalBitcoins was established to Bring Bitcoin Everywhere and drive global financial inclusion. We have honored that mission for over 10 years and we are proud of what we have achieved together with all of you, our loyal community.We are therefore sad to share, that regardless of our efforts to overcome challenges during the ongoing very cold crypto-winter, we have regretfully concluded that LocalBitcoins can no longer provide its Bitcoin trading service.We encourage all customers to withdraw their funds from LocalBitcoins and we ask you to proceed with withdrawing the Bitcoins from your LocalBitcoins wallet. You have 12 months to withdraw, however of course we encourage you to proceed withdrawing sooner.Thank you for being a part of the LocalBitcoins family! It has been our honor and pleasure to serve you over the last decade.Timeline for discontinuing the Bitcoin trading service:    2023-02-09 Suspension of new sign ups    2023-02-16        Suspension of trading on LocalBitcoins        Suspension of using LocalBitcoins wallet (with exception of withdrawing one's funds)    After 2023-02-17 LocalBitcoins customers will only be able to log-in to withdraw their Bitcoins. The trading and Wallet services will no longer be available at this point.We thank you for choosing LocalBitcoins for all these years and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.",

Not really a risk and the email is from local bitcoin and this is a standard procedure to make sure no one has funds left on the exchange before the final closure of their service and nothing more, and for the ops to have received the email means he has an account on LocalBitcoins and since the email is directed to all the registered customers the email will get delivered to them whether theirs have zero balance or some funds left in the wallets.Also, I don't think there is a need to fill in any sensitive information to withdraw if you have a balance other than just your wallet's public address.",

Yours Sincerely,LocalBitcoins Welp, I'm guessing it's the classic \"I forgot\" reason that lead them to still retain funds on localbitcoins even though the site's no longer up. In any case, I have three things in mind that's connected to this email you received OP.  From the looks of it this is an old email considering the due date for withdrawal's from two months back and it's a bummer you only saw this email a little late. For sure you're getting charged for it too. I suggest you take your funds out right there and then, transfer it to a self-custodial wallet, and secure it. You might even want to run it through a mixer if you're iffy about the security of the assets that are supposedly still in their custody just to make sure but if I were you, I'd take it and do everything I think is appropriate to retain most of my funds. But since you don't have any funds at all, I'm guessing this is an automated service email that Localbitcoin's put in place to inform people who still had funds on their wallet. They may have just made a mistake with the logistics but I think it's cool that at the very least they're letting people know instead of keeping the funds to themselves like any normal people would do. Or it could also be a scam lead by other people hoping to steal your information so they can beat you to your funds and steal it from you, basically a phishing scheme in replacement of the real localbitcoins email that was sent to people who really had funds kept in their account. Scammers sent it to all emails connected to localbitcoins in hopes of landing one belligerent newbie who'd fill in their credentials.",

This message is just to remind them to withdraw their funds and also to tell them about the changes to their terms of service, which took effect from the 16th of April, so i am surprised that this message is coming now, it should have come earlier, or maybe op just saw theirs.Quote from: seoincorporation on June 15, 2023, 05:07:58 PMBy the way, I was taking a look to their block, and they say it was a business that generates $26M/year. i don't see a good reason to close it.Localbitcoins said it is because of \"crypto-winter\", but i don't think it is correct. They were slowly losing their trading volume when they switched from a p2p exchange to a kyc exchange, their customers used to be people who wanted to trade p2p, so since the exchange stopped being a p2p exchange, they had to trade in other p2p exchanges, and that's why Localbitcoins lost most of their trading volume and eventually closed down.",

I think it may be a technical error, and the best thing to do, in my opinion, is to contact the support team if it is still working and inquire.Caution is required with regard to personal data, especially if you are sure that you do not have assets on the platform before it was closed.",
