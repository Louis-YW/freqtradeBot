I was previously able to do it without errors, but now I'm encountering two specific errors on my site (bnb.faucet.lol).The first error is:Fatal error: Uncaught PDOException: SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'IF NOT EXISTS first_used timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp()' at line 1 in /home/faucetl8/public_html/bnb/script/install.php:222 Stack trace: #0 /home/faucetl8/public_html/bnb/script/install.php(222): PDO->exec('ALTER TABLE `Fa...') #1 /home/faucetl8/public_html/bnb/script/common.php(152): include('/home/faucetl8/...') #2 /home/faucetl8/public_html/bnb/index.php(34): require_once('/home/faucetl8/...') #3 {main} thrown in /home/faucetl8/public_html/bnb/script/install.php on line 222And the second error is:Fatal error: Uncaught PDOException: SQLSTATE[42S21]: Column already exists: 1060 Duplicate column name 'users_returned' in /home/faucetl8/public_html/bnb/script/install.php:222 Stack trace: #0 /home/faucetl8/public_html/bnb/script/install.php(222): PDO->exec('ALTER TABLE `Fa...') #1 /home/faucetl8/public_html/bnb/script/common.php(152): include('/home/faucetl8/...') #2 /home/faucetl8/public_html/bnb/index.php(34): require_once('/home/faucetl8/...') #3 {main} thrown in /home/faucetl8/public_html/bnb/script/install.php on line 222I tried changing the character set to utf-8 unicode, and I've also tried deleting and recreating the database, but these actions didn't help.Does anyone have any suggestions on how to resolve these errors? I believe they are related to the SQL syntax and the existence of a column, but I'm not sure how to fix them.Thanks in advance for your help!",
