  "content": "This forum intended for Bitcoin related discussion and you can learn about Bitcoin especially from many high ranked reputable users. However beside learning Bitcoin, you can actually earn some money by offering your service, sell goods, signature campaign and bounties. It's not wrong to learn about Bitcoin and discuss with other users, also at the same time you can earn money too. But, many brand new users doesn't want to learn about Bitcoin and their sole purpose is to earn money. This wrong approach have been done by many new users, become a bounty hunter is wasting time and no have any journey.Take a look with this user Smking1212 he's a bounty hunter maximalist where almost of his posts posted on Bounties section (1296 from 1308 posts or 99%). Currently he already have 518 activity which is enough to become a Hero Member, but he never earn any single merit even he's an active user, that make he's still a newbie rank. It's pitiful to see many users didn't care anything with the forum and just doing what does he wanted in this forum.To be honest bounties is really wasting time, worthless and no have any positive impact for doing that. Bounty is wasting time because you need to spend your times to complete the bounty task, especially you're joining many campaigns. Bounty is worthless because the distributions isn't same as their beginning promise. They're promising the total pool is 1,000,000 tokens and it's will be worth $1/token, so we will think the pool is $1,000,000. But after few weeks the bounty ran, the team reduced the pool from 1,000,000 tokens to 500,000 tokens. Bounty hunters can't do anything since the team reserve the right to change anything about the campaign. Then after the bounty ended and the pool already distributed, the token price doesn't worth $1/token as their promise, now it's $0.00001/token.Bounty no have any positive impact because you're work like a robot by retweet, like, share, one liner comment, post the link etc. You're not learn anything and you don't have any knowledge about Bitcoin.Let me give you an example of the recent bounty that has been finished.ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ [Bounty][CAESAR]153,617.49% APY! CAESAR FINANCE [AVAX C-Chain] $CAESARðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ this bounty is managed by reputable campaign manager.The bounty reward they promised is 100,000,000 tokens worth $150,000 or $0.0015/token. But based on coinmarketcap the price right now is $0.00007859/token. The difference is $0.00142141/token it's really huge and yet any complaint from the hunters wouldn't change the token price. Based on the spreadsheet the average hunters get 25,000 tokens or $1.96475 after working for 4 weeks. The signature campaign participants got the highest share of 1914893 tokens or $150, but don't forget this token only listed on single unknown exchange named TraderJoe. Most of unknown exchanges will charge ridiculous fees even though the fees for the miners is cheap. On my experience I did using Hotbit for sell my shitcoins to Bitcoin and they ask 0.001 BTC/33 USD for the fees while the actual fee I paid for the miners is just $5.Don't forget bounties managed by reputable manager doesn't always guaranteed the project wouldn't scam, below there are some bounties the project turned become scam:scamðŸš§ [SCAM] Protocol X _______________________________ [ 1,000,000 BOUNTY POOL ] NeedforTurbo Bounty(SCAM TEAM)No one can stop scam bounties and the forum didn't moderated scam too, so we're better off to avoid all bounties and we wouldn't get scammed.",

And since we know that majority of people will chose the easy way even though it will give them way less money, no wonder that bounty campaigns are so popular. The bigger question here is why those projects even do bounty campaigns?Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on May 09, 2022, 06:37:52 AMIt does not mean that if you are bounty hunter your only purpose is to interact due to monetization alone but become an active member too contributing to this forum. True, but let's be honest here, how many bounty hunters are like that? As I said few days ago in another thread, it simply doesn't pay off to be a legit bounty hunter because there are so many of those with bunch of newbie alt accounts that are diluting the bounty pool.",

You should edit the title and include bounty campaign with mediocre project since not all campaigns results the same way.

Anyway not much effort and work done here since you are just sharing and reacting on social media. I've done this task before and this is too easy.",

This is one area that the merit system has been very productive. Though subjective, it has helped to discourage spamming. No matter how anyone wants to help that user, they're likely going to find it difficult what post to merit. It's that bad. There were occasions in the past that I took it upon myself to look for users who had zero merit but enough activities to senior rank so I could merit them. Sadly, most of those I found were users whose posts were basically bounty reports.OP, all you said about bounty not worth it is true. Bounty this day is like faucet.",

So I cant say that being in a btc paid campaign, is a waste of time especially when your campaign is a competitive one that rejects spamming. Like yours, @rikaflip. Also were being incentivized in posting, the only difference in altcoins is that majority there are no doubt shitposter. But completely the same falls in a form of bounty campaign.",

Let us know how that turns out.  Since many bounty campaigns are scams anyway, it's easy to change the payment method. Instead of paying you nothing in altcoins and worthless tokens, they can just pay you nothing in Bitcoin.I don't understand those participating in social media bounties these days. I really don't. The number of participants is so big that they consider themselves happy when they get a peanut after all the stakes are divided, but they still do it. it's a bit different if you create your own artworks, write blog posts, or do proper translations. Participating in bounties is one way to get some experience and create a portfolio before you start doing some more serious work.",

That explains the laxity in constructive posting. Those who post there may believe no one is strict in checking what they post and so any type of post goes for them. The idea could be that they begin to think that since they aren't well compensated, why should they over burden themselves with meaningful posts then. I think spam posting in bounties is dependent on both the bounty teams and the bounty managers. If these two are serious to play their paths well, they should be mindful who they enrol and also do a followup with post checks. Anything outside that, bounty will continue to be populated with shitposters.",
