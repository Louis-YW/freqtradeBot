  "content": "Router Protocol have developed a Layer 1 blockchain using Cosmos’ Tendermint Consensus to solve extant problems in Blockchain Interoperability. This will solve for Security and Scalability by unleashing the power of decentralization. Router Chain will provide a modular, composable framework for true-blue cross-chain dApps to be built in web3. This will help onboard the next billion users on to web3. The Devnet is now live: https://devnet-docs.routerprotocol.com/ Router unblocks and unites large blockchain networks like Polygon, Ethereum, and non-EVM ecosystems like Cosmos and Substrate-based chains by allowing delegation of cross-chain transactions that are not required to be performed on-chain like voting, fee calculations, etc. to Router Chain which acts as a data-aggregation layer. For example, cross-chain governance can be carried out directly via a governance contract on the Router chain, which can allow users to create and vote on proposals. The inbound and outbound modules will serve as a cross-chain synchronizer to communicate data and voting results between other chains (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, etc.) and the Router chain. Router chain’s relay architecture allows for the parallel execution of outbound requests. Since the relayer network is permissionless, each application can run its custom relayer to process its outbound requests. This way, an outbound request from one application bridge contract does not affect the outbound requests from another. Security is an essential aspect of any blockchain network. The Router chain derives its security from its underlying tendermint consensus engine with a decentralized network of validators.Router Chain offers 3 tiers of security at: 1) The Blockchain Level   2) Bridge Level   3) Application Level   Also, unlike most chains built using Cosmos SDK, Router chain will have full-fledged support for MetaMask (Consensys). Users will be able to:a) Add the Router chain to the list of networks on their MetaMask wallet.b) Import their Router chain assets and balances to their MetaMask wallet.c) Review transaction details, including tx data, gas price, and gas limit, and sign transactions directly from their MetaMask wallet while connected to the Router chain.For an infrastructure this robust, the applications could be endless. The use cases can range from cross-chain NFTs, cross-chain governance, and cross-chain stablecoins to cross-chain oracles and cross-chain marketplaces. A devnet starting from Block 0 with all the latest features mentioned above is NOW LIVE. Check out the block explorer at https://devnet-explorer.routerprotocol.com/Avalanche’s Fuji Testnet, Polygon’s Mumbai Testnet, BSC Testnet and Ethereum Goerli Testnet are supported on Router devnet as of now.
