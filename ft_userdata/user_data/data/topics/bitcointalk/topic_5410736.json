  "content": "They may not be dead, really when Bitcoin was created it wasn't as widely traded as it is now, I wasn't confident enough eitherand waited long enough to mine a large % of coins before openly releasing them to the world, may be the case with many Alt-Old-deadcoinsBasically no one trusts a new currency nowadays, but they can trust one that has been around for years (even if it is not commercialized)People today only look at what price it reached or at what price it can reach, that's it, in the future this will be even more shameless.We are overconfident in Bitcoin, and it is just because of the price.The world is not written man!, the changes are sudden!Imagine that in the future it is more \"ecologically viable\" to resurrect an old currency and not create it.Imagine campaigns that try to \"resurrect\" certain ancient currencies.There are projects TODAY that are accumulating \"dead\" coins in exchange for money, who tells you that this projectdo not see viable Revive a deadcoin if you see that it has 30% of the total supply?Not everything is said! (at least me) if i was a super dark businessman, i would mine a dead coin getting a lot of accumulation while others have no idea,I would improve the code but I would not implement it, and when nobody expects it, I would appear there, with any excuse, with bags full of hope.why in such a new world, people are so convinced? they seem to have the security of knowing how this whole world really works, it's crazy!!!There are tricks, hidden moves, manipulations, maybe you have swapped your currency v1 for v2, but the one that wins is v1 because you have helped reduce the supply...I would encourage you not to think so much about the cover and to delve into the life of the writer of the book.Or am I the one who needs help?",
