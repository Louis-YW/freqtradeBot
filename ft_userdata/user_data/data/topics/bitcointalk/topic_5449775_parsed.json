As the US strengthens more regulations, more money is looking for a new place to flow into. Recently, Hong Kong held the Web3 festival to show their determination to build a crypto hub in Asia. The new rules and favorable policies on crypto will be implemented in this June. I firmly believe that as long as the new window opens, endless hot money from China mainland and all over the world will be flooding into the crypto market in Hong Kong. All cryptocurrencies will see a bull run for a while. By the way, our project FireDAO is in progress and please feel free to contact me should you have any inquiries.",

I think this set back is due to people cashing out from the airdrops rewards and even the btc buyers at 17k to 18k level. Its already a massive profits and probably they are taking some gains. Its quite normal and people tends to spend on some new testnet and potential airdrops. I think thats more likely to happen at some point. But bull run isnt gonna happen in just few months right away.",

It's definitely a good idea to have that festival and a crypto hub in Asia. Anyway, does your project have something to do with the crypto hub, OP?",

I think thats more likely to happen at some point. But bull run isnt gonna happen in just few months right away. This airdrop farming as it happened with Arbitrum, can't go on for much longer in my opinion. The reason for that is simple, a lot of people made quite a lot of money with the Arbitrum airdrop. The news about this attracted even more airdrop farmers and hunters. So it is pretty safe to say, that the next airdrop, if it happens, will have at least twice the amount of participants than the one of Arbitrum. This means everyone only gets half the amount of money and if that is the case, that whole airdrop hunting will become less attractive again. So i doubt that we will see more airdrops that have a value of 1B$ or more in total so soon again.",

Southeast Asia countries do not affect the price, but for a long period, China and several countries were the factors that were used in the spread of FUD and made the price decline.In recent years, the price has shown immunity against such news, so China ban or positive legislation from Hong Kong will not affect the price.Quote from: FireDAOJackie_Z on April 22, 2023, 09:49:30 AMBy the way, our project FireDAO is in progress and please feel free to contact me should you have any inquiries.So the basic purpose of creating this topic is to promote this service.

Now the market has quite naturally gone to correction, so I expect fall down to 20-25% from current highs, which were shown by the top cryptocurrencies a week ago. In summer, by the way, the market is almost always bearish or does not move at all, so you should hardly count on the summer bull run.",

The fun about crypto is that everybody haves its own predictions. We saw a setback of around 10% which is not so major as we have had a lot worse and as long as we stay above 25,000$ there is no real need to panic. I think everybody hopes for another bullrun and I think the question is not if it will happen but when it will happen.",
