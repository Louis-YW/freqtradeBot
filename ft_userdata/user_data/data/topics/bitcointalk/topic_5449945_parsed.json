Bitcointalk members are so smart to detect. I checked many Thread for this purpose where individual site are reported.

The idea of ​​this topic is good, but how to collect this massive number of domains in a list will not be easy, so it is better to educate people on how to secure their wallets and not fall victim to these sites because if they know that, it is impossible for them to be deceived.",

I like your initiative and also appreciate that you care and are concerned about members so that they don't land on phishing scam sites and lose their money especially if it is related to cryptocurrency sites. However, if you will search on Google, you will find there are a lot of phishing sites, and new phishing pop up every day that it is impossible to keep track of them.I would suggest bookmarking the exchange/wallets/investment sites that we visit often so that we don't land on scam site if we search those sites. Secondly, i have seen google ads showing many scam sites at the top when you search for any site, so better avoid using Google search. I prefer to use DuckDuckGo search engine (https://duckduckgo.com)",
