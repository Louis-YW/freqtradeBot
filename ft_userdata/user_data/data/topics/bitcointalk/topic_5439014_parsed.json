Of course this is debatable but some investor would feel bad for this news if ever they push through with this path. What can you say about this? If this would turn out to be true, then this would definitely be a big blow for the crypto space i think. For me (and i think also for a lot of other people that are investing money into cryptocurrency space) cryptos are a chance of financial freedom. It would be a dream, if someday i would have enough funds staked in order to be able to get a significant return each months back in the form of interest. May it be over the native staking that some assets are offering, like Cosmos or Radix or Ethereum. Or through the staking on yield farms where you can stake single assets or LP's. So if that would no longer be possible it would really hurt the market.",

      "body": "https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25Kraken to Discontinue Unregistered Offer and Sale of Crypto Asset Staking-As-A-Service Program and Pay $30 Million to Settle SEC Charges.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE2023-25Washington D.C., Feb. 9, 2023 —The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Payward Ventures, Inc. and Payward Trading Ltd., both commonly known as Kraken, with failing to register the offer and sale of their crypto asset staking-as-a-service program, whereby investors transfer crypto assets to Kraken for staking in exchange for advertised annual investment returns of as much as 21 percent.To settle the SEC’s charges, the two Kraken entities agreed to immediately cease offering or selling securities through crypto asset staking services or staking programs and pay $30 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.According to the SEC’s complaint, since 2019, Kraken has offered and sold its crypto asset “staking services” to the general public, whereby Kraken pools certain crypto assets transferred by investors and stakes them on behalf of those investors. Staking is a process in which investors lock up – or “stake” – their crypto tokens with a blockchain validator with the goal of being rewarded with new tokens when their staked crypto tokens become part of the process for validating data for the blockchain. When investors provide tokens to staking-as-a-service providers, they lose control of those tokens and take on risks associated with those platforms, with very little protection. The complaint alleges that Kraken touts that its staking investment program offers an easy-to-use platform and benefits that derive from Kraken’s efforts on behalf of investors, including Kraken’s strategies to obtain regular investment returns and payouts“Whether it’s through staking-as-a-service, lending, or other means, crypto intermediaries, when offering investment contracts in exchange for investors’ tokens, need to provide the proper disclosures and safeguards required by our securities laws,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. “Today’s action should make clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair, and truthful disclosure and investor protection.”“In case after case, we’ve seen the consequences when individuals and businesses tout and offer crypto investments outside of the protections provided by the federal securities laws: investors lack the disclosures they deserve and are harmed when they don’t receive them,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Today, we take another step in protecting retail investors by shutting down this unregistered crypto staking program, through which Kraken not only offered investors outsized returns untethered to any economic realities, but also retained the right to pay them no returns at all. All the while, it provided them zero insight into, among other things, its financial condition and whether it even had the means of paying the marketed returns in the first place.”In addition to ceasing the staking program and the monetary relief, Payward Ventures, Inc. and Payward Trading, Ltd, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC’s complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, that would permanently enjoin each of them from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and permanently enjoin them and any entity they control from, directly or indirectly, offering or selling securities through crypto asset staking services or staking programs.",

SEC made Kraken end staking today in the US.It's not that the SEC is stupid, its that Gensler is of the idiotic opinion that banning is protecting and so he seems to want to just randomly ban things in crypto for no other reason than he doesn't like crypto.They can't ban staking or mining. But they can ban companies offering staking. And that is what they are now doing, starting with Kraken. They have no ability to stop individuals from staking, but they can use the legal power of the government to stop companies from doing whatever. This kinda highlights the whole reason why Bitcoin and decentralized services are so important in society - decentralized sovereign money and monetary services that can't be stopped. Anything with a company attached to it (most of Crypto - exchanges, altcoins, most \"De\"Fi services) can be taken down by the government. SEC is highlighting the populations need for Bitcoin with what they just did to Kraken today and are obviously going to follow it up by shutting down staking services on other exchanges.",

So this isn't ban on staking really, it's ban on centralized third party services like exchanges used for staking? While this will bring prices down, this could actually be good for decentralization. People would need to run their own nodes if staking as a service is not an option anymore. Will this affect on staking services like Lido DAO as it isn't maintaining eth infrastructure either or are they too decentralised for control?",
