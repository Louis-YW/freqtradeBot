  "content": "We can just skip market analysis, not put in any effort or time, and have someone else handle our trading. It sounds almost too good to be true, doesn't it? That's what copy trading offers us, but can we really trust it?There are a few things to consider when evaluating the legitimacy of copy trading. First, you need to make sure that the platform you're using is regulated and has a good reputation. There are a number of scams out there, so it's important to do your research.Second, you need to carefully select the traders you want to copy. Some traders have a better track record than others. Make sure you look at their performance history and read their reviews before you commit any money.Finally, you need to remember that copy trading is still an investment, and there is always the risk of losing money. Even if you're copying a successful trader, there's no guarantee that they will continue to be successful in the future.So, is copy trading legitimate? Yes, it can be a legitimate way to invest if you do your research and select the right traders. However, it's important to remember that there is always the risk of losing money, even with copy trading.",

It sounds almost too good to be true, doesn't it? That's what copy trading offers us, but can we really trust it?It's not a must that we go through analysis efforts, once the copy trade could do it for us, I see no reason why we don't utilize it, especially when we don't know how to trade or have busy schedules. But the issue is how to get the right strategy provider, and what I've seen in my long years of trading even before the dominance of cryptocurrency is that they don't often work, and those who work well do not last, and those that last without ruining copier's account do not have a convincing record to quantify the number of years they use in achieving their tiny success.For this, my conclusion is that copy trade could be good only if traders could do their due diligence. But they still have to be sure that they are monitoring the provider actively after initially certifying it as a trusted one. This could limit the damage the provider could do to the account because, after some good records, they don't often replicate it.",

They might look like good traders because of their less-than-2-years-long track record, but a huge majority of them end up losing money in the end.I’d say only do copytrading if you want to have a little bit of “fun” with some of your spare cash.",

Those who you want to copy are still under some losses as self trader but they learnt the copy trading technique to market to people that don't want to learn. If someone has a better trading technique, he is likely going to use it for himself and family, this is suppose to be a right thinking way for users of bot traders and copy followers",

And besides that it is important for beginners to do their own research before choosing a copy trading platform. And it is also important for beginners to remember that profits are not guaranteed for copy trading, and don't make copy trading your permanent method and you also have to learn the knowledge related to trading and it is also very important to manage risk well and always use money that you can afford to lose .",

What the beginners should realize is that copy trading is the name of the way you are trading, but who you copy matters the most. If you copy someone that does amazingly great profits then you are going to make the same profits, if you follow someone who loses too many times in a row then you are going to end up with no profit and no money left.This means that copy trading doesn't mean that you will profit or lose, just the name itself doesn't give anything, you should be trading based on what you have and if you have something that benefits you then you are going to end up with a profit eventually for sure.",

So the question is basically saying \"Is an apple an orange?\"If you are tempted to use copy trading because you think you'll get profit if you copy Person A activity because he has a good history, you'll be disappointed. You'll find that anything can happen in the future as it's unpredictable/random. What you're doing is like reading the recent year's performance of Mutual Fund X, which is great, and thinking that it will yield the same profit in the future.",

This is the reason why copy trading may not create a positive image at some point due to those unreliable sources for copy trading.  Thank you for highlighting that copytrading is not a foolproof trading strategy with a guaranteed 100% success rate. Please understand, copytrading is an extremely effective and useful strategy, especially for beginners and busy investors who don't have much time to devote to trade setups. I also utilize copytrading occasionally, but it frustrates me when certain platforms promote it as an infallible method, leading people to blindly rely on it in hopes of guaranteed success. There are valid reasons why reputable copy trading platforms like Bitget allow users to review the track records of traders they intend to copy and why they have a wide selection of skilled traders available. This is to ensure that users conduct proper research, make careful selections, and have multiple options to consider before investing. Else, you can end up losing your funds alongside the trader you copied. It is in this light I am saying that it shouldn't be perceived as a 100% success guarantee strategy but of course, a useful and legitimate strategy.",
