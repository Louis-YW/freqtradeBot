  "content": "Stompix said it is a flood in Orenburg , Russia. There was flood in Dubai but not this image. But this does not change my question.This was part of the flood in Dubai recently. The rain that should have fallen in almost 3 years fell in just one day and the whole of the city were flooded. It is possible that doors and windows and wardrobes were broken. Can steel or titanium sheet survive this? It might probably has been swept away from the house into the ocean.",

Steel can still be damaged by corrosion if submerged in water for too long - but titanium may be more resistant.It's hard to guess that the steel sheet would still be in a safe place in the event of such a devastating natural disaster. So it's best for someone who can still access their wallet via cellphone or laptop to back up their seeds again to a safer place, or move them to a new wallet.",

Yes the phrase will still be on the steel sheet but as you have stated would be washed away with many things except if it is possibly stored in a container or wardrobe that is unmovable by the flood and locked properly again, then they’re is a good chance it would still be there. Regardless of what happen, once you have large amounts of savings in a wallet then it is advised to duplicate your seed phrase back up to different locations. This particular case explains why it is important to do that.",

Although I know we do not usually prepare for things like this so having a tracking chip place on the inside of the titanium would not cross the mind of the owner. Lastly, we should have a backup plan for the main backup.",

Then it is no longer just the water that is the danger in your steel plate. It could bump into other metals or sharp things that may or may not cause it to break. If it’s in a container however then most likely it will be very safe even in a flood.",

I'd agree to zaguru, that's the next thing if the owner survives as well with that kind of flood but usually, there's a rescue response before a house or city gets drowned and flooded like that.Quote from: _act_ on April 26, 2024, 08:01:17 PMIt might probably has been swept away from the house into the ocean.Exactly, not just to oceans but can also be burry down by the things that are flowing in the flood. So, someone who has his seeds that are engraved, it's best to have it like a dog tag as another backup or if it's in metal plate, make sure that you're able to bring it before some disasters like great floods comes in to your area.",

Steel can still be damaged by corrosion if submerged in water for too long - but titanium may be more resistant. it didn't even occur to you that the steel or titanium safe (assuming that was what it was) must have been sitted on a basement, in the locker room or somewhere else? If that's the case, then there's no guarantee of safety... It would make much more sense if anyone speculated that there was some metalwork done - in that the safe was glued, maybe with an epoxy unto an installed metal (maybe the foundation pillars or something)... If it's the former, then I'll consider it a false story as it's impossible to weld a steal.Quote from: Stalker22 on April 26, 2024, 08:54:58 PMThe question isn't whether your seed backup can survive the disaster, but rather how its location is secured?  Will you be able to find it after a devastating event like this?  you'll never know how you'd react until it eventually happens to you; At this point, the only thing that matters to you in life is \"LIFE ITSELF\"",

Honestly, when natural disaster hits, it is very easy to forget things like hardware wallets because the primary concern will be how to save lives. According to Google, Titanium is water resistant.QuoteTitanium resists all forms of corrosive attack by fresh water and steam to temperatures in excess of 600°F (316°C). The corrosion rate is very low or a slight weight gain is experienced. Titanium surfaces are likely to acquire a tarnished appearance in hot water steam but will be free of corrosionFor a Titanium coated sheet,  if it is spared and not washed away, then the seed phrase will be safe. On the contrary, steel is not resistant to sea water under prolonged exposure, so seed phrase engraved in steel coated sheet is not safe when exposed to sea water.",

If it is just casually kept in an unsafe place, definitely the flood will sweep it off to a different location where I might be found by another person or where it can't be seen again. But if it's kept in a safe metallic box or embedded in a non-decomposable material and buried under the earth, there's no way it can not survive this kind of flood. Secondly, a secret phrase should not only be kept in one source because, in situations like this, you might not even be able to go to the location where you kept your seed phrase, but if there is another nearby location within your reach where you kept another piece of that phrase, you can just get that one.",

Dubai has never been able to take advance preparation for this terrible flood so without advance preparation it becomes very difficult for a country to deal with the overall flood situation. Now coming to the consideration of bitcoin holders, if a bitcoin holder in Dubai keeps all his bitcoins in a device in the basement of a building, think for yourself how reasonable his bitcoins would be in this flood situation. You can imagine how much bitcoins have been recovered from the devices kept on the ground floor from the flooded places like the airport, shopping malls, supermarkets, etc. in Dubai. Security system/Seed phase of Bitcoin wallet should be selected as a sustainable storage method in all these flood affected areas. In that case Google Drive can be used or a device should be selected to store the Phases words in a place where there is no chance of being submerged even if flooded.",

Just like the steel sheet, any other item can as well be swept away by the flood if the flood is that heavy to sweep away everything inside the house or even the whole house. The materials used in constructing this steel sheets cannot easily be destroyed unless left inside the water for a very long time. So, if the steel sheet is still accessible after the flood, everything will still be intact and water wouldn’t have done any damage to it if found early as it takes time for corrosion to affect steel sheet even if they’re prone to corrosion and takes longer time for a titanium sheet as they can resist corrosion than steel.",

That's a droll Question mate!But anyway, let's talk about it. In my opinion indeed, steel or titanium sheet can survive the flood. Because both of them have the quality to keep his shape and structure for a long time. If a flood comes and the seed phrase has drowned in the flood so steel or titanium sheet have the ability to keep its shape or structure intact for like 2-3 days so it doesn't rust or something else.  So it means to say that first you need to keep his seed phrase safe at home. Whatever flood comes to your house and drowns everything you should leave it in the same place because if some mud sticks from the flood, then hopefully you will recover it. So this is my opinion according to this question that yes, both can serve in floods.",
