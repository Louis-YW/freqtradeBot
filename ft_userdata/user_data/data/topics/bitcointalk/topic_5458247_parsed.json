Let's get your thoughts. Let's dive into the benefits of social media itself, the intention for this advanced technology is to get everyone along with development trends by creating a fun fair plaforms people from across the world could meet, relate and discuss on many aspects of life, it could also be informative, educative and transformational, but it's a pity that some people have taken extra steps away from this to suit their selfish interest by using social media to scam and attack people in many ways, fake news is also what is going not too well through the social media aside diverse opportunities tht comes through the social media.",

Let's get your thoughts. It all depends on the individual, and how he is using social media apps. Social media has both positive and negative impacts. Personally, I use social media for marketing and getting information about investment opportunities, and studying. However, It is important to look for the negative impacts as well. One main drawback is \"time wastage.\" Privacy is another concern that needs to be addressed.",

Let's get your thoughts. It varies to the effect that's happening per person. To me, I'd say that it's on the positive side for adults and working people but for young adults, teens, and kids, social media should be a place that they should avoid staying and spending a lot of time. My country is considered to be one of the most people that's staying and using social media nearly half of day and that's no good for most people in here that don't have anything to do with social media but just keeps on browsing with contents that has no use and help to their lives.",

Further more many celebrities around the world today  has accumulated more wealth through social media as well, so I ask; Social media for me has done more good than evil. The rate of poverty would have been more if not for social media but more youths have tapped from the benefits of social media. At least Mark Zuckerberg's age is within the youth age and he is rich from creating Facebook. Many other entrepreneurs social media platforms are making the world an entertaining place to be, Snapchat, YouTube, content creation, jobs accessibility online, gaming and casinos etc. All those and more are courtesy social media. The list of benefit is endless and moreover communication which seem to be very important in the day to day activities of mankind are all made more fostered through social media.Quote from: Victan22 on July 01, 2023, 03:17:33 PM   So far from various individuals views would you say that social media has made more negative impact than the positive side? Let's get your thoughts. This is mostly the government view that social media is producing negative results especially countries from third world or the ones that are known as technologically less developed. These government don't want to be criticized, they want to keep riding on the soldiers of the people and they don't want dissenting opinion or voice but they also forget that some of their policies get to the people through same social media. It is just a case of speaking with different side of the mouth.",

It is just that in every good thing,there are dubious people who will take advantage of it to scam people through it. Anything that brings people together will have some people that are not honest because it has the features of a society. In a society we have people from different background and different characters and upbringing. Personally I think that social media has done more good to the world than bad. It has become a means of advert for some business owners and for entertainment. Music,football and so much. It has serve as a means of income for celebrities and influencers.",

Social media is distracting and will make you lose focus if you are not careful with it. Many people are more addicted to social media than other things like gambling etc. and it is still bad because it will consume your useful time on nonsense non educational things that will most times do not add any value to you. There is a good side to it which is to help people socialize, but it is abused a lot, and it has also made people feel less of themselves like they are not doing enough from the fake life other people show there.",

There was a time that tweeter was restricted by the government of Nigeria because people were speaking out what was wrong in governance. You can't beat a child and tell him or her not to cry, that is not possible because it will amount to inhuman reaction. Social media platforms have given voices and created enormous wealth to people who never expected they will get to where they are today and moreover it has exposed many to different talents, comedy etc.",

So, here's my two cents: social media is like a double-edged sword, right? Sure, we've all seen those cringe-worthy rumor mills and attention seekers doing their thing, but let's not forget the flip side.  I personally know this guy who kickstarted his small biz solely through socials – crazy, huh?i think in the height of the pandemic, social media has become a tool that really helped all of us since no one could go out of their homes, everyone instead was forced to use the internet to do everything they used to do in their daily lives this was a hard time but social media proved itself worthy during this time we got to connect with everyone without risking our own health and some of us even discovered hobbies and interests through social media that we otherwise would have not discovered and like you said just like your guy, a lot started their online businesses which helped a lot of people survive through the pandemic despite the economic downturn it caused",

Don't get me wrong, social Media has indeed changed for good the way most of the people on the planet interact with one another, it has helped people to keep communication regardless of the distances, but it has also served as a tool to manipulate, belittle and even destroy the life of many. There have even been some studies which have concluded that the use of certain social media like Instagram is harmful to the psycholgical well being of teens. It would rather to have more days on the calendar which helped people to be aware of social issues like access to food, racial discrimination or violence against men.",
