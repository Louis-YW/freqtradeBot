  "content": "I will not say that bitcoin and gambling ate the same because bitcoin is a digital currency,while gambling is an activity that is carried out by human for pleasure.From my own point of view bitcoin and gambling have some similarities in common for someone that want to partake in them. These are as follows :--Use money that you can afford to lose: This applies to both. If one wants to invest in bitcoin, you will be advised to use the money that is not made for other important needs to buy bitcoin. So that going into long term investment can generate you with a good profit. One the other hand if you use the money for your important needs to purchase bitcoin,when the time comes for you to be in need of the money, you will end up selling your bitcoin even though that the price is below what you bought it. You might still end up selling your bitcoin due to panic and this will lead you to lost. This goes with gambling, if you don't use the money that you can afford to lose,you have paralyzed the fun in gambling,because if you are losing, you might keep on chasing your lost and this will lead to to losing all that you have on you.--Having the knowledge of it : Anyone that wants to invest in bitcoin needs to have the proper knowledge of it. This will enable you to monitor your investment and to be patient with it,until when the bull market arrives,you can sell if you are okay with the profit that has accumulated. You indeed need the knowledge to know how to secure you bitcoin and the type of wallet,in order to safe guard your investment from scammers and being victim to centralized exchanges.  Likewise gambling, if you don't have the knowledge of the game that you want to stake on,you will end up losing every time that you play. This is because you lack the skill and strategy you need to win the game. For example poker,you will only win on your lucky day,since gambling sometimes is based on luck.--Part of human nature : Bitcoin is a digital currency and it is important that human have something of great value,in which they come in agreement to be used for trading and it will be accepted worldwide for easy transactions. Before fiat currency came into existence, cowries,silver and gold was use for international trade. Fiat currency took over from gold,bitcoin is an alternative currency which can be used for international transactions in replace of fiat currency.  Likewise gambling, which has been in existence since the creation of man,because gambling is part of human nature and human invented gambling,because it is a means of entertainment and for fun.--Patience : Bitcoin investment needs patient for an investor to make profit from it,it is not a get rich quick investment. After the halving,when bitcoin ATH comes,only the patient ones will make huge profit from their investment, regardless of how much that they invested.  Likewise gambling, you need to be patient with your gambling activities and don't let your emotions control you and don't be greedy,so that you can easily quit the game you are losing and try again tomorrow, with the hope that tomorrow will be a lucky day.--Discipline : Investing on bitcoin needs discipline for you to be able to accumulate more coins for yourself during the bear market and hold for long,till the bull market. Some persons can't just take their mind of their savings. They easily go to their savings,if they are faced with little difficulties that they can take care of without touching their savings. It is one thing to have a savings and another thing not to temper with your savings till the appropriate time that you planned for.  Gambling also needs discipline, which I will call self-control. When you don't have self-control over your gambling activities, by setting out an amount and a particular time duration for gambling, you might end up to become an addict, which is unhealthy to human.--Fun and entertainment : Finally,accumulating you bitcoin gradually and seeing the price pump gradually time to time,gives you joy and you will be excited towards the price pump. I know this might be wrong to some other persons but this is what I feel.Tell me what is your opinion on this.",

      "body": "Theirs is no way this two are similar except if you’re relating gambling to Alticoins.1. Investing what you can afford to lose doesn’t carry the same meaning between bitcoin and gambling. As for bitcoin it simply means you should invest an amount you can turn your eye away from from a very long time not necessarily you lose everything like that of gambling. You only experience a lost when you sell at a lower price but on gambling you lose everything. With bitcoin you can never lose everything.2. Having Knowledge is essential in bitcoin but the only knowledge only lies on how to safe one’s funds on different set of wallets but you acquire broader knowledge when you have the intention to trader. But for holding it doesn’t need much of a knowledge that most gamblers needs to understand the game. Gambling knowledge looks more harder considering one needs to understand almost everything about the games or sports he is playing",

      "body": "I don't know why you're equating the two, maybe crypto and gambling would be more appropriate. The two are even different and they are opposites. Crypto is more dominated by digital currency investments and there is no direct gambling in it. Gambling itself is betting activities, slot games and such that rely on luck. Having knowledge in both is not a similarity, but even in all fields must understand what is being done. If you understand, of course you can do it. Gambling mostly depends on luck, but crypto investments such as trading require knowledge to be able to analyze the market, open guesses or the like.",

It can be used to buy goods and services online or in real life, and unlike money stored at banks it can't be seized by anyone, it's anonymous, and transactions using it are public and can't be rollback. So unlike gambling it brings progress to humanity.",

While its price has certainly fluctuated wildly over the years, Bitcoin's underlying technology and the benefits it offers make it much more than just a speculative asset. And let us not forget about the potential for Bitcoin to empower people in countries with unstable currencies or weak financial systems.As for the comparison with gambling, you can do that with almost any type of investment, including traditional stocks and bonds.",

They're even calling bitcoin as a sort of gamble and anyone who invests on it is considered \"betting\" their money on it. Well, let those people think what bitcoin and gambling are but we all knew what bitcoin actually is and that won't change our minds. It's just an overwhelming response that they can't take some sort of innovation that can be seen all in just one asset. A cryptocurrency that has its own payment system, ledger for its records, being a store of value and the call for decentralization as its nature and characteristic.",

      "body": "So maybe we can see any similarities or a resemblance between bitcoin and gambling. Bitcoin is a currency just like fiat's USD and EUR and these casinos will use many currencies in order to cater to as many clients as possible. Bitcoin's growth over the years prompted casinos and sports betting companies to adopt the currency to further boost their clients worldwide just like when they want to add more local currencies from various countries.When it comes to investing there are risks so maybe this is the same with gambling. Casino games though are mostly based on luck but we have card games and sports betting that is partly more on analysis in order to win which is somewhat similar to bitcoin charting using technical indicators and fundamental analysis.",

Surely you are someone who doesn't gamble, you only know the gambling world from a distance and from some extreme cases you have known, and you take those extreme cases as the generality. Saying that is like saying that people who drink alcohol end up alcoholics or that people who use kitchen knives do it to murder. Most gamblers gamble money they can afford on an activity that can be considered entertainment, like going to the movies or dining out, but with the difference that at the end of the night you can occasionally walk away with more money than you came with (here I do not take into account those who play sports betting or poker in a more professional way, and get regular profits for it).Then, yes, there are the addicts, the problem gamblers, the ones who steal money from their mother or wife to keep gambling, but that is far from the norm.",
