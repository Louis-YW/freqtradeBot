I have a few in my library including some crypto crafts too. I got the idea from \"The Bitcoin Cafe\" in Bangladesh though they don't accept Bitcoin lol.However, I always had the same thought in mind, people may get interested but would never order because of their privacy.

Personally, I delete any sensitive data in PMs once its not needed, but no one can verify that except theymos. However, when it comes to a site you control, no one at all will be able to verify that you remove or don't store the data. Since you need some data to be physically able to ship items, you have to store it for a small period of time at the very least. If you could come up with a system which was able to prove removal, and no data been extracted then I'd be very impressed, but as far as I'm aware it simply cannot be done.",

I know this isn't easy.Right now, I'm finding 3 ways:- The customer (you) uses mailbox addresses or virtual addresses. Cause all countries have this kind of services. That way the seller (me) only knew that address, where he would send the order.- To register the order, use encrypted form services, such as this one: https://blocksurvey.io/ I'm not saying I would use this one, it's just an idea. Had to investigate further (suggestions accepted).- When placing the order, no information will be requested that connects the person who is placing the order to the user here on the forum.Is it the ideal model? Maybe not, but it's the only way at the moment, that it's possible to make transactions of this kind, without compromising on a large scale the user's privacy.What do you think about these points?Quote from: The Pharmacist on October 14, 2022, 04:24:22 PMAnd not for nothing, but I'm really hoping someone creates a commemorative coin for bitcointalk's 15th or 20th anniversary.  I wish I could help make that happen, but I've got nothing to offer.  But OP, I'd be willing to buy something as long as that something is of good quality and something I can keep as a forum collectible.  Minerjones made those BTC pennies back when Zepher died in 2019, and though I only knew him by reputation they mean something to me because I see them as part of bitcointalk's history.Quote from: tranthidung on October 14, 2022, 04:10:13 PMI suggest if you want to create something, you should focus on important events in history of Bitcoin especially Bitcointalk.org forum.Great idea.  It might be hard to sell, but I'd love to see something commemorate the start of the merit system.  It's hard to overstate its importance, and it was a major change that had both immediate and long-lasting effects.I have this kind of idea, and I've been trying to explore it for over 3 years. I can say that since almost 5-6 years. I still believe that it is possible to find a model that works.This idea is super interesting, I also have plans. But first we have to find the ideal way to carry out the transactions.At this first moment, the idea is to have an object that just mentions something, where only people who really know the forum would notice. For example, a logo with the text \"I am Legendary\".Regarding the type of object, everything is still open. It doesn't have to be clothes, in fact I even thought about other things (although I didn't mention it in the research). For example, what do you think of \"Mouse Pad\"?@The Pharmacist think we can talk better later to share ideas via DM?",
