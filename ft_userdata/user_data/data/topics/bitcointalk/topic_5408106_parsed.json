      "body": "Although the article isn't about Bitcoin, but since the title claims that Bitcoin is helping to eradicate poverty in poor countries, here's my couple of Sats. Bitcoin contributes a little in eradicating poverty. Such contribution may even be insignificant in uplifting the poor from their situation. In terms of poverty, I personally think that it is almost entirely useless to make the poor their own bank. It's not what they need. It is probably wrong to overemphasize that the poor are unbanked. The poor don't need bank accounts. They need the most basic of needs. It is false empowerment for the poor to open him/her a savings account in a bank.

In conclusion, bitcoin is not the solution in this case.Yes, it's just a marketing article posted by Electroneum official website to promote its cryptocurrency. People behind this project promise to reward adopters up to 3$ monthly, althought further informations and details are missing.For people living in poor areas it would be awesome to earn an extra 3$ every month just by using an app on their mobile devices or adopting a cryptocurrency without any investments, but I guess it's not sustainable for real.Talking about the role of bitcoin on this matter, it will be effective once more online jobs and opportunities become disponible for everyone, so people can get paid in BTC when working remotely, especially those living in rural areas far from the civilization.",

For example as a currency, people would still have to work to earn it so it can't really eradicate poverty if they can't work already! As an investment you still need money to invest in bitcoin and to get out of poverty you'd need a considerable amount, we know someone who is defined as \"poor\" doesn't have extra money to invest in first place otherwise they wouldn't be considered poor.In any case you posted a clickbait!Quote from: Flyingjack123 on July 30, 2022, 01:53:30 AMI think we need to focus on educating people on crypto.

You mean bitcoin not crypto because if you tell people to buy altcoins all they are going to experience is losses and that would make them poorer!",

But yes I find this idea intriguing, if we can use bitcoin as a tool to eradicate poverty. Yes there are many ways bitcoin and blockchain can help people to achieve a decent income, if used properly, it has made people really rich. Blockchain tech has opened doors for new jobs, which can be done even remotely while sitting in a rural setting, thus helping many to earn decently. This happened in many African countries.",

If this was the case, all \"poor\" country would make the use of bitcoin to get rid of poverty. The author of the article would probably be seen highly for showing the people the way to get rid of poverty. But no, it is not going to happen. Bitcoin is just another medium of payment and nothing else. It won't remove poverty or anything. Do you really think the poor will be able to invest in bitcoin? Even if they can, they shouldn't based on how volatile the market is.",

      "body": "The issue of poverty or wealth also needs to be considered more fairly here. I don't think economic benefits will bring a completely good direction when social problems are always present. The perception of life is not always easy to tie together if it does not bring happiness to the parties in a positive and correct way, assuming a family just needs to have a simple life and doesn't want to. If they are plagued with problems of greed, delusion, or self-indulgence, they don't necessarily strive to become rich. So I also strongly support the fact that Bitcoin brings a lot of balance to life, but it is also difficult to express whether each of us is looking at the interests of ourselves or the community in the right direction.",

Getting qualified on those jobs requires some educational degree which poor countries often don't have unless the government will sponsor their education or a well-funded private company will do it for free.I don't really think bitcoin is the key to eradicate poverty as it is much more of an investment for me rather than a currency. Like pooya87 said, how can it help the people if it needs money to acquire it. Even us who are properly educated and can afford to buy it don't think bitcoin will lift us from our current financial status that easily.",

Yes, if they can think about what will happen in the future and are willing to open themselves to accept new things, bitcoin can give them the opportunity to earn a source of income for their lives.

I wonder if these ideas will work now. GitHub shows the development activity of this project a year ago.As for Bitcoin and poor countries, this is also a utopia. Poor people live one day. They are interested in providing for their families, and they simply have nothing to invest in bitcoin.In addition, information about bitcoin is not closed. If a person is poor but has some creative urge to solve problems with their poverty, he is able to use the Internet and get all the information about bitcoin.

BTC is not a solution for years and years of economic turmoil, social inequality, lack of education of the poorer community, non-inclusion of the poor (ghettoization), no social mobility, laws that favor the wealthy, lack of worker rights, lack of job opportunities...BTC CAN'T and DOESN'T solve that. It can help people have some additional income, and help them pay the bill more easily, get them out of a specific financial rut they are in at the moment, but they will most definitely not eradicate poverty that's systemic for as long as there is modern civilization. Please let's stop painting crypto as something that it's clearly not and start looking at it as it is, and we might have a much healthier community than a bunch of laser-eyed twitter influencer goblins.",

That brings a lot of opportunities to the people there but maybe you are right that they didn't rely all to bitcoin. There are some problem which bitcoin cant solve but government should make an effort to bring solutions if they don't want their people to suffer.",
