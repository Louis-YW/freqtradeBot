Avoid chasing excessive profits that could lead to a complete loss.Remember that not losing is often more advantageous than risking it all.When luck isn't on your side, consider an immediate pause to prevent further losses.It's crucial to recognize that consistent daily profits are unlikely. Don't jeopardize your entire balance just to chase them.Understand that all games involve an element of randomness, making it wise to cease betting after securing a win within a range of acceptable losses.Don't push your luck beyond the maximum acceptable losing streak. Waiting too long often results in significant losses.For instance, if you're playing a game with a 3x payout, the safe losing streak might be 18, and the maximum losing streak might be 24. If you experience a losing streak exceeding the safe limit, followed by a win, consider stopping your bets.Be aware that extended losing streaks tend to get worse, and it's challenging to predict when they'll surpass the maximum threshold.Avoid waiting for a substantial payoff after a prolonged losing streak. Cut your losses before they deplete your bankroll. It's likely that bets close to a quarter of your balance will lead to losses most of the time.Adjust your bet sizes to ensure that one or two wins can recover more than your previous losses. Avoid excessive greed.Recognize that the house often aims to lure you away from your strategy, leading you into their designed plan to deplete your funds quickly.Act promptly if your emotions start influencing your decisions. Both excessive fear and greed pose significant risks.",

Nevertheless, all the points mentioned above are essential guidelines to follow when entering the world of betting. Luck, managing risks, practicing self-control, setting limits on your bets, and avoiding addiction all play vital roles in betting or gambling. It's important not to rely solely on winning because there are no guarantees, and this is where luck becomes a factor.",

Waiting too long often results in significant losses.Yes this is the time to lose more. Some people will become very emotional and lose all their money in bank or on a wallet. What I did that has been so helpful is the gambling budget that I set which is 5% or less of my weekly income. It has been helping and the reason I have been reiterating it on this forum.",

Most of the points listed are what have come up here and gamblers who are experienced keep to them.Like you mentioned about luck, some times when playing and losing in gambling, we need to listen to that third voice that tells us to quit or exit for the main time and that is what to follow to avoid further loses when we keep playing. The luck factor is always there while gambling and when it is not going our way then we have to stay out. Staying out helps to get us to reorganize, plan and relaunch again with a clear mind and not for the shake of chasing what we have lost.",

Both excessive fear and greed pose significant risks.Among everything else mentioned, I think this part plays a very important role in gambling as it affects the decision-making process, which might in turn make one take a very bad decision that can turn out to be a negative gambling result. If one can learn how to control their emotions, then I think everything else can be followed, as they can be simple to obey. The joy that comes with winning a ticket, especially when the winning price is high, can literally take someone to another level, which can make them think that all tickets can have the same result and it's their time to shine that very day. They might end up continuously betting, which might result in losing the entire price that very day, added together with their deposited amount. It can also happen the same way when it comes to losing too. One can get very angry to the extent that they will just have to keep on trying to make sure that they can recover a few amounts from what they have lost that very day, which they might just end up losing more of. So if one can be able to overcome sad emotions and don't allow them to affect their decision, then they can survive the gambling system.",

Although, his reactions to that is not stated, memorizing lists of rules, may not be the catalyst of enforcing those rules or abiding by it while gambling. Strategies should be personal. If he wishes to share them, with other players, it's not necessary we follow it. Because we're not sure 100% that what he stated or shared with us is what he really does. The truth is that successful players, professional gamblers hide their strategies. It's left for any other player, to figure out what works. Then implement them into practice. It could be just few sentences, when written down that'll be easy to memorize. We win according to our losses. Most times I fail my instinct and end up not winning. And vice versa. No perfect right technique. We must adjust our moves consistently to stay winning than losing. Perfecting a technique and tagging it as the ultimate gambling technique, is wrong. It'll create losses to multiple players, who utilize same strategy. Gambling is a game of changes, the house change their techniques often, so should players. Hence, following another player's rule can be wrong. But, in some cases like a physical casino, the person sitting next to you can chip in accurate prediction. Yet, the problem lies on if the player will listen to their neighbor. This example explains better why people may not rely on rules. As it doesn't seem right with their own idea and prediction. It's like telling or advising people how to spend their funds. I've read about players who don't care whether they win or lose. I don't think any gambling technique will interest them. That's human like you said. Ideas and behaviors don't exactly match. Expect to see different reactions on the gambling experience of those following your techniques. Which shows the vast difference or uniqueness in the operation of casinos and players on a single technique. A machine in one casino may not perform like others in another casino. If a player gets advantage winning by playing bad machines, and shares it as his technique. Would it be useful to a player who plays in a casino with good machines. He'll have to wait until a bad machine shows up.",

Oh hell yeah it’s gonna hit hard now and then all the time. I have experienced it many times and turned off gambling for few days in the frustration so that I can calm myself from the bad experience further. There are no such proven methods to beat the system so it’s better to play with integrity, fun and few personal strategies now and then. I mean House edge will act on everyone with different set of rules. One account might be earning hell lot of money and one might be loosing at an alarming rates and thus House edge will try to give back to loosing account for some streak ahead.

What I did that has been so helpful is the gambling budget that I set which is 5% or less of my weekly income. It has been helping and the reason I have been reiterating it on this forum.Have been a victim of the excessive push of lock in days where i feel my luck is on the high spirited, this happens to me mostly in sportbetting, some days i make multiple games selections and I become lucky to win a substantial amount in the process, instead taking a break, I decided to play more and in that process, o eventually will lose and it I don't stop may lose everything I won in previous bets.This experience has taught me some lessons and now I will never consider chasing any direction in gambling be it winning or chasing loss, this has created more cius than it helps the time and for any experienced gambler already knows this and tries to avoid practising  such approach in gambling because it won't help",

Decide ahead of time how much money you're willing to spend and how much time you're willing to spend gambling. And it's not only about setting the limit and time but sticking to those limits is more important than necessary, even if you're feeling greedy or afraid. Some time it is also necessary to take regular breaks from gambling, so you can clear your head and make decisions based on logic rather than emotion though it is difficult to separate emotion from gambling. In case you are lucky enough to win on a regular basis, make sure to set aside a portion of your winnings for other purposes, like paying bills or saving for the future gambling. Again, despite your winning streaks, gambling is not a source of income and you should not rely on it to survive.",
