  "content": "Hi Guys!I just bought This miner and after updating to latest firmware, I have a power consumption of 1735 watt. I can have a consumption of 2200watt in my basement.Can I tune it up in an easy way, in a safe way for the miner? Have around 10 degrees warm air coming in to the miner.When I log into the miner I have a action called Set voltage. The title is voltage set(100mV), under I can put any number. Now it says 112Is it were I can tune it up or there is a better easier way?Thanks in advance!",

      "body": "Never heard of this miner before I tried to search a bit but it seems it's not a Bitcoin miner based on my research it's a KDA miner or Kadena miner.You won't get any answer here because this section is Bitcoin miner-related not for altcoin. If you want to get some answer why not bring this to Mining (Altcoins)Anyway, about your question I don't think there is an easy way but the way you configure it I think that's the only way to improve the hash rate of your miner also check the PLL and try to play that thing from 700 to increase it until 750 or 800 PLL but monitor the miner if the temp is an increase use the warning param to avoid overheating.",
