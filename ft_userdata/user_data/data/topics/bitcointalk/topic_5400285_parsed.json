      "body": "Based on the logs below read temp error it means that your control board can't detect any temp signal from your hashboard.Code:Max pcb temp : 0Read temp failed, set fixed full fan speedFAN PWM: 100read_temp_func Done!CRC error counter=268One of your hash boards might have a broken temp sensor or ribbon wires that are not plugged properly. Try to re-plug all of your ribbon wires then check it again through logs or if it's hashing.If still do not work then you can bypass this issue by flashing your unit with modded firmware like asic.to firmware or Braiins OS.",
