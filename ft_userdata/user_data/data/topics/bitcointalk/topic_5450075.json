It's not like in other regions where business aren't allowed to accept Bitcoin payment.Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-can-uk-based-businesses-accept-bitcoinIs Bitcoin legal in the United Kingdom?No specific regulations govern trading and investment in Bitcoin. However, United Kingdom residents can transact using Bitcoin.Unlike El Salvador, which considers Bitcoin (BTC) to be a legal tender, cryptocurrencies are not treated as currency in the United Kingdom. Instead, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) categorized cryptocurrencies as digital or crypto assets, which may be liable to capital gains tax or income tax, depending on the circumstances.One can trade BTC via cryptocurrency exchanges such as U.K.-based CEX.io or globally based Coinbase or Binance or through brokers like eToro. However, to register a cryptocurrency exchange in the U.K., the financial conduct authority (FCA) requires the business to establish a legal entity, get a registered office address, open a business bank account and register for taxation. After this, they will need to obtain a crypto exchange license by filling out an application form accessible on the FCA’s website and paying a registration fee.So, can U.K.-based businesses accept Bitcoin? Yes, businesses can accept Bitcoin payments in the U.K. directly or indirectly via gift cards. However, it depends upon the customer base if they want to pay in crypto or fiat currencies.",

So far, it’s even a little strange that the crypto-winter has dragged on for so long. If the price of bitcoin recently rose to 68 thousand dollars, then with the next wave of growth it is quite possible that it will reach one hundred thousand dollars. It's only a matter of time. At the same time, the probability and possibility of growth does not mean that it will happen in some named time frame.",

Some are fought silently and patiently and time decides the winner. We are surely on the winning path! Thoughts?It's a very conservative forecast. Current ATH is around $70k and we'll likely reach (and exceed) it next year. If we take a look back at previous cycles, ATH had been broken in the third year of the cycle. Last time we went from ~$20k to ~$70k so something like x3.5 increase. At the same time, many bitcoiners agree that the previous ATH was ruined by some political and economic events and growth was stopped prematurely, so we can as well exceed x3.5 and shoot to like x5-x6, so $70k x 5 = $350k. So there's a good chance at least $200k will be reached next year. For sure, these are just speculations...",

That bank means nothing to me, and I believe that 99% of the users of this forum have never heard of it - so I wonder who even cares what banks think, no matter what they are called? As for the trust you are talking about, it is far from the fact that it happened and it cannot happen overnight as some think, because trust is built over decades. This is the reason why 98% of people still trust banks more than Bitcoin.Quote from: avikz on April 25, 2023, 05:24:50 AMNot all battles are fought on the battleground.

That makes more sense, but all those who live in some kind of belief that Bitcoin should (or can) beat the banks are not thinking rationally at all. Banks are the most powerful institutions in the world and if they really want to, they can do terrible damage to Bitcoin, because most people still use those same banks to buy/sell Bitcoin, regardless of whether it's CEX or DEX.",

Bitcoins are limited in number that is, no more Bitcoins can be created or destroyed, hence the coins are very rare and valuable. So if the demand to accumulate these coins increases, due to the fixed amount of supply, the price will automatically go up. So 100k is surely possible before the end of 2024, I am predicting that Bitcoins will break ATH and will settle in 80k usd by the end of this year.",

I'm not saying they have to buy right now, but bitcoin isn't as popular as it could be because many people think it to be too complex and time consuming to learn, so they stick with what they know. SC prediction is based on the last cycle and you can see it by the way they take into account a possibility of a sudden crash to 5k, which is based on analysing the 2019-2020 data model where we had this sudden drop to 3k.
