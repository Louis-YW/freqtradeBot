      "body": "This year is still work, no boom imo just a good amount of progress to recover some of the prices lost in 2022 would be fine enough I think.    BTC is doing well so far and even recently its continued upwards but its clear too that upward we are restricted by the volume of selling that occurred across the whole of the 20k range.   Around 25k seems to be pivotal, the closer we get the more it will bite into positivity until there is an open battle between bull and bear and I presume that means more volatility then we see right now.  BTC stays above the 2 day average so far, so retains very fast momentum but probably not for the whole of February some selling or attempt to sell off will occur most likely imo.",

Sounds like it's too far to wait mate, as there is plenty of time and good things to be enjoyed by everyone before then. Besides, I personally prefer to see a four-year cycle in Bitcoin than a seven-year or more than once-fifteen year cycle, that's really long for me to wait and see the magic you say. I have absolutely no doubts about Bitcoin for this, but an increase in the price in the market for Bitcoin will always be colored by corrections and each correction always takes more time to rise again.",

But true bitcoins are really in it for the long game anyways, savvy? It will take time, and at times it will be brutal, and other times it will be epic. If you play the market right you can make money both ways, but i've never been one to do that. Although I wish I would take a chance with that. I think its just anxiety provoking doing that moving large amounts of funds to exchanges or elsewhere in hopes to trade and make a profit. I have always stuck to the HODLing approach and steady stacking myself. Nothing wrong with a little wishful thinking though. Of course, there is no guarantee that this will ever happen but I will say that it surely will be one crazy ride if it does!",

But we all know what happens next, we went on the bearish trend.So still very far for that $1 million prediction, the best thing to do is to so where we are going at least for 2024-2025 incoming bull run.Might be good to see for the first time the price going $100k.",

Of course, there is no guarantee that this will ever happen but I will say that it surely will be one crazy ride if it does!I try before to play the market, but it's really hard to make money specially in bear market. I have nothing against those who short or learn how to make money regardless of what conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of us, who don't possess such kind of knowledge, it's better to stick and not make things complicated in our end. Just buy and continue to accumulate, specially in the bear market, because it is where the best time to stack up sats and continue to buy thru DCA and then HODL as long as we can, till the next bull run and then new ATH!",
