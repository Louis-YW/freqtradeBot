Opening of casino is not that easy and you have made it look that way with just $150 and many will see it as suspicious as a trap to get them in first before further request of fund. So this is going to be difficult to come up for you to get positive response. However, discord may not be only channel you can use to show prove of what you have done if you are real.",
