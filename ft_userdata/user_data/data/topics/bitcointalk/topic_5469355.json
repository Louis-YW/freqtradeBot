One of the most common malwares for cracked Windows is the Clipboard virus, which is among many that can be found on cracked devices, and some malware can't even be detected on your device. You can start by checking if your PC is affected by the clipboard virus. Maybe try to copy and paste a wallet address, either bitcoin or any popular crypto address, and see if it will change to another address, as that's the most common way that the clipboard virus works. For the main time, if you don't have any funds in your wallet yet, I will advise you to get a new OS from a licenced dealer in order to be sure of what you are using and reduce the security risk that you are taking.",

We don't know if this spyware collects your data or not. It's not wise to use these cracks and financial software in the same OS. You can easily find cheap activation keys online. Windows has some resellers who sell those keys very cheaply. It's between $5 to $20 in Bangladesh. It is not worth taking such a risk for this amount. It's only if you are a Windows lover and you are friendly with this OS. Or you can move to Linux for better security.",

However, not all AV can detect a newly design or a variant of a recent malware or spyware. So you don't know if there is one in your system until it's too late.So not sure what you are trying to proved here.",

But there may come a time when you have to lose everything. And you will tell us that you have been using this system for years, and something went wrong. If your system is under the surveillance of hackers, they can simply wait for the right moment and not waste their time on small things, but wait for a big catch. Another option is that many hacked systems are sold online as servers. Especially if your computer is powerful enough. Working from your IP, you may not know that, in parallel with you, someone is using your computer for their own needs and perhaps not doing exactly the right thing, and you will bear all responsibility after the incident since you provide access.

The ones who create cracks are experts at software engineering and reverse engineering and they can add malware, spyware, and any other virus in the crack easily. Most probably they add malware but in a way that's 100% undetectable by any available anti-virus program because the crackers know that the ones who use Windows OS are more likely to spend money online using credit cards and other stuff. I believe that you wallet isn't safe at all, I recommend you to wipe out your entire drives and then install Linux based Distro that's freely distributed and doesn't need any kind of crack in order to activate it. The Linux is the safest operating system out there and anyone who uses Linux is far more safe than the ones who rely on Windows OS. I know that most users like Windows OS because it's easily to use but these days there are many Linux distros that can be used be non-tech guys. The distros like Linux mint and Lubuntu are the ones that any user can use without much hassle. The best thing about Lubuntu is that it's less resource intensive and even runs of intel atom based laptops flawlessly.",

You need to ask yourself, why would someone crack up an app that it's supposed to cost you something just to make it free? Most pirated apps are infected with malware that can steal your sensitive information, crypto funds and also take control of your web cam. Please uninstall the cracked windows, go for a licensed windows or install Linux as it is a better alternative. It's free, open source and more secured.",
