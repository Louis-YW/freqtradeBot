There are a lot of users doing it, and all of them are handled good by the moderators.Unofficial list of (official) Bitcointalk.org rules, guidelines, FAQQuote32. Posting multiple posts in a row (excluding bumps and reserved posts by the thread starter) is not allowed.But I was surprised by this one user:Username: YurkovRegistration date: February 25, 2013, 12:06:52 AMThe above user violates rule number 32 quite often. Even I have reported it few post but to this day he still repeats it. I've also reported that user's profile to  moderator for review, but as a registered user in 2013 then I don't think it makes sense to be warned too often.What surprises me is that he continues to do so almost daily for spam posts or burst posts on gambling board. So when will violations like this become so serious?",

      "body": "Unfortunately, it probably depends on who handles them at the time. If you get the same moderator handling it every single time, they'll probably ping the username in their mind, and be able to act accordingly in the future. However, if you've got multiple moderators handling the reports then things can become a little inconsistent as as moderators we can only act upon what we see, and can verify. Therefore, if one global handled 25%, another global with 25%, and a dedicated moderator 50%, a global isn't going to think too much of it. I know this seems to be in the Gambling section, and therefore the dedicated moderators are global, but there's three of them, so it could equally apply. The above is just an example. In other sections where there's multiple non global dedicated moderators things can start to get really murky depending on who handles it at the time. Plus, there's the flip side where moderators handle a lot of reports, and pretty much identical reports when it comes to bumping. So, its very easily to forget when you could potentially be handling hundreds of reports every day. Obviously, with the recent decline in reports it's probably not as drastic figures, but you get my point. I've been utilizing a user script by TryNinja recently. I had a half baked version that I made prior to it, but their version is fully fledged, and pretty much covers all basis'. So, I've started to log certain problem users, for further review down the line if there's other reports made against them. Again, this doesn't really eliminate the issue of multiple moderators handling the reports, but it does eliminate the second issue of forgetting.Technically, moderators can somewhat verify if another moderator has taken action on the user previously, but I'm not sure if other moderators do this routinely. Especially when it's longer than the data available shows. That would be my guess of what's happening here. It's not the fact that this wouldn't be taken further, and by taken further I don't mean bans, but could potentially be warnings via personal messages before bans, it's the fact that there's missing parts in the process. It'd be nice if we had a reporting system that highlighted how many times a user had been reported in the past x amount of days, and potentially link to a archived version, but that means storing deleted posts on the live database longer than we probably do right now.",

Surely these members would warrant an warning ? DustMedia007 has been banned, not sure if its for the same reasons that you reported them for, or if it was in direct response of one of your reports, but they're banned currently. As for Scotland, that does ring a bell, and I believe in the past I've acted upon certain reports against that user. Obviously, being a jr member I don't see those reports any more, which might be another reason why certain usernames don't face consequences after repeat offending constantly, since patrollres may have been acted upon their reports, before they became a jr member. Obviously, that's looking at the larger picture. The 12 reports in 14 days, could potentially just be different moderators or the moderators monitoring the situation currently, and don't want to act too hastily.",

What I have noticed is that some people deliberately do not delete old bumps so that their threads look like there is some kind of discussion going on there, which in my opinion is obvious abuse and should be punished in the long term with at least a temporary ban.I would suggest that this rule be supplemented with the following \"more than xx bump posts deleted by mods = permanent ban\". Of course, the question arises as to who will count the deleted posts, but that's why we have BPIP and it's easy to look at the statistics of deleted posts. _BlackStar, I looked at the post history of that member and he is a classic shitposter, so I suggest you waste less time on reporting multiple posts in a row, and focus more on signature spam reports.",

With this script, they can easily keep notes of previous moderation logs for the above-mentioned issues. Though there's a good chance that not many users here would be interested to use this kind of script as they may not be using a compatible browser for the script.",

If he does not sop after being warned, then you may temporarily ban him from posting.Also, regarding this rule no 32, I see many times mods themselves merge the consecutive boards. Right now I don't think violating this rule can get your account banned. Usually, people do it unknowingly and mods themselves merge those posts.",

Several times I have said, many of my reports are not handled on the gambling board even if I am absolutely sure about my accuracy. That's the reason why I don't report posts there even if many people admit that they are spam.Quote from: Rikafip on October 15, 2022, 03:17:21 PMSince he keeps doing it even after his posts got deleted, have you ever tried to warn him/explain him that what he is doing is wrong and might end up getting temporary ban because of that?I'm not sure I'll do it, but maybe the moderators need to.Quote from: Rikafip on October 15, 2022, 03:17:21 PMSome people are so ignorant about the rules and won't even know that they are doing something wrong until you send them pm or warn them directly in the thread.

I imagine the mods are well aware of that, and it might make sense to report one or two posts by the same member violating the rule with a note telling the mod to look into their post history--the same goes for any other kind of reporting when you're dealing with someone with multiple, repeated violations.  It's efficient, and I think Hilariousandco once suggested it to me back when I was doing a lot of reporting.And the gambling sections....*whew*.  When I'm doing post history reviews I often find myself looking at posts in threads with tens of thousands of pages.  When you've got threads like that, shitposters and violators of rule 32 know they can basically get away with whatever they want to.  On the other hand, I do see valid discussions happening between members (or what looks like it, anyway), so if there was any good reason to be posting multiple times--but not consecutively--it'd be that.  OP, if I were you I'd give up on spam megathreads as far as reporting goes.  I know I did, because there are just too many rule breakers and only so much time in the day to devote to a problem that's been around for years and shows no signs of improving.  But that's just me.",

Again, this doesn't really eliminate the issue of multiple moderators handling the reports, but it does eliminate the second issue of forgetting.When a moderator takes action that results in a report being marked as \"good\", they could also classify the rule violation as one of several of the most common reasons that real users have action taken against them (along with an other category). This would benefit the administration in two ways:1 - it would make it much easier to determine the validity of a ban request for a particular user 2 - it might uncover communications issues that certain (groups of) people don't understand certain rules2a - the impact of the rule violations can be more easily studied to understand the impact of said rules, which may lead to the tweaking of rules to further improve the user experience of the forum. To answer the OP's question, the mods are not in the business of banning users. To ban a forum member means to remove them from the community, and that is not what the forum administration wants to do on a regular basis. The mods are in the business of keeping the forum a place where various topics can be easily discussed, in part by enforcing the various rules of the forum. A forum member is banned only as a last resort, and a ban is typically seen as a negative outcome. Obviously, in some cases, there are situations in which banning a forum member is necessary.",
