Some sources identify Bitcoins that haven't moved for a long time, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are lost forever. There's no way to collect missing Bitcoin addresses or private keys from any sources. It's not a practical question, as finding private keys would mean the Bitcoins aren't considered lost.",

Very often we see Bitcoins that are sleeping in wallets for years are moved. So if coins are sleeping or not moved even then we cant say that they are lost forever. But there is consent that there is huge number of bitcoins that are gone forever. Its because in early days people took Bitcoin for-granted and didnt cared much about there Bitcoin's when its price was under 1$.",

Only kicked out of circulation through people losing access to their cryptocurrencies and all that. There's a possibility for these people to access these coins once again and sell them which will drive the price of bitcoin lower but at the same time it's a little improbable especially in cases where it's saved on self-custodial wallets. Sorry to hear about you losing out on so much bitcoin. If I'm not mistaken and if you still have the drive where you saved those bitcoins, certain programs and companies are out there with the sole purpose of providing assistance in regaining access to your bitcoins so you can get them back although not really sure about the authenticity of these entities. Still worth a try especially if you're getting desperate.",
