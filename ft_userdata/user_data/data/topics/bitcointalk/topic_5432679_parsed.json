Never had an ROI there even for how many months of waiting. Probably only those who can refer other users is the only thing you can make an ROI.",

      "body": "Cloud mining is well known for being an unprofitable business format, which unfortunatelly was very popular until some years ago, when people really thought they could have a lifetime income from sites such as Genesis Mining and similars, including the ponzi schemes promoted as cloud minings, although they didn't involve any kind of mining operations.OP, if you invested in this business, you have already lost money, because you will never be able to hit ROI, since income is progressively decreasing within time. So, why to pass this loss ahead to someone else? Maybe to dilute your own losses this way? That is not good...",

It is difficult to convince someone that cloud mining is something that generates money and you do not have enough trust to prove it. Therefore, without pictures and evidence proving your possession of mining tools, you are lying.[snip]Exactly and you nailed it. Cloud mining was already busted and known as most of them are scams, they don't have actually a mining machine that truly operates mining and some of them steal images claiming that they have mining facilities. So how can we trust them without showing further evidence that they have those mining machines? That is right --we are in 2023 and cloud mining is not a thing that will fool people, we all know already the possible outcome if we invested in this.I remember before when I was new in crypto, I invested in cloud mining because there is an ROI like every day you will get bitcoin as a small percentage of your investment, but a week later I cannot access the site anymore.",
