However my stance on this is that when they show their bet slip to the public because of how much influence they have, the young ones who look up to them will most likely start betting. What these Young ones don't know is that these celebrities have more money than them so they can afford to lose that money and still be fine but these poor young ones who would  jump into betting because of a celebrity, do not have money to lose. And when they lose the game, we would hear stories of them crying and doing all sorts of irritable things on the internet because of their loss.",

When you see a rich person gambling, it is because they can afford to loose the money they are using to invest and still be okay. They play these games for fun, not because they really expect to win. The Nigerian socialite that we are discussing now is a billionaire, and since he is not even betting up to 5% of his net worth, it is no big deal and a risk he can afford to take. Bet according to what you can afford, do not be pressured to using all you have to gamble because you see what a rich man has used in gambling.",

There might be another reason like doing promotions on the casino that they are playing and it might be a sponsored bet by the casino, we won't really know. There are many high rollers out there but some of them just don't really show it off publicly. They can go on a higher level so I don't see any problem with that. I understand that influential people are sharing it on public because maybe they want to include it on their figure just like how drake are doing it.",

I'm not a fan of this sport but I can see why he bet on Chelsea. Matches like this sometimes end up with just 1:0 and this team is already ahead of its game. Very reasonable to pick and bet 5M as well. Normally the odds will also drop down to 1.40 when one team scores.",

Pure marketing purposes. They surely partner to the casino they place bet since there’s no sense for an influencer to post such betslip without getting anything from it. I don’t consider a bet like this that put with a real analysis since they will not resort on being influencer if they are really into sports betting.This huge bets is probably nit real or part of the deal with the casino since the casino brand is available on the betslip they are sharing which is weird since it shouldn’t be available if they will share the betslip itself.",

So there's no reason for me to go foam at the mouth and be ballistic against their bets even though they are always counting by the millions, but I digress. I don't think it's going to work as a marketing tactic either, \"LOL someone's betting 2 million dollars on this team let's go bet on that team as well for the kicks\", is that what you're trying to convey? Cause if that's so then I'd like to point out how preposterous the logic behind that statement is, and why it wouldn't work as a viable marketing tactic. In my opinion these people are just posting these to flex on everyone, doesn't have to be a statement or anything.",

I see this as a pure marketing strategy to attract more gamblers to the gambling house where he placed the bet. Drake is an ambassador of Stake, maybe this Nigerian rich socialite might be connected to bet9ja. I am not in support of this kind of advertisement because it can fuel over-gambling. There is no need to encourage people to bet higher than what they can afford by showcasing a celebrity's high bet.

Business owners can do anything to make more profit. He might not be an ambassador, but he might have invested in the gambling firm. Maybe soon we might know his connection with bet9ja.",

Like promoting your business. You are seeing what they want you to see, not what it actually is. Influencers and celebrities can easily manipulate you to do anything.",

This is the difference between rich people when they play, which is why the phrase: only play with money that you can afford to lose. It is a phrase that will always be mandatory to follow. I've seen many rich people putting a lot of money into gambling and they don't get upset by the defeat, on the contrary, after losing, they go to bars to spend it on women and drinks and their lives continue without problems.",

If it would really be just that Naira then it wont really be that much of a big amount which it cant really go toe with toe with those bets been done by specially by known gambler such us Drake which splurges out hundred thousands of dollars on a single bet. Even if you are a billionaire which it doesnt mean that you would really be spending millions of dollars on your gambling bets on which it would really be just that depending if you are really that a gambler or not or simply that could spend up a small amount which he can afford to lose or simply just that enough for him to lose. $4k might really be that small for some people specially on to those billionaires or millionaires who are capable on doing such thing.I dont know if this would really be just that right on using up that all-in word considering that it is really just that a dust amount unless if this would really be million dollars then it would really be thata different story but if its not then it would really be that just a small amount if ever this bet would losses but if it do win then the amount would neither be significant or notbasing up whether this one talks about million dollar bet or naira been used but well its their money.
