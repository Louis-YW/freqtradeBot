  "content": "Having relocated to a new place because of work or joined the Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency community because of money, it takes courage to do both and succeed where others fail.I had to relive life as if I was born a new. On the contrary, one common trait that seemed to bother most, as I have come to see, is that of trying to fix everything. When someone knows what is wrong, instead of ignoring or finding a way around it, they try to report it or complain about it or act in animalistic manner without fixing anything in total.I have also realized that it is always better to let things flow, in the sense that one just overlooks the problem and firstly seeks peace of mind and ordered reasoning. If after making the case known to a superior and nothing is done still, with being calm and appearing unbothered, the fuss will somehow become clearer and solutions will surface. I.e. give the problem a day or two, if it doesn't present a solution, please seek further advice or a mentor. As with the case of this forum, newbies should try to be calm as with the merit and post section rush that is more of a trend these days. Be calm and take your time to understand the way things get done here, mostly as regards comment style, presentation of work, organization of reference and links,  terms and languages being used. You will see how things just flow with ease.",

It does have it's limits and that's where complaint comes if you really can't find a solution for that problem. If it's about ranking then complaining about it doesn't make difference since that system is used to prevent people who only come here in forum which such goal like increasing their rank to join bounty campaigns or a bounty hunter that only spam the forum which many people doesn't like it or frowned upon. If a person really want to join this forum to learn and such then the merit system is nothing for a person to worry about and I see such person achieve that and now have enough merits to become a legendary member.",

Merit flows only when quality posts are been made,and to be calm in Bitcoin requires patience .Moreover,bitcoin is a thing of patience, if one is not patient enough it seems as if nothing is working but if patience is applied the result is usually big, as a beginner in bitcoin trading you have to expect lot because before  everything big comes a big risk, most times people give up because of little patience and fear of losing money and so on but when they finally accept the risk and wait patiently they surely have good results. Another thing about bitcoin trading is to understand the margin reading and the rest to know when coin is high or low so that you won't sell at a rate by which you lose.",

The sooner newbies conceives that the forum is about quality and not quantity the easier the merits will flow in many ways than one for them.

Patience is a character trait of a person who is constant in achieving his goal and is present everywhere and in everything. Even if, at first, he does not get much success. It is always necessary to study deeper than to acquire superficial knowledge, and only after that should you declare yourself a guru who is ready to teach everyone.",

Since such people always make a bunch of mistakes.~snip~Few follow the line of greater resistance, and most go towards bounty campaigns or think that by plagiarizing/paraphrasing they will succeed in deceiving someone that they are something they are not. To some extent, I can understand that some members, even though they are beginners themselves, want to help others, although sometimes they exaggerate in this - or what is even worse, they give not only wrong but also very risky advice. Of course, the golden rule is that you should not believe in anything blindly, but that you should look at most things critically - because even if five people claim that something is true, who is to say that a sixth person will not appear and prove that they are wrong?",

But I have come to notice that on this forum there are two sets of people, (I.e those who come here with the mindset to only make money) who always goes about looking for shortcut to earning merits and (those who come here to learn more about Bitcoin and it's ecosystem) who are always patient and end up ripping the fruit of their labour.But on the contrary, I agree with O.P that it's more advisable newbies first learn to understand how the forum works before going after merit, as you will get to learn a lot from the forum",

Its quite clear that Many users came to the forum to earn a living through participating in signature campaign which many have achieved but the feat in which this was acheived is also based on the same perseverance and patience that these users exercised by patiently learning and improving themselves on the different areas of the forum because in order for one to be successful you must be hard working and learn to patient because there's no short cut to it. I think these popular saying has always live up to their meanings ~ patience is a virtue ~the patient dog eat the fatest bone~slow and steady wins the race So if there is any newbie who feel there is constant need to grow up so fast by posting countless gibrish in order to attain merits and rank up fast, i think you would probably get stuck in one spot for maybe a gazillion years to come  .so my advice to everyone is you just do well to learn patiently and always remember you can't offer what you don't have upstairs so you need to read and learn and simply follow all the instructions and guidance on the forum and you would be a step closer in acheive your purposed goal.",
