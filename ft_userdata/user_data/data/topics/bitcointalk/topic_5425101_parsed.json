Compared to other big Asian countries like China they seem friendly to bitcoin adoption. I even read sometime ago that they relaxes some of there laws to allow people trade in bitcoin. They also have registered exchanges like Bitflyer, coincheck. The country also has some bitcoin ATM which is another step that they are actually friendly to crypto currency.The image below from statista shows percentage of Japanese that uses crypto currency. Although the statistics its a bit old I feel there has been massive changes to that percentage since its laws against it has been relaxed.",

Japan's national debt currently sits at ¥1,028 trillion ($9.087 trillion USD).[/u] After the stock market crashed in Japan, the government bailed out banks and insurance companies and provided them with low-interest credit. Banking institutions had to be consolidated and nationalized after a period of time and other fiscal stimulus initiatives were used to help reboot the struggling economy. Unfortunately, these actions caused Japan’s debt level to skyrocket.Also, considering the fact that Mt.Gox was based in Japan and that they have not been able to solve this problem to this day perhaps best speaks to the fact that not everything is in that country as some people think. As for the sports results you mentioned, beating Germany, which is not even a shadow of what it used to be, or Spain, which wanted to avoid winning the first place in the group in order to avoid Brazil in further competition, is not really something to judge their strength on. The real test is next Monday when they play against the finalists of the last World Cup.",

Please correct me if I am wrong.Japan is a Bitcoin-friendly country because the currency can be used for any form of payment without restrictions. But exchanges are subjected to the strict anti-money laundering (AML) legislation which put them under government regulations. I also agree that based on the technological advancement of Japan they should have been a key player in the crypto space. Maybe the focus of the Japanese government is not on the crypto industry or most crypto companies are scared of regulations. They don't want to be liable when the company fails..",

Why ? Please correct me if I am wrong.If that's the question, I can give a little answer that in the past Japan imposed exorbitant taxes on crypto exchanges and also on crypto users so that there was no blockchain ecosystem and exchanges that developed well there and became famous like some of the existing exchanges at the time. I say this after reading an article that really concerns your question.However, in another article it was also stated that the Japan Crypto and Virtual Asset Exchange Association as the regulator dealing with crypto assets in Japan has recently released a plan document to facilitate crypto laws related to official exchanges to register digital currencies by relaxing their screening process.Reference:[1] https://www.fortuneidn.com/finance/[2] https://wartaeconomic.co.id/read453193/",

I think in 2017 bill Japan had many things to contribute on since they were using bitcoin on larger scale. Now I am not sure the documented scale matches to this or not but definitely Japan has lost the track after covid.
