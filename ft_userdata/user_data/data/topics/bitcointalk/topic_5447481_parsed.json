If someone broke a off topic, low quality and spam rules, a high ranked user's post tend to less being deleted rather than a newbie user, it's very subjective.But for a clear mistake like post in a row, a high ranked user's post would be merged, there's no matter how high the rank, how many the positive feedback he got etc.You remind me about this thread Has the forum become more loyal?2. Maybe reputation section is one of low moderation section, it's really different with Bitcoin technical support, development sections etc.",

Sooner than later logic will catch up with them and their sham will become obvious. Their value will be lost forever.

As of now I am still trying to learn new things from other fellow members, and who knows when it will be helpful in the future. One more thing for me is that, sometimes off topics can serve as an ice breaker for a member to take a breather after engaging the seriousness here in the forum. That is the reason why there is an off-topic section in which members can sit back and relax and talk about something unrelated to economy, bitcoin or opportunities, but of course off topics should remain on the off-topic board. In regards of those off topic replies, usually they get deleted but often times they are marked as spam from the mods.",

A lot of spam hunters tend to get regular users who are not reputable and have no position in the forum because they are usually the ones posting spam and tend not to care about the quality of the posts.In one case, I agree that it makes sense because users with good reputation and status in forum tend to have good quality posts although sometimes some posts may also go off topic, but reputation and status are the reason why someone doesn't report those posts to moderators. But I think there must be different viewpoints on this as off-topic posts are easy to identify and there should be no exceptions.",

It's an individual choice, but there will always be controversy. This is the uniqueness of the bitcointalk forum, may could even say this is an internet forum that is almost the same as real life.

Sometimes their posts seem off topic, but if they are digested deeper, the contents have meaning hidden in them. Established members serve as role models for juniors, there's no way they'd make posts off topic on purpose. Even if there were, the number could be counted on the fingers.",

But I think this thread is about something else, pay attention to the last point of @lovemayfamilis post, hope you understand it.Anyone can report any post for any reason, but the decision as to how to handle it rests with the moderator. I think the moderators have their own discretion about the rating of the report, if it's really off topic then the post will be handled properly. While they may ignore the report and leave it unhandle it's not because they don't agree with your report, there may be other things being considered.",

Kudos I guess  I suppose that I came across as if I have some sort of emotion as to how the OP conveyed his post. To be clear, I do not. I also understand that one could easily visit the reputation board and see what he is talking about. However, I think that if the OP wants to make change, assist the moderators and potential supporters to easily see the problem with clear examples, out the perpetrators and provide good basis. Sure, if change is not the goal and it's just a form of humor or a light complaint, then I misinterpreted the post and I apologize.",

In general yes.That is why you can start self moderated posts.At times I will start something to discuss 'A'. If it moves and grows to 'A1' and 'A2' and 'A3' that is fine. But if you want to make sure that it never gets to 'B' or 'B1' you really need to self mod.It's also too much of an opinion question.  There is a topic going on about the situation with the General Bytes ATM hack [ https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5410704 if you care]I was going to do a much longer comment then the last one I made on the 27th about security in general and a better way of securing the machines and servers and OS and so on. However, I did not do it since it was more related in only general terms to the hack. COULD someone have reported it as OT and been correct? YES. Would someone have done it? Possibly. Would the mods have removed it? Who knows, because even though I am saying it did drive OT, you could also see a justification in that it was discussing the hack and ways to prevent another one in general.-Dave",
