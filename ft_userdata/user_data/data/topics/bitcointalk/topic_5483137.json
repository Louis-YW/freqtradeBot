But I can't recall whether the video was made before actually buying the car, so with the guy explaining the whole thing, or after he already got it. Anyway besides that I feel that Lamborghinis are even more attractive than Ferraris, they look more aggressive so since the average bitcoiner is often young it makes sense to prefer Lamborghini. And some Lamborghini dealers actually accept (or used to) bitcoin.",

It's just a slogan, which to be very honest I never heard before that if you are a rich Bitcoiner then you can purchase such a car, maybe this slogan is famous in your local community or where do you live. I never heard this slogan before. Talking about why people would choose Lambo only, while there are many other cars also gives great competition to Lambo. I will say those who use this slogan only know a few names and Lambo is straightforward and fast to say instead of Ferrari and Maserati or Porche. Another reason would be, that people saying this slogan only like Lambo instead of other cars. There would be many personal opinions of those saying this slogan. So, I don't think it's a big issue or there is some technicality in this slogan. Don't get too curious unless you have some logic in your mind?",

I think that's what happened. but to be honest, I also occasionally say buy Lambo in my community when the price of Bitcoin goes up, even though in reality Lambo is not my dream car, it seems like that word has become a tradition lol.",

      "body": "Just a stereotype of people when it comes on being rich but it has no substance at all. Quite aligned with the jokes of \"if you're rich, where's your lambo?\". Well there are other brands which are more expensive but Lambo is just a brand that will first come to your mind, when you are asked what do you want to buy once you become rich. Bitcoin is having an impression to many people for being a gateway on being rich due to high profitability, which is true in that aspect. However, risk is being disregarded. Not all investors are profitable due to various reasons;circumstances, decision making, and more. It'll all boil down to the fact that things aren't that easy even with Bitcoin investment.You could associate any car brand that you want or anything luxurious, it will all fall to the idea that people are too optimistic of bitcoin investment as a way to wealth. Especially at this moment wherein bullrun is much anticipated by many investors because of what happened on the previous Bitcoin halving. Things are valid but lt us not be too confident of things given that risk is always present.",

That’s when Jay (not his real name), then in his early 30s, and with the help of his wife who is also a Bitcoiner, used almost 217 BTC to purchase what is believed to be the original Bitcoin Lamborghini at the Lamborghini Newport Beach dealership. He then provided the evidence on the anonymous imageboard 4chan.https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/we-tracked-down-the-original-bitcoin-lambo-guy/It's worth mentioning that he also took a jab at Bitcointalk in the article by saying that the community was toxic and the forum's administration had a share in that.",

The buyer leaked the documents, so the Reddit legend goes, and bought the car using a third-party service that verifies bitcoin.1Interesting enough, there were also some signature campaign (afaik Freebitco.in) that used a Lamborghini as their profile image in advertising their campaign. Others have already mentioned that the use of a Lambo is a slogan that symbolizes wealth and power. It is also often associated with the rich that they are the ones privileged enough to own one of these luxuries.I guess Lambos are just frequently used as a symbol of wealth as this can be gleaned from other sources and not just by BTC. Though this may be the case, I still think that BTC being associated with a Ferrari would be more fitting, though this is just my opinion.1 https://digiday.com/marketing/lambo-lamborghini-became-status-brand-crypto-boom/#:~:text=In%202014%2C%20a%204chan%20user,party%20service%20that%20verifies%20bitcoin.Quote from: Lorence.xD on January 27, 2024, 06:37:38 PMYou could associate any car brand that you want or anything luxurious, it will all fall to the idea that people are too optimistic of bitcoin investment as a way to wealth.

Thus, the slogan Lambo and BTC are often used with each other just as to signify your wealth in general.",

I don't know any other platform that uses lambo in their advertising except freebitco.in which they use until now especially when I received an email from them. I think that's enough already as to why lambo is used as a status brand in crypto instead of other brands that are more expensive than lamborghini brand.

Lamborghini is a very popular car, the dream of many people and it depicts wealth and luxury. So the fastest way to get people charged up is to flaunt wealth in their faces through false hopes.
