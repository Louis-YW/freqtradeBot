The community was at the forefront of most of the innovations and adoption of cryptocurrencies by the online gaming industry.Importance of the Community.It is a fact of history that without the cryptocurrency online community, cryptocurrencies would never have become as popular as they are today. Most cryptocurrencies and projects such as Bitcoin and Ethereum were developed by a handful of blockchain, finance, and cryptography experts. But in terms of creating awareness, the crypto community has been at the forefront of driving adoption. And one space that has played a prominent role in crypto adoption is the gambling industry.Some Examples of When the Community Made an ImpactCreating Use Cases for CryptocurrenciesBitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was distributed freely to the earliest holders, who were mainly cypherpunks and other people who were interested in the concept of digital money.In June 2010, for instance, Gavin Adressen, the Bitcoin lead developer, announced on Bitcointalk that he had set up a website that would distribute 5 BTC to every visitor for completing a captcha. This was just one of his many contributions to driving the adoption of cryptocurrency.A month earlier, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida programmer, spent 10,000 bitcoins on pizza.These are some illustrations of the quandary that the early adopters of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies encountered. Some had so many cryptocurrencies but were uncertain if and when the assets would become means of transferring value.Most of these people were not certain that cryptocurrency would be acceptable to the general public. Neither were they aware that it could become a mainstream phenomenon.How the Online Gambling Community Drove AdoptionOne of the earliest use cases for Bitcoin in the online community was gambling. Early holders of the cryptocurrency, out of the need to put them to use, developed various games in which participants wagered bitcoins. These were bets, schemes, and wagers that were based on forums such as Bitcointalk and Reddit.The Era of Forum-Based Blockchain GamblingFor instance, a 2012 forum jackpot game posted on Bitcointalk by a user, Dego, is explained below:Dego called for participants to place minimum bets of 0.1 BTC and maximum bets of 2 BTC for a chance of doubling their bitcoins in the games. Two winners would have their coins doubled. These are the first and last players. Another would earn 15% of all the deposits as the next-in-line jackpot winner, who would be selected based on a set of criteria. In all these, the OP, who is representing the house, earned 5% of all deposits made by those who wagered.Dego promoted his cryptocurrency-based forum game with this line:\"Double your bitcoins in this pyramid game! Pay fast and win; come last and win too!\"A Foundation for Crypto-Casino PlatformsGames such as Dego’s were the precursors of modern cryptocurrency casinos as we have them today. It is not inconceivable to infer that some of the online cryptocurrency casinos were inspired by these forum-based wagering games. There is also a possibility that many of the originators of these games were the brains behind some online crypto casinos, especially those that have a strong presence in cryptocurrency forums such as Bitcointalk, Cryptotalk, and Reddit.Contributing To The Growth Of The Crypto Gambling SpaceThere are several ways that the online crypto community has contributed to the growth of gambling. Some of these are explained in this section.Funding for Online Gambling PlatformsWith the surge in popularity of cryptocurrency casinos, more businesses interested in the gambling space are seeking ways to enter the online crypto gaming sphere. Funding options available to such would-be founders include angel investors, personal funds, and crowdsales. Irrespective of the choice they make, the founders would need the support of the cryptocurrency community if their roadmap translated to a successful gambling business. This is especially true if they opt for crowdsourcing.Gambling crowdsales generally incorporate the participation of the online cryptocurrency community. The community members participate by investing in promising online casinos by buying casino tokens, with the hope of sharing in their success in the future.Spreading the word about crypto casinosThe community also participates in spreading the word about the new casino through bounty and signature campaigns organized by the team behind the new gaming platform.Casino BountiesBounties generally pay participating community members for spreading the word about the new casino by paying with the casino’s internal currency or token. The founders allocate a fraction or percentage of their tokens to bounty participants.Online community bounty programs generally involve promoting a new or existing gambling platform through channels such as social media, video production, blog posts, and more.Signature campaigns for gambling platformsFor signature campaigns, the casino owners pay participating community members a fixed amount in the agreed cryptocurrency. The payment is usually dependent on the value that the participating member is expected to bring to the publicity. Experienced forum members with higher ranks would likely get higher payments from the organizers of a signature campaign.Casino ReputationPlayers are mostly at a loss on how to ascertain how reputable a casino is, especially if it is their first time using such a gambling platform. They’re also mostly unaware of the shortfalls that they could encounter if they’re oblivious to the policies of the casinos they play at.The online crypto communities are the best fora to consult at such times, since any casino that has been around for some time would have something written about them in the forums. The experience of other players helps prospective punters make informed decisions. Even when there are no such reviews, the user could ask questions about the casino and get the opinions of community members who have used the platform. This is a reliable way of knowing how credible a casino is.There are instances when players feel that a casino is fraudulent because it refuses to pay winnings. However, the issue could be linked to the player not being well informed about the casino's TOS before placing bets. For instance, placing a bet in a casino from a restricted country could result in issues such as seized funds.Nevertheless, there are other casinos that are actually dubious and regularly seek opportunities to cheat the player, especially when they win big in bets. The fact that these casinos have huge bankrolls doesn’t change their bad reputation. The player can only know about and beware of such casinos if they are aware of updates about such platforms in the crypto community.For example, a 1xBit user posted this scam allegation against the casino on BitcoinTalk:\"I decided to bet on a WNBA match with odds of approximately 1.65 and a total of 4000 USD.The match went well, my match was successful, and I won the bet. Shortly after I received my winnings (a  total of 6592 USDT), I decided to withdraw the whole amount to my TRC20 USDT address. However, shortly after that, my withdrawal was declined (no reason specified).\"Here is the comment in response to the allegation:\"This is just another number. No one is going to show any interest in your thread, unfortunately. We are bored to see accusations against 1xBit. There are many of them on this scam accusation board.\"It is important to note at this point that the community reputation of a casino is more important for its reliability than a license from an island thousands of miles away in a PO box.New Game Development and TrialsGaming platforms collaborate with game makers and providers to give the gambling community some of the most engaging games ever known. These games are not developed at the whims of the makers but with the active collaboration of the gambling public. The online cryptocurrency community plays an active role in testing new games for gambling platforms.Resolution of IssuesMany gambling platforms promote their businesses in cryptocurrency forums. They also have representatives that actively monitor the happenings on these forums. Punters that have unresolved issues with cryptocurrency casinos usually post these at the forums. When such posts are made, the casino representative or owners usually get notified, especially if the complaint was made on the casino's announcements thread. Thousands of casino-related issues that the player couldn’t resolve have been fixed in-forum because the casino owners wouldn’t want bad publicity within the community.Here is an example of a complaint made by a player:\"After six days of waiting, I saw no other option than to open a topic here. I created an account on D., played the first bet, which was a winner, and tried to withdraw my money. After that, they asked me about KYC. July 10, 2022Whenever I asked them if KYC was confirmed, I would get the same generic answers from Live Support. They don't know anything; I need to be patient; they don't know when it will be finished; there is no ETA.\"Another member advised that the complainant contact the casino representative for a quick resolution of the issue.Detecting scam casinosThere are many shady gambling sites out there. The members of the online cryptocurrency community usually share their experience using various gambling platforms. When people lose funds at scam casinos, they sometimes post their experiences in forums. Such posts serve as guideposts for future prospective players to avoid such scam casinos. Punters who encounter issues such as non-payment of winning bets also take advantage of the experience of other community members to determine if they used a fraudulent casino or just experienced delays in withdrawals.Freelance ServicesThe crypto community brings together people of diverse backgrounds, cultures, and skills. The online crypto gambling industry, as an integral part of the community, utilizes the specialized skills of community members to build and promote their businesses. Freelance skills such as translation services enable gambling platforms to reach local communities in their native languages. Most crypto gambling businesses are known to have a presence in the online cryptocurrency sphere. They also hire community members to help them accomplish their casino roadmaps.Important Online Crypto Community ForumsBitcoinTalkThis is one of the oldest cryptocurrency forums. It was founded by the Bitcoin inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, in November 2009. The forum is also the largest online community dedicated to cryptocurrencies.To access the gambling section of the site, go to Bitcoin Forum > Economy > Marketplace > Gambling.Its child boards are Games & Rounds (where several gaming platforms advertise their recent offerings), Investor-Based Games (which are mainly Ponzi, HYIP, and other scams), and Gambling Discussions.To use this forum effectively, the player should also go through the Scam Accusation section found at Bitcoin Forum > Economy > Trading Discussion > Scam Accusation. This is the section where casino scams, issues, and the reputation of the service quality at online crypto casinos are discussed.CryptoTalkThis forum was established in 2019 and has been promoted as a post to earn BTC platform. To access the gambling section, click the hamburger menu at the top left side of the forum. Scrolling down shows gambling, HYIPs, and free coins. This is where service discussions about cryptocurrency casinos are held. Going through the comments section of the gambling platform that the user is interested in would give them insight on what to expect, since Cryptotalk doesn’t have a scam review section.RedditThe subreddit, r/onlinegambling, has 11.5K members. It is one of the largest subreddits dedicated to crypto gambling. User-generated content on the subreddit is mostly questions about casino services and promotions by casino management. The sidebar promotes several online casinos, sportsbooks, and poker platforms. Even though these are promoted as the best platforms, this is not necessarily so.As a general rule, referral link spam, begging, doxxing, and sale pitches are prohibited on these gambling subreddits.BeermoneyForumWith 223k members, BeermoneyForum is one of the leading online forums for cryptocurrency gambling. Two related sub-sections of this platform are the investing and gambling sub-forums. The former is where user-generated HYIPs and ponzi schemes are advertised, while gaming and gambling platforms are found under the Gambling section. One advantage of this forum is that the administrators and moderators routinely flag casinos and services involved in scams.ConclusionOnline casino operators have strong links with the crypto community, since this community is the driving force behind Bitcoin and altcoin adoption. It is the community that determines the acceptance, rejection, or popularity of specific tokens. So casino owners generally ensure that their service offerings are in agreement with the demands, current trends, and direction of the online crypto community.QuoteBitdice Review: All You Need to Know About This CasinoBitdice is an online casino that has served the needs of punters since 2014.

I did my EOS deposit on Bitdice on February 12, 2022 at 04:10 AM (GMT -5h). tx It's been over 20 hours, and I still haven't received my funds. The EOS blockchain works as usual; the network is not overloaded (transactions to other addresses came through fast for a maximum of 5 minutes). Wrote more than ten messages in support without changes.\"He insisted that he wouldn’t be using the platform for games.It is worthy of note that these issues and all others were resolved by Bitdice. This is despite the fact that the casino representatives have not been active on the forum.When the user announced that their deposit had reflected in their account, a community member, YinShuiSiYuan, responded,\"Thanks for informing us, and it's good that everything ended positively, because I was afraid that the ending of this story might be a bit different. If the person representing bitdice.me reads this thread, they should report this type of situation.

After all, even in the case of doubts, the security team will be able to verify everything before someone wants to withdraw.\"RedditAt the Bitdice sub-reddit, the main concern of investors is that the casino has yet to pay a dividend to investors for months.
