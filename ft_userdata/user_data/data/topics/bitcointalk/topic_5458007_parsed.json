      "body": "Your mentioned wallets are already being talked in your provided references so as per the objective heading, the main purpose of the topic will be discussion about your mentioned wallets? Right? As, I found no other useful information which is unique to anyone. As, every wallet is being mentioned on this platform so many times. I hope you would not mind my words which might be wrong too. I think it would be nice if you could come up with some more unique and useful information other than repeating the features of wallets from their summaries. Well, as the purpose heading indicates, intentions are to help newbies, but in my POV, newbies do not come this deep into the forum because newbies to btt and crypto sphere too.",

This is a very wrong practice and breaks the privacy and decentralization of the wallet.It is also not anonymous if they are linking on chain information to real life identities.- Jay -",

If this is a discussion, then I would love to see more details and opinions about the wallet or how the wallet rates against the others, popularity etcFor example, very many members here would agree with me that wasabi would not be the kind of wallet you would recommend someone, as they even blacklist UTXO's.walletscrutiny.com for example gives one a good guide and groups wallets based on the important features users would love in an open source non-custodial wallet.",

In this system UTXOs are not  regarded  equally in terms of their   rights on mixing. This issue has sparked discussion in our forum, leading to an appeal to sign petition for the removal of Wasabi from recommended wallets on bitcoin.org.Instead of Wasabi I recommend directing users towards AirGap Vault, which seems to be suitable and reliable choice.",

It's the first time I've heard of this service, the attached table is a little misleading, and the name as well, since using the wallet use will determine whether it's airgapped or offline, it would have been better for them to choose another name, but other than that, it offers an experience that we can consider safe for beginners.My problem is that using an old phone as AirGap Vault is not an ideal experience because these phones may stop at any moment, but if you have a phone that you do not want to use and disconnect the physicals network parts properly, you will get a safe experience.I will try it later but it is good and can be added to the list.",

      "body": "Worth mentioning Railway, which is plugged into the Railgun Privacy protocol on Polygon, Ethereum etc. Not for native bitcoin, but does allow you to anonymously trade with wBTC.  So for instance after bridging to Polygon or Ethereum you deposit your wBTC into Railway which then gives you access to all of the liquidity on the chain via private dex trades. So private swap your wBTC into USDT, Dai etc and you can withdraw that to a fresh wallet and do whatever DeFi you wish. Whilst it isn't a mixer per se it also allows a simple round trip from Bitcoin -> Polygon -> Fresh wallet -> Fresh Bitcoin wallet therefore anonymising your bitcoin. Fees are 0.25% per transaction... So a deposit, dex trade ( which is both a withdrawal and a deposit of the swapped token) then a withdrawal would add up to about 1% + gas fees, which are negligible on Polygon and maybe a couple of hundred $s on Ethereum.",
