If there is any need for any board to be considered, then I believe there will be a more recognized way of doing that, maybe by creating a request topic like the ones that have been mentioned by _act_, but those are just requests; it's when the Administration finds it interesting that it could be given consideration. So if there is any board that you think is missing on the forum, you can make your suggestions and requests and hope for some positive outcome, which everyone's opinion must not be in your favor.",

They are active too throughout the month. We even share our monthly stats from we can easily check the activity our local members are doing here.But still after putting a request we are unable to get our own board. We are still a thread or you can say a topic. The point is, i just wanted to say the whole thing of adding new sections is not up to us this is upto the moderators like theymos etc.",

Any need currently?This looks as if theymos is asking or atleast one of the moderators. If you feel there are boards that need to be created, you start by naming them and saying the reason(s) you think they need to be added to the forum. Not just asking a random question when you actually lack the power to enforce whichever suggestions that would arise.I have seen people suggest security boards, nft board etc but it seems theymos is unwilling to add more board to this old software. That being said, the forum is fine and more boards are not needed unless when a particular local thread is worth to be granted a board, it will be done by the admins.",

Almost all life patterns, as well as social and economic factors, have been covered in the sections. I additionally don't believe there is a need for additional subsections because some of us here have yet to go around the forum because we have no business with other sections; hence, creating more will be ineffective in my opinion.",

That’s how broad the forum is!We can’t go about creating boards for every innovation that occurs in the crypto space.I’ll say, let’s work with what we’ve got and if you take a close look at it, you just might find the right board to accommodate just anything you hope to discuss about.",

Local board can not just be given. People requesting for it should work hard to get it. To have a local board, the people in the country posting on this forum must be very active on the local thread. If they have certain number of activity daily, the admin will give them local board. It is not up to a year that Nigeria was given a local board when their local thread was very active.
