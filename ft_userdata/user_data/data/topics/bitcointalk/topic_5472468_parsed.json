I am a guy who likes to take it safe and not risk everything on something new which may or may not have potential to grow in the future. Despite being the top gainers in the last 24 hours, anything could happen to them at any given time. Researching something new in the altcoin market seems like hassle and west of time to me. They could actually have potential but as everything goes with altcoin, when the trend or hype is over, the project is most likely dead. Thank you for bringing up the topic but I don't think this will do any good for me. The price pump could happen anytime given the current market situation. For that reason, try to stick with something reputable which can take you a long way. And if you are able to take the advantage of the recent market condition, then sure you should take it. Just a little reminder, don't blindly buy anything that shows green right now. Anything that goes up counts down as well.",

I don't want to hold them for now; maybe in the future I can. It depends if I see something good develop in their coins themselves.  Because mostly my basis is the top 20 listed on Coinmarketcap and Coingecko, these two platforms are often used to find potential crypto assets and then hold them for the long term. I also have other holdings for the short term to also get profit every day.",

It's worth noting that the tokens highlighted in your post may not be widely recognized except few of them like 1Inch, Sei and Bakeryswap, in the crypto space and their historical trading volume in particular has not been so significant. It is crucial to understand that currently cryptocurrencies market is in initial stage of an upward trend, and during such phase almost all alscoins tend to exhibit momentum due to increased interest of general public in crypto space. Therefore, conduct comprehensive research on a coin or token before making investment decision.",

When it pumped its price surged by 1000% and then the next day we know what happens in such a scenario. It is again an artificial pumping done by the whales to create FOMO, later they will sell to make good profits.",

The top gainers in the last 24 hours as listed in the OP is not a guarantee that they'll keep pumping and be profitable for investors to rush and buy them, because anything can happen in the coming 24 hours which might change the naretive of their positions. Like you I'll rather stick with  reputable altcoins and Bitcoin that have proven their consistency in the crypto market, knowing that even if they experience price dips that they'll surely pump back with higher ROI.",

I can see that some of these projects are highly qualified as reputable projects.Sei, the graph and bakeryswap and even 1inch are good projects in my opinion. Yes they might sound new but they literally in the past years already and been using some of them so I dont know how you can say they arent reputable. Maybe you wanted to say is famous? Or something you always see and read off.Well if thats the case as a trader I prefer to invest or trade these quiet one so when you hear them next time they are already famous so hence pumped out already. If theres noise means its already been pumped or gain a lot I typically stay away from those.",
