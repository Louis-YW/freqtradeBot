  "content": "This Is My Appeal To Theymos.In past, recent and future times, many forum users have (and will in future) come up (in posts) with so many great and not so great ideas/suggestions of what should be implemented or added to the forum.The posts/ideas/suggestions ~ The good, and ones that forum users think will benefit/be of great benefit to the forum gets supported, both in merits and positive comments, and unfortunately, that's the end of it, we never get to know what Theymos thinks, whether he agrees with the community or not, probably because this threads get buried so fast amongst several other threads in that board where the post was made.The posts/ideas/suggestion ~ The bad, and ones that the forum users do not agree with or think will benefit/be of any benefit to the forum, even sometimes with few merits as support, still gets trashed in the comment section, this already shows that the community does not support this idea - So Theymos, you don't have a problem here  .Now My Suggestion/AppealHow about a community voting sub/child board in the Meta Board where all this ideas/suggestions can be housed for easy access?, The main Meta board can be a place where every other topics concerning the forum can be discussed, while the Community Vote Sub/child board can be a place where any suggestion/ideas of what should be implemented on the forum can be posted ~ and a feature added that can allow users to cast a vote on ideas that they think is/are worthy to be implemented.An idea can be implemented after reaching a set amount of votes, lets say like 2 million, 3 million votes, depending on the size of the forum in terms of users ~ with newbies/junior members with low activity excluded and also denied voting rights in other to prevent abuse, that is prevent users from creating multiple accounts for the sole purpose of voting.ORThe voting can be made to be a two way voting, like it is with reddit up vote and down vote, An idea can either be implemented if it gets more up votes than down votes in 3 or 6 months counting from the day the idea/suggestion was posted, and if in the set 3 or 6 months from the day the idea/suggestion was posted, it got more down votes than up votes, then that idea can be trashed and never to be implemented since its not supported by the community.This is me thinking, maybe, another impossible thing.",

      "body": "This has been suggested quite a few times before and has been quite ignored by the forum afaik.I think one of the reasons this isn't done is because views change. Also Theymos and mods can get around to viewing all the suggestions topics and implement them - I guess this new system would be a way for users to track what's implemented/new on the forum but it's probably potentially unnecessary too (and depending on the feature might lead to spam).It might also be something that puts too much pressure on admins, staff and mods which could be considered problematic (considering they're volunteers).",

      "body": "Theymos is the only person that can make changes or additions and many of them will require time and be difficult to implement, voting will be useless, voting can only make sense if the system is automated, and once a suggestion for example clocks a certain number of votes, the system automatically implements it, but that isn't possible, if this voting system is to be accepted, even after voting, the work of implementation falls on Theymos.Needless to say that you wouldn't force the admin to implement a suggestion that he doesn't want, like or has the time for, the forum is centralized, so voting for a suggestion to be implemented can't work, that is why members make suggestions for implementation and wait for Theymos to either accept, reject or say nothing.",

This strategy might work to prevent the suggestions from getting lost under other threads.Fivestar4everMVP, you can create a thread and compile the different suggestions, so theymos can easily go through them if he needs it and it can be easily pushed up much better than bumping all the different threads.[1] Open Merit Source Applications,waiting list.- Jay -",
