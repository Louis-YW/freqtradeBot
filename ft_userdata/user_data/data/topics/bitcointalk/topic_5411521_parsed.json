Most of the people entering in crypto trading are corporate workers or people with job that wants extra profit using there savings. People are not contented on fixed salary they are getting and want a way earn more while crypto trading is very easy to access by just using a mobile phone and card to deposit money. These have already skills but they still choose crypto trading as another opportunity to earn more.",

People think investing or trading crypto will make them rich magically. As you said that's almost never going to happen. If they want to get rich out of dumb luck, they should just play dice and wager everything they have. Otherwise, getting rich takes enormous study and time. Learning a skill which is well in demand makes a huge difference and it is almost risk-free because you are not gambling at all. You become a merchant who sells his skills and gets paid for it. E-commerce is a good idea too. It is like trading crypto but unlike crypto, your products will always get sold for more than what you paid for. (as long as you sell a product which everybody wants of course)",

It is also correct to say that such users get cleaned off the charts very quickly on the next bull/bear cycle and are never heard of again.I always encourage people to learn new things and hence I would always ask them to do something they love, but most may not be able to afford paid courses in e-commerce or so. Naturally most are not having the degree or the background education to pursue the same too, since not everything can be learnt online.But learning something new may not may not improve their trading skills. So I dont understand your correlation here, rather is an anecdote.",
