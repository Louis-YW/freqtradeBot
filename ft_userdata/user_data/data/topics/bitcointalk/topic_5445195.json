But the unit you bought will remain unchanged forever. Price increases along with value growth. Value refers to how widely recognized Bitcoin is, and price refers to the current market price. You can conduct further research on the value, price, and units. Hence, it will be clearer to you.",

But if you refer to changes in the value of bitcoin with other currencies, then the value of bitcoin will not be the same, there will be changes in value because Bitcoin is a digital currency that fluctuates with high volatility. This is influenced by adoption and users, market demand and new news and events that will affect the entire market.Investing in bitcoin involves a high degree of risk and no one will be held responsible for the investment you make, that is completely self-conscious. It seems you need to learn more about Bitcoin Value.",

One of the greatest values of bitcoin is, bitcoin is teaching people this. Many people know it already. Many of them are wealthy from understanding this. They look at the clothes on their backs, realize that it is money, and figure out how to bargain it away for better clothing.",

But when transactions either use this on investment or on other means 1BTC is always equivalent to 1BTC and value will be less concern since you will only notice this once you cash out or exchange your bitcoins to fiat.",

Defining value can be broad from one person to another. For example, if you have Bitcoin and the government can be running after your finances maybe to confiscate them it would be impossible for them to track your Bitcoin not unless you are volunteering to tell them. Now that is one value of Bitcoin we can rely on. The price is of course depends on a lot of factors especially demand and supply...and because Bitcoin can be excelling on these aspects no wonder some are predicting that its Bitcoin can go to the moon at the right time. And today as the world is watching the banking turmoil in USA and Europe we can see that more and more are shifting their interest to Bitcoin especially as a reliable safe haven.",

I mean in a sense it doesn't mean that it is not possible at all but at the same time, it doesn't mean that it's going to happen even though it is possible. If war explodes nobody would ever be interested in buying bitcoin unless you still have the capabilities to buy it instead of just focusing on surviving. If people are convinced that it is going to be the end of the world and we already have no future, nobody would ever still invest in bitcoin.Bitcoin is still bitcoin, or should we say bitcoin technology, but for most people, this is just an investment, and even me so it all depends on the market price and that's how we value it period.",
