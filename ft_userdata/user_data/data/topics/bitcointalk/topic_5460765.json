I want to share my strategy on how to teach kids bitcoin and you can try it. Especially, those of us that want our kids to know what bitcoin is or have the basic knowledge of bitcoin. If you have a cartoon on bitcoin,you can put it for them to watch and after watching,ask them if they enjoyed it. Tell them that whenever they watch the cartoon, you will give them a reward,and it should be the something that they like most. Maybe candy,ice cream whatever that you know that makes them happy when they eat it,but something easy to afford. Like down here I can buy some chocolates for him. Tell them to watch it every evening or when you think is cool for them. Don't forget to keep to your promise whenever they watch the cartoon. You will see that they might not like the cartoon but they will love to watch the cartoon based on the benefit attached to it,and some will love to watch it not because of the benefit. You will see that consistent watching of the cartoon will begin to send messages to them about bitcoin and before you know it they will start asking you questions from the cartoon that they don't understand. From there you might take over from there. This is what I think that will work for me but it might not work for everyone. Newbies can also watch this cartoon to get a glimpse on what bitcoin is.I have two cartoons on bitcoinTurtle TwinsTears of ClownsWhat are your views on this.Let's discuss.",

      "body": "Sorry to ask, have you ever sat your kids down (if you have any) to ask them about the movies or animation clips that they have ever seen? Most times the idea looks good when we imagine it but when you start implementing it, you'll then see that it's more complicated than you thought. The only way this is going to work out is if you have numerous cartoons about Bitcoin, and there's a difference between viewing something to learn from it and viewing it just to satisfy someone else's desire. To me placing a reward for your kids so that they can continue watching a particular movie seems more like a torture to me because if I should go back to my childhood and my parents starts to buy me Cookie just so that I can watch a movie I will never be interested in the movie, with time it will become boring. Just let them grow up like normal kids it's not a must for them to know about Bitcoin at an early age, you could try to teach them about management even if it's not financial management you can also teach them about managing their time everything about your child should not just be centered on Bitcoin, after they have their own life to live, don't force your own on them.  Just my 2 Satoshi.",

That's actually good since kids are more into cartoons and easy to understand by the kids. Though it's not really advisable to teach kids crypto or Bitcoin, maybe it would be good to introduce it to them when they are already teenagers. Giving some rewards is actually good maybe you could ask some questions like a little quiz so for them to really watch and understand the videos as they know you'll be asking them regarding the video. If they might ask further more questions about Bitcoin just give them the basic information that their learning capacity could handle. The rest of the complicated things when they reach the proper age where they could have their own decision making which is 18+. Since Bitcoin is not easy as it looks in the cartoon since you will be risking your money or your kid's money when they invest without deep knowledge.",

They either watch something they like or they won’t care about the episodes anyway if they watch something they don’t want to.Instead, kids are curious and it’s quite easy to get them into BTC if they hang around you while you do your Bitcoin business. Keep them around when you’re doing BTC stuff and answer any question they may have about it. Just don’t enforce the idea, because they’ll just start refusing it through hate after a while.",

And like you said, you will only teach your kids about bitcoin if they have an idea about bitcoin, so why would you use rewards to make them watch bitcoin cartoons? It's like when my children are anorexic, refusing to eat, I take candy and cartoons as a reward and force them to eat reluctantly. I know I'm forcing them, but it's food, not unnecessary knowledge like bitcoin. Children need to have a childhood playing and doing what they like, they don't need to know about risky investments like bitcoin or any financial knowledge.",

Maybe I'll introduce bitcoin to my kids when they're 15, but if my kids don't like bitcoin, I don't think I need to force it either. I will let him grow with his will and motivation, let him fly with all the dreams he hasBut I'm pretty sure that in the future crypto will be a financial system. So I'm sure even if I don't introduce bitcoin to my kids, they will know about bitcoin and crypto system because the future will implement this technology. I am very sure about this",

I hope you are not going to make them the same video daily.   And the other channel you mentioned also have only 1 video of around 22 minutes. Means to say, what will you do after showing them these 2 videos.You will definitely going to find another BTC cartoon source but this will not create any interest in them. Because sometimes kids like the character they are watching and if you are going to change the cartoon source every time or everyday then they might not select their character and there will be a lack of interest too.But still i liked your plan, and you should also find some cartoons that could explain how finance is working. Because such things are necessary to known before getting into BTC.",

      "body": "This is where you have to be careful and sensitive depending on the age of your child. If the child is not 18 and above, and by my preference at least 21, I will not expose the child to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. No child should be taught such a risky/easy way to make money in my opinion, it might get into their heads if care is not taken.And as this could be psychological, instead for them to be facing their education and later a career, they might relax and be busy pursuing crypto since it offers them easy and fast money. And by then, you might not be able to control the situation anymore. Crypto investment should be a passive way of earning, everyone must task themselves into doing something good and build a name for themselves if possible and let crypto dealings be secondary.I bet that exposing them to crypto would not affect all children, but it will definitely affect a sizeable percentage of them. So, don't let us be careless as parents. If you don't want your children to miss out, invest on their behalf and never tell them until they are so old and mature to possess it. Just like old people do by buying shares for their children and later letting them know in the future.",

When cartoons become a lesson for you and it's not just an ordinary cartoon of course it will be a pretty good cartoon. \\Moreover, information about Bitcoin will be obtained in the cartoon show. But we also have to accompany them when watching this cartoon, while explaining what the purpose and purpose of the cartoon is. There will definitely be questions from children when they start watching the cotton. Then be happy enough to answer them with answers specifically for children. Don't be too burdensome, if they like it to continue but if they are getting bored then intersperse it with other cartoons. I also found a channel that discusses crypto and Bitcoin but the host is a child and he explains in his own language with examples that are easy to understand. https://www.youtube.com/@CryptoCoinKid1There are many methods or videos that can be used to introduce Bitcoin early on and of course in a way that is suitable for children.",
