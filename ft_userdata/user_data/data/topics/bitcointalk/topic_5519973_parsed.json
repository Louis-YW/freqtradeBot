It could've changed the world on a comprehensive societal and economic level.Any thoughts?Gold, silver, and other precious stones are free gifts of nature, but only a few people own them. Bitcoin cannot be owned by everybody because a large portion of the global population doesn't even know what Bitcoin is. Some people still believe that it is a scam and will gradually become worthless. While others are limited by illiteracy, lack of basic infrastructures like internet connections, and poverty. The distribution of global wealth is not done in an equitable manner. \"The richest 1% own almost half of the world’s wealth, while the poorest half of the world own just 0.75%\".",

Bitcoin is so successful because it is not easy for everyone. As you have planned, Bitcoin will need to increase the supply of Bitcoin in order for it to benefit the majority of people worldwide. If this happened Bitcoin would not be where it is today.Majority of people worldwide can definitely access Bitcoin, but most people's thinking is not positive for Bitcoin. They think Bitcoin is a scam. People who are Bitcoin positive are benefiting from Bitcoin today. People are not able to benefit from Bitcoin because of their own mindset. It will certainly be a reason for happiness for Bitcoin and Bitcoiners if the majority of people in the world get into Bitcoin.",

That means you are not rich because you have what everybody are having which makes it not scarce. You will find it difficult to see someone to employ and it would be as if people do not have money at all. Let nature be what it should be for people to know its value.Also bitcoin helped those that bought it. That is certain. Although, it helped beyond because if not because of bitcoin, no exchanges and other crypto businesses will be existing today which employ people and getting paid.",

Do you really understand how the markets work? A financial market cannot work if all traders make profit and nobody makes loses. Imagine all the people around the world having Bitcoin. The BTC price would hit absurd levels, but the price growth would most likely be over. Who is going to make profits, when the Bitcoin price stops growing? Only the \"bears\". The people, who sell at a higher price and buy later at a lower price.How do you imagine Bitcoin changing the economy and the society, when the blockchain can't handle an unlimited amount of transactions?",

Is there anything apart from life that people have equal distribution of? It's natural to have unequal distribution of wealth and anything you can think of. Bitcoin is following the same path despite there's enough available. Is there any resources that benefits the entire global population without working for it? Your hardwork will earned you the portion that you deserve. Normally, we already understand that wealth attract wealth and people with materials getting a larger benefit. It's a result of their hardworking and nothing more.",

However, with proper research and patience, those who made long efforts in studying bitcoin will discover its high potentials and eventually decide to invest on it, while those who have always been doubtful and hesitant, they will never experience the vast benefits from bitcoin.",

We know that some people out there saying Bitcoin is a scam and that is because they don't know how Bitcoin work and not know how people can make money from Bitcoin. If they know for sure and see the reality, they will want to join with them and trying to buy as many Bitcoin as they can and hold it for a long term.",

To be precise, we are saving ourselves and bitcoin is one of the tools we use. Bitcoin is a financial market, and when investing there will be winners and losers, no market makes everyone win. So bitcoin will be seen as a savior for those who know how to use it to make profits but on the contrary, those who lose money will not be able to say that bitcoin is helping them.",

There are those who have lost money due to selling early and with a loss. Some investments were stoles. So not only it helped or could have helped, it also made someone's life worse.
