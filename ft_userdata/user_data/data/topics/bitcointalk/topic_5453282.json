Firstly, I'd like to know what components are necessary to build a functional hardware wallet. Apart from the obvious need for a secure microcontroller, I assume there are other essential parts like a display, buttons for user input, and a secure element for key storage. Could you please help me compile a list of the necessary components and their specifications? Additionally, if there are any specific brands or models that you recommend, I would greatly appreciate your insights.Furthermore, I'm curious if there is any readily available source code or open-source projects that I can refer to while building my hardware wallet. It would be immensely helpful to have a solid foundation or reference implementation to ensure the security and functionality of my device. If you know of any existing projects, particularly ones resembling the Ledger's architecture, I would be grateful if you could share the relevant information.I understand that building a hardware wallet involves complex considerations, particularly regarding security and firmware development. Therefore, any advice, best practices, or resources you can offer would be highly valuable to me. If you have any personal experiences with similar projects or if you know of any other forums or communities dedicated to hardware wallet development, please feel free to mention them as well.Thank you very much for your time and assistance. I'm excited to dive into this project and look forward to your insights and suggestions.",

The have built both the hardware and the software. Check those links:https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner (for the code and software)https://seedsigner.com/ (the website)Even if you don't want to re-use their code, you could use it to develop your own's software, although there is nothing wrong with it.Personally I have to say Seedsigner is a magnificent project!For more custom solutions, I will let other people talk.",

You could even build your own Trezor device[3].

      "body": "This topic would fit better in our 'Hardware Wallets' category.Here it is explained how you can move your topic.As others have mentioned, there are various commercial hardware wallets whose source is public and / or open (don't want to get into the details and differences right now). These are:Foundation Devices Passport Firmware source files Hardware source filesTrezor Firmware source files Hardware source filesColdCard Firmware source files Schematics (somehow no board files?)Furthermore, there is a whole list of DIY wallets which are based on off-the-shelf hardware, and are mostly open-source firmware projects for microcontroller dev kits such as the M5Stack.You can find the whole list here: [LI​ST] Open Source Hardware WalletsNo offense please, but since you are asking basic questions, such as which 'essential parts like a display and buttons' you need, I get the impression that it would be best for you to start by building / setting up one of those DIY options and then begin tweaking some aspects (in software or hardware) here and there instead of 'starting from scratch'.That should give you the understanding and experience you need to build your own device. Or you may end up being really happy with a (maybe just slightly modified) existing device.",

      "body": "It's not easy to make it happen, because building a hardware wallet requires an idea or understanding about cryptography, electronics and security. Today, one of the examples that is open source is the Trezor wallet and Ledger, although there is now an issue here because of the service they offer.        Now, if you are really determined you should start checking the information about Ledger or Trezor, and once you have these resources you can start to build your own hardware wallet. Of course, what you will need in this matter is that you will need to buy the right one for it, second you need to install firmware, and you will try your hardware wallet or test it.Guidelines to build your own Hardware wallet",

It has literal blue prints on it and there should be no problem in building the entire hardware wallet with it. I have seen that there are DIY (Do it yourself ) site with complete guideline about almost everything that you could imagine. These site Will also lead you towards the hardware and software parts required and where you could purchase them. Most of the programmable boards are already available on the market. All you have to do is plug and play everything. Good luck for your project, hope to see your from the scratch hardware wallet soon.",

It's not considered hardware wallet, but signing device, because it's airgapped in comparison with hardware wallets. My only concern is that it's less reviewed than the latter. Do your search.",

It has literal blue prints on it and there should be no problem in building the entire hardware wallet with it. If you cared to check your sources, the wallet you quoted - ColdCard - does not have 'literal blueprints' in their 'Open Verifiable Source Code' GitHub repository. On the hardware side, it only contains the (pretty basic) schematics as PDF. 'Literal blue prints' should also contain the EDA source files.Such as:https://github.com/trezor/trezor-hardware/tree/master/electronics/trezor_one/kicadhttps://github.com/Foundation-Devices/passport2-hardware/tree/main/electronics/PCB",
