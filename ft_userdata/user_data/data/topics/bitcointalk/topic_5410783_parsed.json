Also has anyone heard about doge chain project? A friend talked about this and I want to ask. For me you either pick fantom instead of dogecoin.  It is an L1 with a lot of potentials and currently down a lot plus there are things a lot to do on fantom than simply holding a non utility dogecoin memecoin.  Aside from trading,  you can only used that as store of value,  if you are a fun blockchain user then youll find a project that can heavily attached to a lot of use cases and environment such as gaming,  finance,  defi, and many more.",

Diversify your money can also become one of best choice in this case i think that fantom is far better in term of fundamental from project unlike doge coin which was only rely from the hype but yeah elon doesn't have any impact anymore to the meme coin. That may make meme coin being so difficult to get crazy increase",

Fantom is good but Dogecoin isn't bad either because this is not an ordinary meme that likes to be pump or dump, Dogecoin is another alternative in some businesses e.g. gambling or real use on tesla elon industry, besides that many people still hold Doge for reasons we don't know. It will definitely be possible another pump in the future, although Fantom is better.",

If we mention Elon Musk then any good coin can not give you profit equal to this doge coin. It is better to invest in two coins. Many people want to invest in Fantom because they don't want to go under any circumstances like winning the lottery.",

Also has anyone heard about doge chain project? A friend talked about this and I want to ask. Doge is a ticking time bomb if you are asking me personally. It has unlimited supply without token burn mechanism and the only thing that keeps his price holding on is the fact that Elon must is supporting it and a chance to pump it again in the future. This is the reason why there are still many blind followers that keeps holding and buying this dip even though they are just buying a falling dagger. I would suggest you to purchase Fantom without a second thoughts. Dogecoin is just for leisure investment.That's one reason why I will invest in both, no one can really tell what will happen to any project so instead of making some guess is rather take risk on both project, in this crypto space any project can do wonders, just any, even the ones that people don't talk about or call shit projects.",

Also has anyone heard about doge chain project? A friend talked about this and I want to ask. For now, I tend to prefer Fantom over Doge, even though I used to benefit from trading Dogecoin.The reason for preferring Fantom is because Fantom itself is a state-of-the-art blockchain project that provides a platform for building customized decentralized applications and non-exchangeable tokens.has a direct acylic graph (DAG) smart contract platform. it can increase scalability and transaction speed which can increase to more than 300k per second.Fantom is powered by the power of Lachesis built on the Ethereum blockchain, due to its fast and efficient platform, leading blockchain project",

Think again before investing my friend.Altcoins could also be as profitable as Bitcoin but the difference is, that BTC could provide a higher assurance when it comes to profitability. I don't know much about Fantom either but I guess buying Doge won't be a wise idea. You can still pick higher potential altcoins than a meme coin. There are still good top coins that you could buy since you have a big fund.",
