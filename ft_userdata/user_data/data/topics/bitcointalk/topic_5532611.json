If someone is experienced and know how to use leverage to their advantage, and can also read the market to some extent, they can trade altcoins which aren't shitcoins or pump-and-dump tokens but actual, real, and use-worthy altcoins and manage to get good profits in no time.Some influencers even make trades on-stream. We have some in our country who come online, start live streaming, and then make futures trades live only to show people that it's possible to earn money this way, however, even though they warn others about the risks involved, some people don't get it, and which is why there are often people found cursing such influencers because they followed them and lost money.A person needs to understand that another person won't feed you with their hands. They can only show you the direction, and the rest is your job to do. Only because someone is saying a certain thing is good and should be done, you shouldn't do it without doing your own research about it. That's bad practice.",

It makes you wonder, in such a huge crypto market, why are they focusing on Bitcoin alone?We all know investing in Bitcoin carries risk, but compared to any altcoin, it's the least risky option. Sure, it might not offer the biggest profits at this stage due to its high price, but in the long run, it’s almost a guaranteed win. So now, you just have to ask yourself, are you willing to take on higher risk for potentially bigger rewards, or do you play it safe with Bitcoin, which has proven itself over time?",

Let me start from where you ended, using an exchange is common for trading, but also know the risk for using a centralized exchange, but if I may recommend you with one, choose Binance or Bybit for your trading, but know that not your keys not your coins, now back to the first aspect, isn't it better to trade and be successful, have a minimal profit, and be less open to high risk by trading Bitcoin than going for altcoins we can't even defend anything about them and we loose at the end.",

What about you and which exchange did you use in trading, kindly share with us. Depends on your risk appetite and your knowledge since somehow you can trade Bitcoin if you know how to deal with its risk. To many people trade Bitcoin on futures so maybe you could get some experience then decide for yourself if trading is your thing.But if you can't and realize that trading is risky you can go to other option which is to hold Bitcoin since this is another ideal thing to do especially that future is always promising and looking at history it shows that holders gain a lot from choosing this type of investment. Also it will avoid you not only to get lots of pressure due to some fuds and other market stressful movement , but also with other things that can disturb your peace for looking at the current direction of the market.",

I prefer to buy BTC and hold it for the long term, rather than trading with it and expose myself to more risks. Day traders may prefer altcoins though, maybe because of the volatility and the chances of them making profit, though the volatility can also present losses too, that's why trading is considered much more risky than just holding.",

In trading, either Spot or Margin or Futures, Bitcoin is best for trading too because of its narrower margin of price changes, less volatility than altcoins. Even with Margin or Futures, you will have less risk of liquidations than with altcoins.With Spot trading, if you open a bad trading position, you can hold your bitcoin like a holder, with acceptance of risk by holding your coins on centralized exchanges, it's not recommended as it is very risky.Reminder: do not keep your money in online account.",

What about you and which exchange did you use in trading, kindly share with us. Everyone trades bitcoin because even if you don’t trade bitcoin you certainly need analysis from bitcoin to help get better confluences on other trading pair, that’s why you see many traders usually start the day with bitcoin analysis first before others. As to the pair I trade it is bitcoin and sometimes other coins. One reason why I feel like you need to actually have a favourite pair you trade is simply to actually get better knowledge of the pair. If someone decides to either focus on trading BTCUSDT as pair I believe even if the market is actually unpredictable you will be able to not only understand the pairs chat pattern, but also can be able to focus on its fundamentals than going through lots of pairs fundamentals. One aspect of trading is backtesting your trades and with one pair it is much much easier to do this. For me I use Bybit to trade but due to the charges of recent I have moved to MEXC at the moment",
