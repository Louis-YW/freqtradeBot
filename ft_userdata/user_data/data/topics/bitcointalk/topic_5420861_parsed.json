  "content": "International Outsourcer Company Studying Crypto Incentives ProgramI work in a renowned International Outsourcer company also operating in my country, which I will not mention due to a “Non-Disclosure Agreement” issue; this same Outsourcer recently started a survey in order to try to understand the knowledge and interest of its employees about Cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology. One of the central ideas related to this initiative will be the possibility of putting in place an incentive program and extra bonuses for its employees delivered in the form of crypto assets. The good news is that, apparently, the industry is expanding significantly, and even the corporate world is starting to wave their hand on to the cryptocurrency universe.Have any of you, in your companies, already addressed the topic of crypto assets\\cryptocurrencies?",
