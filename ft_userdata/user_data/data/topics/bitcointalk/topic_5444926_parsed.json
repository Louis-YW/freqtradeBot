A U.S. drone was hitting by a Russian jet in the black sea and this black sea is a boundary between Russia and US, Â but that's not the interesting part of it, the thing here is that a citizen of the U.S said Russian ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º denied the accused. Can this be true or a lie?

I wonder what kind of respond will the USA do this time, will they just do all talks or they will respond with the same damage as well?",

The American drone was on a routine flight across the Black Sea when these Russian aircraft intercepted it and facilitated its crash. Russia is claiming that there was no contact between its aircraft and the drone while the Pentagon is considering it an accident. But an investigation is still ongoing and the result will be out soon. Now the US is focusing on recovering the ruins of the drone because it might not want the Russians to have access to such a sensitive military intelligence device.I pray this confrontation will not lead to military escalation between these two world powers because the world might not recover easily from the impact. The US and its partners are avoiding any personal confrontation between them and Russia during this war in Ukraine.",

Regardless of the true reason, this does appear to be another escalation towards WWIII. I think the only thing left to make it official is for China to choose sides and engage in military action. The video has already been released and shows an RF fighter jet literally throwing fuel over the drone to down it, without really \"downing it\". There is some probability of this being intentional as the US cannot search for it there even if they knew where it fell, but also it is quite difficult for the RF to get anything from there.All summed, it seems that is just the way the RF Airforce shows the finger to the US, by making them loose 100 million (cost of a drone) for fun.",

He could have perfectly just take it down with the weapons, but (as I expected) the Russian government is seeking to get their hands on the technology in the drone.The plan was to release fuel on the drone and then ignite it, but since I did not see a huge fireball in the video, I assume in the end he went with the easiest solution in the end.I would have guessed those drones had some self-destruct mechanism, so the enemy won't get them in one piece, I guess I was wrong.",

It is a costly joke to be honest and kind of a statement about the matter of espionage.That is something I have noted as well since I started to pay attention to geopolitics and the political climate of Russia, for some reason, the diplomatic tactics of the Russian government are mostly about denying any wrong doing and exaggerate the wrong doings of their adversaries to a comical level. When they do not have a way to picture things the way they want for their propaganda, then nothing is said.If you have taken a look to the Russia based channel RT, you know what I mean.Â  Â At least, western administrations eventually admit their mistakes when are obvious.",

And at least Russia denies doing anything. Even when it did.Attacking Nato on purpose would pretty much guarantee that there would be a bigger war coming and no one wants that. Not even the putler's trolls in here.But i am starting to think that WW3 could be unavoidable. Russia has a history of violating Finnish airspace a lot and now that Finland is going to nato, we actually might drop their planes if they try it again. Russia is pushing their limits and anyone with a brain can see that China won't take Russia's side if they end up starting the war by attacking nato, they have too much in stake if they want to keep on pushing their economy.",
