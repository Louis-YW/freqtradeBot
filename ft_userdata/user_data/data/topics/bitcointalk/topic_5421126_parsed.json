Ronaldo and the centralised Binance. Good luck to him if he is endorsed by Binance. I do not know much about these worthless NFTs that people are making them to worth something, isn't C. Ronaldo selling the NFTs for his own more profits?Celebrities will only gain from NFTs as some people will want to buy his iconic moments. Which means this is just about C. Ronaldo, but has nothing to do with gambling.",

The whole market for NFTs is no longer here and Christiano will have to wait for another bull run before the profits start pouring. You need an influx of new investors and another wave of FOMO to resurrect this industry and chances are it will never come back like ICOs never did.",

Here Ronaldo is an artist for Binance to promote his services, but on the other hand this will also make binance get a lot of profit.Quote from: Blawpaw on November 15, 2022, 03:05:15 PMBinance is hitting strong the Footbal industry and already counts with several partnerships with many prominent players as well as Football clubs. This is good news for the industry as it brings a lot more visibility to cryptos.The crypto industry has now even received a lot of attention from various types of sports. Not only football, I think there are many other sports that have partnered with the crypto industry. Obviously this would benefit both industries, but of course it would not be a guarantee that the project would be highly credible.",

I'm waiting for November 18.It's not the news that they shared but it was a promotion and luckily Ronaldo agrees with the deal, I think that is because he was offered with good money by binance. Binance won't do that if they didn't know that they can recover what they have paid because Ronaldo is a famous personality in the field of football and his fans could easily purchase the NFT's by showing their support to the player.Those who aren't a true fan but only a fan of cryptos/nft or simply a fan of making out money through the hype will also ride the trend. Binance never stops innovating because they want to grow more. They want to dominate the crypto world.",

It is unlikely that if someone makes unsuccessful investments in the NFT, he will blame Ronaldo for this. On the other hand, the crypto now has a rather negative background, and such news from Ronaldo, who carefully monitors his reputation, surprised me.",

We have also seen this with former top football players, who then become ambassadors for a gambling site. That also means nothing. If there are problems with a site or a payout, users should not think that these celebrities are going to solve it for you. They have absolutely nothing to do with that part of the site and are only there for the image of the site towards the customers. I would almost say that you just have to pay more attention, because sites want to buy a certain reputation indirectly through such constructions.",
