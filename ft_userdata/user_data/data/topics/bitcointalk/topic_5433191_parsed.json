However, I observe a mass adoption of the newer address types. In fact I have a PK that gives me access to a legacy address, that's why I felt the need to ask.Quote from: jackg on January 05, 2023, 10:58:24 PMI don't think there's a reason it'd be removed from Bitcoin core (and if it was, someone else would probably want to encode for it too - even if someone did it for a hobby project).There's a lot of niche things quite a few wallets support that I think would go first (like mini private keys and p2pk - which I assume is still possible). To be honest, now that I think about it more clearly, I don't see the reason why they would stop supporting legacy addresses. I mean, even if they are deprecated, they still don't provoke any issue to the software developers, nor to the product they produce. They could potentially just exist.",

It could happen on particular wallets (those developed by third parties) but in general there is no good enough reasons to stop supporting legacy formats.
