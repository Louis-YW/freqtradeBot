However, your current wallet set up (not entirely clear, but some combination of hardware wallets and multi-sig) sounds like it is much safer than a standard Bitcoin Core hot wallet, and so running your own node won't improve on the security of your coins.Here's what I would do:Download Bitcoin Core and run a full node*Set up your own personal Electrum serverUse your hardware wallets via Electrum, pointed exclusively at your own Electrum serverThis gives you the privacy and verification benefits of running a node, while still keeping your coins within a more secure hardware wallet set up. However, the combination of a full node and an Electrum server does require sufficient hardware and storage space to run effectively.*Running a pruned node is a possibility, but you'll need to make sure that Core knows all your addresses in advance so it can scan them as it goes before it starts pruning blocks. And if you ever create a new address in any of your wallets (or any new wallets), then you won't be able to sync it using a pruned node without downloading the entire blockchain again.",

So it would run counter to my already paranoia. That not only answers my question but also solidifies my decision. Lol. I really just wanted to support the network and was on the fence about the core wallet. I wouldn’t then use the core wallet and the is be running a node for it just to sit there and look pretty and not really use it. Thanks for all of the clarity. I’ll just stick with my cold storage and multisig. Thanks again.",

There are no benefits to having a pruned node the security of your wallet always depends on how you protect your PC and it is running just like an ordinary wallet the only problem is it only downloads the block history that includes your transactions and it's not syncing from time to time if there is a new block coming. Pruned node RPC commands on the console also do not work. Unlike having a full node it is syncing from time to time and all commands from the console should be working the only problem is you will need to download the entire blockchain and you need to keep your PC online and connected to the internet.

You are correct, “the why” is more important than the how. That’s what I’m battling. Does the benefit outweigh the risks and is it better than what I’m doing now. I don’t know enough to make that decision. I’ve researched the hell out of it and it all sounds so complicated. As already said, you have no cold storage in your setup. So for now the risk I see is you, no offense: the risk is that you think you know some things and you may not actually know them, hence doing mistakes because of some assumptions you may make. My advice is to read more, much more.Hardware wallets are not unsafe, but they're not cold storage either. (Cold storage never connects to internet. Ever. Hence it's also not synced, but that's OK.)Now, about \"the why\". If you use Electrum, or Ledger Live, for example, these are wallets that connect to servers and exchange information. This means that the owners of the servers can easily see what are your addresses and what funds you have. If some of that ever goes (or ever went) without your VPN, then they'll also correlate with your IP.Some find this a problem. Some don't. It's up to you. This is the most important \"why\" in this equation.Then, the only time I've tried to connect my Ledger to Bitcoin Core I failed. It should be, in theory, possible, but it may (still) not be straightforward. So you may need a more complicated setup and a pruned node may not help in this/may not be enough. I have my own setup with full node (on a separate HDD) and a local Electrum server, since Electrum is friendly enough with my Ledger. As said, a pruned node still downloads the entire blockchain, just doesn't keep it all on your disk. Even more, a pruned node services one wallet; if you for some reason want to switch to another wallet you may have to re-download the whole blockchain (and since I do make tests now and then, this is a no-go for me).If you only use one wallet, maybe a setup with Bitcoin Core (pruned) and Sparrow wallet would do. But you have to check for yourself...",
