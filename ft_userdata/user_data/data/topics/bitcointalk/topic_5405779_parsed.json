  "content": "Gold has been the store of value par excellence for about 48 years now. After the United States returned to granting the private use of gold in 74 and the decoupling from the dollar, they allowed a dizzying rise in its price.However, what makes gold a store of value are several factors, including:Scarcity -> Gold is one of the scarcest metals on the face of the earth, it is not the scarcest. But it remains among the poorest, which makes it palatable.Proof of work-> Gold is difficult to mine, as you have to organize human resources + machinery to mine it. Once extracted, it is necessary to provide for the logistics and control of the gold.Let us also remember that gold is a metal that resists time, that is, it does not undergo variations.For several days I have been thinking of Bitcoin as the new gold for the 21st century:Bitcoin is inefficient as layer 1 if we look at it as a payment system. For this, we are working on solutions like Lightning Network (layer 2) - but that's not the main point.Mining Bitcoin is already difficult today, it will become increasingly difficult over time -> This is an important analogy with Gold. Both are difficult and will be increasingly difficult to extract.Bitcoin has a limited amount and will not change over time -> Same as gold.The Byzantine Generals Problem -> Miners are incentivized not to compromise the BTC network as well as is very complicated, we can compare it with the physical gold surveillance system.The first country that will take mining seriously by meeting the various mining farms, and finding efficient mining solutions, could increase its economic capacity.What if the US regulates crypto and declares Bitcoin a store of value? Basically, it doesn't have an ICO, there are no teams behind it, and there isn't an owner.",

Once extracted, it is necessary to provide for the logistics and control of the gold.True, when it comes to industrial mining, it is a very expensive and dirty business, whether it is surface mining or mines, it requires a lot of money, manpower and time. However, ordinary people search for gold only with metal detectors or by washing on river/sea shores.Quote from: J117 on July 10, 2022, 09:57:22 AMBitcoin is inefficient as layer 1 if we look at it as a payment system. For this, we are working on solutions like Lightning Network (layer 2) - but that's not the main point.Bitcoin is incomparably more efficient than gold in the payment system, and it works quite well even without LN - the problem is with users who don't want to think but want everything to be automatic - but if you know how to properly set the fee in relation to mempool, the transaction will be confirmed in a reasonable time. In addition, any transaction that does not have an RBF can be accepted without confirmation, especially if it is for smaller amounts.Quote from: J117 on July 10, 2022, 09:57:22 AMMining Bitcoin is already difficult today, it will become increasingly difficult over time -> This is an important analogy with Gold. Both are difficult and will be increasingly difficult to extract.Partly true, because Bitcoin has a max supply and we know that by the end of this decade 99% will be mined, while there are undefined amounts of gold on our planet, not to mention outside of it.

Basically, it doesn't have an ICO, there are no teams behind it, and there isn't an owner.So didn't El Salvador do just that - Bitcoin is legal tender and they mine it with the help of geothermal energy? What if the US declares Bitcoin illegal, closes all crypto exchanges and demands the same measures from its allies? Don't believe that the US could ever go so far and give such legitimacy to Bitcoin when they don't allow a regular spot ETF that is available in many other countries around the world.",

You know just recently a huge deposit of gold was discovered in Uganda, QuoteRecent exploration surveys in Uganda have led to the discovery of approximately 31 million tons of gold ore deposits  source This recent deposit discovered alone is more than the total fixed amount of bitcoin that can be mined. This discovery of this large amount of gold makes one wonder and accept the possibility that there can also be another deposit of gold as large as that sitting somewhere undiscovered.",

For example, there used to be inflation which occurred in Western Europe in 16-17th centuries, which is attributed largely to large influx of gold from Spanish colonization missions. As for our times, there've been reports on Uganda's huge gold deposits that, if confirmed, would more than double current amounts of refined gold.Also, proof of work is technically true, but it's necessarily harmful to the environment and local communities, whereas Bitcoin mining's ecological impact depends on the sources of energy.That being said, Bitcoin is way less stable than gold, and I think gold is often associated with certain safety and stability that Bitcoin does not possess.",

You could draw a lot of connection if you so wished to desire but in that sense it could be drawn a lot more.Plus, gold could still be \"found\", rare these days I agree, but there is no limit to how much gold there is, because it is unknown give or take, sure we won't be finding an earth size gold for sure, but it is still unknown how much is left. On top of that, with space getting closer and closer each decade, I am sure in the distant future \"space mining\" won't be impossible.So, even if we see the short term similar, eventually gold will get devalued by influx of more gold coming in, whereas bitcoin will always be 21 million capped no matter what happens, plus all the burned ones, so it's even less.",
