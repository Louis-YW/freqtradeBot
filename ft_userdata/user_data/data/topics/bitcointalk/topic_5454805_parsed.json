  "content": "I ran across this recently, and wanted to share as I know there are a lot of various BTC card collectors on here.In 2022, the Bitcoin themed SBF \"Treasure Hunter\" Topps Garbage Pail Kids card was released. The #6 card shows Bitcoins being clay pigeon style blasted from the air by SBF himself. Some have even entered I am no expert, but a few interesting items to note:1) It appears 1265 were made 2) There is a unhappy face border parallel version (example below, not mine). I'm not sure if these are included in the 1265 production run, or a limited number of these were produced on top of the 1265 white borders.Being a limited production run, these look to be a nice collector item and I wanted to share. Ebay has them pretty cheap to snatch one or more up!https://www.ebay.com/itm/394477508851?hash=item5bd8b118f3:g:0GgAAOSwzKxj9s0k&amdata=enc%3AAQAIAAAA0EoTMd2%2FG%2F%2BmZpvGczdMhWKfq9XXGBptRxu1uWSZexCzSkGcS4A3ayhPITJu4kLQuM9YgZTWbqjHhCcRxG7Ui82vymGilUH8XHWMcsK%2BtHTKPU6%2BpvRgwtTBv3ckBea72TBtZmzjKL2WdnAFjMoLzhg1nKCniVmqilEexoYoGgI9bldvQcJiWC6t2s5SRK5l%2FmHNdiq5yOQhsQRx741XW1Je48TBrGWCrpfvbhIvNDWKVET2Xq1%2B2bSpjXjDIbQa4z%2BBdDczA61CmW9TyGcHzkg%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR8j_rI-PYg",
