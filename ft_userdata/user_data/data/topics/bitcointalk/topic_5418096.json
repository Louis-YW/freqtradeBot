      "body": "Know that holding bitcoin is not trading at all, trading is very risky, it can take from someone just like gambling, the reason people that want to trade are advised to use the amount of money they can afford to lose for trading. Or maybe you just meant that your friend taught you how to convert fiat to bitcoin, that is trading too actually as you trade from one coin to another.Hope you used a reputed wallet for your holding? Reputed wallets that are open source and having more features? I can recommend Electrum if you have small amount of coins. But if you want to hold large amount, best to get a open source hardware wallet if you can not setup airgapped device to generate a paper wallet or to have the wallet on the airgapped device as a cold wallet.",

There is a lot to know about it, and this is why you should know that there are people out there who are willing to assist you in every way possible by giving useful information about the said cryptcurrency. Although it's good to have someone you trust who can help you in the beginning, I still think it's the best to be well-informed on your own. You don't need to be a tech-geek or financial expert, just someone who wants to learn the basics of how the cryptocurrency works and ways on how it can improve your life.",

Certainly getting to know about the wallet is a good first step.it's good to have someone who will explain some ambiguities and help you master the material but I would suggest you do more research on your own and read the experiences of others (this forum is a great start for that). it's about your money and you shouldn't trust anyone. I'm telling you based on personal negative experience when you trust a person and not a process.",

You should continue learning on your own now, as he has already taught you that,you need someone to put you through which introducing you to bitcoin. This forum is the best place to learn whatever you want to know on bitcoin and so many others. Read and make research, learn from peoples article.

You don't have to stop at having a Bitcoin wallet but I hope you can invest in it by buying fraction of bitcoin like some Satoshi (hope you know what that is by now  ) because a bitcoin can be expensive to buy, you start small to accumulate it.

Maybe its good if you pursue and be more eager to search for further knowledge about it since its a great accomplishment for you also with the person who teach you if they see you succeed.Also you must know that acquiring bitcoin is not only ends with buying it as investment.
