  "content": "Hey.. I found this on my wallet today at the NFTs section, after I received my bestchange retrodrop I never applied for anything on this forum to receive a 5000 usdc voucher stating \" you have won 5000 usdc voucher\" voucher expires in 7 days, I can swap it at claim.usdcircle.io.Like this sounds strange to me because I can't say for my stayed over the years I never received anything like this or to say someone gift me 5k usdc.I don't know for those who are good in making findings should please dig into the details I shared to know if is legitimate or fake, as they voucher expires in 7 days. To me this is too fake to be real and I can't imagine if is a trap set for in order to wipe my wallet because of my bestchange retrodrop they have failed, I won't even try any nonsense to swap it except people over here prove it to be real otherwise I won't try it.Edit..From my information on transaction details I noticed that it was only sent to 4 address that received each 5000 usdc in their various addresses. https://polygonscan.com/address/0x27ab9F0553B5C3eAc8Af7B52dd52520503aFD6a4#tokentxnsErc1155",

      "body": "Oh you have won 5000 usdc. You are so unlucky. check my nfts, how much I won. Only one nft worth $100,000This is 100% scam attempt and very now becomes very common and no one caring about it. first scammers was sending free scam tokens with name of big name like XRP , XMR , when some try to swap then wallet got empty. Now this is little advance trick where they send NFT with tricky name and winning voucher card. when you click on nft you will see the ad claim website to claim voucher price. Thanks for sharing, I will suggest everyone to use Safepal wallet because there you will not see scam token and nft. This issue is only with trust wallet and they have no support for automatic hiding scam tokens and nft.You can also read here Metamask warning article tooNFT airdrop scams",

It is like someone coming to you to tell you to go with me somewhere and you will get $ 5000. It is definitely scam and putting the expiration date of the voucher within 7 days is proof that they can cancel it Or delete it without being able to prove that it is yours (if the service is really real.) I expect that after you log in to that site, you will be asked to either deposit some ETHs or empty your wallet.",

All of those addresses are likely their own address used to convince their victim, and even if they don't own them you can expect their partners or friends to own those. Nobody is going to do a giveaway for $5000 to begin with, that's just common sense. I've also seen similar posts on social media claiming that users can claim a free $1k airdrop. It is nothing new, don't be fooled and just remember that if something is too good to be true, it probably is.",

I knew there's something phishing about this airdrop because no project would risk 5k usdc as an airdrop to wallet. Although I am not an airdrop lover so I wasn't too haste with the value I found in my wallet because I know is all fake, only wanting to get attention to their site so that more people may likely fall victim of their cheap scam.Henceforth, I want to let everyone know to be very careful about this type of scam and fake airdrop that's claiming to have dropped 5000 usdc, especially to newbies that are hunting for airdrops to be very mindful otherwise their wallet would likely get piped and all their funds stolen away.",

I think it is a social attack, especially if you post your addresses here, they will think that you have a lot of Ethereum and therefore there is a potential chance that you authenticate the NFT or mistakenly link your wallet to them.Stopping posting your addresses publicly and using new ones will make it less likely that you'll be sent a random NFT.Their site is full of lies. It has been less than a month since that domain bought and they claim that they have been given an award for the 100 most influential projects and that they have a partnership with BlackRock.",

Again what surprises me is that I am not use to NFTs apart from the one gain from my campaign as a loyalty rewards to their participants. I am aware of the scheme which scammers often uses to scam people especially when they notices newbies are desperate of receiving free tokens they don't mind setting traps for people to fall prey and they automatically sweeped their accounts at the cost of trying to exchange those free NFTs.",

Anyone who appears desperate for this is likely going to fall prey of the attack and this I know for sure wouldn't go down well with them.OP it would please you to know that I received the airdrop as well but I never remembered anytime I filled any form in the name of winning an airdrop. It's just that these scammers are just desperate to scam people without minding the repercussions attached to their act.I was wondering how a project could give out $5k which is good enough for them to do publicity with. Come to talk of it, that amount for an airdrop now is too outrageous  and can  not be feasible. I believe this nft given is a dust attack by scammers to invade wallets who try swapping the nft for a token as means of exchange. What I would advise holders of such nft to do is to move all their assets out of that wallet to another so as not to be tempted by the flashy price of the nft because constant attention of it will definitely lead to ok me trying to see how it works and in the course of trial, the unfortunate might likely occur which would cause a lo of damages.  One needs be careful of the dust nft.",

That's my major guiding principle in this industry. Yes, if people in the field of crypto apply this principle, I think they will not be affected by any potential fraud that may befall their wallets. Scammers exploit the factor of temptation and greed among people, so you find them distributing to hundreds and thousands of wallets quantities of scam tokens, which are worth thousands of dollars, and NFTs like the one the OP received and the value of its voucher is 5000 USDT, you will find that there are people (especially beginners) who are deceived into these schemes in order to obtain this massive amount of money for free, and in the end they lose all their assets. Hence, yes, nothing is free in crypto. If you do not do any work or find any reason or spend any money to obtain it, then these NFTs or tokens that you received as an airdrop or giveaway are undoubtedly traps to trap you.",

That's how scammers attack people, they usually use that sketchy prize thing so if people believe that they really won because of that notification then after that they will get scammed. We should know that scamming starts there and its obvious scheme so if we know for ourselves that we didn't participate on anything that can rewards us a huge amount like that then we should ignore it. Doesn't get any damn to notice it can save us from getting scam so best to be smart and not get scammed by said schemes.",

These self questions you have mentioned here has a big role to play for any one curious about such occurrence or drop as a gift to them. Many people fail to have a clear thought about some little things that matters before they engage to interacting with such contract address to transact. I see no reason why I should just wake up and start doing transactions on my wallet for a token I have no idea about. I never filled any form or partook in any free airdrop to say that this is where this token rewards are coming from or somebody sent them to me as a reward or payment for services rendered.  These things should be what one should have as thought before trying to do anything when such was sent to their wallet.",
