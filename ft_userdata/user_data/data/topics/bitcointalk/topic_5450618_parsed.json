The ridge iron piece was the first physical crypto type piece I ever laid eyes on and got me into collecting physical crypto. Would love to own one but the link to websites either doesn’t work or they don’t respond to messages. Figured it was worth a shot to ask. Images below if I did it right:",

Yes sir they exist. I believe I know a guy with the bottom coin let me see if I can contact him for real life pics of finished product. Now I’m curious",
