The worker do not have to say anything. Casinos will have rules, their works should not violate any of the rules. What I have noticed is that no worker will encourage you to stop playing, they will not also encourage you to continue playing. It is you that will tell yourself what that is right.",

      "body": "No matter what you tell that gambler to stop playing and walk away, it will be based on his choice, because gamblers don't listen to advice when they are winning. The gambler might feel that you are scared that he will win more money and that you were sent by the casino to make him walk away for the casino not to run at loss, and what makes you think that he will even listen to you.I don't think that people working in a casino can tell a gambler when to quit or not because that is where their weekly pay comes from, the loss of gamblers. Another thing is that there will be rules and regulation in casinos and if they find out that you are trying to make gamblers gamble responsible by limiting their bet, you might get fired or they will never allow you to go close to the gamblers.",

Instead, they will only give you their best services so that you will be more encourage to stay in the casino longer. Gambling is a business so as much as possible, they will do everything to increase their profits, even if the gambler itself is already struggling on his finances.Gamblers should be aware already how to be responsible on their gambling habits prior to gambling. Staffs have also their own jobs, and reminding those gamblers how to be responsible will never be part of their job description.",

      "body": "Have you heard of or seen a hotel manager send a customer away not to spend a month in the hotel? Hey, leave my hotel, you'll spend lots of money, if you continue staying! In business, such advice doesn't exist. Everyone is assumed to be in their right senses. Doesn't it sound like an insult to the gambler? he'll easily go to your competitor's casino, then gamble at ease. Hanging a placard that reads \"gamble responsibly\" is enough to encourage responsible gambling. The casino also wants to make more money, how on earth will their worker be allowed to continue working if he acts like that to customers? They'll be trained to act the opposite way. Offering drinks to the winner, to feel relaxed and continue wagering his wins. If casinos practice what you advise, they'll all run out of business. The money rewarded to a specific player is what serves as a marketing strategy for casinos to yield more customers. And when they don't calculate well on how it's being issued, the business will crumble. So, telling every winner to go home, is taking the casino one step closer to failing as a business. In some casinos, most waitresses or croupiers don't know much about gambling and are just there to exhibit their skills and get paid.Most of them don't gamble and can't give gambling advice. They hardly talk to gamblers, unless they are asked a question. Sometimes they can't answer questions correctly and will reply with let me ask a different staff. Gamblers get disappointed when they figure out that a worker in a casino can't answer a basic question about gambling. Remember they are not there to gamble but to work. So, if the management figures out that their worker is a compulsive gambler wouldn't they sack him? despite working in a casino. Business is run in there like any other place. Rules and ethics are made available for workers. And a staff watches the moves and actions of all the employees. The only possible means of rendering such help is outside the casino or work hours. Maybe, luckily, you saw the player in a different location, the croupier is free to usher in their advice to the player. Then wait forever to see him patronize your casino next time.",

For the safest route, they can just ignore and not say anything to the players. If they make one (1) mistake, then they can potentially lose their jobs, therefore impeding the opportunity for their livelihood.Again, it is somehow a difficult line to draw especially if you are an advocate of responsible gambling. But if you are a staff working at such casino and you also want to spread the message of responsible gambling, then it is better to quit your job (to avoid any conflict of interest) and be an advocate for such.",

      "body": "As others have already said, it is very unlikely some casino worker who have direct contact with gamblers will have something to say to them in order to encourage responsible gambling or leave the table when they are winning money. I would be very surprised if on the contracts of those workers some clausules about interaction with the gamblers are not included. In the end, the casino and resorts benefit when people spend money on their services and also when the gamblers end up losing money while gambling. The managers of the casino know it would be counter productive to allow their workers to encourage people to walk away with money. The ettiquete those workers serving gamblers is supposed to be very polite and educated, so gamblers feel comfortable to come again and continue to have fun on the gambling floor.",

Expect the worker to just watch since this is how they paid, although there are words poster regarding on responsible gambling but for sure they don't really mean it since they just post that to have some nice words but for sure they want people to gamble since this is how the casino earn a lot of profit.",

It's similar to those popular gamblers that were banned from certain establishments because they keep beating the house.Responsible gambling for casinos is more like taking some actions to prevent a player from losing a lot and going towards addiction.",

However, if it was really done on his own initiative and maybe if his superiors found out he could be scolded because the casino aims to take more from gamblers. In general these actions will not be in written rules so you just need to make sure what he says is not known by his superiors. I mean that the casino goal is to operate to make the biggest profit possible, and the staff has no authority to determine which  gamblers come in and leave.",
