      "body": "Haven't used the app in a really long time -- but you should be able to still fix this with a replace-by-fee (RBF) option (You can increase the fee so that problem doesn't appear). If not, maybe try restoring the seed phrase on a desktop client and then do that from there (right click on the transaction > replace by fee).Must be a bug if new version, if no desktop, try an older version and restore?P.S. For more eyes on this one so you get the help you need, move this topic to the specific technical > Wallet> Electrum section here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=98.0",

      "body": "The error is exactly as described - you are trying to broadcast a transaction paying a fee rate that is below the mempool minimum, which is 1 sat/vbyte.Try to create the transaction again, and this time open the Advanced Preview window if it doesn't open automatically. At the bottom of this window you will see a box labelled says \"Target fee\". Make sure that the number in this box is at least 1.If that still isn't working then it might be a problem with the server you are connected to having a different minimum set. Go to Tools -> Network, pick a different server to use (Right click -> Use as server), and try again.",
