These two organizations stand for opposing ideals—one rooted in conventional financial institutions, the other a forerunner of the digital age. The conflict between the dollar and Bitcoin has prompted discussions about the future of money, investing, and the role of technology in forming financial institutions as the global economy continues to change. My question is this, why does the value of BTC decrease when the value of the dollar rises?",

Therefore, when you see BTC price go up, that can mean either two things - the market demand of Bitcoin is increasing, or the US dollar is losing value because of inflation while Bitcoin stays at the same demand.Same is true in reverse - when BTC value goes down, it doesn't necessarily mean that dollar is also going up, perhaps the dollar is remaining at the same value while BTC's own demand diminishes.",

      "body": "Between Bitcoin and USD, their correlation operates inversely. In simpler terms, when investors flock to a strengthening asset, let's say the asset gaining strength is USD, the interest in alternative assets like Bitcoin tends to decrease. This triggers selling pressure that significantly impacts prices. Naturally, investors have to decide which asset is more stable, meaning the one that's gaining strength at that time.However, in certain instances of Bitcoin's price movement, things don't always unfold as anticipated. For instance, during a global economic crisis, people seek out a Safe Haven Asset. As of now, I would place gold at the top tier of Safe Haven Assets. Consequently, both USD and BTC might experience panicked selling.",

Although after some long period, dollar devaluation will become noticable but people do not see it as it is kind of hidden unless you are expert enough to calculate it.",

      "body": "Think of Bitcoin like a financial superhero that comes to the rescue when the value of the dollar takes a hit. When the dollar's value goes down, Bitcoin tends to rise in value. This is because Bitcoin is like a treasure chest with only 21 million coins inside, making it really rare and special. So, when inflation shows up, people find Bitcoin super attractive.But since it can get quite volatile in terms of price, when folks feel pretty good about the dollar, they might ditch some of their Bitcoin for less volatile stuff. That can make the price of Bitcoin take a dip. The Bitcoin-dollar relationship is like a complicated dance that keeps changing its moves.",

You can buy 50% less stuff than 20 years ago. Thats the dolar purchasing power chart:2- DXY pumps when there is a panic in the market (no matter what it is caused by) and this causes investors to migrate from riskier assets to safer ones. therefore, they migrate from exotic fiat currencies to the dollar, sell shares on foreign markets, sell bitcoin. Thats the migration from risky assets to save assets not the migration from old money to new money.",

When inflation grows, prices of commodities increases and when it reduces so does the prices of commodities.The changes in reference to Bitcoin price is not significant.",

It's the same as Bitcoin, in fact if the market demand for USD decreases, the USD value will also decrease accordingly and if market demand increases the value will also increase, even though it's actually more complex, we can simplify it like that. But if so, why has Bitcoin's value increased so significantly compared to USD in recent years? because people understand that the potential of Bitcoin can revolutionize global financial markets in the future and buying Bitcoin early can provide high profit potential in the future, so even though many people say negative speculation or things about Bitcoin, there are still many people who hold it because of its potential.",

Bitcoin is a traded currency, and its price is mostly calculated by the dollar. But the price ups and downs of Bitcoin do not define how the dollar can be valued. I guess the dollar's value is most often determined by how high inflation hits it or how well they can resist it, and a strong economy also contributes to its value.
