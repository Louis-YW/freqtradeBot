If anyone wants to copy trader, they can just go to exchanges that support it and copy trader their, no interaction with people like you directly. People should also know that copy trading does not mean making money, it can lead to loss of money too.

There is no evidence needed about this, people should stay away from this if they want to stay away from scam.",
