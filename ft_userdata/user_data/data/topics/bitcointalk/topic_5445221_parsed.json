This shouldn't have been happening in this century with all gauges/measures at the apex bank's disposal.Well, this is not the first time that FED is bailing out banks, it only depends on the number of banks and the amount of bailout funds that would determine the extent to which inflation could be induced, it might not even be noticed at all.Naturally, this should induce inflation by economical interpretation as it would be a situation where more money will be available for little goods and services.But no one would know the extent now, let the bailout figure and the number of helped banks be ascertained first.",

During the past 6 months, the Fed's policy has been to limit hyperinflation to reach a healthy rate of 2%, and it has continued to raise interest rates to curb inflation and reduce market liquidity.During the past week, a liquidity problem appeared in one of the banks, and thus panic began to affect all customers in most small and medium banks in the United States, and this may lead to the collapse of the economy, which prompted the Federal Reserve to intervene urgently.So what is happening now is a temporary act to prevent the economy from failing, and it is a more urgent act than fighting inflation.The problem is that reaction policy always leads to failure because it means economic confusion, so let's see what happens.",

The inflation won't be reversed, the inflation rate will go down but the price increases will still be there. That becomes a problem when the wage increases are disproportional from the inflation rate.And of course, when the fed introduces new money into circulation, it's difficult to take that money out. Interest rate hikes are the only remedy they have and that has ramifications for GDP growth.",

They should really start looking after a strategy which will help America to get over the debts they are piling up over the time. If you checkout the real live data of US Income Tax Vs. US Debts then the later one is rising by millions every hours to days. Goa bless America in the upcoming decade. Many fellow members think that America had been in debts since many years yet it is surviving and stuff like that. However, sooner or later this bubble will burst as well and FED won’t be in the position to overcome the returns after inflation is gone. Because by that time they will realise they are more into debts themselves and there is no more Air to Money conversion.",

Many of these banks bought bonds (very secure money, but when purchased a couple years ago with a ten year maturity, they paid very little due to the interest rate environment at the time) but now if those banks wanted to sell those same bonds, maybe because.. there was a rush of customers who did not feel their money was safe and acted irrationally all at once, then they cannot sell off these low paying bonds quick enough. That's because you can buy newly issued bonds from the government paying much higher rates. So maybe these banks put too much of their money into these fairly illiquid assets and now struggle to cash out, but besides that they are still solvent - at least until their customers all go crazy at once.",

Now my question is will this increase inflation or not?Its a good question.The fed \"erases\" bond losses by expanding its balance sheet to buyout outstanding debt. I think the consensus is this expansion can be relatively contained within banking and financial systems. Without having much of a negative effect on markets or consumers. It doesn't trickle down in a way that directly affects the price of gasoline or eggs.The evidence for this lies in many banks around the world being bailed out by the fed under the TARP bill from 2009 to the present. Without the process having much of an effect on the price of customer goods. The main difference from previous bailouts to current ones, is banks had better options and a growing economy to work with to payback bailout loans. While in the current market, they have a contracting economy and worsening economic conditions. Some of what people are calling \"inflation\" atm is actually due to shipping delays creating artificial scarcity in markets. Which is a trend which has been observed for many years. Most noticeably in raw aluminum markets where coca cola and pepsi were forced to pay considerably higher prices for aluminum for their beverage cans. During a time when shipping delays created artificial scarcity for raw alu metals.",

This money wasn't in circulation, now it will go into circulation and that's why it will drop the value of dollar, and that will cause inflation because inflation is basically dollar losing value. When dollar does that, usually most other currencies follow the same path as well, they don't have to but they usually do. This is why I believe that due to this depositors money being safe type of act they do, which is the right option, inflation will happen. Would you rather let people lose billions and not have inflation, or save everyone's money and have inflation? I feel like they made the right choice with this one.",
