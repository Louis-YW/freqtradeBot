Whenever you think Bitcoin dumping will surely come up. Prices of all commodities including oil, gas have increased due to which everyone is waiting for winter season. Those who want to invest must think that if they invest in the present time, there is definitely a chance of getting something good.",

Firstly, that recovery started around 19200 and it's now at 20200 so 1k up from a few days back and more than 1.5k from the last week's lows. Secondly, we're still in the same range we were in since June which is roughly 19 - 25k USD. It really doesn't change anything that Bitcoin goes up by 2k USD if it remains in the range.

As long as the Bitcoin price doesn't drop to $17k again, I think we don't need to worry about the price of Bitcoin. Remember it is a bearish period, a dump is something usual, we shouldn't be so worried about the temporary drops. I am also not really sure that the big factor to dump Bitcoin today is the high inflation.Anyway, what is wrong with Bitcoin purpose? The current dump doesn't mean Bitcoin denies its purpose. Learn more about the factor of Bitcoin dump, it shouldn't be about inflation only, it can be about manipulation or other things.",

So let's wait for the market to settle in, weak hands has to be shaken out, or those who wanted to sell at $22k, get their profits and then reinvent when the price goes $19k-$20k.

Because Inflation is a decrease in purchasing power in all sectors of the economy and also the market. So what is happening to Bitcoin at this time is a natural thing and is not deviant because people are not able to make purchases gradually when inflation occurs. Bitcoin crashes are a common occurrence, but if it is accompanied by inflation, then it is very visible as if Bitcoin is not doing what it should be doing. Though it is a natural thing and also very simple to interpret at this time.",

In addition, the US stock market, which was in positive territory, fell and the S&P 500 closed at -4%, and the €/$ pair, in which the € was recovering, turned completely upside down as well, because investors expect that the US monetary policy is going to tighten even more in the face of this.Quote from: eddie13 on September 13, 2022, 07:54:49 PMThis is the exact opposite of what Bitcoin is supposed to do..Bitcoin is not supposed to protect or fail to protect from inflation in the short term, in a few hours like yesterday. In short periods of time it gets carried away like the rest of the market, what we will have to see when this period of inflation passes is whether it has protected itself well from inflation.Quote from: LoyceMobile on September 13, 2022, 09:25:17 PMMarkets are completely dependent on BRRR nowadays. It can only normalize when the economy makes sense again. You know, old fashioned things like positive interest and higher savings interest than inflation.I may be wrong but I believe that higher interests than inflation will not be seen. They will raise whatever they are forced to raise but they will remain below inflation and with the desire to lower rates at the minimum that they can lower them again. Economies are too dependent on liquidity and they are already starting to have a cold turkey. Even if Bitcoin is supposed to protect against inflation, what is clear is that in this period there is less money available and less money circulating, therefore, it is logical that there is not as much money entering the Bitcoin market.",

Inflation, CPI, unemployment rates and other news can affect Bitcoin and drags it down.
