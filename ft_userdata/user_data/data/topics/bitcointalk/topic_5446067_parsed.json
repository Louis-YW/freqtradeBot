  "content": "I have had this confusion running in my head and most times I pretend that I understand what actually happened but deep down me I still have some confusions. My confusion is:1. Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin and also created bitcoin.orgWhy did he not secure bitcoin.com domain. Does he have problem with the .com domain extension?I mean as a CEO or an entrepreneur, what you are expected to do is to register and secure the two top level domain extensions(.com and .org) to your business name. Why did Satoshi and Malmi register register bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org and forgot about bitcoin.com?2. According to Wikipedia,Â  bitcoin.com was first registered in 2008 by Jesse Heitler and later transfered to David Lowy and later got to Roger Ver who later leased same to blockchain.info and later to OKCoin and now the CEO is Davis Jarvis other bla and blah3. Was the name bitcoin.com registered before bitcoin.org? This is because wiki said that bitcoin.org was created by the two first developers of bitcoin (Satoshi and Malmi) somewhere 2009 but another article I read said that Malmi met Satoshi in 2011 which is years after. 4. I am being confused because both bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org looks like something that is decentralized like Bitcoin as the former will tell you to choose your wallet and walk you through how to create either mobile, desktop or apple wallet.The third one is rather looking like an CEX talking about APY and 227% yield. Can anyone send me links where I can read the relationship between Bitcoin.org, Bitcoin.com, and Bitcointalk.org?",

Does he have problem with the .com domain extension?He could have if he wanted to, but he decided to go with the .org domain instead. The .org top-level domain was originally intended for non-profit organizations and has been used as such for many years. However, over time, the use of .org TLDs has expanded beyond non-profit organizations, and it is now commonly used for a variety of purposes. For example, many open-source projects use .org TLDs as a way to highlight their commitment to community-building, collaboration, and advocacy.Quote from: Zoomic on March 23, 2023, 03:39:50 PMI mean as a CEO or an entrepreneur, what you are expected to do is to register and secure the two top level domain extensions(.com and .org) to your business name. Why did Satoshi and Malmi register register bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org and forgot about bitcoin.com?Satoshi is neither a CEO nor an entrepreneur, in that sense. If he wanted to establish a company based on the Bitcoin project, he would likely have registered a .com domain, but he chose not to do so.",

The .org just serve the right purpose and it's just perfect for the website, any one who knows the difference between .org and .com when he/she comes across Bitcoin.org the person will know that this site is not profit oriented site.",

      "body": "I was also a little confused at first about the domain names bitcoin.com and bitcoin.org, because I thought that bitcoin.com was the official place for Bitcoin, but bitcoin.org was the real website. But this makes sense because the .org domain is more appropriate for Bitcoin compared to .com because the .org domain is for organizations while the .com is for commercial - Satoshi's idea to develop Bitcoin was not for commercial, but for a global payment system which is faster, secure, anonymous, and low cost, this is probably the reason why he prefers .org over .com domains. And moreover the .com domain was previously affiliated with 2 companies, namely Swedish and Korean companies, maybe he doesn't want to be associated with these two companies.",

And as CEO is considered to have a company which bitcoin is not either. That is why the .org the fitting tld domain extension for it. This is obviously explained on the bitcoin.org website.",
