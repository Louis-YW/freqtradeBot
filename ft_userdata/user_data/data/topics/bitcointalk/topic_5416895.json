I'd like to discuss some of the points I quote below about the future of bitcoin, and I'd really like to know if you're worried about that?Quote1. Remember that Bitcoin is still beta software. Don't put all of your money into BTC!2. \"I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.\" -- SatoshiAbout the first point: I assume that there is a risk of failure on this currency given that bitcoin is still beta software. I don't know if my concern about that is unreasonable or not, but there are certainly risks I can think of.About the second point: It is possible that there was no transaction volume in bitcoin's first 20 years. However I wouldn't worry too much about that because up to now the volume of bitcoin has been huge and bitcoin has dominated the market for a long time.Then, what do you think about the two points above.",

However, even on beta software, I am still not worried.Honestly, I'd really like to know some opinions on what the risks might be if bitcoin was beta software, have you thought about it?I think it'll stay until there's no more significant changes to the code like has been said above. It might remain in beta for a long time more and I don't think that's a problem. Sometimes companies release beta updates a week or two before the main stable update and make them reversible - we might not yet know if we need this with a future bitcoin fork.One of the main things I can see aside from forks is mining. What if someone somewhere produces really powerful mining chips and has a monopoly on it by being able to mine at a low rate (this might be on the extreme as it'll probably not take too long for companies to catch up and compete but it might pose a risk still too).I think it's kept with bitcoin core also because it's a flage that might welcome feedback and people to join the team to fix bugs and submit reports maybe that one bug that doesn't do much now could do a lot once a feature it effects gets implemented differently.A lot of companies also come out of beta to charge people to use their software too - like Microsoft did with windows 10.",

We should only worry for a beta software that is close source for a long time and not the decentralized bitcoin. I believe the OP's worry was about the possible vulnerability that usually occurs when software ware still in beta and this reminds me of the vulnerability called BTC inventory out of memory denial of service attack which was detected by Braydon Fuller in the year 2018.Yes, we don't need to see it as a threat since the BTC dev ( of course Braydon Fuller is among them) is making a contribution to the development of the software to prevent possible vulnerability.",

I didn't know that Bitcoin is still in beta software but thanks for this one. With regards to putting all of your money into BTC, I agree with it because I believe in diversification and when I say diversification, it means putting money into different assets like Crypto, Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate etc. etc. Maybe there is some here who puts all of their trust into BTC thus, they went all in into it and there's nothing wrong with it since it's your decision and money. Just be ready if incase...2. This is the one that I worry about. This one depends on the adoption of Bitcoin worldwide because either people will integrate Bitcoin in their everyday lives or not at all. It's either we see people trading Bitcoin or using Bitcoin in our daily transactions or not at all. On the contrary, we've seen Bitcoin's volume if not increasing remain sideways on a day-to-day basis, but it isn't still safe to say that Bitcoin will not disappear after 20 years. That again depends on the adoption of Bitcoin.",

As for it being in beta software, I'm not sure like others who have expressed doubts, but I think it simply means that as functional as it is, it still needs to be improved and some features implemented.",

Beta or not, not putting everything in BTC is something that must be done not only in BTC but also in other forms, but that is not a reason for us to diversify into altcoins which are actually more risky2.

Just as the internet needs to be understood beyond computers and browsers, money is more than just coins and cash. The bank accounts and credit cards you use are just one part of using money.In the long term, I believe bitcoin will work to further decentralize the financial authority that currently resides in the big banks and regulatory bodies. This may mean a lot in the years to come but in the end, it will be good for everyone as long as we protect ourselves from theft along the way.I personally would love to buy a new house with bitcoin one day!!!",
