  "content": "QuotePostFinance, Switzerland’s fifth-largest financial services firm, says it will begin offering its users access to cryptocurrency, thanks to a partnership with regulated digital asset services provider Sygnum Bank.PostFinance, which is owned by the Swiss government, will start by providing its 2.5 million customers access to buy, store and sell leading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), with more crypto-tokens to be added in due course.Switzerland marches to the beat of its own drum and stands in stark contrast to places like the U.S., where a concerted effort to stamp crypto out seems to be the end goal. Crypto-focused Sygnum, which attained a banking license from Swiss regulators some four years ago, caters to a range of institutions, including Cantonal banks and private banks.“Digital assets have become an integral part of the financial world, and our customers want access to this market at PostFinance, their trusted principal bank,” said PostFinance Chief Investment Officer Philipp Merkt in a statement. “A reputable and established partner like Sygnum Bank with an excellent service offering is more important than ever.”The decision by PostFinance to branch into crypto was partly driven by outflows from retail banks in Switzerland into the digital asset class, according to Fritz Jost, chief B2B officer, Sygnum Bank.Switzerland's goal appears to stand in contrast to what is happening in the United States, where the ultimate goal appears to be a concerted effort to crack down on cryptocurrency.It seems that their motive for this is that they notice that there are a large number of financial flows to cryptocurrency exchanges and instead of blocking them, it is better to provide a better and regulated service, which is better for everyone.Source https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/05/swiss-government-owned-bank-postfinance-to-offer-customers-crypto/",

      "body": "Switzerland is known in the whole world for its banks and banking system, and while a large part of it is the reliability of its political and economic climate due to its historical neutral status, I believe another important part is its openness to new approaches. Since the bank is owned by the government, it represents an official pro-crypto approach and a reasonable view that banks and the state should focus on profits, so instead of fighting against cryptos banks can offer services to those interested in cryptos and make money.",

And if you refuse to offer these crypto services, the ever-increasing clients will move to other banks that offer such services. Restrictions on crypto transactions will only lead to a loss of revenue because people will always seek alternative means to deal with cryptocurrencies. And these banks need alternative sources of income or funds to avoid collapsing.Although the bank's target is to centralize, control and exploit the crypto industry, it is a plus to the sector because it will not last forever. More people will be introduced to cryptocurrencies and some of them will embrace the sector. With more awareness, they will learn to move their coins to decentralized platforms where it is safe.",

But I respect the initiative of Switzerland by acknowledging crypto as they expand the options in improving their services to their investors. As people find more services bank give, the more customers would recognize their bank. You can't blame US with the cons of Bitcoin since still open to illegal activities and more fraud. Both country seen the potential of Bitcoin where it could open many opportunities, but unlike Switzerland, they took initiative first and seems like they could handle it since they are known for their financial sector.",

      "body": "That's really great news for us. It shows that slowly but progressively, many governments and banks, for example, the Swiss bank that is mentioned in the post, are accepting that cryptocurrency is the currency of the future. It also shows that they are somehow promoting the use of cryptocurrencies and their intentions are positive. That's another great move that they offered BTC and ETH as starting cryptos in their bank.I hope that their mission will be successfully accomplished because there are many governments that are totally against crypto. The sad thing is that they don't show their hatred publicly. However, I believe that they are surely scared due to the decentralized nature of cryptos. But I'm still optimistic that they will also embrace crypto in the future.",

Instead of blocking financial flows to cryptocurrency exchanges, PostFinance has decided to provide a better and regulated service to meet the needs of its customers. The decision was also driven by the growing importance of digital assets in the financial world.Switzerland, in contrast to the United States, seems to have a different approach to cryptocurrencies. While the US is focused on cracking down on cryptocurrencies, Switzerland has taken a different approach by providing a reputable and established partner like Sygnum Bank to offer its customers access to this market.This is a measure to ensure that customers have access to a regulated and safe way of trading cryptocurrencies.",

They treat it as a mutual fund of some sort where you can leave it to the hands of the institution and that it will be waiting for them when it's time to liquidate. I'm not against banks offering users crypto directly or including it as part of a portfolio -- I'm only hoping that people understand that it's not actually their coin unless it's under their own control.",

I would even conclude that most refuse to understand because it's easier that way, if only profit is at stake, then that's the only thing that matters in the end. If the bank provides guarantees and insurances for such crypto deposits, many will consider it a much better option than using CEX or non-custodial wallets.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on April 09, 2023, 03:58:52 AMOn the one hand, the fact that they offer it to you at the bank, in the eyes of society, gives it a good reputation, and on the other hand, although you are right, it's like buying bitcoin on Coinbase or others and leaving it there.I can agree with you here, because most people look for some kind of confirmation from the government, politicians or banks in order to believe that something is legitimate, and the Bitcoin logo on the door of a well-known bank is certainly a good advertisement and gives people some kind of confidence in something. The only question is whether banks want to profit only from fees, or would they also offer the possibility of withdrawals to non-custodial wallets? If that option existed, then I personally would not have anything against banks becoming part of the game.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on April 09, 2023, 03:58:52 AMMichal Saylor told an anecdote about how a subsidiary of Bank of America went from telling him that not only could he not buy bitcoin there, but that they could not even talk about it, to offering bitcoin trading and custody services.

If I'm not mistaken, a few days ago I saw that BOA became one of the largest owners of shares in MicroStrategy (Q1 2023), so we can say that such banks are also changing their strategy a bit, because that bank was known for its extremely negative attitude towards Bitcoin in the past.",

It would be stupid and such a scummy move if they just decide to confiscate crypto from the banks if they never stated that crypto is illegal. As for how some banks got into trouble recently, crypto is not really the reason as far as I know, just poor decision-making from the management in general. At the end of the day though, while I won't be surprised if they change their tune again, I do think they won't claim deposited crypto unless they want protests to happen frequently.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on April 09, 2023, 03:58:52 AMMichal Saylor told an anecdote about how a subsidiary of Bank of America went from telling him that not only could he not buy bitcoin there, but that they could not even talk about it, to offering bitcoin trading and custody services.

Regardless of how satoshi envisioned the future to be, people will always have different ideas. At the end of the day, as long as people are aware of the risk, I believe most of them will adjust their plans accordingly. Some, if not all will stop being reliant on a third party if they want full control over their wealth sooner or later imo. If they're not convinced then hopefully they don't get screwed if the banks decide to go bankrupt and lost their money.",
