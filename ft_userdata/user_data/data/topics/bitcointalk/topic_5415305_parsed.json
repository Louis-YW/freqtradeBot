  "content": "PROMXIDO Mission is to be the single-stop multi-chain launchpad for selected projects without distinction of the blockchain used. While the current project landscape is scattered and dependent on the blockchain used, PROMXIDO will offer the possibility to launch on one or multiple selected blockchains.In an ideal world, blockchain should be trustful, but PROMXIDO will have a due diligence process on every selected project as it is not always the case. It will communicate withÂ  transparency to the potential participants. Participants will need to stake a pre-defined amount of PROMXIDO tokens (PRMX) to access the IDOs held on the App.PROMXIDO will not limit itself to a launchpad and, to a second extent, will develop an ecosystem offering support options to projects such as incubation, or Marketing.This paper will go through the different features that PROMXIDO will propose and its functionality.Multi-Chain IDO Launchpad",
