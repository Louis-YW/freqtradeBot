Don't forget to vote in the survey.I think Galatasaray and Fenerbahce will be the favorites and these two teams have no doubt about the quality of their performance.But for me personally, I would be more inclined to make Fenerbahce the favorite who has big chance of winning the competition and bringing home the Turkish Cup.",

There is a slight possibility about Beşiktaş - Eyüpspor game that can be surprise. Caner Erkin and Arda Turan will do everything they can to beat Beşiktaş. I'm sure they will be extra motivated. If Beşiktaş continues to be out of form during the time of this match, we may see a surprise in the favor of Eyüpspor. Except this, this round will probably without any interesting results.",

Kasımpaşa took 16 shots in the match but couldn't score a goal. Bandırmaspor's only shot on target was a goal. Beşiktaş and Eyüpspor will play in the important match of the day. Beşiktaş, who wants to win this cup this year, will not let it be a surprise. I expect them to win the match easily by scoring an early goal with an effective game. It looks like Svensson will be in the starting 11 for the first time. Emrecan Terzi, Demir Ege and Semih are expected to be in the first 11 again. Gedson, Ghezzal and Muleka will also play alongside the youngsters. I think this squad is enough to win the match.",

Fenerbahçe will play Adanaspor tomorrow. They will probably start with a squad consisting of substitutes. However, we can say that they are the favorites for tomorrow's match and for the next matches in the tournament. Players like Bonucci and Krunic will strengthen the squad rotation.

It is not acceptable for them to lose to a team from the lower league, anyway, they are not a favorite team anyway. It will most likely be a cup that one of the big four will win. I don't actually keep Beşiktaş in this group. I assume that Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe will be a cup that one of the two teams will win.",

I never expected that the team that is at the top of the second division could not score against inconsistent Basiktas, who are 18 points behind Fenerbahce the leading team in Turkish Super League. Fenerbahce will face Adanaspor tomorrow in their round 5 encounter,  a match I will give to the home side who are my favourite to lift the trophy.",

I confess I was surprised by Kasimpasa's defeat, they could have managed to win, but it's unbelievable that they couldn't at least score 1 goal, conceded 1 goal and couldn't score at least 1 goal. I don't know what is happening with kasimpasa, in the first league they had 2 consecutive defeats, and something that can be acceptable because we are talking about the first leaguebut when they play against a team that is not in the first league and they cannot score at least 1 goal and lose the game, then their situation is dire. The other teams like Besikitas took advantage of the situation they found themselves in very well, as they were playing against a weak opponent, Besikitas scored 4 goals and didn't concede any goals, it was definitely a victory that leaves Besikitas players more motivated, especially in attack. , because even playing against a weak opponent, it still takes skills to win and score 4 goals and not concede a single goal. Congratulations to the besikitas. Congratulations also go to the other teams that won the games",

He gave a penalty in favor of Ankaragücü in the minute. I think it has nothing to do with the penalty, but the referee gave it to him. While many people thought that VAR would come back, there was no VAR in this tour. I'm sure if the referee watched the position again, he would never give a penalty but (I guess he thought I would get beaten too 😂🤔)Tolga Ciğerci scored the penalty goal for Ankaragücü and made the score 2-1. Then, while Rizespor was attacking to find a draw, they made another penalty from the counter attack. (What penalty this time) Morutan scored this penalty and the match ended 3-1.If the penalty decision given against Rizespor had been against Fenerbahçe or Galatasaray (unlikely), it would have been talked about a lot. Rizespor was eliminated and who cares?",

Actually Fenerbahçe has very deep squad to rotate especially against weak teams like Adanaspor. I am expecting Fenerbahçe win as all others expect but I don't think score difference will be that much. 2-0 clean win may actually be good bet here. Or just 3-1. If Fenerbahçe has bad experience in match pretty sure they will let bigger names on pitch to secure themselves.",
