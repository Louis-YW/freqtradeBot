  "content": "Hi, Yesterday I tried to invest using a limit order through pancakeswap here: https://pancakeswap.finance/limit-ordersIt was for EPX and the limit was for 0.001996 and I was going to invest $1000. While the transaction went into open state, the EPX token fell from 0.002100 to 0.001900 and down to 0.001800. The order did not actually go through even though the token price fell down to 0.001800. Do you know why the limit order did not go through? I had to cancel the order.Â  Did it have to specifically buy at 0.001996 or it wouldn't go through? That's the only thing I can think of. On any central exchange when the token price falls the order would be filled you know how that works right? So I don't understand why the limit order on pancakeswap stayed open and did not get filled. Plus there is no support and I don't know where to ask other than here or quora.",
