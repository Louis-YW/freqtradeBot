Then didn't get a red trust?Red trust or the trust system is supposed to be used for evaluating trading risk. You must understand the difference between the feedback and trust list. If you had done a little research, maybe you have learned the difference. For better understanding- LoyceV's Beginners guide to correct use of the Trust system1. Give feedback to someone- To express the risk of dealing with an account. Positive means less risky, negative means very much risky while neutral is self-explanatory.2. Include someone on your trust list if you trust their judgment (feedback).3. Exclude someone from your trust list if you distrust their judgment.In this case, if someone red tags Timelord, it will be abuse. Instead, DT should exclude him from their trust list if they also think what you have accused is true.",

Should I mention that this is my personal opinion, and it does not have to be the opinion of all other DT members?First, Timelord2067 already has some negative marks, so your theory about untouchability falls away.You have already received an explanation of when and why a red trust is left, and it is obvious that Timelord did not harm or hint that he could be part of the fraud. As far as I know, he generously participated in some donations, so from that aspect I believe that green feedback is more suitable.For his erroneous interpretation in the case you mentioned, he was obviously adequately \"punished\" excluding by many members and DT selection.If we moved the criterion of negative tagging as you suggest, then some of the DT members could also interpret your appeal as a potential for a negative tag, because you are asking for an excessive and inadequate punishment for someone.QuoteWhile other DT fast to put red trust committed by other who do small mistakes.Obviously, such cases were better investigated and clearer evidence was presented. You are free to state if you think that someone is lightly red-tagged.",

If anything the opposite is true. Statistically he's historically one of the most excluded DT1 selected members on here last I calculated (see total exclusions data).So to say that other DT members don't take action simply isn't true, last I checked he's still excluded from DT for the very reason of leaving inaccurate trust feedback, so I wouldn't really worry about it. He has more than enough neutral feedback left surrounding his feedback and/or behaviour. He doesn't deserve negative feedback either imo as trust feedback abuse isn't exactly worthy of being tagged as a scammer.Overall, I'd say he's one of those users to simply ignore and move on. If he really bothers you then add to your distrust list.The only thing that really surprises me is how many DT members still trust his feedback really  Cue: being labeled as a troll by Timelord",

No collateral, no loan.Except you don't actually mean that or you wouldn't be lending to HedgeFX (sly wink) now would you?HedgeFX isn't a brand new account that joined the forum a week ago. Try and grab onto thicker branches if you can find those or drown like you did before.Yes I realize its just a neutral and its meaningless anyway, but I'm trying to understand how the post is \"racist.\" The metaphor made by alterra57 hasn't the slightest thing to do with race.Pretty sure he's just mad that I said this:Quote from: nutildah on July 04, 2023, 04:13:35 PMYour fixation on this member is, once again, borderline psychotic.to which he responded:Quote from: Timelord2067 on July 05, 2023, 01:40:43 AMAnd yet you continue to Troll me in my threads...  I'll answer it here since it'd be highly off-topic to do so in the original thread: I'm not trolling you, I'm either pointing out flaws in your alt detection methodology or standing up for accounts you are picking on with your weird, unfounded accusations. Additionally, asking for transaction IDs involving loans that have nothing to do with you is just poor taste, as is meddling in the affairs of lenders in general.",
