I've been seeing local news headlines of how the businesses in the retail industry, banking industry, energy, and others are registering higher net profits every quarter and every year. It makes me wonder; there's the pandemic, there's the invasion in Ukraine, there's the rising national debt, there's the rising unemployment rate, rising of the prices of goods and services, rising inflation rate, and so on and so forth and yet the business sector are making more and more money. The ordinary people are tightening their belts, now more than ever, because everything comes with a higher price now. And yet businesses are unaffected, declaring double digit growth in profit. Why? Because all else are passed on to the consumers. Business people don't compromise their profit.",

I don't think they wnt go about paying whatever taxes that is imposed on them but the issue here is, it would lead to an increase in price for the various oil products they offer and in the end, the citizens would still be the once to suffer.It doesn't make any much difference. I think nations that have got oil should look towards a more local production of these resources, get there refineries working and the livelihood of its citizens would be improved.",

      "body": "The big problem is that the oil corporations might simply increase the prices even more, which defeats the purpose of such \"special taxes\".There are only two ways to lower the fuel prices- increase the supply and decrease the demand.The first way depends on the OPEC countries in the Persian gulf(and maybe Russia). They have no incentive to increase the oil production and lower the prices.The second way depends on the global economy. If a massive global recession is coming, the global demand for oil and gas will decrease, which will eventually lead to lowering the oil and gas prices.Imposing \"special taxes\" won't solve the problem, but the politicians around the world like this \"tax the rich\" approach, when the crisis strikes.",

The good news is that the number of dead has decreased significantly compared to the same period last year. Empty roads would certainly affect the price of fuel, but on the other hand, all those people at their homes would use more gas or electricity than they normally do.",

After the covid pandemic, I have a strong distrust for all of the UN officials because most of them still keep their seats at the UN but doing a shitshow of it. How about we fire them, reduce the UN contribution then use that money to subsidize fuel/oil prices till Russia and Ukraine war sort out? At best, maybe 6 months from now on till Russia is out of their tanks, supplies, and conscripts. What do you guys think? I think it sounds better than increasing tax on the oil firms.",

It will help governments earn some extra money out of this crisis. But a government needs to understand that these oil companies are mass employers. They must not start firing people to make provisions for this extra tax. Then the result will be negative on economy which is already struggling with high inflation. Also third world countries can misappropriate such taxes which may not reach to the target mass and can go into the political funding.",

      "body": "It's a blatant lie that the increased energy prices are caused by corporate greed. The energy companies operate on specific margins that are independent of what the raw materials for the goods they produce are sold at. No matter what the cost of the raw materials, the profit margin on relative terms will stay the same. It seems as if the UN doesn't understand supply and demand, nor recognize the tight energy constrains that were artificially placed on countries who decided it was prudent to ditch oil/gas for greener and less efficient forms of energy. They got what they asked for. I suppose it's easier to demonize the big oil/gas corporations instead of pointing out that the revitalization of energy in Europe away from fossil fuels, and the dependence on foreign sources, got them in the mess they're in.",

This is what they say the rich only get richer while the poor can become poorer but in order to stop that from happening, those countries who haven't imposed a tax yet in oil should do it so that the money that people spend in oil can also be returned to them later on. I think this won't make the circulation of money lesser but the money can circulate more if let say the government can redistribute the tax in the form of cash assistance.

That's the million dollar question, and I'm afraid there may not be any correct answer to that because I believe any route we take will get corrupted eventually and people will find a way to exploit it. Of course it is easier to exploit some systems than others. Maybe the solution should be sought in a better and independent lawmakers and regulatory body that is not easily corrupted to redefine the laws that favor those with \"power\".The problem isn't only in economics, take democracy for example. It is good on paper but in practice it is the worst thing that has happened to humanity, since we place the fate of a nation in the hands of millions of uneducated people who vote with their emotions for the candidate that has fooled them better than the rest (ie. exploited the system).",
