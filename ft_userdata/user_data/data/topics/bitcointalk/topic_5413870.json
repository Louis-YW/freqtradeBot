  "content": "Disclaimer: Eco-friendliness does not imply low power consumption. Cloud computing data centers use huge power sources to power their operations to which if pressure from green activists was diverted to shutting down would also take down most of the top 1000 websites with them. So any posts spreading rumors about \"the upcoming winter killing miners and cryptocurrencies\" will be summarily deleted by myself, thanks.See the supplementary article on my blog about what miners can do to combat climate change here: Bitcoin Being Energy Efficient?Two very significant events happened recently which prompted me to start this topic:- Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake was completed yesterday- Congress wants to make a law to ban Proof-of-work mining algorithms (as with most partisan efforts in the US of A, this is largely a farce and abortive effort, more at danger to be forgotten by both parties should a more political conflict emerge - that it all I will talk about them in this post)Some of the more non-technical people or perhaps policy makers reading this board are probably shaking their heads, with all the aversion to Proof of Stake shown here:\"Will Bitcoin ever become environmentally friendly?\"Yes, Bitcoin can become environmentally friendly in a way that doesn't require a change to its Proof of Work model. It should be known that Bitcoin mining is fully capable of harnessing the power of all kinds of renewable energy, and in fact, many mining farms are already using them. The environmental cleanliness question is largely the miners' problem and there's nothing the devs can do about it - since any such solution would require taking power away from miners and giving that power to other, significantly less centralized entities (it is nobody's desire except perhaps for the trolls at r/Buttcoin to see Bitcoin suffer a 51% attack).\"Will miners keep contributing to make increasing larger pollution?\"Regarding the waste products of electricity generation from various renewable and non-renewable sources. Miners can help lower the carbon footprint by using renewable energy as I mentioned above, and also by using the waste products of other fuel processes, such as methane, as a source for electricity.Like I said, it depends on the miners to design innovative electricity generation methods that use different types of green fuel sources, particularly those which utilize the waste products of fossil fuel generation. This is a non-technical problem domain however, and developers can not enforce any rules for this on the network.\"Is bitcoin going to do anything about the Congressional proposal to ban Proof-of-Work algorithms?\"No. Once again, this is not a developer problem. Also, the merge took a few years from start to finish to be fully carried out. Trying to rush the process in a timespan of a few months will split the network into many pieces.\"Why not just run it on a handful of computers?\"Because doing that will make it vulnerable to a 51% attack (one person or group with more than half of the total hash power can mine whatever transactions they want, censor, or defraud people). It's important to note that new cryptocurrencies cannot start out with the Proof of Stake model because it is easy for anyone to get a majority supply of coins during that phase. What usually happens after this is the coins become worthless because the entire supply of coins constantly get transferred between thieves.Self-moderated against spam. Do not post irrelevant, trolling remarks in this topic (see the top of this post for specific details). Discussion is of course welcome.",

Yes.The above question shows bitcoin going green would not bring a lasting solution to the social criticism it gets. Going 100% green is a huge task for any industry and not usually set as a standard, but there is an exception here as bitcoin is not a conventional industry like many others, and with those, the government would take a sort of passive approach towards their environmental effects.Bitcoin can and is going green, but I doubt it can ever go as green those who envy and wish to exert some sort of control on the network.Quote from: NotATether on September 17, 2022, 11:24:36 AM\"Is bitcoin going to do anything about the Congressional proposal to ban Proof-of-Work algorithms?\"Devs cannot do anything, but the community can.Announcing the efforts of miners to keeping the environment safe and reducing carbon emissions, would show mining activities is not as bad as it is reported to be.

      "body": "Some people do not care about the great amount of electricity all other industries are using to power their continuing functionality and profit making. Even if bitcoin is not existing, and there is still continuous deforestation (in which plants that take in carbon dioxide are reducing in population across the world) and release of green house gases into the atmosphere by vehicles and industries, there would be global warming and more thawing of permafrost.I am always surprised that some people are just bitcoin critics but do not know the truth about what is actually happening. Is electricity even only the cause of global warming? No. It even also depends on how the electricity is generated. There are clean/green energy generation from wind, solar, nuclear and well constructed hydroelectric power plants.This is still this year Coinshare research about bitcoin mining and to what extent it is deteriorating the environment in relation to release of green house gases when compared to other human activities:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5383881.msg59129918#msg59129918The bitcoin mining network CoinShares researchThis was the conclussion:QuoteConclusionIn the grand scheme of things, the carbon emissions emitted by electricity providers supplying the Bitcoin mining network are inconsequential.

Likely it reduced after the ban, but reduced to 50%, 60% or less as Kazakhsta and miners from countries that started to mine or increase the mining hashrate likely generate more from fossil fuel.

That bitcoiners are irresponsible and are wasting energy mining something that doesn't do anything and doesn't help the world in any way. What is eco terrorism? The idea that we should ban everything that produces greenhouse gases. We should somehow make people buy those inefficient and expensive electric cars, just because they don't burn fuel. We should make countries shut down their coal burning industry and build inefficient and expensive wind generators, and so on. I think that \"eco\" industry is a big scam and countries that participated in it for many years like Germany are already experiencing the effects of their actions. A few months ago the EU was trying to enforce a ban on gasoline and diesel engines, but  Germany opposed this. We're talking about a country that used to vote for sanctions against EU members with high CO2 emissions. https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/germany-rejects-eu-plan-ban-new-fossil-fuel-cars-2035-2022-06-21/",

      "body": "Bitcoin mining is uniquely placed to facilitate and enhance the move towards 100% renewable energy.With standard electricity production, such as via burning coal or natural gas, supply can be adjusted to meet demand. More demand on the network? Burn more stuff. Less demand on the network? Burn less stuff. Straightforward.With renewable electricity production, this is not possible. How do you create more wind for turbines or decrease the amount of sunlight hitting your solar panels? You can't. So you need to do something known as demand response. Demand response means changing the amount of consumption, rather than the amount of production. So whenever the power companies have a low amount of production with a high amount of demand, they can pay customers to reduce their electricity consumption. Bitcoin miners are well placed in such a scenario to be able to immediately reduce their electricity consumption without any lasting effects on future operations, and so provide a good demand response buffer for the network. This is already happening in places like Texas.And then look at the flip side as well. When demand is low, with traditional electricity production then the power company scales down their operations. Again, they can't do that with renewables. So instead they generate a bunch of electricity which goes to waste, they have to dump, and they don't get paid for. Instead, bitcoin mining comes along and can immediately ramp up its consumption to utilize this otherwise completely wasted energy. The miners are happy since they get cheap green energy, and the green energy company is happy since they make money on electricity which would otherwise be completely wasted and earn them not a single cent.And so not only does bitcoin mining facilitate a robust renewable energy network, but it even incentivizes production of new renewable generation. I'm not going to build a big solar panel system if I know that the local grid will only utilize ~50% of the energy I produce and the other ~50% is going to be completely wasted and earn me nothing. It won't be profitable. But if I know that at times of low demand there are bitcoin miners who will scoop up every last kWh I produce and I'll get paid for 100% of the energy I produce, then that becomes a much more attractive investment. Bitcoin mining is fairly unique in that it can be located anywhere there is electricity being produced - right next to a solar farm in the middle of nowhere is just fine - whereas most other industries need a lot of surrounding infrastructure (transport, water, waste/sewage, etc).",

Why aren't more politicians being told this?Somebody needs to tell the Blockchain Association to make this their main talking point, and then have miners talk to utilities to actually make this happen.I accidentally deleted the above post, so there's probably a deleted post counter now; but I'm dead serious about the no trolling rule.

Nuclear plants don't shut off at night when demand is down and so on. Geo-thermal and so on. Although most power grids are interconnected not all are and places do exist that can tun on green. Add in some of the new large battery storage options and it 100% can be done. It will cost more to start BUT, if everyone is operating under the same costs then it's still a level competition.But, I also think it would help if miner manufacturers started producing smaller lower power miners that can be run on home solar and the like without rewiring your enter house.Smaller, quieter, less power draw. Same efficiency more or less but not screaming fans making anything but the best wiring glow. My condo is 100% solar / green electric power.

Miners are looking for the cheapest electricity possible, if in some location it is generated by fossil fuels, it's not their problem. There were reports that in some places mining resulted in re-opening of a previously closed coal power plant. In recent times my attention has also been drawn to hydropower dams as a source of green energy because unlike solar and wind energies they can operate for 24 hours without any form of restrictions. There are some groups and individuals advocating for the conversion of some nonpowered to hydropower so that Bitcoin miners could have enough access to power. In the case of the United States out of 90,000 dams, only about 2,200 generate hydroelectric power. Most of these hydropower dams are old and producing below capacity, hence Bitcoin miners can take advantage of these opportunities and finance some of the projects of transformation and rehabilitating some of these dams to produce the needed electric supply. The project might be expensive now, but the cost of electricity might be cheap in the future.",

In this scenario, the supplier would be able to broadcast to the meter of opted in customers within the necessary geographic area that they would be paid at premium rates for any electricity they sell back, allowing each individual's system to work out whether it was more profitable to keep mining bitcoin or to shut down their miner(s) and sell the electricity back instead, and then vice versa when the rates drop again. Could all be set up to happen automatically, providing a great reserve of green electricity the grid can draw on during periods of peak demand.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on September 18, 2022, 07:16:19 AMPeople say that Bitcoin mining incentivizes green energy, but isn't it incentivizing all energy?It can obviously use all energy, and it will pay for whatever energy happens to be the cheapest. But as I outlined above, it can incentivize green energy in a way that few other industries can, by virtue of bitcoin mining requiring very little additional infrastructure, being entirely mobile, and being able to ramp up and down instantly without any long term negative effects (you can't just power down a whole factory, for example, without incurring significant costs in starting it all back up again in the future).",

I always shouted this over the forum that there are more petrol and Disele engines, more refrigerators, more cold storage for perishables items in the world than the mining equipment’s which is being pain for government or environmental activists! No bitcoin will never contribute to pollution to that much level as what industries and data centers contribute and contributing since hundreds years now. They literally want it to be banned for the reasons of its pseudo anonymous nature and nothing else. They want bunch of reasons thrown away in the assembly so that they can say no to bitcoin and run their own bank in the traditional ways as they did always. That’s the summary of it. All the Eco friendly talks, CO2 emission and what not is just layer to hide stuff.",
