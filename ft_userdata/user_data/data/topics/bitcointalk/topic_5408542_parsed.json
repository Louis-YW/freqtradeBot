The Bitcoin miners, not you (the wallet creator), are the ones who cash in on the transaction fees.Here is my opinion: Join a micro cap project that has some game changing technology and contribute to its success. This is the best way for developers to get rewarded (paid) in this market. Either you receive free coins or you invest very early in the project.Â  Then, you put effort into making the project successful. For the first time in years, I now do investing instead of coding. However, I am promoting my investments and looking for ways to put them on the right course as an investor using this strategy. In my situation, I assist with making business connections. Before investing your time, you simply need to conduct your own due diligence. Before investing in any coin, I conduct my own due diligence.",

In my opinion, the only way to make money with a wallet is to sell it, and I don't know who is going to agree to pay for a wallet (not open source) as we all have ElectrumWhy would we pay for a risky option when we have a trustable free one ?Wish you a nice day guys, and a happy new year 2023",
