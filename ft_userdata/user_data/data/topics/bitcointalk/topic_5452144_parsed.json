Is it an alert set on your exchange accounts or an alert set on your personal private wallet, or is it some of the market trackers like Coingecko or CoinMarketCap? You need to be specific so that one can know where you are coming from and how to be off-hand.",

If it's the former, then it's very likely there is a battery or power saving setting that shuts down your apps from running in the background, and therefore you won't be able to get notifications in real time.",

The moment you have gotten any alert notification and it don't show up for easy access, why don't you login to the app to confirm for yourself. If it is a wallet that you are talking about,then this depends on the type of wallet that you are using. I have a trust wallet that notifies me in any price change in bitcoin especially. What I do is that I will login and check other coins too if there was also a change in the price. Sometimes, the problem might be from your phone.",

For example, suppose you wish to get many notifications and always be up to date, even with minor changes. In that case, you can set the sensitivity to high so CoinStats can constantly notify you about the changes.I haven't seen any alerts history or some sort either.Side note: Lmk if I did not get the app right lol",

I fully understand your point above, the problem you are facing indicates that CoinStats cannot be fully relied upon to track real-time prices due to several constraints that occur as you experience.Many issues are triggered due to late warnings, technical issues are inevitable with events like this. When the warning for a coin that you expected never appears, you should look directly at sites that serve real-time price movements such as coingecko.com.",
