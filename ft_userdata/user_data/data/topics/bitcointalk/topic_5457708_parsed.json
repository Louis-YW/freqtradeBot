There are many wallets nowadays that you can use to cash-out your money. And for me, why do you need to transfer all millions of dollars in a single event if you can divide your money into different assets such as pouring them in different exchanges or foreign stocks, buy different cryptos and save in different wallets. Just make sure you'll not forget the seed phrase.",

They then use the exchange's P2P service to convert to fiat little by little, they never place an order too large to make the banks suspicious. I think it is not too difficult to do, converting crypto to fiat is very simple, even if it is millions of dollars. I've never been worried about that, what I'm worried about is how to have a lot of bitcoin to do it   .",

If he is someone who has a lot of money, he will have no problem bringing it to the surface. The problem would be for you if you suddenly recovered a few dozen bitcoins that you had on an old laptop from when they were worth pennies. We have discussed this many times in the Legal section of the forum and the conclusion is that the best thing to do would be to hire a professional specialized in these matters to advise you, as what you can do will depend on the legislation where you live.",

But if this just an ordinary person, I wouldn't worry about him/her because he's bright enough to buy bitcoin as the earliest stage and selling it would be easy. The regulations will depend on where he is found and I am sure that he won't just sell all of it on an instant with just one exchange. Scattering it and spreading it across various exchanges could be his option and one thing is for sure that he can't skip the KYC part because if he wants to sell and have no problem then that's what he has to go through. Not unless, he knows a huge place where he can OTC or through P2P without having any issues.",

However, if it is a common man or a woman, they would convert their Bitcoin into local fiat in smaller amounts to avoid arousing suspicion. Then as pooya87 said it also depends on the country where the whale resides. Some countries do not have hash laws against converting Bitcoin to local fiat.",

Have you asked yourself why trillions of dollars are being kept in offshore companies located at \"tax heaven\" islands? The rich people are using such companies because they are very convenient.Selling big amounts of BTC in centralized exchanges seems very risky to me. I guess that the crypto whales are negotiating big deals with the crypto exchange owners and they sell them their BTC outside of the crypto exchange platforms.Obviously we are not crypto whale accountants and we don't know how the crypto whales are moving their wealth, so I'm just guessing.",

Within a few minutes, the police and other law agencies will start monitoring and tracing your account and even your location. Using exchanges will also be risky because the money will still have to be transferred to your account which also raises a red flag. P2p transactions will be good if the other party is trusted and willing to pay in cash. Exchanging the coin gradually is another option but the funds in the bank account will still increase to attract suspicion. The best option will be to get professional advice from an experienced and trustworthy financial or investment expert. They are skillful in handling such issues if you can pay for the services. I highlighted trustworthiness to avoid engaging a dubious company that can cause more harm. I am sure that when I get to that bridge, I will crossover.",

If you can be doing it like that the banks wont be able to do anything with your account, but immediately you withdraw everything at once, then you will have to visit the bank and explain your source of income, and in my country the central bank have given all other commercial banks the permission to ban all accounts that are connected to crypt currency activities.",

So the best option to send it to a trusted centralized exchange and convert it to stable coins. If you need fiat then just trade with P2P option.And I don't think an Ordinary citizen need all of his million dollars at a single time. He can secure his funds by buying stable coins and storing in a non custodial wallet. Then he can follow this P2P procedure again and again to convert it to fiat.",
