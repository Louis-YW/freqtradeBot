You know the truth, according to what I see in the community here in the Bitcoin industry, many expect that when Bitcoin's halving starts, the bull run will come in little by little. And the expectation in this matter is that Bitcoin's ATH is between 100k$-120k$ it can possibly reach.But this still remains speculation until it happens next year. It's just this year that it's hard to predict where it will reach, it could be between 40k$-50k$ each. But let's see what can happen.",

I think at this point though it will be due to more of the same. Institutions will be taking more and more BTC out of circulation. The halving will make miners hold until they are profitable and with growing hashrate and declining rewards, either the entire mining industry goes bankrupt and investors lose billions, or the price goes up and everyone makes money. It’s a feedback loop.",

Because even if bitcoin hits $300k, if we don't have too much bitcoin we won't get any benefit. And the higher the bitcoin, the harder it is for us to accumulate. The only thing I always think about is bitcoin will hit ATH in 2025 or 2026, and I have just over a year left to accumulate as many bitcoins as I can, so I would even prefer the price of bitcoin falling to rising this year.",

The point is that what I do is buying, buying, buying, and buying when everyone including you is positive about the Bitcoin price in the following year, at that time I have already accumulated. Since the first year of knowing the purpose of Bitcoin, everyone has understood how this concept will be the target of many people in the future. Why am I sure? if you study the origin of fiat created, or more deeply study the origin of the medium of exchange and then correlate it with the current level of technological progress then the answer will meet at the point of full ownership which cannot be controlled by any party as the winner.",

This year, I will be happy when Bitcoin reaches $35k by the end of 2023. For the next year is where retail investors will start to make the demand higher when they see this sudden movement of Bitcoin so $40k - $45k and then the halving will come which hypes up the market and FOMOs will definitely come, $50k - $55k at that moment but it might still go down due to correction before the end of the year so $50k will be the minimum, I think. 2025 is when another reaction will come due to the hype, $60k or above ATH is where I see Bitcoin will be. $100k for me is a long shot, we saw $69k because of the shock, I don't think that can happen again that fast without a billionaire on our side.",

Next year is the halving and even if the bull run starts, the peak is likely to be in 2025, which I expect to be above $100K but not reaching $200K. All in all, along the way I expect major resistance. At $50K, to approach the previous ATH of $69K, and above all at $100K a huge resistance that will be hard to beat several times.",

Predicting prices on specific year doesn't give much credibility on predictions in comparison when you made a prediction opin the future without any definite timeline. I think the future valuation that you expect to happened without specific timeline is more appropriate to predict instead of assigning price each year.",
