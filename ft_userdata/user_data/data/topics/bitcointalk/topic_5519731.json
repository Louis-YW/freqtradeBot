The US for the next 5 years makes sense because President Trump is now Pro Bitcoin but after that will they apply the same rules regarding state asset reserves?",

If they manage to pull both that off, they will have such a huge leverage against other countries. Why need to sacrifice gold for bitcoin? For us, average citizens, we probably prefer bitcoin but a country needs to get their hands on every profitable asset as much as possible. If they use gold to buy bitcoin, they probably will not sell all to buy bitcoin.",

They can say it now, but 2-3 years from now if things go south, they can just say things that are against the commitment that they said out of nowhere. What I believe is that they saw how Germany profited from the Bitcoins they got that's why they believe that if they can, so do they as well. What I doubt is that the amount of time they will be holding it. 20 years? I mean there's nothing wrong with that, but I doubt that they will be doing it. Also, this will give them power to manipulate the price of Bitcoin on their own will knowing that we only have a finite supply of Bitcoin unlike Gold where you can just mine for a very long time, Bitcoin isn't like that. They might trust it, and they might see it as a store of value, but that 1 million Bitcoin being out of the market is something huge if you will ask me. Well, talking about superpower country like US. Overall, I think it would be better to just buy Bitcoin and don't sell their gold reserves. It's something like diversifying their portfolio.",

The fact is it obvious sounds as much an expensive move as seen.Gold and bitcoin are two highly demanded assets. Volatility is usually important especially for situations when there is a spike in demand especially if the supply is constant or regulated. In the case of bitcoin, it's grow this mainly as a result of volatility and adoption as both a crypto currency and as an investment. Unlike bitcoin a great percentage of all gold in the world is being regulated by powerful bodies making it very possible for them to manipulate prices if need be.",

Even crypto optimists like Michael Novogratz are skeptical of the US taking up the move anytime soon. https://www.cryptopolitan.com/senator-lummis-proposes-swapping-federal-reserves-gold-for-bitcoin-reserves/Political and logistical barriers make the above-mentioned plan highly improbable. An ultimate sale of gold in such a large amount is definitely risky, while the purchase of Bitcoin would highly increase its price, hence costs. At any rate, Trump's approach is far more cautious, considering holding onto the seized Bitcoins, not making major new buys. The plan could lead to making the US's reserves even more diversified and reinforcing US crypto leadership, but when and how that could happen are very much in question.",
