  "content": "HydroCIS is Nigeria and West Africa’s First Energy Information Platform. So they are more reliable to give information about converting from petrol generator to gas generator. We have a thread about a warning last week, but which we are not satisfied with because it gives just simple information that there should not be a leakage but which we all that are using gas (in the Kitchen) all know about. Nigerians have even prefer to use gas to cook in the kitchen.If you have a LinkedIn account, you can see the information HydroCIS shared which are about petrol to gas generator conversion. You can check this site to see the information also: https://nairametrics.com/2023/08/07/hydrocis-shares-what-nigerians-should-know-about-lpg-powered-generators/Quote from: https://nairametrics.com/2023/08/07/hydrocis-shares-what-nigerians-should-know-about-lpg-powered-generators/Key elements for conversion to LPGAccording to HydroCIS, the key elements for generator conversions are: High-quality cylinder regulator, which must have an excess flow shut-off valve.High-quality safety relief which must be recertified every 5 years and replaced every 15 years. Note that all cylinder valves must have a safety relief. High-quality cable ties that are used to secure gas hoses safely.High-quality and high-pressure hose with no folds/cuts and must be replaced every 24 months. Note that water hoses are not suitable replacements for this.  High-quality dual fuel carburettor that is properly sized for generator capacity and has an easily accessible fuel selector switch/knob. Jubilee clips that are the correct size for the diameter of the pressure hose should be replaced as required. Note that the user should discard it if it is bent or broken. HydroCIS also stated that when in use, the generator should be positioned firmly on the ground and ensure that vibration during operation does not result in a change in the position of the generator.  HydroCIS also talked about the benefits like cost effectiveness and easy maintenance and the steps to take after deciding to convert to LPG.Read more nairametrics or the infographics on LinkedIn.

How many Nigeria gas cylinder  users will follow this key elements for generator conversions according the the HydroCIS because, people are use to fuel to on their generator and they can position the generator anyhow and enjoy their activities by using fuel to on the generator. I enjoyed using gas to cook my food in the kitchen without fear because am used to it right from secondary school days and it has not damage anything from my house.",

Here we can see the professional recommendations and validation that LPG is a good alternative unlike the other article I assume was just put up to discourage people from seeking for alternative.",

      "body": "This is a very good update, and I'm sure if people could keep up to the safety rules required for the use of Liquified Petroleum Gas for generator, they will be able to save more and spend less in this period of subsidy removal. Because both the use of \"fuel\" and \"liquified gas\" are dangerous and have it's safety guidelines which only if you can keep up to it, you will always be on the safer side.  Because just as it's not advisable to smoke or bring fire close to a fuel generator or keep it in a confirmed space, if you too can distance your gas cylinder of about 3 to 5 meter away from the generator and not keep it in a confirmed space. You don't have any reason to worry about.",

I enjoyed using gas to cook my food in the kitchen without fear because am used to it right from secondary school days and it has not damage anything from my house.Fuel generators have cons too. I usually read the most common in the news in which someone, or some members of a family, or the whole family will die because of generator fume. These are examples:20 days ago      https://punchng.com/seven-die-four-day-old-baby-survives-generator-fume-in-anambra 5 months ago   https://punchng.com/ondo-couple-found-unconscious-in-room-baby-dies5 months ago   https://punchng.com/ondo-man-found-unconscious-in-room-wife-baby-dieThese are common news in Nigeria. I have been reading news very well since 2017 and generator fume killing people is a common news.Quote from: https://www.generatorsource.com/Natural_Gas_vs_Diesel_Generators.aspxAdvantages of using gas generators• The three most obvious pros of using natural gas as a fuel to power your generators is that it is cleaner, less expensive than other non-renewable fuels, and is considerably efficient.• In comparison to oil and coal, the emissions of sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) are considerably lower. Hence, natural gas is one of the cleanest fossil fuels when it burns.• Another advantage of natural gas generators is that natural gas does not produce a pungent odor, which is fairly common in generators powered by oil or diesel.• Natural gas generators are also effective in reducing costs when used to power homes. This is because electricity from the main utility source is a far more expensive alternative.• Apart from being cleaner and cheaper, natural gas is also readily available in large cities since it is delivered directly through pipelines. Hence, when using natural gas powered generators, storage of fuel becomes redundant.Maybe this kind of killing would have reduced or eliminated if natural gas is used as fuel. It is worth to note that from the article, carbon monoxide (CO) is not talked about. I do not know if I am correct because I am not an expert in this and I do not see articls about gas generator carbon monoxide poisoningIf you follow the precautions above, I do not think it would be bad to use gas generator.",
