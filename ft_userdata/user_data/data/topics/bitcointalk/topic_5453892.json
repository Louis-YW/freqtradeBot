The Chinese speaking communities are buzzing. Historically, coverages like these led to bull runs.Not saying past predicts the future. And not financial advice.”Link to Changpeng Zhao’s tweetThose that have experienced the bull run before, does events like this leads to bull run or signifies that bull run will happen anytime soon?And those that haven’t bought bitcoin, does this signify that they need to necessitate buying some now before it’ll be too late?",

      "body": "The news about China recently is because of the reduce restrictions on cryptocurrency and this will certainly have an impact on cryptocurrency because The Chinese apart from been the most populous country in the world there number in the crypto space is also high, so with less restrictions more people will come into the space and this will certainly have a positive impact on cryptocurrency but will this trigger a bull run i doubt probably there will be weeks of bitcoin highs before everything settles down a bit. The bitcoin halving is usually the most import even that triggers long period of bull run and this run is certainly almost a year after the halving itself (my suggestion is based on the past bitcoin trends). So personally I am placing the bull run on this to affect it. Aside that I would say the rest will be just bull trap. Those that are yet to buy shouldn’t wait till this a news broke out about bull run because nobody is certain of it, it is just speculations and they are sometimes miss leading. The best thing is to buy when you have the funds to do so and apply the DCA method to minimize the risk.",

China has a great population, and they can also have a little to great impact on crypto prices, just as a crypto ban news from them can cause a price decline for a few hours and days.Since they have reduced their crypto ban, I believe something good can come out of it, but we should not be expecting any pump or bull run in this instance. Anyone who still has money to buy and bag more Bitcoin should be doing it as usual, and don't take this news as a kind of hack to use and borrow money to invest in Bitcoin with the hope that after the pump you can sell and pay back. This will be the greatest mistake anyone can make.",

They all have a good chance of getting bitcoin at low prices, but I hope they're not too fomo. Should also consider DCA for unexpected market reactions, but buying 80% of the total budget is probably well worth considering.Oh yeah, I also don't want my opinion to be considered as financial advice, meaning they have to make their own analysis before making a decision.",

      "body": "I know that there are different factors that contribute to the bull market, and perhaps the Bitcoin halving has not yet happened, so I don't see any bull run anywhere near the Bitcoin market. The price may experience some spike, maybe before the end of the year, but I am beginning to believe that the price will just keep roaming around $30k and $25k+. If there will be a bull run, it is possible that it will happen after the halving has taken place next year. Following the price history of the last halving, I know that after the halving, the price did not go down further; it just kept going, gradually. I am not going to be judging based on the last price, but I believe the bull market is not yet here; probably the bull run has already happened (just as OgNasty stated), lifting the price from $16k to $30k and back to $26k. I am not a price expert, but based on the experience I have gathered so far and also on what I perceive about the market, I know that Bitcoin price spikes or bull runs often neglect some human ideas and all speculation; it's a dynamic market where something positive can just lift the price in a short period of time.",

      "body": "The bull run that Zhao refers to is the 2017 bull run, which was triggered by a story on CCTV. The coverage led to a surge in demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as an increase in trading volume across exchanges. This is what I gathered from the media sources available. However, there are many factors that can influence the market, and it is difficult to predict with certainty whether this event will lead to a bull run or when a bull run may occur. In my opinion , this event will not have as much of an impact on the market as the 2017 bull run. The reason I think this is because there are many more people who own cryptocurrencies and know what they are than in 2017, so any news that comes out about bitcoin will likely be met with skepticism or indifference by some.",
