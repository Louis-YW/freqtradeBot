Unlike BIP39 seed phrases, you can't generate different types of addresses using an electrum's seed phrase. In other words, you can't generate a legacy wallet using a seed phrase that has been generated by electrum for a segwit wallet and vise versa. Since the version 4.1.0, electrum generates a segwit wallet by default and don't ask you the wallet type. If you want to generate a legacy wallet on electrum, you can go to console and use the following command. Code:make_seed(128,\"\",\"standard\")",

If it is Electrum seed phrase, there won't be anything like that because the seed phrase for address types on Electrum are different as a result of version number.Read about it here:Electrum Seed Version System",
