They can scam you intentionally by working for Ponzi projects but they might even not know that project is scam and they eve lose their money too.Crypto Investing and the Curse of the Luna TattooMike Novogratz lost his money with Terra $LUNA too and if you followed his investment decision, did the same thing, you lost money too.",

Quote from: Onyeeze on May 06, 2023, 12:32:30 AMSome days a go some people who invested with site because of a skirt Maker who promoted the site and many people thought with the skirt Maker who is promoting the GMG website that the site will be legit. So I'm of the opinion that we should avoid ponzi scheme and also make sure we make a research properly before investing in a newly created website. The skirt maker was contacted or asked to help them promote their project not because of his knowledge of the project, but rather because of his influence, or the number of people that the project could reach through him. I wouldn't be surprised if the skirt maker in question never visited the website he promoted; as long as these influencers get paid, they couldn't care less about what happens to their viewers or those they claim to be fans. It's now being repeated everywhere DYOR, regardless of who is selling you a project, if you haven't done your own research, don't buy it. P.S. Please reduce the size of your images as they take too long to load and mess up the appearance of your thread.",

I don't know if some Nigerian scammer created a lookalike or fake website with the same name. From the little research I did, the real Graphene Manufacturing Group is headquartered in Australia. It's also a publicly listed company whose shares you can trade on the stock market. It's a bit difficult to understand OP with the way he is expressing himself.",

And trust no one even if the advertiser is going to be a very influential person or celebrity. The fate of these investments are not in their hands but still in the hands of the developers that has the intention to scam people. They're just good as advertisers but after getting paid, they can go away from any trouble from them. But just as the US, they've got serious law about these influencers and advertisers to become responsible to what they are advertising with.",

It will sure be what it used to be: ponzi and people looking to make quick cash, so definitely some people will fall victim, apart from those reading through this thread, those that the ponzi have not extended to their country, and people who remain unmoved in this aspect of making money. Obviously, there are going to be more of these ponzi schemes arising before the end of this year; people just have to be careful and do proper research before putting in their money on any platform.",

I believe so many Nigerians will be in tears now on hearing about the crashing of GMG but I hope they learn from this because this is not the first time they have cried out loud after losing funds from so many Ponzi scheme Investments.",

I've learnt my lesson, so no one will be able to persuade me now  to invest in any internet businesses that offer a some of percentage of my investment because I've already made that mistake before.I believe that by this point, people should have realized that there is no such thing as free money online and stop participating on all this online investment that always promise them huge return. If I imagine how, in the past, the money that people wasted on ponzi schemes may have been better used to invest in bitcoin.and I may say these kind of people may be aware of the possibility of investing in bitcoin but they will never do so because they are only interested in getting quick money.",

Have seen different skit maker marketing Ponzi scheme in my country, but from what I noticed, I think most of them are always among the owner of the sites or the Ponzi scheme, so it’s just like they are marketing their product. I think the best thing that should be done is that if any influencer or skit maker market any product and it’s turn out to be a scam, then they should be arrested and investigated, if they are found guilty then they should be punished.",

There have been more terrible Ponzi schemes that have been done in the past that many people fell victim for that should be enough to teach a lesson to not just the people who experienced it, but anyone who hears it. But as long as there is greed, there will always be people that will be victims of Ponzi schemes.",

Few days ago I saw close pals doing same shit I was persuaded to do same but all fell on deaf ears.Some group of people recently invested to get returns but last night all I hear was that they found it difficult to withdraw the daily returns they was suppose to get.So in conclusion, OP was trying to send a clear warning to the public to stay away from investment sites like it. At the headquarters shit might be going well but to make gains they must have built up a site to steal funds from folks I guess.",

Whatever the reason try to avoid the loopholes that promise huge returns from anything other than a ponzi scheme there is a process you have to go through every time you try to make a profit and even when you try to invest in bitcoins. There is no instant form of making a profit instead it takes a process to go through, there are many reasons not to trust this scheme and probably many of the cases we have seen so far about fraud being run like this.Be wise in choosing and pay attention to the level of risk posed by third parties, because if you want to play it safe you should try to invest on your own and the OP should reduce the size of the image because it is too big and doesn't look good or you can combine several sides to make it look neat.",
