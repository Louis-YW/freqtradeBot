  "content": "Today, Cloudflare was blocking scraping bots again. For 8 hours and 24 minutes, my scraper wasn't working. Anything between posts 61513760 and 61515614 (1853 posts) is missing, and amongst others my notification bot wasn't working. I already delayed my Merit and Trust data updates (which normally start on Friday and Saturday morning).This happened 18 days ago too.Public request to theymos: Is it possible to get an exception from Cloudflare for popular scraping bots? I'm thinking of BPIP.org, Ninjastic.space and loyce.club, but there are probably a few others that provide useful features for the Bitcointalk community. It would be really nice if DDOS-protection doesn't interfere with features.",

I am sorry if it sounds harsh but I don't think many people over the internet like the way the scrappers are scrapping every information that are published intentionally or unintentionally. Everyone have their rights to remove any information they want. But it's unknown how many bots out there and scrapping everything without our knowledge.May be I can trust Loyce.club, the same with Ninjastics or BPIP but if we give them advantage over others then we are creating double standard.  Especially when this forum is about an economy like Bitcoin, we really need to be careful about what information we post and who keep copies of our information.",

He will probably need to do extra work because of all this so he can feed his tool correctly with the missing data... so let's not be too harsh on him either. It's okay to ask; whether it will be granted or not... that's a different story and I trust theymos that he will see this topic and take the right decision.",

This would probably actually reduce the number of page views because a “scrapper” could gather posts in batches rather than in real time. Allowing scrappers has already made all forum posts and other data freely searchable, so unless this will change, I see no reason to it implement an api for people like loyce.

Whitelisting can go in both directions (can be disabled or even become blacklisting). When somebody (who got whitelisting for his scraper) is no longer trusted (and we know how easy is for that to happen) his whitelisting will no longer be granted.PS. Of course, API keys would be more professional, but I don't dare to even dream about that.",
