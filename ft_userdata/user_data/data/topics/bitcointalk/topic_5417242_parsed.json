  "content": "Last Saturday, I was listening to the radio when I came across a Christian ministry program that piqued my interest. I was enjoying the ministration of the man of God for about 15 minutes before the program was coming to an end, and then when the pastor began to pray and share some testimonies. I feared when he made mention of how he had prayed for a brother who traded Bitcoin and became financially free; how people's businesses were doing great; how individuals he prayed for were excelling in their business; and some were getting new jobs. I was jolted into shock when he said, \"I have prayed for people that trade Bitcoin, and they are making  profit.\" I don't really know what he meant by that. He was either referring to Forex trading or something else I don't know, but if it is a Bitcoin investment, I am certain enough to believe that prayer and prophecy don't work for Bitcoin.I know lots of people are so religious they believe what their pastor tells them. I'm not saying prophecy doesn't work for those that believe in it, but all I'm saying is to everyone reading this, Bitcoin price movement doesn't work by prophecy or prayer.Lastly, the man of God said, \"Come to church on Sunday and receive your blessings from God. Are you doing business, self-employed, working, or trading Bitcoin? Come and be blessed\"..I can't go to church and believe a prophecy that Bitcoin's price will increase by a certain amount, and this is not what any one should do.",

These people move according to the trend, and what we see here is one such incident. He have understood about people making use of bitcoin. This can be used during prayers to attract people who have succeeded out of it as well as who have been suffering out of cryptocurrency investment. Good is to follow God and pray directly than following these pastors.",

For me. this is normal as long as you don't do illegal things or not appropriate things.This becomes the normal nature of a man. So, if ever Bitcoin creates a new all-time-high and they are thankful for God because of it, so be it.",

And a prophecy about bitcoin price reaching a certain amount can easily become true, since it doesn't have a time constraint.So it ends up into either getting to the expected price, either to \"patience, my son\".However, advertising at the church bitcoin or any investments is risky: it can easily make (impatient and rather poor) people poorer instead of richer.

I wouldn't be surprise if in his church he says that \"God wants the members to donate $100 worth of bitcoin\". God has nothing to do with bitcoin. He doesn't care about it nor any other crypto currency and any pastor who instead should focus on preaching the truth of the scripture and is instead making false prophesy about the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency is serving mammon and not God.",

It is absurd for someone to believe that certain prophecies or prayers will come true without any effort. Not only bitcoin, but with any market, any business field will always have many fluctuations and if you want to profit from them, just take the time to learn about them, and how they work.

I agree with you,  maybe the Man of God was just sharing a testimonys of other bitcoiners that turned to millionaire to his members to be part of this potential movement that made some people feel is a prophecy. Praying for people to have the knowledge of Bitcoin in the church is not a bad thing, because the Man of God has seen what Bitcoin has done to some countries that made it legal. But, it's not advisable to trade your coins in this bearish market because of prophecy man of God gave in the church, because prophecy has nothing to do with Bitcoin price.",

No one is saying prayer is wrong, we pray for different things every day including Bitcoin trading, and hopefully, their faith can guide them to Investing and hodling till the right time maybe there are others in that same church that have gone through that before. However we know, if you don't have any idea of trading and Investing in Bitcoin (putting in the work) you can not just sit and expect everything to fall in place because of prayers from someone, so even those giving testimony must have put in some effort.",
