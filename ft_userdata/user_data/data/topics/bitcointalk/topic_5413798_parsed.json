  "content": "Hey guys,You probably know that stake.com is not available to play in the United States. Some people advise using a VPN for this, but this is risky, especially when it comes to withdrawing your winnings.The legal option is to play in Stake.us social casino. It is a sweepstakes casino, meaning that instead of directly depositing funds into your account, you purchase the so called Gold Coins. They can be used to play for fun in the social casino and cannot give you real winnings. However, for the purchased Gold Coins, you receive Stake Cash as a bonus. When you play with it, you play for real money rewards, which you can redeem.If playing at Stake.us sounds interesting to you, you can check our detailed review: https://thecryptobonus.com/stake-us-sweepstakes/Cheers,",

Once the official Stake.US ANN thread made this thread will be moved to trashcan.[1] Stake.US Crash & Slide seeding eventIt may have been confusing as the title may pertain to be the ANN thread for Stake.us especially that there is no official ANN thread created by Stunna or any team from stake about this. However, I don't think that this thread should be deleted or moved to Archive as it seems like the thread's main purpose is to inform and review the platform. I think OP should rather change the title instead to avoid confusion especially once the official thread will be posted.This is great information to further inform more gamblers that live in the USA that wanted to gamble on Stake. I personally tried to visit the website at Stake.us however I was redirected to visit the original website at Stake.com since I am not from the USA. I was not able to do anything on Stake.us but it seems like there are a lot of users based on the number of online users. It's best to use Stake.us for those who live at the USA and avoid using VPN as it will void the TOS of the platform and may cause issues in the long run.",

I would take the terms and conditions seriously and not try to outsmart the casino. I have personally not heard of anyone who got caught using a VPN but I am sure that there are tell-tale signs that an account is using a VPN. For example, they have a new IP from a different country every time they log into their Stake account.Better safe than sorry. Especially if they can just take your money.",

It was the stake cash is the one that you need to use if you want to redeem a prize. You can't access the site maybe because you are not from the U.S but if you are curious if what the site looks like or what are the games being offered there, and others then you can always use a VPN but you gotta make sure that you set your country's VPN to U.S. As for the type of prizes, they have cryptos, gift cards, and merchandise.
