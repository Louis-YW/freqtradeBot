Today I am here looking for answers to something that is causing me some intrigue and that is that directly in the \"CGMiner API Log\" of the Avalon miners (Models 921 and 851 that They are the ones I work with) Among all the information that it shows me about a miner there is a value that is \"CRC\" What does this mean and what can I see in this data. Example \"CRC[40 0 1296 0]\"",

Example \"CRC[40 0 1296 0]\"Well, this applies not only to your miner, it generally refers to the method of detecting errors in data transmission over the network through the use of checksums. In general, a CRC error indicates that the data transmitted over the network does not match the expected value, indicating that an error occurred during transmission. This may be due to a number of factors, ranging from noise during data transmission, deterioration of signal quality and ending with data corruption during transmission.Upd: As for your case, it is most likely a communication error that occurs between the ASIC miner and the control board.",
