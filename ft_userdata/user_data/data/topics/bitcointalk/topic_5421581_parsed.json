They are affecting too much in the market trend, it increasing panic and losses to FTX users and the credibility of Binance. You will never expect a lot from the current situation OP. Might you have heard the good news but never think this is enough to uplift the market prices? What you gonna do is to keep patient and have faith in your investment. And never get enticed by this fake news.",

It's imposdible to make any money in this Market Somebody need to put money in it's fruturating like this.I don't think I heard any more good news, but no matter what good news you heard, you should be aware that the market is still in a bear market and that now is not the time for Bitcoin to pump. Everyone knows that if Bitcoin doesn't pump, other coins won't either, so a bullrun will occur between 2024 and 2025, according to analysis. and most recently, one of the factors affecting the price of cryptocurrency is the FTX exchange issue..Everyone is convince  do to that nobody was expecting this kind of market currently, so nobody knows what will be the next price of Bitcoin because of some factors that is affecting Bitcoin partly this issue of exchange. Now crypto is down a lot of projects are  dying and everybody is in frustration. So it will be hard to even give signal. The only opportunity that will  Favour is to buy and hold for a long period of time.",

Regardless, it's not that the considered good news for you can just shake the market easily.

There's no such thing as a trend that should always be favored by you. In fact, it's the best opportunity to buy cheap coins. If you can't handle the stress, you can take a break and do some relaxation in the outside world for the meantime.",

Always keep in your mind that if you are trading, you can't do 100% every time, that's why there is risk management like using stop-losses just in case your trade will not go accordingly to your plan.Expect that there are lot of upsides and downsides of emotion when you are trading, you must be aware of it so you can control your emotions too and not to be greedy.",

      "body": "And the good news is...? While I do consider an exchange closing down and people learning and solidifying the idea of \"not your keys, not your coins\" good news, I'd say it has a pretty negative effect on the market. Additionally, even though I don't fully follow the price but there should be some points in time where you would've been able to profit, albeit really small though. If you were looking for big profits, then a day, heck even a month, or a year wouldn't be enough time, especially since we're still feeling the bearish sentiment. I suggest taking a break, and maybe switching over to DCA so you don't have to mind the price all the time.",

If good news coming then price should follow instantly.I would say that most investors these days believe that crypto market is easily predictable due to bitcoin market's halving based nature of four year cycle which means whatever happens positively, more than 50% of investors still believe that bearish conditions will last till December of this year or at least till first half of January of next year.When 50% of 'contributing' people are not ready to accept something then we cannot expect usual effect. So in my opinion, all those good news are getting nullified by the believers of 4 year cycle of bitcoin. Overall in my understanding, when there would be more demand for bitcoin then that 4 year cycle might turn to 3 year or shorter cycle; on that occasions those investors who fail to update themselves might get trapped.",

Just look at the effect of FTX scam. BlockFi in trouble, Genesis in trouble, more companies that has connection with FTX might be in trouble as well because of what happened. Contagion effect.",

I don't really know the good news you are talking about because I haven't really seen any good news, and even if their is good news do you think Bitcoin will just jump back to $60k+? I don't think so, Bitcoin is going to take time before it can recover, so we all have to be patient and hold our coin, even if their is good new bitcoin won't just bounce back just like that, it's still going to take time, when bitcoin was dumping, it didn't dump wetin one day or one month, it was dumping gradually so if bitcoin is going to pump, then it will be gradually and not once.",
