  "content": "I have just noticed on Binance that Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (D0T) have been delisted from their derivatives multi-asset mode. Solana which is more volatile was first delisted. The remaining ones are Bitcoin, Ether, Binance Coin and Ripple. While the other ones are stable coins like USDT, USDC, USDP, TUSD and BUSD. The only exchange that I use for multi-asset mode is Bybit which is called unified trading account. I have been looking for another crypto exchange to trade more volatile assets that I can be able to use multi-asset mode with them or having a unified trading account. What other exchanges can you suggest?",

You will like the exchange. Do not mind my question. Can you explain what I mean by multi-asset mode? The reason I asked is because I do not think that Bitget has it. Or I will like another person to let me know if this is true.

I haven't tried exploring further, so I don't know if they also did coin delist recently. Let's just say this isn't a suggestion. I think the multi-currrency mode is about using fiat to trade. I am not sure of that.But what I am looking for is portfolio margin. If you need to trade with either multi-currrency or portfolio margin, you need at least $9900 worth if cryptocurrencies that you have on the exchange. It was reduced from $50000 to $9900.I do not have up to $9900 that I can keep on an exchange. I have many exchanges and I do not even have up to that amount. When other exchanges make multi-asset mode to be possible with just $10 or less that you have on your exchange account, why OKX is very different.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on July 31, 2023, 10:07:15 PMI used to think Bitget was a cool exchange until I started seeing some accusations of them being scammers, and I don't think I could recommend anyone using that exchange again.

      "body": "To answer question above me, multi asset mode just means you can buy something using the combined usd value of all assets, instead of having to buy each asset pair. For example you have 100 LTC and 10000 DOGE you want to buy BTC normally you have to use LTC/BTC pair and DOGE/BTC pair. Multi asset means one trade.To OP, don't go Bitget, bad things.

For example you have 100 LTC and 10000 DOGE you want to buy BTC normally you have to use LTC/BTC pair and DOGE/BTC pair. Multi asset means one trade.You are correct, but not totally correct. With the multi-asset, you can use the coins that you have like 10 BTC, 5 LTC , 100 USDT to open position in USDT equivalent (not just a trade). If you want to be correct about that, derivative or future trading has to be mentioned.Not the pair that you will use, I mean the part that I bolded. You have to use the coins.

Let us forget that, but also that Coinbase do not allow derivative or margin trading because leverage trading is not allowed in United States. Not on Kucoin. You can not use Coinmarketcap to know about it. You can use Coinmarketcap to know the coins listed on an exchange and if an exchange also has derivative pair.",

So, seems Bitget was trying to help a lot of investors and an upcoming project by freezing is Bitget account. I don't think thats Scam. Its obvious that its a scam prevention or anti scam action.",

I thought there was though because I started using the exchange not long and I follow all thier twitter account for updates. So, I thought with their recent trade smarter implementation, there should be multi-asset mode.Moreover, I stop using multi-asset mode after FTX insolvency. I hope you know that its only favourable in bull market?",

I just hope that we need to focus on what to do and whenever there is something that is beyond your reach like this, then you just have to find something else that you can do and that would be improvement in the end. I believe that we could potentially do something that will benefit everyone eventually.",
