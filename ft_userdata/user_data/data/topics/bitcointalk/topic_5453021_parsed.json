This has raised concerns, speculations and debates amongst experts and the key people involved in the US government, including the House and Senate. I know the country is filled with knowledgeable people, and a very good decision would be reached before it would cause a default. The default would cause chaos in the US as the government would not be able to fulfil its basic obligations and this would cause a chain reaction to the detriment of the country. The debt ceiling should have been reviewed long years ago since the US population now and the government's obligations have increased compared to when the agreement was reached. However, this will not cause panic to the extent that people will now be leaving the US.Sure, it will affect them, but it's the government and its workers that will be directly affected. While those that rely on the government for tax returns will also be affected. Be it businesses, families or individuals.",

      "body": "I think you are referring to the US default on its debt, which is linked to the debt ceiling crisis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling, whose solution is political, not economic. So, will the US default on its debt? Absolutely not, because this is how the global banking system works.Politicians will continue to argue until the last moment, and after making some concessions from one of the parties to avoid political damage, an agreement will be reached and the debt ceiling will be raised. Therefore, do not worry, even if the markets did not calculate any possibility of the United States falling behind, otherwise we would see strong corrections in stocks.The pace of raising the debt ceiling is terrifying, and perhaps after 10 years we will see a real danger of continuous raising operations.https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/15/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html",

      "body": "Default simply means that the U.S. does not pay off a bond or make a payment as required according to the contract. Such a default is entirely possible and there are legal and economic ramifications.The possibility of a default is already having an effect.  In 2011, the U.S. credit rating was downgraded due to a similar possibility of default. It is likely to be downgraded again this time, even if there is no default. If there is a default and it is brief, and payments are delayed maybe only a few days, then I believe that the immediate impact will be relatively small, though it will cause more severe problems down the road.However, if the default drags out, it could cause severe economic problems even if the debts are eventually repaid. For example, U.S. bonds are treated globally like cash. Large payments are made using bonds instead of dollars. If U.S. bonds suddenly lose all value because they can't be redeemed, even temporarily, these payments can't be made and global commerce will grind to a halt.",

The debt gets paid either way. We already know which one they are going to choose and that's option B.",

I don't know what is the purpose of American politicians when they make this news every year. But if anyone still believes this will happen, it is naive and you will continue to be led by their media. I'm pretty sure that will never happen until their economy is actually challenged by China or some other great power.

So I think the default rhetoric is meant to big this big issue that unites people and their political representatives, pushing for more financial accountability of the state and stopping to rely on borrowing even more money (even though in this particular situation it may be the fastest or the only way out).

The US, however it may look to most people out there (even to me, I feel like they've fallen from grace and has become a shell of its previous glorious state), there's no way in hell that legislators in the country would allow itself to default from debt. As what @Husires has told you in his post, it's all political issues really, and barely economical, because for the most part the reason why there's no movement in the part of deciding whether to increase the debt ceiling or not is because legislators and politicians couldn't decide at the moment on what the best path to take is. Eventually they come and will come into a solution, that's always been the case for US anyway. The US will not default on its debt, financial crash would be delayed another time, and all that kind of stuff.",
