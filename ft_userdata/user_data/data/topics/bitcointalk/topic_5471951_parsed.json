  "content": "Concerns about Samourai Wallet (Access to Clipboard without permission)Hi guys i just want to let you know that I am deinstalling Samourai wallet from my android device, an also i am moving my utxos from that Seed to my cold walletWhy?I just noticed that Samourai wallet is Accessing to the clipboard with permission and without asking and without trigger..How?Some days ago I just activate one android option to alert me every time that an APP access to the clipboard, so when i do a long press in the touch to paste some informacion in the clipboard i get an screen notification  \"APPNAME pasted from your clipboard\".Almost all Apps work fine without any suspicious activity in this way, BUT i just notice that Samourai Wallet just do that at when you open it check the image:When that notificacion pops? When I start the samourai wallet for the first time after unlock the pin screen, without doing anything else, that notification appearsWhat do you thing about this behaivor of that APP ?Edit:Looks like they do a clipboard check for your \"security\". In my Opnion this should be optional and only activated at the user request.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on October 29, 2023, 06:50:31 PMIt is checking your clipboard for any stored private keys and then warning you that you have keys on your clipboard and giving you the option to delete them.Here is the relevant code for doClipboardCheck: https://code.samourai.io/wallet/samourai-wallet-android/-/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/samourai/wallet/home/BalanceActivity.kt#L1119And here is the warning message it displays: https://code.samourai.io/wallet/samourai-wallet-android/-/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml#L400You can see from the code that it doesn't use the private key on your clipboard for anything else.",

Also i am going to send an email to them.Is it just me, or most of the activity on the Samourai wallet android repository is from 3 to 4 years ago?Also, a number of open issues that have not been attended to. Their latest update was just this month, was not tagged in the repository. Last tagged release was on Apr. 16, 2020. I wonder why.This thread should not be on Reputations board. Perhaps wallet software is more suitable.About watching your clipboard, that is worrying if an app just watches your clipboard minus prompting it. I thought such apps usually needed permissions to get enabled first?",

But that still looks suspiciousYes it can obviously recognize privatekeys and they claim to be a security measure. I can't see the point of implementing such security if the warning only appears when the wallet is opened. I'm a bit skeptical from now on.",

I believe it was after they were acquired by Microsoft and they started censoring controversial projects and restricting users from sanctioned countries. Their code can be found on their self-hosted GitLab repository https://code.samourai.io/explore/groupsI haven't reviewed their code but I assume they are accessing the clipboard as soon as the app is launched so users can quickly paste addresses and BTC amounts.",

So it appears to just be 'the way it's done'Out of all the things that go on with crypto, things like this are some of the least of my concerns.And, I know I have said this before, but I'll put it out there again.YOUR PHONE IS NOT SECURE.

All characters are checked. This at least gives me peace of mind that there is no clipboard malware running amok.",
