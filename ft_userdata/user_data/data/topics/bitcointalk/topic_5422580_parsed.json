  "content": "I do not invest on altcoins, I prefer bitcoin, but as the market is very red now, I decided to gamble with some altcoins. Yesterday, I bought Neo with $200 which I can afford to lose, but believing the coin can grow and I will gain. That does not mean this bear market will not continue for now, which means it is gambling. I did not just choose the coin, I read that if you hold Neo on noncustodial wallet, that you will earn gas. I have my private key, used Atomic wallet for it because I see no open source alternative. But since yesterday, I did not earn any gas. All I read that is required is to hold Neo on noncustodial wallet, but the Neo is not increasing.",

Go to the Staking tab and select NEO to see how much GAS you can claim. To see your claimed GAS balance, go to the Wallet tab and search for GAS. If so, is it already 24 hours that have passed when you've staked your NEO?",

If it tak that long, I can wait, I won't bother about it, I just want to know if I am doing it correctly or not.That's just my thought that it would be needing to have a full cycle of 24 hours before there will be a credit to you for gas. Wait for it and let's see if that's really the case for you. But if 24 hours have passed and there's still no crediting for your gas as you've staked NEO on the atomic wallet, you can always contact them as they've got support for their customers. And, no, you won't be getting each but only gas. You stake neo = you get gas only, not gas and neo.",

If I should not diversify, I will still only prefer to go for only bitcoin which is far less volatile and have the strongest blockchain.",

But there is no fear that they can scam you through staking.  Because you have a private key, you own that coin",

I am surprised someone still buy NEO to get GAS distribution, and find it more profitable than buying other altcoin and stake them. I remember holding or staking NEO was useful or profitable only one, back in 2018, when holders received ONT (Ontology). It was profitable only because there were no staking at all. Now, ONT is already distributed, GAS does not cost much and users dont get much of it, NEO isnt most popular blockchain, some exchanges even suspended GAS distribution. Then I wonder why someone still buy NEO for ?",

I will make my next comment when I see the reward on my wallet. Thank you all.Staking isn't really that much if you're looking at it as the daily increase and gain that you make. That's why APRs/APYs are calculated for you to have an idea of how much your gain will be within a year. But, aside from that, you're also looking to have that volatility of the market so it's not that fixed value that you'll be getting at the end of the year. It will still be based on how much it will be in the present time as per calculations. If it's still not yet appearing, contact the support.",

I have bought Neo some hours before I posted my first post here which was four days ago, I checked and rechecked my wallet and I saw no Gas as reward, this could be true in the past, but I do not think it is true anymore, no reward for holding Neo anymore is what I could say.About Neo, it dump very well during bear market, and increase very well during bull market, that is the reason I thought I should go for it and I believe I did not make a mistake. But actually I saw it as gambling when I wanted to buy it, especially if bitcoin decreases a little, it would be hard on altcoins that their marketcap is becoming very small, but I hope bitcoin price will not further continue to be in the bear direction.",
