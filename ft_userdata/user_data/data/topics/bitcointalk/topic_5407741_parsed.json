Good odds on them to do so.Atl-GO vs CorinthiansGotta like the Corinthians team here, they've been playing well. But Atl-GO could continue their magical run.Then, tomorrow:Sao Paulo vs America-MinasSao Paulo fresh off a stunning upset over Palmeiras who was playing great football. Including their star player missing 2 penalties. Will their strong goal-tending continue? Under may be a play hereFortaleza vs FluminenseFluzao has been playing great, Cano scoring almost at will. But Fortaleza has been known to pull off an upset or two.Should be some great games",

We have PGP, so all messages can be encrypted.Deposits would be like any normal site, you are provided a unique BTC address for your deposits and all deposits are credited to your account so you can then gamble.Thanks for your feedback, we weren't aware of the Copper Membership thing. We will look into that. What is the other information do you find lacking?",

You'll have to get in touch with an agent to have your account created, and then this agent will process all your deposits and withdrawals. Honestly I have no problem with that if that system is working for them, but there is already a possible point of failure and that is the agent itself. Not saying that not everyone can be trusted, but it's better to have yourself create your account so that you're sure that in the event of a hack, you have no one to blame but the platform or yourself.",

There is nothing mutual about the agent having all the information of the end user, and the end user just feeding money to the account and playing on it. The agent and the platform benefits from all of this, never the end user because they don't have any say on what's going to happen on the account. For all we know, the agent can just get the deposit of the player and not deposit it manually if the amount is so big.
