Second, if he doesn't have any other means of making money to train his family, that means all the money he earned will go back to the gambling house. As he'd be staking to earn more jackpots.

I'm not a religious person, so I can't speculate about whether this pastor did the right thing, but I have heard stories of highly religious people admitting that their church cheats people and they work there because they were once cheated.",

Pastor shuts down church after winning N100m sports betWhat a sad thing on which someone do end up on becoming a fake pastor just for him to support his family which is something that not really good to do.Preaching out fake divine learnings or teachings just for your fake intent which i dont see for it to be that good no matter what angle you would really be looking.Also 2k amount isnt really that much but since we do talk about Africa which we know a country which poverty rate is high and economical status isnt that great which these amounts is something that significant.If he decided to quit and close up the church then i do feelsorry for those followers.",

They're not committed into taking care of their church member but I guess that's what a worker will do when he's out of budget.",

That could be possible like he was also using them to provide for his family aside from gambling. If that’s his intention why he has built his church, then probably winning from gambling is a good sign that he will stop spreading the fake news since he’s not a real pastor after all. This is indeed a big sin using the church for his own desires, but it will be a lot bigger if he never win a huge amount and still continue to deceive the people. So maybe  winning from gambling may consider be a blessing in disguise for him.",

Pastor shuts down church after winning N100m sports betIt is not surprising to hear this kind of news.  There are lots of people pretending to be the messenger of God and creating their own sects and churches.  At least this guy still has a conscience and shuts down the church and admits that he is making fool of his followers after winning a huge amount.  I think the figure you stated is somehow wrong, the Pastor bet 1 million of his currency and the winning odd is 700x so isn't it 700m in total?  A mere $2,171.65  won't make the pastor go far so I think it is more than that amount that makes him decide to quit his fraud activity.  Now I wonder what would be the reaction of his followers when he shuts down the church and admits that he is lying to them.Quote from: ryzaadit on March 24, 2023, 06:49:20 PMF*ck him and feels bad for the member However, we all-know how the gambler ended.

Also, he may have gained enough money to set himself for life in Uganda but the angered church gatherers and those who followed him in his Pastor days will definitely get his ass someday. Props to being honest but that's never going to justify taking advantage of people who are probably impoverished themselves all because you can't find a good job to feed and support your family. This is scamming with extra levels if I do say so myself lmao. Evangelists are definitely a different breed of scammers if I do say so myself, his is a very unique specimen. I hope he gets his retribution no matter how funny this story is. People's lives are deffo ruined after hearing the fact.",

The thing is that for only a small amount of money the pastor has changed inevitably but as I've said it's good that it was end so soon rather than to continue. I wish it's a good decision by the fake pastor and hope it will change his life with that winnings.",
