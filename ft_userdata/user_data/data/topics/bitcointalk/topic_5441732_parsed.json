[...] Is it a problem from image hosting site or from bitcointalk?Well, based on pure logic, since you could not upload your .webp image on the image hosting site, what's the connection with the forum?  It's a problem that the respective image hosting site does not let you upload .webp images.Quote from: Little Mouse on March 01, 2023, 04:22:19 PMI tried with 2 different sites and still, the result was the same.This should have explained you already that there is no connection between the forum and the sites where you tried to upload your image...Quote from: Little Mouse on March 01, 2023, 04:22:19 PMSo, I took a screenshot and used that image, and finally, that worked.Yes, that worked, because the screenshot was saved as .jpg or .png and the image hosting site was accepting this type.Quote from: Little Mouse on March 01, 2023, 04:22:19 PMWhat was wrong with my initial webp file?There was nothing wrong. It's just the image hosting site did not accept this format. I tried to upload a .webp image on imgur and it doesn't work.

Although, it didn't display any error like that of imgur but still yet the forum could render the image, so I had to delete the whole post because I was quoting an Op for visibility.This could happen for various reasons... For example: was the picture larger than 2.5 MB? If yes, this is the reason.Another reason: how did you try to upload the picture on the forum? Simply by adding its link between img-/img brackets? I mean this link: https://imgur.com/a/i5LE0HB.If yes, again, this is the reason. You don't have to put between img-/img brackets the direct link to the pic. Instead, you have to have to click on the uploaded picture, in order to open it in a new tab, then right-click on the pic after you uploaded it on ImgBB and select \"Copy link\" or \"Copy image location\". By doing so, you'll get a link ending in \".png\" or \".jpg\". And that is the link you should insert between img-/img.Example: if you'll type this inside your post, no image will be displayed:Code:[img]https://ibb.co/25JPKx9[/img]Trying to write the above BBCode sequence inside your topic will end up in this:That is a picture I uploaded on ImgBB. Now I open it in a new tab. For doing that I either click on it or copy that URL and paste it in a new tab. Once the image is displayed in a new tab I right-click on it and select \"Copy image location\". This generates a new URL, ending in \".png\": https://i.ibb.co/7bhVyPf/Untitled4.png. And this is what you have to place between img-/img:Code:[img]https://i.ibb.co/7bhVyPf/Untitled4.png[/img]Now the image is displayed:Then, if none of these work, always remember:Quote from: GazetaBitcoin on March 01, 2023, 08:07:19 PMIf you have any other complains, well...Quote from: theymos on December 31, 2013, 12:21:10 AM",

Basically I would only be managing the front end of the site, where the hosting would be provided by these services. Do you think that would be interesting?",

Yes, this changes things completely... But are you sure you actually managed to upload the .webp picture on that site? Do you remember, at least, what site it was? I am asking because not many websites accepts .webp images and, perhaps, you do not remember well... As you saw, in my earlier post, imgur also does not allow uploading .webp images, notImgBB. I mean maybe we could try this again, following exact steps you made first, in order to see exactly where the problem is.Quote from: Little Mouse on March 03, 2023, 08:35:53 AMI see.

Except for more complex extensions - for image programs. Even on your PC changing the extension, it recognizes the image as another type of file. If you test change to .bmp, a very little used format, it opens the file the same on your PC. It's pretty curious how the imaging system works.",
