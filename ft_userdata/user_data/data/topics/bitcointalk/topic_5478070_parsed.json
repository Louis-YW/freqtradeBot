I do not take time to read much anymore. I prefer to read the important part which are:1. KYC requirement needed or not2. Restricted countries3. Deposit and withdrawalAfter checking those, I will later find time to read the ToS in full anytime that I am less busy, but when I am already using the site.",

The problem with term and conditions is that asides the fact that they can be long and boring, the font used for the writing of theses terms is not always attractive to read, hence many gamblers do not waste time there, but will quickly accept the terms and conditions even without reading. Some other gamblers also assume that the terms and conditions of all casinos are the same, so because they have read the T and C for this casino, they do not read the  conditions by the other casino.",

      "body": "Sincerely speaking the lengthy part of most casinos are very tiring I tried create an account in a local gambling site but when I tried to advance the site the more I keep reading lots of compliance and it's nothing but just kyc and the rest just as above poster just explained. Even though I am still new to the gambling side I make sure to pass kyc before making deposit to start placing bet though I still finds it very difficult to go about with how the game selection process yet I don't give hope usually we need patient to read those terms and conditions and if we do I don't see ourselves running into trouble with those casinos and believe me or not most common issues won't arise for any reason except it's not properly followed. But important things oshosondy has outlined them all.",

The only time I have read their terms and conditions is when I had help.uness I have problems with maybe deposits, withdrawal, KyC,, then I read it Because of it's bulkiness most of us ignore it.

The terms and conditions of the sites that I have know before is not boring and have good font.It is the old casinos that do have longer terms of service. New casinos terms of service are not that long.

      "body": "To be honest, I have never read the entire TOS of any casino or website I use, this is because there is so much written in the TOS that I get tired and lazy to read everything, so I look for the things that I see to be most important at that moment, things like list of restricted countries, deposit and withdrawal conditions (wagering requirements) and whether or not you have kyc and then I focus on finding out more about the bonus, although I'm not interested in the sign-up bonus, I still care about read about him in the TOS because he has been the center of many fights and as I am afraid of depositing money in a casino and then not being able to withdraw it so I prefer to know everything about it.Now there are questions such as the casino validating or not validating a winner, a game or a bet and in the casino books this part is too long to read, it's a headache, although it will actually be a very important part, I prefer not to read it, when I see that I've seen enough in the tos and I'm happy to create an account at the casino, but there are times when I don't read anything in the tos. I create an account and I will only read it when I want to make a deposit. As I already got it in my head that all casinos will ask for kyc so I already know that I will have to do kyc so in that part I'm not surprised. casinos should create a simpler format with less things for us to read. It's very tiring to read a lot of things",

If you're serious about playing in a casino the word boring should not be in your vocabulary when reading the TOS of each casino that you're going to be active, not reading will put you at risk in the future, I have seen so many gamblers not paying attention and they pay the price that is they cannot withdraw the money that they have won, pay attention to TOS and make sure that if there are chances you are fully aware of the changes.KYC is part of casinos compliance if you're not comfortable with that you will have to find casinos that do not implement this, that's if you can find one that has all the features and reputation of top casinos with KYC.It either you do or you don't because you don't have choices.",

I've been gambling for quite a while already and I think I haven't fully read a casino or betting site's terms and conditions. At most, I've read sections. Many times, I've checked on the terms and conditions only after signing up and playing. In other words, I've lied when I ticked on those boxes saying I've read and understand and agree with the terms and conditions. Perhaps everybody does.",

I don't think anyone really do. And as I'm not into money laundering or mixing I don't think any of it matters. I haven't ever used a VPN on gambling site.And as I gamble with smaller amount, I have never faced any event for my funds being held by casino. I also don't remember filling a KYC on crypto based casino. Did it on bet365 and might not be unwilling to do that if I have to.Whatever the terms maybe, there's practically no use of it as they can change it anytime. The best way to avoid the casinos you don't want to join is to go through their review.",

The biggest reason for this is that the rules and regulations are written in legal jargon which is not easy for everyone to understand. Moreover, the terms and conditions are written in a large size in words that it becomes a matter of long time to find the desire terms. Gamblers feel that those who have started this casino business must be doing it from their good thoughts and must try to give their maximum. Moreover, since there is a lot of competition among gambling platforms, they must provide good service. Gamblers have positive thoughts and avoid reading those terms and conditions easily. But the gambler must have a good idea in several important factors like deposit, withdrawal or KYC verification.",

Reading of terms and conditions of any platform is important, we don't have a culture of doing that but just click accept and start using the platform without knowing what is written and later we begin to complain when things written as those terms and condition are been done. You won't waste more than 10 minutes reading the terms and conditions of casino platform therefore it's better we read them so we know what we're signing up to. If the case was to go to a law court, they can use the fact that you accepted their terms and condition against you and you lose the case. Casino that won't to scam their customers will put in terms that will favour them when they want to denied you access to your winnings due to lack of kyc or been unable to convincingly proof the source of your capital that you used for gambling for people that used a large sum and also won a large amount of money.",
