You might face problems trying to use a cex to convert to eurt because it's probably a lesser market in the US so might not have much liquidity (afaik the US have to have their own segregated markets for assets while a lot of countries in the rest of the world can use the same global one).",

Why did this happen? it's because they can do everything with their tokens and they're already failed to follow the price at $1 just like the real fiat money. Since it's from a same creator, they can do same with the EURT.Why is the value of USDT less than one dollar?",

It could be interesting to mix the stablecoins to mitigate the risks IMO.",
