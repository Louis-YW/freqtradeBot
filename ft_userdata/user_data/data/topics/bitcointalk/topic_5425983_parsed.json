However there has been too much negative news in the past two years. I reacquaint myself with bitcoin and fiat money.Money is a tool for exchanging goods and services in human social life, and whichever tool makes it into the system becomes the de facto currency. Governments regulate the economy by issuing money, which means they can control it. Bitcoin, on the other hand, cannot be controlled, which is why we like it, but also why governments don't like it.After I figured it out, I no longer expect Bitcoin to be recognized by the state, and it doesn't need to be. It is part of a special asset, not a currency.So I don't think Bitcoin is going to become a fiat currency.",

On other side, currency that we use in our daily lives are not only controlled by government but they can print more money which makes it an inflationary asset with a fixed value (just like USDT and other stablecoins are in crypto world). We love the way Bitcoin is being criticised against fiat because people are still unaware of what Bitcoin really is.",

Bitcoin is used in almost every country in the world today. But currently the price of Bitcoin is very low. And that's because I think the Bitcoin price is going down because of the two countries. And some countries have banned the use of Bitcoin. Now I think if the price of bitcoin hits in the new year then bitcoin can go back to previous level.I think Bitcoin will become the global coin in the future.",

This is also true because the example above means its value is better than the fiat that we adopt for hundreds of years. The fact that the government kept talking about it like ECB having a blog about its last stand means, it really affected them. The Senate already has been trying to regulate the crypto markets too.

Imagine if BTC were to be a global currency replacing fiat- that would mean a disaster for most countries given its nature. Not to mention, its limited supply would cause hyperinflation and majority of the whales can somehow manipulate its price on the market.That is why, fiat and cryptocurrency can co-exist with each other and serve their respective purposes.",
