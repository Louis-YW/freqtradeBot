  "content": "We know already that Bitcointalk's table formatting is quite buggy. For example we need to apply some tricks to get a proper size of the first column: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5105539.0But one of my tables is making issues. It's not a big table but I can't enlarge one column in it: Quote from: 1miau on June 19, 2022, 04:54:31 PMBärenmarkt / Crash Durchhalteparolepräsentiert von________________________________________________________________________________________________________________1.

Let's see how it'll look like when using “⠀” (U+2800): Quote from: 1miau on June 19, 2022, 04:54:31 PMBärenmarkt / Crash Durchhalteparolepräsentiert von⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀1.
