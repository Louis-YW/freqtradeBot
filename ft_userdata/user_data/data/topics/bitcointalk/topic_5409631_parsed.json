There's a reason Satoshi chose to be fully anonymous to start with.https://www.theblock.co/post/163206/suspected-tornado-cash-developer-arrested-in-amsterdamhttps://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/12/netherlands-arrests-suspected-tornado-cash-developer/",

Does Coin Center have a case or will the courts keep blocking this until it reaches the supreme court? This might be something similar to Larry Flynt's landmark case about the protection of free speech. Today, Coin Center, along with a group of normal privacy-seeking workers, donors, activists, and public figures, filed a lawsuit against the Treasury Department to keep privacy normal, to delist Tornado Cash privacy tools from sanctions, and to enjoin Treasury from enforcing against ordinary Americans exercising their self-evident and basic rights to privacy.Source https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-is-suing-ofac-over-its-tornado-cash-sanction/",

This might be something similar to Larry Flynt's landmark case about the protection of free speech. I hope that \"Coin Center\" wins. I don't think there is statutory authority to have Tornado Cash on the OFAC list. The government might argue that the coin on Tornado Cash is the property of the developer, who I believe is a foreign national, and this would get around the argument that the government cannot sanction a smart contract. I don't see any other argument supporting the sanctions. Both the sanctions and the lawsuit are making what I believe to be novel claims, especially around the statutory authority. It is difficult to predict how lower courts will rule, however, I think this is a case the Supreme Court will ultimately decide.",

There is also an argument that if a car was used to do a crime, can the government go after the creator of the car? Code being open source does not mean that no one owns said code. Many open-source projects attach one (or more) of various licenses that allow others to freely replicate and/or modify their published code freely. Open-source or not, someone had to publish the Tornado Cash code onto the electrum blockchain so its smart contract can execute. This person would, IMO, would be the one who \"owns\" this particular instance of the code.

Ross created and operated a marketplace where illegal stuff are sold. He may not be the one selling, but it's his website, his store. And he's very much aware of the illicit deals there. He, therefore, facilitated these transactions. He could have regulated it so that only legal goods and services are allowed. In the case of Tornado Cash, it's just a code that is open and available to everybody. The authorities are, therefore, in a quandary as to how to deal with the developer. He didn't facilitate money laundering. It's very possible he was never even aware of it. So how should he be blamed for it. But I guess the authorities just want heads to roll, whoever they may be. It can't be left unattended. Somebody has to fall and suffer to instill fear. The problem, however, is that unlike the Silk Road, the code can't actually be shut down.",
