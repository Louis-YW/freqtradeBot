  "content": "StellaSwap is one of the first automated market-making (AMM), decentralized exchange (DEX) for the Moonbeam parachain network. The unique value proposition of StellaSwap is that we're committed in establishing a strong foundation with our native token, STELLA, as a governance token, diverse farms, a built in bridge and user-centered service. StellaSwap's main objective is to create a broader range of network effects to address the issues of liquidity in the DeFi space, instead of limiting ourselves to a single solution like many DEXs are doing now. This manifests itself in the diverse product suite of StellaSwap that will be explained in more details. Our products are structured in such a way that facilitates decentralized governance of STELLA holders, while continuing to innovate on the collective foundations by design. Why Moonbeam?Moonbeam is slated to be the biggest parachain on Polkadat network, after securing over 95 million DOTs valued at approximately $3.8 billion USD on the first round of Polkadot's parachain auction. At its core, Moonbeam is designed to tackle cross-chain interoperability challenges by making it easier to deploy decentralized applications on Polkadot. As an etherum-compatible smart contract parachain, developers don’t need to rewrite their entire code, as all functionality can be “transferred” through a smart contract-based approach. It provides Ethereum developers a chance to use their favorite Ethereum developer tools to either build new projects on Moonbeam and Polkadot, or redeploy their existing Solidity projects through minimal changes.StellaSwap is fully aligned with the vision of Polkadot and the implementation strategy of Moonbeam network, and is committed towards extending the functionalities and opprtunities of DeFi.Official website:https://stellaswap.com/Join our discord:https://discord.gg/zdrmXwuxnqJoin our subreddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaswap/Twitter:https://twitter.com/StellaSwap",
