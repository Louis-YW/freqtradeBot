I believe that the need for decentralized platforms has become apparent.I like DYDX but I heard you need VPN if you are in the U.S because they don't allow American people. I've not use GMX or GAINS ( gTrade ) what do you think about these two? Or which one are you using right now?",

Sadly there's no 100% decentralized exchange that offer perpetual futures trade, Bisq only offer spot trade. IMO perpetual futures is similar like gambling since you're trade with an underlying asset, it's not 1:1. I also don't think there's a 100% decentralized exchange will offer perpetual trade since it doesn't possible for them to add that's feature.",

If there is something like this and you are right. But if its only on US means they are pretty strict with decentralized approach of trading and likely wanted to have a solid monitoring to users.Probably OP the only best are go to cex if you wanted a lot of options but since its risky then might use dex spot trading.",

Been using GMX now for a while without any problems. What's great about it also is that it scrapes prices off multiple big centralized exchanges, hence you wouldn't get those typical scam wicks(that ends you up getting liquidated) you see on specific exchanges(I'm looking at you, FTX) as prices are averaged.Can't say for sure about Gains, but it should pretty much act the same way as GMX — with the difference being GMX being on Arbitrum and Gains being on Polygon.",

I am really disappointed mate.Folks, i think we need some refresher courses on what exactly decentralization on the blockchain is. This shit exchanges running on Ethereum or any other shitcoin smart contract fool you into believing that they are Dexes, and yet they are not.How do I explain to my kids that a \"decentralized exchange\" blocked some user accounts (dYdX confirms blocking (and unblocking) some accounts flagged in Tornado Cash controversy)",
