QuoteMy question is guys which do you prefer, a steady monthly salary which you know that no matter what, it must come once the month ends or a business/ trading/ any other thing which you can do that you earn base on performance and you have the capacity to earn ten fold of what a civil servants might earn if you are good at it, but there is also a possibility that you may have a bad day in the office which you may even incurred some loss.Which do you prefer an why.I will prefer both; both earning options are essential to my financial growth, so as long as one is not restricting me from the other, I will gladly use both options.Under the civil servant's job, I should or might be working in a field of specialization, which will be an added advantage to my career, and when one is doing what he loves, he derives joy from his work place.On the trading part, I will do the little I can to work and trade at the same time. I know if I give it much of my time, the more I will perfect my skills, but that doesn't mean I will always be on the positive side of my orders.The reason why I will have to keep both earnings coming is this: If I am to leave my civil servant job and focus on trading, now that I have lifted all my bills to be paid from my monthly salary, I will be surviving now on my daily earnings from trading, which is the most risky part of it. The level of caution you might be using when trading when you were working and now that you have made trading your full-time pay job won't be the same again. You will want to make sure that you make some profit no matter what every single day and week, which will increase your chances of losing your trade. No more risk management procedures; all you care about is winning a trade. The more you continue losing and you remember that you don't have food at home, then emotion takes control. When you can't control your emotions, I guess you know what's next when you are trading under pressure.",

Learn how to use the search engine hereAlmost everyone wants to be their own boss and that is achievable with owning a business or trading. But both the latter and former are not easy to start up because one needs a capital. Although there are grants or loan that one could use to start up but the problem is the major risky of the business collapsing or losing everything on trading. The government work comes with security and doesn’t need fund for business start up but government work also requires one to go through acquiring knowledge which is somewhat difficult for some people. Also the government work has its limitations because it doesn’t gives one freedom to earn more profit as you’re confined to only your salary or wages. I actually prefer the both but the business doesn’t need to exhausting one or one could just find sales person for the business.",

An unsuccessful deal, a sharp change in market trends, a negative news background, or some other force majeure circumstances that are not so rare in the crypto market. Don't forget that you are probably using some kind of exchange for trading, which means that your money is in their hands. I don't think you should be reminded of exchanges that have been hacked or crashed in the past.So that's what I want to tell you. It's good that you've mastered a new way to make money, but to put it mildly, it's a little risky to rely on it completely. If I were you, then personally I would not be able to afford to give up a stable job / salary for the sake of trading and would prefer to combine. In principle, one does not interfere with the other. Moreover, the work of a civil servant has always been your passion, as you say.",

Don't think of leaving your job just because you are making money from crypto trading, you trading won't stop you from doing government work, hope you know their is no constant money in trading, your profit can come at any moment and you will be losing sometimes again, but when you are in a government job, your payment is secured every month you will be paid.Have seen people who left their job just because they were making money from trading during bull run and when bear market started they couldn't make any money again, they were even losing, at the end, they ended up regretting why they left their job. Quote from: Kara3 on April 29, 2023, 04:04:08 PMNote: in trading I earn base on performance, but even though the market is too bad, I still earn a decent amount of money out of it in a month base on my level in trading.I don't know for how long you have been trading, if not that you are a expirened trader, during the bear market, you might not be making much profit, your loss might even be more than your profit, so I don't know how you will be able to survive if you don't have another source of income during bear market.

Actually, you don’t have to chose since you are good at both. Remember that trading should only serve as a side hustle since it can never provide us profits in a consistent manner, unlike our stable job does. You might be trading profitable today, but you can’t have the assurance if it will stay that way in the future. So for best results, stay in your job and just do trading at your free time. That would be my advice so you can still make significant profits from both.",

And because they don't have the experience and they are not prepared, for sure majority of the have suffered from the shock and perhaps couldn't recover. So the best advise I would say is that you don't have to give up your job that easy in order to do trading. If you can still manage time and do both, the better.",

      "body": "With the recent happening ( inflation and recession) I won't encourage anyone to based on a single stream of income or business, although it may be time consuming trying to cope with the two activities. So as a trader what I would advise is that look for best time to be trading because trading at all time might makes you incurred lost while trying to focused on the office task that is being assigned to you. So trading at night will be more better with some specific range of time maybe developing 3 to 5 hours after working will also add additional value to your income while you still focused at the office.To have more multiple stream of income you may also open a business for yourself from the profits and also monthly salaries to boost your earnings rather than depending on both. Here are some disadvantages of having one or two stream of income; office job be it civil work might got terminated anytime and leaving at square one or level zero, relying only on trading might put you on a higher risk why? Because all family pressure needs and wants are now being channeled to your profits that you may trade out. Meaning if there were lost you will keep trading to make sure you have some profits to settle out family needs which in turns endangering your capital by making more lost since you are now trading with pressure and anxiety.",

That's not going to make me worry about where I should spend it. While trading is completely flexible and I can do it anytime that I want, that's why I can do both of it. But here's the thing, if the side hustle that you're working on which is trading is making more money than your stable job and it's quite stable, you really have to consider thinking of doing it full time. Since you've done it and you've considered doing it full time, there should be no regrets and just do better in your trades.",

Answer would depend on what type of individual you are. Some people won't afford embracing the risk and would rather choose to just settle for less as long as there's considtency. However there are individuals which do prefer shortcut to success. I'd suggest be both if you can. Trading is indeed profitable but keep in mind that not all trades would generate profit and if you can manage the risk then that would be fine but still, a consistent income is necessary for every individual to make a living. If emotions won't be controlled in trading, expect huge loss to be the outcome because there'll be times the market would be tempting you to engage and lose eventually so be careful.",
