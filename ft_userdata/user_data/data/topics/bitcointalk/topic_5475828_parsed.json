  "content": "Hello. I need some help; I'm not sure if its the place, but I'll post it here since my transactions started from an Electrum walletI've send 0.05 BTC from my electrum to my Hardwallet, but I received just 0.0025 there. I can't find the rest of it; Any idea what happened??* I was testing the HW, I sent the sats back from the HW to the electrum wallet, the 0.0025, and I got it back, excluding the tax ofc. I mean, where is the rest of the first transaction ?      edit  - - txid =     6fd52678efc0fbd427f698d1550fad0b77e5348772711555cc582e774d556e08",

The fund (which is 0.05 BTC) hasn't been moved from that address and is still there. Yes, , I'll check again the IDhttps://i.ibb.co/0YNfpJR/image.png-0,05 is the transaction from elect to HW+0.0023 is the transaction back from HW to elec (all the balance I could see there) 6fd52678efc0fbd427f698d1550fad0b77e5348772711555cc582e774d556e0816b0de4473efd87d9c81d1ebf71c3e64a46eb80102f8557c2b28ca9a865dc2c1both txID. I was trying to send smth to the HW, then get it back to test it. it worked, but Icouldn't access all the balance in the proccess. It looks like I'm not able to access all the balance I was supposed to in the HW",

I was using app on cellphone, watch only to see the balance.But,  WTF, I've just checked again, and now it's right, I can see the balance all OK. (I was refreshing it all day yesterday and today too, no ideia why it's right now; I checked it before starting the post here);It looks like it was a bug or something and the app had a delay...  no idea. Thank you again, it looks like you can solve problems just staring at them     Thank you P.S.  \"The transaction sending 0.0023 (from your hardware wallet to your electrum wallet, as you say) has spent the fund received 2 months ago and has nothing to do with the transaction sending 0.05 BTC. \"Man I have no idea what happened, both transactions I've made yesterday, the ones I've sent the printscreen, and I copied the  txID direct from them.Also, i've never used this HW before, I opened it maybe 2 months ago, when I bought, but the only transactions that I've made with it were those I've sent here with the printscreen. Anyway, something happened while I was here with you and now I can see the balance",

No update from him so I don't know if he already fixed the issue.Here's the Reddit post that I'm talking about below.- https://www.reddit.com/r/KeystoneWallet/comments/143nmgd/dont_see_sent_btc_on_keystone_app/?rdt=52654",
