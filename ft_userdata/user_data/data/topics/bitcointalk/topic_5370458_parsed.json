Though, there are many society causing chaos in Nigeria like Boko Haram, Biafra to mention few. But the truth of the matter is the fact that, the Nigerian government are the ones committing the highest crime in history. Well.. I have no idea if your state are experiencing this same bad governance too but this is a country I was born and raised so I know statistically how bad the county are being ruled and its current condition. The leaders have no integrity when it comes to money, which however make them more centered on their own self-interest while the country economy is dying on a dailies.QuoteBecause a poor and vulnerable population is easy to control.

I mean they have greatest resource any country can dream of but they are not utilizing it for there own development. Leaving your own country is not an option for everyone, since not everyone is that rich. Nigeria govt must focus his attention on core issues rather curbing the crypto enthusiastic. In p2p wallets, there is no way any organization can catch the crpto user. It will be just wastage of time chasing such guys.",

Maybe only non-KYC services where they will must using VPN or something like that.",

Somebody who is active on p2p is doing hundreds a month, a simple query from the bank and they can track him easily. And all they have to do is pick one by one the guys who have sent him or received money from him. Easy as ....pie!It takes one transaction from an undercover agent to find the account of that trader, then the bank will give the police the entire list with everyone connected to that account, then they will pick those and see where it spreads.In this case, you don't try to hide all your life, you try to change the laws.I always see poeple from Nigeria bragging that there have 10, 20 even 30% of the population involved in crypto, where are those 60 million protesting about these laws?",
