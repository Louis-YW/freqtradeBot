      "body": "Maybe include some details about the project of discussion so that contributors can have background knowledge of the project. After a quick google search, I found this Gempad App project, and from what I see, it is a launchpad project on bsc already has some project to launch. Launchpad projects are good if they have good and genuine projects launching in the platform and with this current bear market not many projects are going into launching and those who launched are struggling with price.  If you are interested in this project, you should do more research, don't invest because it is a launchpad project.",

I am curious of what people thinkLike the other guy already said it is hard to give an opinion about a project where we have zero information about. I also just did a little google search and it seems like the website of this project is gempad.app apparently. I took a quick look at the projects that were offered there and i have to say that i don't know any of those projects and there are also quite a lot meme-coins among them. For me meme-coins are useless shit-coins so i am not impressed by that portfolio.That being said i am part of some other launchpads (DuckDao and Poolz) and there it is also pretty quiet at the moment. There are just not so many projects launching during a bear market.",

I am curious of what people thinkIf you ask me what i think about a Token like GemPad i could say it sucks. It doesn't have a page web or active social networks or at least some market transactions... I was just a token generated with an smart contract and the project was forgotten in the limbo. I would recommend to stay away from tokens like this if or other way you can lose money with them.",

I am curious of what people thinkI went to their website and saw that the 5 project's token sale is upcoming. When I saw the Twitter of one of these projects, that project had only 36 followers. LOL Usually, whenever you see a project which is going to be launched for token sale on an IDO platform they have thousands of Twitter followers and similarly on other social media platforms. (means a strong community) But I was surprised by what this platform is bringing for their investors. Projects that no one knows about. Having no community support.Here is the project that i am talking about: https://mobile.twitter.com/zahnymous",

      "body": "Typical project launchpad platform. During the bull market there are plenty of ido platform that launches new tokenized projects. But this gempad is not unique at all to those. Ive saw their platform and its nothing special. They have some project line up, but you could check whether those on their roster will survive for long term and to my surprises some are really not worth it.In launching an ido platform make sure that your line up projects are the best so your platform could be a strong one and a top choice. But not sure how gempad would expand like this.",

But not sure how gempad would expand like this. Right now the market is affecting a lot of projects that wants to launch hence most launchpad are finding it difficult to survive. Launchpad project depends on the projects that launch on their platform to survive. And this not a strong utility base for any project who consider the survival and long term existence of its project. It is better to diversify into other trends as a launchpad project to keep the project alive in during the bear market otherwise being strictly a launchpad project can be difficult especially during periods like this.",

They just probably launching one for 2 months or more since then. Especially with the current situation they cant afford to lose reputation on choosing ablot of project with ending up dead in the water.",

I am curious of what people thinkI don't know about gempad but I did my own little research about it. And I can say that, this is a composition of many projects and a list for all of it. It's like ICO lists and I've looked at their maximum contribution and some are having a lot of cap for those interested investors. But this is like a gamble, so high risk and high reward for the listed projects there.If the chosen one becomes successful, you're lucky enough to be rewarded with how much you invested there.",
