Every transaction has a slippage % and if that % is exceeded the transaction is reverted. Yes you paid the gas fee for it, because the miner did \"work\" but had to reverse the outcome.Quote from: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/87475/how-to-fix-warning-error-encountered-during-contract-execution-out-of-gasYour gas limit is too low. Retry the transaction with a gas limit of 6 million. The transaction will only use the required gas without consuming it allIn other words, the issue could perhaps be related to gas limit, slippage or simply low gas fees.Quote from: smau36 on February 01, 2023, 12:23:08 AMhow should my funds of this address be recovered???As far as I know, your gas fees won't be refunded, but the money that was sent unsuccessfully will.",
