They are having product that already developed as well. Some projects may be dumped to the bottom. It gives you another opportunity to buy at the bottom. The project like vulcan forged has been doing 100% recover from its bottom which was around 2,5 - 2,8. that proves that there are bunch of good tokens/coins in top 200. Do your own research rather than believing in what already done by others. You can trust yourself to pick which coin/token will have a good future",

I think that would be a good decision if you can spread your money to buy various legit altcoins in the top 100 or even more. Im sure that it's very easy to get profit from there caused by whole of altcoins traded at the bottom due to the bearish market.

It's just a question of how long the investment will take to make people happy, in my opinion. I still hold a certain amount of ETH from when I bought them years ago, so I'm pretty comfortable with market volatility. Going forward, I think some of the information we've been hearing about the volatility is So early research on related projects is also one of the things that I prioritize for the next few cycles.",

That's the best altcoin that you might invest your spare money with.Good use case? Ethereum has it since it is a smart contract and there are many projects that are being created under Ethereum platform. Large community of supporters? With Ethereum being the top altcoin in terms of market cap, it just shows how much people are investing into it therefore, it has a huge community supporting the project. If you are having a hard time to find an altcoin that you want to invest, just look at the top altcoin at the moment and that is Ethereum. However, there are still other altcoins out there that has a good use case, a utility token and has a large number of supporters but Ethereum is the one that I will pick.",

I'm not sure if it's an investment in altcoins because you will be confused about which one to choose with the many choices of altcoins today. Perhaps ETH and BNB are the strongest candidates you can buy right now because they have the potential to increase again. But whatever coin you want to buy, you must analyze it first so you can buy it at a low price.",
