Historically, don't empires collapse both economically and militarily at about the same time. What will happen if the Dollar turns to dust, but the US military is still the most dominant? Has something like that ever happened before?To be clear: Americas status a Global Leader is not my primary focus, but the really ugly chaos and people suffering is. I try to be optimistic, but I am concerned. What do you think?",

And vice versa.The shelf life for USD is much greater than 5 years. If we're talking about a collapse, perhaps a few more decades of reckless spending before USD holders recognize the fragile house of cards that is United States currency. I don't wish suffering upon anyone, which is why I don't hope for a major currency collapse even though it would benefit crypto greatly.",

For me it's just difficult to imagine Something similar what happened in Venezuela for example, ahppening in USA.USA remaining as main global force for remaining 5 years? Well, 5 years isn't such long period of time for such huge changes. So, I'm confident that USA is going to keep their positions for upcoming years, but there is big chance that sooner or later China is going to take it over.",

They may be successful in some areas, but it will take a long time to dominate the whole world through BRICS It will take a long time to fulfill the plan that has been laid out because the world is still divided into two parts America on one side and Russia on the other side, so it is almost impossible for all the states to come under one roof so easily.The whole world is different or diverse from different places, but the whole world is still completely dependent on the US dollar so it is very difficult to separate in this place because it is connected to the system because a To change the system is to change the big revolution.The US military is highly skilled and able to conduct operations be it through military weapons or other military weapons using materials such as the US dollar of its fabled military weapons America is not an empire that is going to fall today. If they are to fall, the criticism that they are going to fall will be impossible to withstand.Finally, US dollar dominance and military power is problematic in some areas, but it is a sustainable system, and it is accepted by all, so it is impossible to end it immediately.And I don't want the opponent to disappear from the field because if there is no opponent there is no fun in the game I think they will also create a situation like the current system for us at some point, so we need balance in all areas As long as America remains on the map of the world, they will do everything to maintain their dominance, their roots are very strong. So you don't worry or fear what you are seeing will look more durable ahead Maybe there will be variation in some cases but not the whole management hope you understand.*Despite such bad conditions, the dollar has risen again and will continue to rise.",

      "body": "I'm pretty sure that your question boils down to how the long time power of USD (American giant economy) and the military power can be disrupted by the advent of other forces that negate the intentions of the USD dominations amongst other things.Yes, one can say that, as time goes on, if there could be strong opposite global forces that can challenge the dollar domination across the globe, consistently for at least 3 to 5 decades, it could change the narrative. But we must realize that the dollar infestation and imposition on the global economy has given it that leverage to globally control the economic activities and military power. The strength of the dollar to the military power is side-by-side. Since military services (covertly and overtly) are capital intensive, one must be able to take control of the global economy which the USD has been consistently doing over the years.Now, the possible force, that's likely to challenge the status quo is through the use of the BRICS. But when and how possible is another topic for discussion entirely. However, what I cab guarantee you is that Dollar will remain a Global force in the next 5 years or more.The possibility of the BRICS to disrupt the USD and US military is very high, as they're a combination of globally rising economies and military forces that have identified the current dominance and are working towards it. If the energy will continue to move steadily, they can easily disrupt that power through the provision of laudable and mouthwatering alternatives.However the case may be, the USA and US military will still be in hold of the global power for at least the next 5 years to come.",

But it is possible, so we should not over think it too much. Also, even though 5 years indeed a short period of time for a republic which has has two centuries of existence, empires and big Unions tend to break down fast. Another example of it was the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Roman empire.",

I try to be optimistic, but I am concerned.,, /What do you think?You need money to fund the military so a poor country cannot have a strong military. If the USD collapses which are highly unlikely, the US military will be underfunded and other buoyant economies' armed forces will become stronger than the US. Advanced military hardware and extensive research are expensive this is why many developing nations lack strong military capabilities.  Alternatively, nations that have strong military can use it as an advantage to become rich. Militarily advanced nations can sell sophisticated weapons and sustain their economy. An example is the case of North Korea's relationship with Russia. I have read about empires that collapsed because of weak militaries and others that went down due to weak economies. The US economy is one of the most resilient economies in the world. It's collapse is unlikely in decades. To a large extent, the US have done well in promoting global peace and equality but they have also made some grave mistakes. The main chaos currently is in Ukraine and Russia should be blamed for starting the war. I am also saying that the wars and conflicts in other countries are receiving lesser attention from the US. I believe that these conflicts will come to an end but nobody knows when.",

If anything happens to the currency then it is likely going to affect her pride in other countries and her allies. The strength and growth of the US army including influence will reduce because the dollar stand in the gap for exchange including different types of allegiance, countries as stooge to them , leadership roll in UN, UNESCO, NATO etc. Many countries are under US because of her military and economy and I think this may not last longer anymore with rival as BRICS led by Russia as number enemy.",

Many of you may not know that the US used to print them in the 60s but stopped because they weren't used back when $1 had some real value. Nowadays $1 is barely used and cents have no value, so $1k might be back, mark my words. 2 Will it collapse in 10 years or less? I don't think so. The US will pull all the aces to keep it afloat, including threats and war. For instance, it could start sending troops to Taiwan if it wanted to escalate the conflict. If the war in Ukraine ends, the US will probably benefit from it, selling supplies and rebuilding the country. 3. Will its military remain dominant? 10 years is not enough for military equipment to become obsolete. Look at Russians and Ukrainians they're using gear made in the 60s. Some soldiers even use WWII weapons.",

The 100$ bill was intended to be the highest, so criminals would need to transport more volume for the same FIAT value. I agree with you that eventually the USD will have to go through a reconvertion process or they will have to print 200$ and 500$ eventually. It is something which I am quite familiarized with, as a Venezuelan living in Venezuelan. It is weird to think that a superpower like the United States of America will have to do what inflationary economies need to, because of how inflation mess with the value of bills.",

There are two obvious solutions - cutting the welfare or implementation of VAT taxes.

Countries with unclear relationships with the US will significantly decrease their USD reserves (I guess their reserves will have the same structure as their external trade) and it is not clear what US gonna do with released volumes.But on the other hand, the US is the country where the entire world's economic science is concentrated.
