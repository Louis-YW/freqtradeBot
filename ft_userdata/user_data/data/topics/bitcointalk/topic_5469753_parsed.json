What do you think?WARNING: This is a risky project, do your own research.Looking forward to discussing it with you!",

So its a giant scheme where people get money if new people join, so like a MLM. We have seen these before btw, both with coins and with NFT's aswell, it never ends well tho so exercise caution when investing into this",

Some celebrity NFTs might be having some sales in this market, but nothing else in NFT is working unless you find new chickens to sell these nonsense things. NFT has no value and no utility!

It's dead! I was just about to type something similar. NFT’s are the ICO craze of 2017 but for the last bull run. It’ll be something different in 2024 & 2025 run up, I guess the key is to figure out what & then get out in profits before it inevitably crashes. NFT’s have no utility & no future, don’t waste your time, buy btc & eth.",

Make sure to evaluate the project's team and background, roadmap, community support, and long-term sustainability before getting involved. It is a risky project. It's new and untested, and there's no guarantee that it will be successful. Also, consider the project’s transparency and how it handles security and ownership rights. I couldn’t find specific reviews or mentions of this project in my latest search.",
