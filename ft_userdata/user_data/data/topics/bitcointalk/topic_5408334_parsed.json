Even if people in India support and adopt the use of cryptocurrencies in their daily lives, the exchange had to comply with the strict implementations that ultimately led to their shutting down.I just hope that despite this, people in India would not feel dismayed about this. Though this may be the case, they can still utilize and use different exchanges available that is outside their country.",

Centralized exchanges should also maintain their reputation by maintaining a policy that is as convenient as possible so as not to be a concern for users at all times. To compensate for competition between local exchanges in the long term, they should have the courage to change bases to avoid regulations that occasionally turn against like that or they will find it difficult to develop.",

It's like you have a house infested with cockroaches but instead of getting a company to gas the house and kill them you look for the holes they use to move around the house and patch them up with concrete. It's not going to stop if you keep playing around. India should fix their laws first. It's funny that every time bitcoin is banned somewhere it's due to incompetent government that can't deal with pressing matters and tries to put the blame on something else. Surely it's this big bad bitcoin that's corrupting these politicians and allowing criminals to move money around. We ban bitcoin there will be no more corruption and crime",

For you a member of bitcointalk, who knows better and well informed, If you are in India, you should take it upon yourself as a duty to educate anyone you come across that is aware of this news and find it discouraging that they are better options for them in terms of an exchange if they are still interested in cryptocurrency and should not give up. Your little efforts can have a great effect, do not underestimate it.",

Obviously there are chances that the exchange did nothing about the regulation and was ax. Such exchange in that kind of countries will have option of P2P trade to make more money and establish itself but if he decides not to conform with the regulatory bodies, they wont be trusted and might be attacked even by the media.",

It meant that Koinex had to find other solutions so that their users could get their money’s worth.And while there were other payment platforms that worked, Koinex suffered from a constant stream of obstacles like payment denials, closure of bank accounts and disruptions of operations. A very important point to make here is that this also happened for non-crypto transactions such as salary payments, rent, and purchase of equipment.Why did Koinex fail and shut down?There are many reasons why the Koinex exchange, closed in India, maybe, other reasons you can see below.• Crypto Exchange Koinex Falls Prey To India’s War On Cryptocurrency• Cryptocurrency exchange Koinex shuts down in IndiaI think some of the reasons above, can make adding your information regarding the Koinex exchange the reason behind all the cases.",

Anyway, although I am not really a fan of centralized exchanges, it is sad to hear that one will have to shut down its operation not because it lost liquidity in the middle of a bear market or that it is after all a scam or it is poorly-managed, but because the government itself is smothering it. The government, which is expected to be the primary supporter of innovation and the topmost entity to provide the best business environment, instead becomes the reason for its death.It's not the people that is afraid of adoption; it's the government.",

Recently the government imposed 30% tax on cryptocurrency and 1% TDS which will be deducted from source even for P2P trading, so obviously the trading volume plummeted in all the exchanges that are forced to follow these direction. There were raids in WazirX and CoinSwitch Kuber couple of exchanges by enforcement directorate citing money laundering and they have frozen the company assets held in their bank account.",
