      "body": "Yes the amount for a whales to actually manipulate bitcoin will probably be huge very huge amount that a single whale cannot have. According to CoinMarketCap the market cap for bitcoin is around $1.14T, so imagine the amount needed to move the bitcoin market by a single while. According to reports you can’t have a single whale or institution holding at least 5% of Bitcoin circulating supply. In Altcoins most especially those that uses POS you have a validators who are mostly big whales and this are people that in real sense can manipulate the market. So the market cap for Altcoins and number of holders which is relatively small compared to bitcoin sets them up easily to be manipulated than bitcoin. Quote from: Catenaccio on July 10, 2024, 01:28:07 PMI would say the opposite than your saying.

Many of altcoin projects die in bear market because altcoin developers are more easily to abandon their projects, and wait for new trends to create new projects.I can’t say for sure but with 80% certainty I can tell your that almost everyone who holds  actually uses hold a fraction of bitcoin for security purposes, except those that are gambling on some low cap memecoins. Reason why OP said many people use bitcoin than Altcoins is the fact the Altcoins are many and not a single entity like bitcoin. Some can be holding Solana and never holds ETH or some ETH holders can never hold BNB which is different from Bitcoin. As for correction we all see the effect of bitcoin on all other Altcoins, bitcoin can never go as low as 70% if you ask me, a move down to that point definitely killing almost all the Altcoins available.",

Does this mean there is least effect of whale manipulation on bitcoin among all crypto coins ? I maintain an opinion that whale manipulations are more of a conspiracy theory than proven reality with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a huge market capitalization, too big for major manipulations. Certain announcements or events that involve the movement of large amounts of money (billions of dollars) can have a short-term impact on the price, but those are not coordinated attacks. For instance, the price fell down significantly when the pandemic was announced in 2020, but that wasn't a whale manipulation. Similarly, the price went down recently amidst announcements of Mt Gox repayments, but no manipulation here either.I believe that altcoins with low market capitalization are susceptible to manipulations, but Bitcoin is not like that and I agree that it's the least manipulated coin (in a sense that manipulating its price is almost impossible in practice).",

I mean bitcoin has many whales who can pump and dump the markets but the situation is much worse with the altcoins where only a few guys control the whole market. btc and altcoin price volatility supports my arguments too. Bitcoin is much much less volatile compared to alts. It is because many more people hold btc. The supply is spread over many more people and makes it harder to manipulate the prices. When btc goes down ~8%, alts go ~20%. It is an asset with a trillion use market cap in the end. When it goes down 10%, 100 billion dollars evaporate. Crazy.",

      "body": "The most important metric when it comes to market manipulation is trading volume. Bitcoin currently has a 24 hour trading volume of over $28 billion, to be able to manipulate the market you'll need an amount closer to that figure, even if several whales were able to pool $1 billion together to try and tank the market, it will easily absorb the impact of such trades with minimal effect on the price.Another important factor in market manipulation is the general sentiment about the currency. If there's an attempt to manipulate a coin which is not trusted by its holders, they will very quickly dump it at the slightest FUD. Bitcoin is a more trusted network and will still be trusted by many at the face of FUD.",

But you know what when the price of Bitcoin goes that much, we're all saying that there's no manipulation and the increase is due to good news. And when the market is going down hill, we're all looking to blame for something and one of it is about the manipulation that comes from the whales. I'm not sure about the least effect of it, but it seems to be transferable from one coin to another and goes back to Bitcoin.",

Does this mean there is least effect of whale manipulation on bitcoin among all crypto coins ? If you compare the manipulation of bitcoin with altcoins, it is absolutely true, simply put, the larger the market capitalization, the harder it is to manipulate. But if you compare bitcoin with other financial markets, bitcoin manipulation is the largest because bitcoin's capitalization is still very small compared to gold or stocks. In addition, the market still does not have too many regulations, cryptocurrency is still a free market, so manipulation will be easier than in other financial markets. But once involved in the financial market, it is difficult to avoid manipulation, manipulation is part of this game, IMO.",

Bitcoin is difficult to manipulate because the user base is huge. It's easier for whales to manipulate the altcoin market as it's smaller in size.

Let it not surprise you that most of the population that is into crypto currency, which is speculated to be a large number of people, might just know about bitcoin, but a lot of them don't have any single volume of bitcoin in their crypto holdings; it's all filled with altcoins.  The demand for Altcoin is limited depending on what the person going into crypto currency has in mind in the first place. If it's just for them to chase a large profit, then Bitcoin might not be an option for them, but if it's for privacy and something they want to hold for a long time, they will definitely have some Bitcoins in their portfolio.",

Rather majority of the memecoins are hugely manipulated to give benefits to the creators. I think the OP might have used the word “popular” to describe the user base of bitcoin, the diversity of bitcoin as a digital asset is what set it apart in terms of manipulation or even any potential risk as more people run nodes which is part of its security. In terms of manipulation is it as you have pointed out, the amount needed for any manipulation is definitely not an amount that even if a corporation will never wants to give out. Memcoins are just those shitcoins that one person can hold upto 30 percent of the coin and once they liquidate the coin the entire coin feels it and goes dust, same for the low market cap coins.

Totally correct !!The amount of money needed to manipulate Bitcoin when we consider the marketcap of BTC is in the trillions, and who in the right mind would want to risk this much just to paint markets in their liking of which there is risk of losing or being liquidated should things go against you... honestly it's not just worth it!But on the contrary, the most manipulated coins/tokens are usually the Altcoins because marketcap for these is usually small and with a couple of dollars a whale can easily pump or dump the coin with a simple buy/sell.",

Does this mean there is least effect of whale manipulation on bitcoin among all crypto coins ? Whales can only manipulate what they have, they can't do that to the Bitcoin. What they do to manipulate the price of Bitcoin is they bought the altcoins they want to pump at less price and this reduce the circulating supply from the holders and few other traders and then they buy back the available coins continuesly until the meet their target before they offload their bag in the market. They don't have the money to buy all the Bitcoin from other trader because it's too expensive to manipulate the price.If you sum up the total circulating supply of Bitcoin that are in exchanges, they are far less than the Bitcoin that can be found outside exchange wallet and for this, it will be difficult to manipulate the price of Bitcoin as less supply is deposited in the centralized exchanges and this numbers can't be manipulated to play the price of Bitcoin but when you compare and contrast the supply of altcoins in exchanges and external wallets, you will know why it's easy to control altcoins.",
