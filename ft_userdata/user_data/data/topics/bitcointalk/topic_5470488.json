Stock investors also often expect quick profits. There's nothing wrong with that, after all, someone has to provide capital for experienced investors. Every market participant is important to the market. Is he swinging from longs to shorts, providing liquidity, or is he buying high, expecting big returns, while providing capital to smart money. And speaking of the approach to bitcoin, I suspect that you live in your own bubble, where this is the approach to bitcoin (it's nothing bad, everyone lives in their own bubble and rarely sees things objectively.) Older users who have already survived several bull runs and bear markets have a different approach, and statistics prove that number of long-term investors grows and they hold more than 3x the amount of bitcoin that shor-term holders hold.",

Maybe it's the impatience, but I think that misinformation also plays a key role why newbies fail or experience loss early on their investment journey.",

QuoteWhile educating people about Bitcoin, I think it is wise we tell them Bitcoin need time to yield profit, let us change our approach in sharing Bitcoin knowledge so that people will not come into Bitcoin with the mindset of get-rich-quick. You are very correct @OP,  people should know that bitcoin is not a money-doubling scheme or a get-rich-quick venture. They should come as long-term investors if they want to really benefit from bitcoin.  People should also know that the price of Bitcoin is unpredictable so they should be willing to readjust their plans in case the price falls short of their expectation at a given time.",

They believe Bitcoin is more risky than their jobs, I think it's because they have no complete trust in Bitcoin, if not, they would prefer to hold for a very long time, I have a big sister who is also acting the same way, when I questioned her about Bitcoin investment I detect that she feels unsafe with Bitcoin.",

The volatility of bitcoin should even be a good reason for people not to be in a hurry to make profit,  since volatility has great enfluence in the market of bitcoin people don't need to predict when they can make profit from the Market.  Volatility is what you can predict,  it takes investors unaware in the market.  Their is no need to rush yo make profits from Bitcoin because Bitcoin is a longtime investment that people needs to be very patience with the market to get better profit from their investment. Bitcoin really need time but some people just want to make the profit by their own time or prediction which is not supposed to be so. Bitcoin is unpredictable, that people needs not to rush to make money from it.",

However, the mistake is that many people are tempted by the results of traders who are able to take advantage of BTC price movements and people with minimal analysis experience, even newbies, jump in and try their luck.
