Visit this thread in thread to confirm your facts you don receive your own?. There are people testifying to receiving it, even with evidence. So E no reach you no be say e no exist. Scammers in Nigeria are opportunists, they create a clone of legitimate activities for their own benefits, its not only in Nigeria, scanning is everywhere, just that petty scams are  plentiful here. This is why you must use your head when you're visiting any site and observe the following: do not visit a site that is not secured, if it doesn't have the padlock closed at the top left, its dangerous to engage in it Do Not click links directly from WhatsApp or any social media, just copy the link and go  paste on your browser to avoid  hacking your account do not be greedy, research properly about the authenticity of any program before engaging in it to ensure its originality  Do Not fill out your bank card details in a website, go for cash transfer instead unless you completely trust the site, but you can't trust things these days, can you? check for the site's trust  rating on some scam detection websites like Web paranoid, URL VOID and a lot of them out there, its true it can't be 100% correct, but it surely helps.",

My advice is just that people need to be careful, they shouldn't end up into the hands of scammers all in the name of free money . For me alone I won't even participate in a scheme like this because it is something not very sure to me.",

I am not discarding that some set of people haven’t gotten yet or is a scam, it could be true since some people here already said they’ve gotten it already, so it could be true but just that it hasn’t gotten to a lot of people as expected yet.",

Also just like one member mentioned,  whatever you see a fake copy,  there is an original copy of such because the conditional money transfer is a federal government/CBN initiative so scammers already know that Nigerians are desperately searching for means to ease their economic condition and because of that,  they can take risk in believing things like this, even without proper findings or investigations,  so scammer has found that as an avenue to exploit and work on the gullibility unsuspecting members of the society.
