Because the difference between bitcoin and forex is that it is volatile, that's why the bitcoin value reached today in the market because of its volatility.This volatility that Bitcoin has is one that can give a good profit to anyone who believes in it as long as the process steps are correct, but this can also cause you to lose the capital you have for the Bitcoin that you invest.",

Indicators are available to use and you can keep your strategy as simple as possible but you can make it very complicated with so many indicators.With trading, it's not true to say what strategy with included indicators, is good or bad. As it depends on not only the market, quality of the strategy and inclusive indicators but also personal trait of a person who uses it. A same strategy can work for me but can not work for you as we have different traits, patience, discipline and different capital size.",

However you should know the volatility is not the same. IMO I think bitcoin is very volatile. The volume is high for bitcoin . You can use the forex indicators to trade the bitcoin market but you also have to monitor the whale manipulation which makes the volatility spontaneous.",

Because I'm not into forex and I can't tell and depict if it's possible, so instead of giving some guess and thoughts, it's best to this from someone who's experienced in both markets.I'd say that in stocks and bitcoin, you can have the same technique but talking about signals and indicators. There's just a bunch to talk with if it you're relating to both of it. If no one will show up then it's your call to test the waters if it works or not.",

If you're finding Bitcoin's calls it would be better to do your own research and decide for yourself because you can't risk your money to someones calls. There's a lot of group in TG that discussing about calls since a lot of whales have their own group. You still to be careful since TG is also known for fraud and scammers. Also in Twitter there's a lot of of verified users that having their group calls. Still always be cautious it might be fake.",

Instance! When you wants to trade forex you can get signals and indictors apps from google play store but no such for bitcoin?The answer is no. It's just because their volatility isn't the same. So we predict that if your analysis in one specific trading pair is functioning, the other pair is not and will occasionally reach your SL. Aside from that, each trading pair has unique market behavior. As a result, when comparing the two charts, their price action is not the same. So it is reasonable to always back test the trading pair if it is your first time to make your analysis working.",

When you wants to trade forex you can get signals and indictors apps from google play store but no such for bitcoin?Yes, Bitcoin trading also works the same way for traders like forex, but the volatility of the Bitcoin and crypto market is highly unpredictable and due to that sometimes the indicators might not work the way they are intended to work. The technical indicators work the same way, and if implemented with a good strategy, and proper trading plan, than the results will be positive. No matter Bitcoin or Forex you should not rely on those signals that the apps give you. Most of those signals won't work, and you might lose your capital by following such baseless signals. It's always better to learn trading yourself rather than relying on the signals shared by someone whom you don't even know. And, if you lose your capital by following those signals, that won't cost them a penny, and they will still be making money from the ads on their apps.",

Traders can also use various chart patterns and candlestick analysis to make informed trading decisions.

Take trading, for instance, a rollercoaster of thrills (or chills, based on your vibe). Plus, signals and indicators abound, guiding you toward well-versed trade choices.But Bitcoin? The plot thickens. Even though Forex outnumbers Bitcoin in app and tool availability, that doesn't mean Bitcoin trading lacks signals and indicators to steer through the wild, untamed market. Heck, I've concocted my very own covert Bitcoin trading signals, dubbed \"the Blockchain Boogie.\" Picture plenty of expressive moves and incantations - bizarre, I know, but it's a winner.Naturally, the Blockchain Boogie isn't everyone's forte. That's why it's crucial to stay receptive and scout out a spectrum of tools and resources to pinpoint the ones that gel with you. Whether it's classic technical analysis or offbeat approaches like dance and melody, no single \"correct\" method exists for Bitcoin trading.",

It is best advisable to logical and analytical in your market illustration when trading forex as most people believe me that manipulation sets in at one point or the other which can be sometimes unavoidable. You set your “take profit” and “stop loss” while trading forex especially in order to avoid loosing your funds in your account and to be on the safer side. Bitcoin involves understanding the highs and lows point in the market situation, especially now that the price of Bitcoin has fallen to the bearest minimum which a lot of people has predicted already in the past, we only need to build ourselves by understanding the analysis of the market prices/situations, the more you understand how the market works in crypto, the better your level of confidence.  “YOU are the best teacher to yourself”.",

In the recent past it wasn't possible. Innovation has proved consistently that change is a necessity for growth and advancement. In fact, in 2017 when I joined the crypto business one could only trade cryptos as a Spot. The Futures option wasn't there. It was enter one sold Bitcoin for altcoins or exchanged it for fiat at once. There was no stablecoin to sell into. It was just a one-way traffic then to make profit. One could only buy and hodl, then wait for price to appreciate to sell off. It's different today as anyone can sell without even buying, just like what we've in Forex trading.Talking about indicators, one can trade cryptos using the same indicators one trades forex with. It's just a matter of backtesting them to know which works well and with what parameters to set them to.",
