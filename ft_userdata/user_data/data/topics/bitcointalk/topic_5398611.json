If you say wallet that works offline that means blockchain can work offline too, sending crypto on-chain offline is not possible right now. If this kind of malware is in the ad script, simple ad blocker such as uBlock Origin is a simple solution for this, also the user's knowledge how things work.",

So why do we don't accept our mistakes?",

I think that it has already been fixed by Coingecko. They released a statement on Twitter advising users to still be careful but also stating that the ad script has been disabled (https://twitter.com/coingecko/status/1525238360847134720). There is absolutely no reason for a site like CoinGecko to request that you log in or connect to any wallet to browse the site. Anyone who thinks clearly should know that. It would be like Bitcointalk asking for your seed while logging in to your forum account.",

If you don't just think about it and then tried to log in and put in your credentials, it is certainly will be the end of your day. I also visited the Coingecko site but never I've experienced this one, maybe this is just about to happen in a very short period of time that only a few got notice of this and then sends reports. Well, the good thing is that it was resolved already and I appreciate their fast action. It is a need for us now to be more vigilant and careful in our actions especially when it asks for login information.",

But it doesn't make sense upon visiting the site you will connect your browser wallet without a reason for using it, so it's common sense to us to smell the scam attempt.¬† Altcoins are prone to scams, and also scammers day by day become desperate of stealing naive people's fund. BTW, thanks for the heads up!They targeted newbies because they know it has low skills when it comes to handling wallet, especially those bounty hunters, but it might it's a small chunk that they will scam because usually those who visit that site most are bounty hunters.",

It's very easy to get attacked and malware infection. This could be due to unlimited access to sites on PCs which are shrunk in phones for the sake of capacity. Users should be careful running sites on their devices. As a rule of thumb, I've a policy of saving relevant sites I visit on my homepage. I think that has been saving me a great deal from phishers.",
