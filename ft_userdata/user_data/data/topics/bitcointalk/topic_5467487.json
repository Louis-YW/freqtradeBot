  "content": "I've accumulated a significant amount of $OCI over the last two years, but now I'm facing financial challenges (leverage is not in my favor)I want to sell it, but if I were to put it on the market, the price would likely plummet. Therefore, I'm seeking an OTC deal.The price is negotiable, and I'm open to various payment methods, including BTC, USDT, XRD, ETH, and XMR.Good to know:It's not traded on any CEXs yet because the L1 it's built on, $XRD (https://www.radixdlt.com/), is set to launch in a few days, but Babylon (the 'beta' ledger) without smart contracts has been operational for years now.However, you can trade $OCI on their own exchange at https://ociswap.com/ociswap/ for $XRD and then exchange it for your preferred cryptocurrency.The TVL $3.1 million, MCAP of $3 million. Ociswap holds the top position as the number one DEX on Radix.telegram: jhonnyyf",
