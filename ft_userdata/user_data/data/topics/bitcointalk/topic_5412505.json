What is the price at $30k you are talking about for the present cycle?Currently, Bitcoin is under realized price and is good time to accumulate it. We can expect another dump to wash out like what happened when Bitcoin crashed from $6k to under $4k and after that it rose with a new bull run straightly towards $69k. It might or might not happen, we never know.Is Bitcoin bottom there yet? Fear & Greed, Pi Cycle Top / Bottom",

I think maybe plausible models can be created but I would wait and see how this cycle turns out because S2F is not the only model that has broken down.

      "body": "The most important point to note in the new *Generalized* Stock-to-Flow (S2F-G) model is the following.In the Original Stock-to-Flow (S2F) Model, the equation used was:  BTC-Price_(S2F) α≈ (Stock/Flow)^3In S2F-G, the same equation is transformed into:  BTC-Price_(S2F-G) α≈ (Stock)^5/(Flow)^2This makes a HUGE difference in future predictions between the two models. For example, in the present cycle (2020-24), S2F projects $50-100K, compared to the S2F-G projection of only $30K. The next cycle (2024-28) makes the difference between the two models even more stark - the S2F prediction is $500K-1M, but S2F-G predicts a mere $170K. This is because the 'Stock' and 'Flow' exponents were decoupled from each other in the S2F-G model, resulting in a square (^2) dependence on the Flow parameter by itself, rather than being \"forced\" in the S2F model to be a cube (^3) dependence on (Stock/Flow). The Original S2F model is likely flawed, and should be correctly replaced by the S2F-G model.",

Of course, I can give a window for the falsification of my model: If the peak BTC Price lies outside of $100K-$400K range during the period 2024-28, then my model will be broken.

If the prediction is not fulfilled the model is false but as a predictive model it has to be able to make a multitude of predictions in the future, and as long as these coincide with the theory we can consider that it gains plausibility, but not that it has been proven to be true. It is much easier to consider it as false, which is done when reality does not coincide with what the model predicts.",
