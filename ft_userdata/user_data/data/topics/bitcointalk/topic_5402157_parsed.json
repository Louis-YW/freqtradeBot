In spite of the fact that the analysis is correct and it has based everything on data collected since the beginning of bitcoin, it assumes that the rate of adoption will not slow down. It also does not mention that technically bitcoin cannot accomodate 1 billion users to use it every day for their transactions without causing the network to increase fees and price out many users.Also, the anaylsis only mentions bitcoin's adoption as a technology. This might be wrong because bitcoin is also a type of asset that is also trying to compete against banks. Those people behind the banks have made fiat currencies their life blood and would try to kill competitors to protect them.In any case, according to the analysis there are presently 30.8 million net users in bitcoin or 0.36% of the world's population. By taking a cumulative sum of entities net growth, this gives us a value of 30.8 million unique entities (users) on the network right now.Dividing Cumulative Sum of Net Entities Growth by Global Population (with respect to each year) gives us the percentage of the global population that has adopted bitcoin. By this estimation ~0.36% is currently using the Bitcoin network.Read in full https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5de588aa3e9c044c1ad8cb59/t/62a0cee064cb4b79ded25894/1654705890141/Bitcoin+User+Adoption+Report.pdf",

Fortunately for us, the alternate projects of L1 died out very quickly either because of lack of interest, increased complexity of codebase (and not enough hands to work on it).I propose the community will do a decentralized election process by means of running the LN client they prefer to be the reference body (this process will be significantly easier as Lightning Labs/lnd is already enveloped in scandals around its own implementation, and there are no other major competitors to c-lightning & lnd).",

It also does not mention that technically bitcoin cannot accomodate 1 billion users to use it every day for their transactions without causing the network to increase fees and price out many users.I think the average user just does very few on-chain transactions every year tho. I also saw on glassnode that around 60% of Bitcoins supply didn’t move in over a year, which indicates people use on-chain as a store of value primarily at the moment. Scaling with blocks alone will also not work, without becoming centralized at the moment. So we will need to rely on off-chain solutions and they’re probably ready to handle 1 billion users by then, so i wouldn’t be too pessimistic. https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&m=supply.ActiveMore1YPercent&resolution=24hQuoteAlso, the anaylsis only mentions bitcoin's adoption as a technology.

Bitcoins game plan is strong and you could say banks are the best marketers for Bitcoin at the moment, by their own actions. Fiat will collapse by itself, it’s like a house of cards, once there’s problems it’s unable to fix itself, so it’s just a matter of time.",

Because if you look at the state of government, banks and the economies finances, it’s clear that they became fragile. They opened pandoras box with inflation now, which they can’t get out of, because they rely on the printer to pay back debts. They will need some kind of monetary reform or extreme control over how money flows to keep this system alive. Which means Fiat will continue to become worthless, to the point that it eradicates any wealth a regular citizen had stored there. There was a situation like this in 1929 where banks started to collapse and people were rushing into gold, which then was forbidden by the government in 1933. There will be a need and probably no alternative to escape Fiat in the future.So Bitcoin will be adopted because there is a need for it, unconfiscatable assets have the highest chance of surviving economic turmoil and Bitcoin is the most sound money there ever was. What do you think people will do when governments shed apart their bank accounts? Waiting till they define Bitcoin differently?Bitcoin will win because it’s better, not because the government says so.",

(avoiding routing)b. users playing pass the parcel down a stream of users (using routing) where the more users on the network means more hops to go through to reach everyonec. users require more channels for more potential destinations to have a more direct contact without as many hops.each of these directions fall flat into the problem of value liquidity.a. this scenario needs a master hub to have alot of value locked up to have liquidity in each of its channels to palm off to its customersb. for every hop along a lengthy route they have to rely on each person along the route to have available balance and be online to service that payment. the more people in the network. the more distance between source and destinations, the more hops means the more chance of running into a roadblockc. the more channels a user needs to open the more funds it needs to lock up (like the (a) hub problem, but where funds are locked on the user side) where the user becomes a hub. meaning if all they have invested/acquired of  crypto is like $800 worth. 2 channels is $400 per channel 16 channels is $50 a channel. which then limits how much they can spend at at given time to a destination available only on one channelLN has many other flaws too. not just routing bottlenecks of liquidity issues of channels or the requirement of all parties involved in a payment needing to be online. or the requirement of middlemen to sign whereby they can just be assy and refuse, holding payments up/delaying 'success'/fail messages. or the fact that the more hops needed=more fee due to having to pay each hop. or the issue around having to map larger routing tables becomes a bloat of gossip the bigger the network gets and the more data required just to update. or the issues around centralisation of hubs or the dilution of spendable value if users had to have more channels. .but also that the settlement and punishment parts and the initial funding locks are not firmly ruled systems which are audited by the network to ensure compliance.. yep LN is not a consensus network and does not fulfil the byzantine generals problem",
