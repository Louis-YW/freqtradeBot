  "content": "On https://app.analytex.today/lend?view=assets&page=1&limit=10there is a column \"All chains\" and \"All protocols\". The name under them are different. For example in chain, it looks like this are the different blockchains that exist. For example Ethereum, Avalanche. But under \"All protocols\" for example we can not find \"Ethereum\". A) So what is the protocol?B) Why is it important to chose a protocol on https://app.analytex.today/lend?view=assets&page=1&limit=10 ?C) Can it be, that different blockchains use the same protocol?D) Can it be, that different protocols are on the same blockchain?Would appreciate some answer. Thank you.",
