It was primarily dependent on the networks capacity and number of participants using the Bitcoin network at that specific time.",

Also, has the maximum number of transactions per day always been 100?first of all people did not have the ability to choose between paying by address or paying by IP. it was always address based payment.the confusion is thisthe IP feature was not about payment destination inside a tx data.. it was about communicating with someone directly via their IP to get their bitcoin address from their node using a communication connection in the node. to then input the bitcoin address into a transaction. secondly the fee was fixed at a low amount in the initial years. and it stepped down when there were halving cycles and a and large bitcoin market price changes.. people paying random amounts to outbid each other did not come about until much laterwhere the fee market game began which is where the first fee wars started. where fees extended above a $0.20 range and have not really gone back down since.. even with years of promises that new features will bring fee's down, we have yet to see bitcoin (yes i speak of the bitcoin network and not other networks pretending to be bitcoin) offer fees below $0.20 for 8 years nowthirdlya bitcoin block holds about 2500 tx per block on average. and there are about 144 blocks a day so theres normally atleast 360k transactions a day...fourthly the fee back in 2010 was about 0.001-1btc which was at the time, the price of one whole bitcoin was ~$0.004, making the fee then not even 1cent because the price of a whole bitcoin back then was not even 1 cent and the fee was below 1btc",

Also with Laszlo's case, I think it wasn't much of a fee given that it was more likely a p2p transaction and given that the market price before was still low. Until today, fees on decentralized exchanges is lower than our normal transaction fees with fiat and the only problem is just its adoption. No matter how we would want to pay in BTC, if the merchant does not accept such mode of payment, then it won't be as useful as it should be. Same reason I guess why people of this industry prefer using it as an asset more than a currency aside from profit potential but also with limitations on its usage.",

Do you know that many crypto newbies screamed about high transaction fee from Bitcoin and Ethereum in last bull market? They don't understand that you can't have high price action and less transaction fee together, it's not possible.",

At least not till the network became more populated.Concerning the great Laszlo Hanyecz and his infamous pizza purchase, I can affirmatively state that there were no transaction fees involved. But look on the bright side, at least he didn't tip the pizza delivery guy in Bitcoin!As for your claim about the maximum number of transactions per day being 100, that's a fine piece of misinformation. The actual number depends on the block size, which was originally 1MB, and could hold around 2000 to 4000 transactions. The daily limit thus can theoretically exceed several hundreds of thousands.
