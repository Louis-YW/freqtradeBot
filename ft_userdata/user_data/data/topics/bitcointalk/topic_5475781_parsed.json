  "content": "I've been thinking of making quite a few purchases from Amazon lately, and I remember people are selling Amazon gift cards as if they're in abundance. You can even find them as options when buying and selling bitcoin from non-KYC exchanges, and can be bought much cheaply than they're worth. - Are these legal? I remember there was an Amazon saying that you can't sell gift cards. Do people get caught into doing that? The transaction can be made anonymously, and I wonder how Amazon can figure that out. - Are they legit or is this a usual financial instrument used to scam people?",

Do people get caught into doing that? The transaction can be made anonymously, and I wonder how Amazon can figure that out. Depends on the terms of service whether they are legal. But they have no way to detect that gift cards are being sold unless someone tries to cash out a large batch of them in their order (which is not wise to do anyway). I've been buying iTunes cards regularly for some time and I've never had any problem redeeming them.Quote- Are they legit or is this a usual financial instrument used to scam people?Well if they just show you a code, it could already have been redeemed so buying them by P2P is very risky.",

You just have to make sure that the you don't buy coded Amazon gifted card. I think there arf two types of Amazon gifted card, we the code Amazon gift card which is mainly generated at the point of purchase from there online store. You can't sell it because it can be traced to the actual owner while the scratch card Amazon gift card can be bought originally at any physical store that sell gift cards. They can be sold whether online or physical to any person without any risk.",

As far as Amazon is concerned, I've never had any problems, the important thing is not to use the gift cards with an Amazon account to which a credit card is not linked, otherwise the account will be banned and the gift card will be lost.",

Because it can be abused by scammers, using one giftcard for different trades and scam different trade partners.If you only want to purchase gift cards for your personal use, it's fine but you have to know risk of reselling giftcards like I said. At least the risk is big if you resell a same gift card on a same platform where you bought it.When trading gift card with a trade partner, you must have a screen recorder that can be used as a proof of trade when you need to make a dispute.Redeem gift card quickly because if you are late, the trade partner can scam you.How to Safely Trade Gift Cards on PaxfulQuoteAmazon Gift CardAsk your buyer to upload the gift card with proof. This includes a photo of the receipt. Take a close look at the receipt. See if the receipt is under your trade partner’s name and look at the date of purchase. Ask if their account is restricted on Amazon. Ask them how often they sell Amazon Gift Cards—if they do it often, it’s likely that their account is restricted.",
