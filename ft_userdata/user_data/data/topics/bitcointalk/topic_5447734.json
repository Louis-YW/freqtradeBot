The current hashrate is well over 325. EH/sOn average there are 144 blocks per day. The average fee is about BTC0.2 per block so 144*3*.2 = 86.4BTC So unless you have a few million USD to throw around it's never going to happen.-Dave",

That won't work either?if that won't happen, what will happen if I through 1 million BTC transactions to market through my miners and pool with 0 sat fee and 1 satoshi in value totaling 0.001 BTCMainly I thought owning mining pool, miners, and adjusting the fees would fasten the transactions processing because I am not looking for profits or block rewards.",

That won't work either?It doesn't matter what you fill into your candidate block, your pool of miners would still need enough hashrate to be competitive with every other miner out there. To compete at that level you would need a huge capital, when you set a deadline to achieve it, the capital grows larger.There's no separate chain for low or zero value transactions.Quote from: CryptoHFs on April 06, 2023, 01:45:36 PMif that won't happen, what will happen if I through 1 million BTC transactions to market through my miners and pool with 0 sat fee and 1 satoshi in value totaling 0.001 BTCMainly I thought owning mining pool, miners, and adjusting the fees would fasten the transactions processing because I am not looking for profits or block rewards.Nothing happens. The amount involved in the transaction does not determine the feerate neither does it affect what you are considering.No, it would not fasten the process. Your miners are competing to confirm blocks so they are looking for block rewards, that's how the protocol works.",

( 0 sat fee 1 sat trans value )AFAIK, the highest number of unconfirmed transactions at one point is about 200k - 300k, if hypothetically it was possible to initiate a million at the same time it would definitely cause a panic.But you have to get nodes to validate those transactions first and include them, such an influx would likely cause most nodes to not push hose spam transactions into their mempool and it never gets out.At a ferrate of 0 sats/byte, your transactions would never be confirmed.",
