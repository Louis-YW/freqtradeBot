  "content": "This board should have the will to fight and win for the value of bitcoin. We need to use the powers we have to defeat the evils that want to keep it down. I will list a few of the bad actors, and methods of combat.- Peter Schiff: He makes profits on gold and fears that bitcoin will force him to sell his house and turn his daughters into prostitutes. He slams bitcoin but no other crypto because of his fear of the 'king coin'. Any media that quotes this desperate fool should be slammed hard. Comment on the articles that they are posting fake news by 'the desperate fool'.- Gary Gensler: to be resolved Jan 20- Dems and the DoJ: On Monday, July 29, 2024. The US government moved 29,800 of its total hoard of 230,000 coin. The FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) in the market caused the price to crash $3,000. This was two days after the Trump speech in Nashville. The speech and the hype up to it, had the price up to $70,000ish from the Mt Gox and Saxony crashes. I reported this to the FBI as either election fraud or market manipulation. They think I have a tin foil hat.- Saxony: They sold criminal seized coin on the open market and we hope they learned a lesson. All public coin should have democratic policy about sales of criminal seized coin. This should apply to all countries including China.- Paywall media: If you google 'bitcoin news', the top hits are media sites with bad news headlines that you can't read without a subscription. There are many more to list. Please add. ~~~~",

Anyone can battle this thing however they want.  But if you feel compelled that you gotta speak out against some fool, then follow your gut.  We each pick our own way to scrap and  just cause Peter Schiff talks trash dont mean Ill give him the time of day.  Bitcoin is fine without any one person.  Best way to stand behind it is use it, teach folks about it, give back what you can...So yeah you wanna call out the BS from Peter Schiff, be my guest.  Just dont expect we all join the cause.",

They have full control over what they do and we just need to do what we are supposed to do because no matter how much we oppose what they do at the end of the day, things like this will not change as there will always be pros and cons to everything that is done.They reject bitcoin because they have a goal for their own benefit and we cannot intervene in their choice because it is their right.Our job now is just to do what we should do, regardless of those who speak badly or oppose I personally don't really care about that because when we try to argue there will be no bright spot from that so why do we try to argue because when someone has started to hate something (in this case bitcoin) regardless of the data or facts we provide they will not want to accept it.",

Where we can feel peace by investing and it is possible to gain huge benefits, there is no doubt that others will present it in the same way as we present it. Because Bitcoin is spread all over the world based on its own merits, those who are very worried about investing in Bitcoin are the bedbugs of this society. If anyone criticizes it, we will definitely prove to them that Bitcoin is the best investment and is known as the safest and truest asset of this time, because you will be surprised when you look at the growth rate of Bitcoin. Only those who are stupid, they are afraid of taking risks, and only stupid people will say that Bitcoin is bad.",

It’s nothing new, FUD has been around for years, but look at how far Bitcoin has come despite all that noise. FUD and FOMO are part of the game, and honestly, not everyone will profit from Bitcoin investing. Some will fail so others can succeed, it’s just how markets work.As for coins being moved or sold, with today’s larger trading volumes, it’s less likely to cause a massive crash. A small dip isn’t a crash, and Bitcoin’s market behaves differently from traditional stocks. What might seem massive to them is often just a regular fluctuation for Bitcoin.",

That is all that we have to fight. People who are spreading misinformation just so it validates their hatred and skepticism to bitcoin are the ones we should take care of. But people who genuinely just don’t want to invest and expressing it on public? There’s nothing we can do about that. We can’t force them to do anything.As per “market manipulation”, I don’t think that was the case back then. Even if it was, I don’t really know what would be the consequences for that. There are entities with a lot of bitcoins and unfortunately they hold the power to move the market. Again, nothing we really can do.",

      "body": "For me one way to keep decentralisation in full positive impact and power. In the crypto space is to clear out FOMO because of it's effects on the network. Most big firms and investors are actually focused solely on profits and what they could benefit from the network and not necessarily being an enthusiast or a core supporter of the network.  Decentralisation has it's undisputed importance and advantages and also, so does it have a couple of disadvantages. Sudden moves like buying or selling huge amounts that big firms usually make are usually accompanied by sudden shift in price too but it's effect is more intense because of the FOMO of retail holders.",

Please add. ~~~~ if you are bullish on an asset and intends projecting it to the people in the society, its best to do it without trying to get another person involved in it in a manner that makes it look like you see the individual as a threat to bitcoin. Gary Gensle, peter Schiff and whichever anti bitcoin personality we have out there are just to be seen as mere noise makers that are not fortunate enough to have invested in bitcoin and because of that wants to see bitcoin crash so as to boost their ego for their lack of believe in bitcoin. trying to go at that on the media to tarnish whatever post or opinion they share will be a waste of energy and instead, it's best to use such energy in projecting bitcoin and continue in investing in bitcoin so after slamming them, it would not be that we ourselves don't even have the slightest quantity of bitcoin we are holding.bitcoin represents freedom and doesn't need you to go word for word against the anti bitcoinnier. the best way to show that you value bitcoin is to buy, hold and maybe share your investment journey with people which can in the process bring others into the bitcoin ecosystem. if you have done that, let the media gossipers continue in their gossip and watch how bitcoin continue getting bullish and giving them what to talk about.",
