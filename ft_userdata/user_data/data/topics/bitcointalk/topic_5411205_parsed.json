However, we are not also sure how reliable the information coming from tokenist.com.Quote from: https://tokenist.com/tornado-cashs-usdc-frozen-as-stablecoin-censorship-fears-grow/Consequently, all Americans and US-based entities are barred from interacting with Tornado Cash or any of the Ethereum wallet addresses tied to the protocol. Those who fail to comply may face fines of $50,000 to $10,000,000 and 10 to 30 years imprisonment.I have not used Tornado but the list is a lot.USDC banned addresses - https://dune.com/phabc/usdc-banned-addresses",

This stable token is actually didn't comply with sanction by OFAC/regulators. https://tether.to/en/tether-holds-firm-on-decision-not-to-freeze-tornado-cash-addresses-awaits-law-enforcement-instruction/As a centralized stable token and then USDC did better compared with tether in term of regulation compliance. I would say that if tether was pulling its bomb time. We will see another major problem may come for tether as soon as possible.",

      "body": "Tether is different story though, I mean they have been in the scope of many regulators and still up to this day they were able to stand up against those accusations, maybe they are cooperating more than ever but still they can't be shutdown.Tornado Cash case is decentralized as opposed to Tether centralized setup. And that is why they are going all in on Tornado Cash as it is a mixer per definition. So the authorities see them as somewhat involved in concealing 'criminal flow of money'.Although Tether might encounter another problem if they insists on not to freeze tornado cash addresses.https://tether.to/en/tether-holds-firm-on-decision-not-to-freeze-tornado-cash-addresses-awaits-law-enforcement-instruction/",

Tornado cash is just a mixer which means only people that send there assets on regulated exchange will be affected and the rest will sit freely in there wallet except for those huge transaction which is shady imho. This news will just make the recovery slower compared than we experienced last week.",

They have been accused of running a fractional reserved, so if somehow they have been de-pegged then we will have to see then. Nevertheless they are going to see what the regulators wanted them do. They explicitly says they will wait for US law enforcement agency request before they will make a move. So it's not like that they are supporting Tornado Cash pe se, or turning their backs on the regulators, they just wanted a formal request before they freeze ETH addresses.",
