      "body": "Hey, I think it isn't a good option to trade with someone that you don't know that too paying upfront. I know trusted users are worth it but what if you can do it with an app?Binance is your solution for this. All you need to do is sign up, verify your account and sell your Cash App balance for Bitcoin using Binance P2P. You will get good rates and you won't need to pay upfront, and even if you do, Binance will make sure that you have a safe trade.",
