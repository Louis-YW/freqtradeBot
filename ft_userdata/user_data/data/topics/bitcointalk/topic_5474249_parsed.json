But we also can't help them as per our governments we are completely attached to our governments and still we don't go their and can't have any possible opportunities' to help them in their difficult situation they are facing now. But we can only make the media alive and we can also raise voice for them through the social media and make all the World to speak against this matter and find a way to get rid of the cruel ones.",

I'm not in support of war no matter where the fault is coming from. Humans don't deserve war, it is only people are tired of life that will prefer to go for war.",

A situation, where someone is deprived of their land, and then over time tortured and killed, and then killing them for fun, making tiktok videos, is it a war situation. I thought in a war, both the sides fight but here only one side is killing and the other side is getting killed.",

It always two sides of a story but often when you have emotion in it, you only look at one side of the coin.Hamas is a terrorist organization and all the economic contribution they get from the world if they used that money to buy food for example for their people instead of bombs it would be much better but they don't want that.But now they won't get any more money and people have stop support them and I am so happy for that, they have to to what the rest of the world does take care of themselves! Now with YouTube and alternative media and everything lie's don't work anymore. Everyone can see what happens with their own eyes. I hope Hamas get defeated so the good powers in Palestine get in control of the country and yes I pray for peace but Hamas don't want peace they want death and war. And I don't take any side here, fuck both sides. I am all for peace, we living in 2024 not 1935 but some parts of middle east seems to be 100 years behind the rest of the world. It's sad, so sad. Because middle east is such an amazing area and have amazing food and good people, but sadly the evil is in power over there.Let's pray for peace all over the world. This is not how the world should look like with war, we have evolved and moved away from such shit many years ago.This is my personal opinions so I hope nobody get angry or sad because I share them since it's a sensitive subject.",

Weather Muslim or not no body or citizens is meant to die when is not appropriate time on earth, avoiding things that leads to this kind of death is most important at all time, because this does not only have onesided sorrow but in all aspects be it economy and social well being of society or citizens many effects are to be witnessed, because all these release of carbondioxide and other substance courses many sickness and effect on life both plant and animals, it's pethentic for a situation like these to keep occuring.
