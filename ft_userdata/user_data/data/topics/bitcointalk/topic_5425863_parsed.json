I did check but did not find any, so I had to bring it up.  It is not enough having ideas, communicating them in a manner the reader will understand and comprehend can be a bit challenging. A script to autocorrect and making word suggestion will not only make conveying ideas easier, it will also improve the vocabularies of Bitcoin talkers. I know there are many websites that can improve one's writing and communication skills that I don't dispute, but learning can be done anywhere and with the increase in users improved communication can make the forum more outstanding.",

You can then go back to that word and make necessary changes. I don't see theymos introducing some type of scripts or software to autocorrect people. You, the person is supposed to make the final decision of what gets posted and not a machine. You can also use Grammarly to your advantage if you want to.",

Grammarly and such type of tools can help. You need to type there and once you are happy with the text then paste and post. Browser extensions are useful as free tools. Just install one of the extension it will do it's job. I think browser itself has an option of auto-correct words or at-least it suggest when something is wrong.",

The most you can to do is to have your device set to use the vocabulary of a particular nations dictionary to serve as default language. While typing, you'll continue to get pop-ups and that could help on the sideline other than having it directly on the site.Also, having an autocorrect on the site could present some issues in the local boards aa native languages have no dictionary to it and by auto correcting, it changes the idea behind local board posting.Quote from: LoyceV on December 05, 2022, 04:22:45 PMProofreading helps a lot too: Preview your post and read it again before you submit it.The most the forum has done to ensure you submit what is of intent is the preview.

It is free, we only need to install it in our browser. But I suggest not using this forever, just making it as an additional tool to help us in writing during we are learning. Then, we mustn't rely on it again if we think we already have enough skills or knowledge in writing English. Anyway, this tool won't increase the post quality, it only helps us to have correct writing procedures.",

That's all really. Plus, I'd wager that most users have a dictionary on their system that can auto correct for them. All the most popular browsers ship with it by default.",
