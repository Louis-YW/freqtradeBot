And always thought that maybe I would lose everything if I went to trading.  But one day I dared to trade and my first training coin was Bitcoin. Although I made some profit while trading, later on I faced a lot of loss. I have now developed trading experience considering profit and loss. Don't be afraid to trade now.",
