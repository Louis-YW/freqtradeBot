Second, be patient; when in this kind of situation, you need patience. Then always try to follow up.",

It's not restricted to making a withdrawal even without placing any bets. But as you also agree, when someone makes a deposit and withdraws without placing a bet, it triggers AML. As you may already know, the website has an in-build exchanger, and it's easy for players to make a deposit, exchange it for another currency and then request a withdrawal, which is obviously suspicious. In this case, if casinos ask for KYC verification, it's obvious why they asked for KYC verification. Thanks, bobstone, for the answer and explanation. Now, wait for OP if he has something to add regarding this.",
