  "content": "Good day to all the community here in this forum, Do you want to know why cryptocurrencies are good for long-term investment? Why is it okay to invest in the long-term and what are the strategies and criteria to choose cryptos that we can invest in?What is long term investment?QuoteGenerally, long-term investment is a form of trading strategy that seeks to profit by holding an asset for more than three years. Standard long-term investment occurs when company X holds a significant investment of company Y without having a majority of voting shares. The purchase price is considered a balance sheet item, while the short-term investment stocks are related to the company’s profit/loss. The sale of long-term investment would ordinarily be classified as other comprehensive income, not related to direct profit/loss. 5 steps for investing in cryptocurrencyQuote1. Understand what you’re investing in.2. Remember, the past is past3. Watch that volatility4. Manage your risk5. Don’t invest more than you can afford to loseReference: https://learn.bybit.com/investing/guide-to-long-term-crypto-investment/Reference: https://www.bankrate.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency-beginners-guide/Benifits of the Long-termMy additional thoughts Why is long-term investing good?* Less Risky - Because you have only invested in the market for the long term, You just term or hold, there's nothing to get rid of and you can't opportunities will miss out on the market because they have invested, it's just you The others are in and out of crypto, so of course, if you are outside of crypto, you will miss the other opportunities here.* More economical - Of course, if you often trade in cryptocurrency, you will spend a lot here, such as trading fees, credit card fees, and so on. If you're just in prison, you don't care about such things.* Less stress - A lot of people invest in crypto but they are always stressed or too emotional about what is happening in cryptocurrency. Like when the value suddenly increases, it's very fun, but when the price suddenly falls or drops in the market, it's very sad and sometimes even depressed, which is a normal reaction and there's nothing wrong with it, but of course, it's also difficult you always feel that you might get sick, so to reduce stress, you should make a long-term investment, like buy and forget or buy and hold or maybe after you buy you will not have any attachment to the cryptocurrency that you will buy, no first you have to check or you should check there only once, or when you have your target you just sell there, it's that simple.* Easy - So, because it's less stressful, this kind of investing is easier, you don't need to be an expert or a good trader. You know how to analyze, signals, charts, and more. That's why you don't need those because you will only invest once, or if you always do something simple and that is just buying buy.* Compound Return - So if you are a long-term investor, your crypto money will also grow more if you do this method over time, especially if you stake in platforms that give you a return every week or month, or year, it seems that your crypto is increasing passively.These are just a few of the reasons why it is good to invest in crypto when it comes to the long term. Because historically speaking, it is also good to appreciate the value of cryptocurrency like what happened with Bitcoin.And another thing that can be done if you do long-term investment here is that if you have extra money, you can also do the DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) style method, this is investing in crypto every week every two weeks depending on you because the purpose is only This means that your cryptocurrency investment should be consistent so that you can increase your holdings of crypto and at the same time you can avoid the volatility of the market. Many well-known investors do this.Crypto Criteria for Long-Term Investing1. Utility - The crypto you buy must be useful, what is it? What does that do? Is there a problem? Or what is it possible to do in the future?2. Technology - Since crypto seems to be our future currency or otherwise it will still have a big part in our future. So we should get what before we get the crypto technology that we choose for the long term. Do you think that crypto technology can help, or will it be adopted by countries or people, or businesses?3. Market Share - It's also important that the cryptocurrency we buy is in the top market, for example in the top 20 altcoins like that. Like many investors, it is popular and many institutions, companies, and or well-known personalities invested here.Although in the stock market it is the same, usually those at the top of those good stocks or blue chip companies are good for long-term investing.4. News and Updates - It's also important to know what's going on with the crypto we are going to buy, are there any updates? Upgrades? What do devs or teams do? Are the cryptos so beautiful, such things? What are the perceptions of the market or the people in that crypto, is it okay for them to use it, and do they have no issues, problems, cases, or red flags?5. Developer and Team - Although it is also a great idea to know who is the person who maintains its team or devs. Although many cryptos are anonymous developers or teams. But if we can get to know it better then.So, these are just a few of my criteria when it comes to long-term investing based on my views and opinions, if you have added a cape to the expansion of our knowledge here in cryptocurrency you are free to give by answering this topic.Good day to everyone.",

Meaning, it’s not like general market (share and stocks) where you can see fortune five hundred companies working day and night on a product or services and thus making us realise whether it is going in the right direction or is it going in the wrong one. Based on that assumption we can actually make decision on long term investing or short term. For the volatile market along with the fact that we don’t even know who is behind the project or who is running the finances it’s always a risk for long term investment.",

The volatility will make them very cautious of the market especially when the bull run reaches its peak, they all wanna get out. For short-term investors, I think they get out, leave the market and wait for the prices to start claiming again.For long-term investors, leave crypto and DCAing or buy the coins and tokens that they think had bottomed because they accumulate more of it. The investors of ETH and BTC who bought at a price of less than $5, may have more in thier holdings after every cycle.",

Take the example of ripple, it is almost like stagnant after a long while and gaining little that will see it slightly over $1.

As for the additional thoughts, I wouldn't call long-term investment 'not risky', as there's a big risk if it's an altcoin that can just crash and never come back, but considerable risk with Bitcoin as well because nothing ensure that there won't be one bear market from which it never recovers. And then on compound return, staking cryptos on a centralized platform involves a big risk which was demonstrated well by FTX. Maybe those small interest rates aren't worth it.And overall, I'd just stick to Bitcoin to minimise the risk.",

The prices move from time to time and that includes both upward and downward direction. Long term investments might save an investor from a higher degree of worry because if you are in short term investment, you'd be more attended with every pump and dump unlikely with long term investors which are setting timeframe of when to enter or exit. But as mentioned, risks are still there. Long term investments are also prone to huge losses because you won't be pulling out your asset on a small dump, problem is there are times red marks are becoming long and continuous, so be cautious of it if you are planning to engage with long term investment.",

The thing with crypto though is that it's cyclical, meaning that every 4 years we might see a good returns on our investments.And long term? it could be defined as 1 year or 4 year or 10 year hold, so it's really up to the individuals on how he/she will look at what long term investment mean.For the criteria for altcoins, it's going to be difficult as we can see even one of the biggest FTC collapses.",

Long term holding gives an outlook of being on the safer side, yet there's risk as mentioned. The market is completely unpredictable, which could drag the market bullish or bearish in no time. So, if we've invested at the peak then sure this is going to be high risk even at the bullish market. Based on how we react to market changes the goodness of the market can be experienced.",
