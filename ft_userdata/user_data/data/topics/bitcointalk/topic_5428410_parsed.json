  "content": "So with everything going on with CEX i am thinking of finally trying out DEX. I am not new to crypto but I am very confused how all these Defi work exactly. So i have a few questions.1) I need to use Metamask? Any way to use it with cold storage?2) I looked at Defi volumes. It says Uniswap is largest with >1B in volume and then Curve. But then I looked at dydx and it also has > 1B in trading volume. However it’s not ranked as #1 or #2. So what is the difference between dydx and uniswap?3) If you trade a lot, what can you do to reduce gas fees? I heard that dydx is gas less because it’s layer2. Is uniswap also gasless? Instead of using ETH network can I use Solana, BSC, or some other chain for lower fees?4) Why can’t I use MyEtherWallet instead of Metamask? As I understand you transfer from Metamask to dydx, if so why can’t I transfer from MEW to dydx instead of using Metamask?Thanks for all your help.",

Any way to use it with cold storage?You always need a connect your wallet online to interact with any Defi protocol.Quote from: adaseb on December 14, 2022, 02:57:19 AM2) I looked at Defi volumes. It says Uniswap is largest with >1B in volume and then Curve. But then I looked at dydx and it also has > 1B in trading volume. However it’s not ranked as #1 or #2. So what is the difference between dydx and uniswap?On coinmarketcap's dex page, dydx is listed as no. 2 with volumes slightly lower than uniswap. However, we dont have much data on coingecko.Quote from: adaseb on December 14, 2022, 02:57:19 AM3) If you trade a lot, what can you do to reduce gas fees? I heard that dydx is gas less because it’s layer2. Is uniswap also gasless? Instead of using ETH network can I use Solana, BSC, or some other chain for lower fees?You cant do much about gas fees, just avoid buying/selling your coin when the network is highly congested. Check for live gas fee for swapping on various dexes on etherscan gastracker. Dydx being layer2 has advantage of no gas fee (good for the perp traders). However, uniswap is not gasless. You can use other networks if the dex supports them. For eg. use pancakeswap for bsc based coins.Quote from: adaseb on December 14, 2022, 02:57:19 AM4) Why can’t I use MyEtherWallet instead of Metamask? As I understand you transfer from Metamask to dydx, if so why can’t I transfer from MEW to dydx instead of using Metamask?Currently, dydx supports MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Ledger, Trezor, Wallet Connect, imToken. MEW is not recommended.Source: https://help.dydx.exchange/en/articles/3076178-which-wallets-are-supported",

      "body": "1. You can send tokens to cold storage once you have them but I don't think you can interact with these sites while having your funds in cold storage. You can use hardware though too and that's normally advisable (I don't think you're able to use multisig either).2. One thing I can think of is that dYdX has leverage while uniswap doesn't which could be one thing changing the volumes (ie one quoting actual values on spot and one quoting volumes on leverage).3. You can use side chains for lower fees if the token is on there and what you want to do is on there. You can save on trades too but you don't save much. Dydx also used to pay your loading fee when I last used them you aren't holding your funds if they're stored in Dydx, I don't know how they're stored but if you're putting a lot in there I suggest you try to find out. 4. You probably can, from what was mentioned in the above response dydx is compatible with wallet connect which should be compatible with mew (just from a quick search).",

Is there any way I can check the spreads and order books for Uniswap?Looking at etherscan gas fees currently it’s like $3 for a trade. So this is good if you are trading mid/large amounts however if you want to trade small then the gas fees will add up. So why doesn’t uniswap do what dydx does where it uses layer2 and make it gasless? With the trading fees, spreads, the gas fees will add up if you are trying to day trade.",

Is there any way I can check the spreads and order books for Uniswap?No, you can't. Uniswap is an automated liquidity protocol / market maker. Pricing is automatic, based on the x∗y=k market making formula which automatically adjusts prices based off the relative sizes of the two reserves (ETH and the associated ERC-20 token) and the size of the incoming trade. Unlike uniswap, dydx doesnt make use of automated market maker (AMM). Instead, the platform utilizes a traditional orderbook + matching model to meet your requirements.Quote from: adaseb on December 14, 2022, 05:18:33 AMSo why doesn’t uniswap do what dydx does where it uses layer2 and make it gasless?There is a successfull proposal made for this already since october 2022. Not sure they've depolyed already on zksync or maybe very close (not following them too much).",

I am confused about this part.Dydx is a non-custodial exchange, hence here your keys are your only 2fa or whatever. If you connect it through public computers, they can have access to your keys and withdraw funds from your metamask wallet (not dydx, since dydx is not a wallet, its a third party dapp interacting with your wallet). So always use a safe laptop/phone while importing your keys and you should be fine.Btw, you shouldnt use public computers for centralized exchanges as well (even if 2fa is enabled). Defi or non-defi everything can be hacked if you are not serious enough with your own actions.",

So you might want to change your node provider if you have some issues with that. It is a bit tricky since most node providers are usually paid ones, or need some registration to use. You might want to use a different wallet entirely to connect with an exchange (like a direct connection to your HW probably).AFAIK, if you connect your HW with MetaMask then you'll need to connect your HW again to approve transactions so if a hacker has access to your PC but not HW, the funds would still be safe. However, that's certainly not the best scenario and they can use other means to attack you such as deploying a scammy smart contract where you just need one approval and they can move your tokens anytime. There have been many cases like this so you should be more careful when you connect to some exchange, make sure it is not a phishing site. CMIIW.",

      "body": "Cryptops is a new DEX that was designed to be easy for new users who want to trade crypto option derivatives on blockchain. In short Cryptops is a direct access layer 1 blockchain with an on-chain order book that uses layer 2 components to provide a verifiable crypto options derivatives market. The trades close on average in 3 seconds and is able to handle 1000+ transactions per second. For improved security there are no browser wallet plugins, smart contracts or protocols that have a history of being hacked and losing millions. Just straight forward direct access to the assets/tokens that reference the on blockchain option derivatives.Cryptops is an open publicly available blockchain that anyone can use to create their own option derivatives market for any crypto currency they desire. Cryptops will be creating an options derivatives side chain for BTC at the launch of the blockchain. I am willing to help anyone interested in launching an option derivatives market for any crypto of their choice, just send me a message. Some advantages Cryptops has to offer include:1) You are able to generate a secure account on an air gapped computer then download the CryptopsTerm wallet/trade app and trade without your keys ever needing to leave your premises. 2) You can run your own Cryptops node with the CryptopsTerm wallet/trade app and get 0 ms access time to the on blockchain order book, again with your keys ever never needing to leaving your premises.3) Cryptops has the best most secure staking rewards model and staking is possible without needing to run a node or anything like that. In Cryptops you can earn staking rewards on coins that are held in a cold storage wallet that was created on an air gapped computer. The rewards are automatically paid out weekly to your configured hot wallet address using a built-in blockchain mechanism.The testnet BTC option derivatives can be viewed using the CryptopsTerm at https://cryptops.exchange/CryptopsTerm/#testnet by clicking \"Markets\" then \"Monthly BTC Calls\" or \"Monthly BTC Puts\".Self custody account keys for the testnet can be generated using the Cryptops Laboratory at https://laboratory.cryptops.exchange/#account-creator?network=test then funded using the friendbot on the same page.  Wallets in Cryptops are not considered valid until they have been funded.If anyone thinks this project has potential and would like to take part at an early stage to help launch the project just send me a message. Current plans are to launch the BTC option derivatives market on the public Cryptops blockchain early next year.",

I don't use ETH that much, so it is not a problem for me. If you have an HW wallet, you can connect it with MEW or MyCrypto if you really need it. You can also change your RPC to other services (after you register, or use a free one, etc) if you want to use MetaMask. Alternatively, you can just continue using it if you don't mind your IP being collected, or you use a VPN and you don't use DEX that much. Using DeFi (most of them at least) nowadays is more or less equal to giving at least some personal info to the platform that you use, so that's that.

Using AMMs to earn means locking in your assets on that network, and the protocols of DEXs like Uniswap (which, if I understand will no longer be open source).The illusion of non-custodial might lead you to think it's safe, but there are other vulnerabilities like front-running or simply backdoor protocols that can steal your funds anyway from pools (and it's all happened before).I think it's fairly safe to use open source orderbook DEXs on Bitcoin -- but because it's not popular I also wouldn't consider it battle-tested, therefore, not safe enough.",
