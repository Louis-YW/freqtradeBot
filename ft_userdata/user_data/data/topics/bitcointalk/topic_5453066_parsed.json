Are we expecting any more major crashes or should the markets start steadily rising in a few months or so or will that not happen till the end of 2023? Nothing big to expect and 2023 will be like 2019 but there is bigger risk that the world has many more serious things economically and politically since pandemic Covid-19. More serious conditions than in 2019 and maybe something will suddenly trigger massive panic on the market from traditional to cryptocurrency exclusively Bitcoin market.If any big shake, crash happens, I consider it is a market clean-up against weak-handed investors, gamblers who try to be rich with leverages. If you are not such people, you will not be impacted.With what happened with FTX exchange and what's going on recently with banks, you should store your bitcoin in non custodial wallets. Then you will surely have chance to enjoy 2024 halving and a bull run after.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

Onset isn’t far from what you’re saying. Taking last halving as a case study the market raised significantly towards the end of the year 2020, it went to 20k in December that year which is also bullish but it was in 2021 that it raised above the 60k mark. It first tested 60k in march 2021 which was almost a year after halving before going down a little bit again. The ATH of 69k was till November that year before it got there. So basically the year of the halving is not that bullish compared to the year that comes after it. As for this year 2023 the bitcoin will be in between the bearish and little bullish period mainly due to the hype of the halving but we would surely see another bear period of the price coming down to say 20k again but that also is dependent on some of the economic factors surrounding it.",

Are we expecting any more major crashes or should the markets start steadily rising in a few months or so or will that not happen till the end of 2023? We can only make speculations about what will happen next but there's no surety about it so if you are having too much expectations from it then it might not work that way.See we have seen halving periods and price boost afterwards because the mining rewards will be halfed to 3.125BTC and the adoption rates show the demand graphs are going upwards so it could be price boost.But your patience level are tested and many are having different speculations but for me holding is the best option till long term and that gives return to us but at the current rates say we are near $27k so it would definitely go to $40k if not have too much expectations.But till that period we can see lot of dips and FUD also but you should stay strong.",

Are we expecting any more major crashes or should the markets start steadily rising in a few months or so or will that not happen till the end of 2023? Personally, I expect the halving to be a logical continuation of this:History is just a series of loops, right ?   .. I hope that once again, 6 months-1 year after the halving we will see a rise in price.Otherwise, from a more realistic point of view, I basically expect the block reward to be halved and therefore my mining income to drop.This is precisely why I am hoping for a small rise in the price, to compensate at least a little for this drop in income..",

Like you said you have been expecting your first bull run, that is what it is for more people. For hodlers who are interested to increase what they have I believe they are all saving up and hodling for the next months to come. The price has been dropping and now trading at $26k while the ATH is $64k, so if you can catch the difference of $64k - $26k which is $38k. That can stand as an investor's profit by the time price reach the ATH and that is a good investment if the risk is taken by this time. And if the price drops more from what it is currently selling on now, that is more profit. Investing now and hodling for the next bull run through DCA is definitely going to profit someone that takes the chance.",

Then in Bear Run, it has been an attitude of everyone questioning why we are going through this. It is important to remember that if something goes up it will go down. This is a cycle that can be related to everything. One unique thing that disregards everything about the Bitcoin bull and the bear cycle is a limited supply. That is one of the biggest features of Bitcoin according to me. That is why everyone should become a diamond hand and wait for the era of Bitcoin.

Are we expecting any more major crashes or should the markets start steadily rising in a few months or so or will that not happen till the end of 2023? For people like myself that have experience more than one halving date, I'm not as excited as you might be. It's nothing new to us. You can't get any prediction accurately as so many things could happen before and after the halving date. Based on passed experience, Bitcoin price would likely rise close to the halving date and dumped after. In the market, people buy the rumors and sell the news and immediately bitcoin halving has been completed, the whole buzz will die down and people will start taking profits which will make the price to start decreasing.Anything can happen in the market so don't put your hopes all up or go to borrow money to invest in Bitcoin in anticipation of the hype (rise of Bitcoin price) to the halving date as that too might never happen. There's only one thing that you can be assured of happening in the market which is the price volatility and if you're a trader you can sue that to your advantage. The best preparation you can make for yourself against the next bull market is to continuously DCA into buying Bitcoin and hold.",

We should be anticipating the bull run, but counting down the months is a bad idea since the bull run might not begin when we anticipate it, which could produce irritation because our expectations were not met on time.So the best advice is to be patient and hold Bitcoin until it.infact timing bull run can even lead to selling our Bitcoin, if it does not happened by the time we may time for it because some people may be thinking maybe it wouldn't happen again especially newbies.

Many people have been saying that we should expect little bearish that the bear market is not yet over, but I can't really say because markets are primarily determined by investors due to the back economy and some factors, like what happened recently like collapse of exchange and run always with people's funds so this kind things due create fear in the cryptocurrency industry and lead to the withdrawal of funds in the Bitcoin investment and also stop other investors for coming in the cryptocurrency industry.",

A halving does not guarantee a bullrun that same year and historically a bullrun does not happen that same year. • 2016 halving - 2017 bullrun.• 2020 halving - 2021 bullrun.We would be looking towards early 2025 for the next solid rally, except if we have a change in how the Bitcoin cycle works which would not be a surprise.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on May 17, 2023, 11:09:45 AMAre we expecting any more major crashes or should the markets start steadily rising in a few months or so or will that not happen till the end of 2023?
