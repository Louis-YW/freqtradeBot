Hong Kong's autonomy is limited. They're controlled and operated by China with a marginal amount of additional freedoms that mainland Chinese citizens don't enjoy.https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-says-full-control-over-hong-kong-achieved-determined-taiwan-2022-10-16/Xi Jinping considers Hong Kong to be part of China.

A couple years ago, China would ship in law enforcement to take over the region and it has pretty much been under their control since.Yesterday, I followed the results of the decisions of the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of China, which stipulate in its most important articles that Taiwan is a Chinese province and the expansion of the influence of the Chinese president within the party, who is considered the largest adherent to the island of Taiwan as part of the Chinese People's Republic.This is no alarm bell for Taiwan, as it can still enjoy autonomy without coming out from under the Chinese cover, as the anti-Chinese countries (mainly America and its allies) seek. On this basis, the adoption of cryptocurrencies may not represent a big problem for China as much as it will represent for Taiwan, which may be looking for new customers with new ingredients in an attempt to get rid of the influence of its traditional partners.",

These initiatives are no doubt a welcomed development in the crypto space but they are just proposals or bills. These bills have to go through a lot of legislative processes. And sometimes the bill initiators have to do a lot of lobbying for these bills to see the light of day.Â Politically Hong Kong is going through a lot of intimidation by mainland China. But Joe Biden's acceptance that the US and its Allies would send troops to defend Hong Kong if China invades would always be a deterrent to the preparing invader. It might put Hong Kong in a better position than Ukraine.",

Hong Kong's autonomy is limited somhow and it relects the central government's will and influence in many ways. The statement here is a positive expression. Hong Kong is truly part of China and only the infusion of mainland China will bring Hong Kong's economy to life. Nothing is gonna stop this. Time has changed.",
