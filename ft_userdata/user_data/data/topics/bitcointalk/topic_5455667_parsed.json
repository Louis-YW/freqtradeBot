      "body": "I'm not supporting anyone on this issue; both the SEC and Binance CEO are not completely clean; they all have what's going on for them under the ground. In as much as the SEC is claiming to be protecting their investors interests by deciding for them on what's safe and what's not safe, I always see a personal interest and attack over their past and present cases with crypto exchanges.Binance and Coinbase, on the other hand, have helped the crypto community by promoting and making things a little bit easier for people who need it closer to them and easier to assess, but they are here to do business, and their sole aim is to make profit, and for them to make this profit, they all have their fvcking hands dirty in doing the wrong thing, which we might never have any idea of, so what's what? They know how to handle themselves, the SEC says what they are selling to their citizens is not safe, then it's left for Binance to either agree or they let the citizens who they are protecting decide. Then, on the part of being unregistered, if it's actually true that they are operating some service unregistered under the US then the SEC has the right to sue them.Whoever wins the case, it does not really matter much to Bitcoin and other crypto. I'm general BNB, and any coin associated with Binance might be affected... But bitcoin transactions will still continue.",

      "body": "I honestly don't trust anyone and don't side with anyone in this matter. But because I have an interest in crypto and well I'm always quite annoyed when someone always complicates everything about crypto.But for this one case I would prefer to be neutral and watch what will happen next. and let's see how it ends.Previously was about XRP vs SEC and Now CZ vs SEC. now Sec is suing Binance US and Coinbase. But there is a difference here. because Binance US was sued along with its owner, namely CZ. but Coinbase was sued without a lawsuit against the owner. (that's what i heard. correct me if i got wrong information. and tell me the truth.)And as CZ Binance.com said stay safe. because the one sued was only Binance US. So I thought it wouldn't be too big a problem. Sourch: https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1666202238933426178?s=20The SEC certainly wants to protect people and uncover anomalies and all kinds of potential violations they suspect. And CZ here had to prove his innocence in this matter.But there's something interesting here because CZ retweeted something that made me think back. is what CZ retweeted true? if that's true then it's a pretty painful sting from CZ to SEC. Sourch: https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1666243210849427456?s=20I think it's going to be a long legal process back in the way that happened in the SEC vs Ripple case.",

However, Binance has been truly helpful in brining crypto-currencies to everyone and has really been helpful in that endeavor. I have been using that exchange myself and so far my experience with them has been good. I'm also a supporter of decentralization and decentralized exchanges but they are far backward in this advanced technological world. The decentralized exchanges aren't that good in their current state and I find trading on those not innovative at all. That's the main reason why I chose Binance and other centralized exchanges for trading purpose.I think if Sec is taking such strong actions on Binance then they might have some proof regarding that and that's why I won't blame them either for their actions. If they are right about the fishy activates of Binance then they have the right to test everything in the system and might have some strong regulatory rules on the way. However, I still can't find 100% accurate allegations that should make Binance guilty for their actions but it seems to me as a new tactic for posing regulations on the exchanges.",

I personally respect the SEC but somehow I don't really like their current chairman.But because this is about who is right and who is wrong. so let the law and the judge in court settle it. I don't want to bother about this.Because it seems that Binance users are not too panicked about this either. even BINANCE.US users can still withdraw their assets seamlessly from the exchange.

Because even though Binance, which was founded by CZ, is very useful for investors in crypto, if CZ does have problems with the SEC with the current problems. So it has to be fixed, because if it's not fixed as soon as possible, I'm afraid it will have a negative impact on the crypto world. Because if CZ is innocent, surely he will be safe, but if CZ really has a problem, as mentioned by the SEC, CZ must be able to bear and fix it as soon as possible.The SEC also accuses binance, definitely not with empty arguments. If the SEC is right, they must have solid evidence that CZ was always the founder of binance. Because so far CZ has been indictedQuote\"Through the 13 indictments, we allege that the Zhao and Binance entities engaged in an extensive web of fraud, conflict of interest, underdisclosure, and calculated evasion of law,\" said SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.Source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnnindonesia.com/economy/20230606131659-92-958235/binance-diclaim-sec-as-atas-tuduhan-transaksi-illegal/ampSo in this case, even though I am an investor in crypto, I cannot side with CZ or SEC. Because the SEC is also not necessarily right with all of these accusations, so the point is that this incident only made trouble for the crypto world.",

But why support when you know they're after them personal needs. United States Exchange Commission wants full control. And exchnages, you shouldn't give your trust, they try to earn yours but you don't give yours. I feel like the Sec are blind, all they want is control and power meanwhile they're indirectly taking the states back when it comes to the innovations.The Sec and the government are fighting Bitcoin and the mass adoption of Bitcoin, it'll be super odd to see a bitcoiner giving support to either of them.My take is don't take sides, rather look at the whole case, observe and take sides with whoever stands with the growth and push of Bitcoin. It's a good time to see bitcoin bounce upwards you know. Why support and back a side that doesn't support Bitcoin and Mass adoption?",

They have invested so much in publicity which includes advertising and endorsement. Binance has also made crypto transactions easy for newbies and people that don't care about privacy. The SEC is claiming that it wants to avoid the FTX saga from resurfacing so they have to protect the US crypto market from losses. I am sure Binance is not clean because it has some secrets it is hiding from the government and its customers. The SEC's target is not just to protect Binance customers but to control the crypto industry entirely. I am a hardcore Bitcoiner and have no sympathy for both parties. Also, I don't know the details of this battle, so taking a side will be leaping without watching.
