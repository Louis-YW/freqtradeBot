I have the Spanish one at least but would love to find an English one so I can read it loledit: one sold for 20.4 BTC at an auction in 2015this one was also signed by quite a few early BitcoinersQuoteThe reason the comic is so special is that FinTech Compliance Executive, Juan Llanos, got the book signed by 105 Bitcoin movers and shakers from 10 different countries worldwide. The signatures include Jeff Garzik, Roger Ver, Vitalik Buterin, Andreas Antonopoulos, and many more making it truly one of a kind item.",
