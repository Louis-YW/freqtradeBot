While I've crossed out the other two, they're not recommended for someone who's going to hold their Bitcoins for long with their wallets. Coinbase is an exchange and although it has also other function but mainly for trading and as for Blockchain.com wallet which I assume you are suggesting, it's not recommended at all as you hold no private key upon creation of wallet there. Electrum is nice and one of the most recommended wallets for keeping your Bitcoin. But again, about keeping your Bitcoins and safe with those crossed out ones, better not to use them for keeping.",

Don't ever consider custodial wallets as recommended wallet app to use as you don't have total control of your coins. The OP however, can update his recommended list and if possible include some useful links. He can also add other sites like kucoin, coinbase, huobi and other top exchange sites.Be very careful though in adding links, just official ones. Because one can easily mistake phishing link to official ones.",

Also any wallets that are closed sourced should be avoided at any cost. Try open source wallets that are available.

But anyway, he can just clear those wallets and choose the other ones that have a real function for being a noncustodial wallet. Reading the replies of the other members will give OP the idea why it's recommended to have these wallets.

There are some that are not recommended but there are some that are recommended and safe to use, but the total safety depends on the wallet user and the type of wallet used. Cold wallets and multisig wallet are the safest wallets.As for the recovery phrase, you can use passphrase with it and do not backup both together. I mean the seed phrase and passphrase.

It will help to keep you in check so that you stay consistent and not miss a fortnight. I do it manually and use it often.",
