Or if it's for study purposes I think you can solo mine on Testnet but not for the Mainnet. Also, check the USB stick miner Compac F which is usually used for study/experiments and solo lottery mining.",

Any other advice for a very simple solo pool open source code that can be used? Something quick and easy with very little need to be modded ?",

Tried Yiimp,Nomp . Nothing seems to work with ubuntu updates. It's like people stopped developing for Bitcoin pools. If they do develop they hide their code or close source it. Getting so frustrated. Wish i could just cgminer directly to my Bitcoin core and solo.",
