The government's transaction was for 9,861 Bitcoin, sold for a total $215,738,155.'There remains approximately 41,490.72 BTC, which the Government understands is expected to be liquidated in four more batches over the course of this calendar year,' Felton wrote in a sentencing memo for Zhong filed on March 31.Hmm, could it be that this has something to do with Bitcoin struggling to keep above the $30k?All this I've read today. These are all speculations. There are certainly many more of them trying to explain why the price of Bitcoin is going down. Well, for all we know, Bitcoin's price is always rising and falling. Notwithstanding all of this, however, I advice that if you have the money, use a portion of it to buy now. People were bearish when Bitcoin's price climbed all the way to $30,000. People then turned bullish, and the price fell to $28,000. Nobody can make accurate predictions. Start averaging now.",

The supply of the coins are fixed and hence when the demand of the coin increases, in order to fulfil the demand the price automatically goes up. This price decrease is just a little correction. So yes, we have to accumulate as many Bitcoins as we can. Bitcoins will definitely break the all time high price this year, so yes without wasting time, we have to think wisely and invest appropriately.",

You are a perfect example of an terribly researched person who knows very little, and yet thinks they know very much to the point where they think they can give people advice and almost tell them what to do. It's entertaining to the knowing eye...it's sad for those who are actually following your words. Quote from: crypticj on April 20, 2023, 02:38:19 AMAs I explained in my last posts, this Bitcoin rise wasn't sustainable. There are literally no reasons for Bitcoin to go up now.It was very sustainable. Some reasons for the growth:- FTX and LUNA collapse during 2022 caused artificial devaluation of the cryptocurrency market- FTX recovering $7.3billion worth of assets (that were probably liquidated and are now ready in fiat) will probably be reinjected into the market- The collapse of large banking institutions and the following further devaluation of the U.S. dollar via stimulus and liquidity injections to keep banks alive - Relating to the above, people seeing clearly that Bitcoin is a must-have in their portfolio if they want to protect themselves from further USD devaluation. Quote from: crypticj on April 20, 2023, 02:38:19 AMSo I want to remain you guys again that right now is not the time to buy bitcoin.Quote from: crypticj on April 20, 2023, 02:38:19 AMSo I recommend holding on to your cash/stablecoins right now and waiting for the signals to buy Bitcoin.Stop giving people financial advice. You are not a licensed financial adviser and I guarantee that you are probably going to at best end up making a fool out of yourself in the end and at worst make a gullible sop angry at you for providing such confident claims.Quote from: crypticj on April 20, 2023, 02:38:19 AMInflation is still high...Inflation rising is good for Bitcoin, as it devalues USD which makes Bitcoin stronger against it in the mid-long term.Quote from: crypticj on April 20, 2023, 02:38:19 AM...interest rates are still getting higher, FED is not planning to stop any time soon...Increasing interest rates now means more pressure on bank liquidity and therefore more liquidity stimulus from the fed, therefore devaluing USD, therefore higher bitcoin valueQuote from: crypticj on April 20, 2023, 02:38:19 AM...and the economy is suffering.Weakening economies forces people to find alternatives. This is good for Bitcoin in the mid-long term. Also good for gold/silver.Quote from: crypticj on April 20, 2023, 02:38:19 AMBut I believe we will see the end of it this year, probably in Q4. I'll agree with one thing, that this temporary run (which will probably end around 35-50k and return to 30k after its peak) is probably the precursor to a much larger run following. I disagree that Bitcoin will get any cheaper than 20-25k, if it even hits these levels again without unnatural forces.Quote from: crypticj on April 20, 2023, 02:38:19 AMAnd as always, the best signals to look for: FED start cutting rates. When this will happen, it will mean that economy will start recovering soon so it's a great time to buy anything you want before crypto and the stock market will go up.You're talking as if there is a possibility that rates will be cut consistently and that the economy will magically recover. What strong evidence do you have to support this view other than your beliefs? The rates will probably not be significantly cut for a long time. In my (well researched) opinion, this is the start of a long dragged out and painful financial downturn.",

Are you suggesting everyone to start buying when Bitcoin starts to go up? That's not a good indicator though and that's not good investment mindset, rather not maximizing the potential for Bitcoin's profit. See, this is how most of the old members here are trying to highlight the importance of DCA, especially when you're in a huge doubt on when to have a perfect entry point. What you're suggesting would most likely let the investors miss this opportunity to add fractions of Btc while it's still considered affordable.",
