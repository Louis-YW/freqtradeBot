      "body": "Its too late. smart money bough earlier. dumb money is buying now at x10 pump. Whole crypto AI bubble will end up as pump and dump shame. simply to build an AI you need huge database to train it. No one will beat google (or similar companies) at the amount of users data they have. Its not something that can be done as a team of 4 DEVs and 10 mln $ from ICO.Also people seams to forget that its not the first time everyone is excited about AI. We have AI mania fallowed by AI winter for last 50 years - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter. If you are on profit. Take it. If you miss the rally. Limit risks and dont buy now. Risk/reword is not worth to take it at x10-x20 pump.",

      "body": "This is a new hype and the trend, unfortunately i was not able to ride it ahead of time though i know its not too late yet but decided not to get involve, because this can be a pump and dump project which I think I cannot afford to take risk right now. Anyway, Iâ€™m still learning how this technology works and what are their importance in this market especially big companies are also investing with this. If I see a good and worthy project, probably will try to catch up.",
