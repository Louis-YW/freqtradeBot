And in this way, there is a low chance to e a winner as on each bet you are increasing the odds. As a result, the possible loss is higher than being the winner.",

Although, I haven't come up with such idea but I think this can only be applied to dice and not sportbet. Especially football because if you try this method on sportbet,it wouldn't work since settling down for 2.0 odds is the best way one can make profit or win the game on football. Have you given it a try and did it work for you ?",
