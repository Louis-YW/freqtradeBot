Is there any chance of console  being banned for doing this?We do not share games.We log in to the account and buy the game or product using Turkey and countries with cheap local units.The region where your account is registered does not matter.When this is done, there has been no ban risk in the accounts so far, but you can contact Playstation support for this.Daily Bump *",
