This means that the benefits of Shardus technology, such as scalability and customizability, will be inherited by Shardeum to create a more efficient and secure smart contract platform. The Shardeum Litepaper states that holders of Shardus tokens will receive a share of the Shardeum network. Specifically, Shardus token holders will receive 1% of the maximum Shardeum supply. This is the way by which Shardeum licenses the Shardus software and rewards the development of this technology.   Where can you buy Shardus? ULT tokens can be traded on decentralized exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Shardus is Dodo (Polygon). Official litepaper of Shardeum: https://shardeum.org/Shardeum-Litepaper.pdf Official Shardus website: https://shardus.com/",

It says they will launch the betanet demo in February but it's already July but they seem very late to update their website.This makes me think about their sincerity in developing the project. For me, small things like notifications appearing on the home page of the website have an impact on the user experience.",
