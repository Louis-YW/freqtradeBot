Blockchain technology creates a safe, decentralized, and anonymous way for sports bettors to fund and withdrawal from their accounts.Anonymity remains a prized possession in the sports betting industry. Anonymous betting is a trend that won’t go away any time soon. Blockchain tech, especially Bitcoin’s blockchain, makes it capable to remain anonymous while wagering on your favorite team.2. AI oddsmaking and handicappingArena is an artificial intelligence start up that is generating simulations of human behavior. The simulations should help those in the advertising industry better determine where to spend their ad dollars.If Arena’s AI tech can help the ad industry, it for sure could help determine where players are most likely to put their money. If that happens, oddsmakers will have a powerful tool. If we take it further, AI could help players, especially players that bet a lot of money, find optimal wagers based on odds.Without a doubt, there’s a place for AI technology in the sports betting industry. We must all keep an eye on how things develop.3. Esports bettingEsports betting is the fastest segment of sports betting because it’s the fastest growing. It feels like every year there’s an eSports league in development.The more options, the more players become involved. Esports isn’t going anywhere. In some ways, it feels like Esports is on the path to replacing horse racing as the daily sport to bet.Like horse racing, eSports matches take place every day and close to 24 hours a day.

Example like gambling sites enabling their users to use  bitcoin, altcoins and web3,  the creation of browsing phones, smart watch and the virtual reality devices that is helping in gambling, the use of AI and and machine learning in general. Many of which are not prediction but what that is actually happening now.Quote from: Outhue on June 26, 2023, 06:30:59 AMBitcoin is Bitcoin and gambling is gambling, there is no technological advancement here, gambling doesn't add anything beneficial to Bitcoin than gamblers using Bitcoin to gamble on online casinos.Gambling sites make their users to use bitcoin to gamble, but bitcoin was innovated. That is just an advancement. It can be included, but it is what that has been happening, not future prediction. Since bitcoin was created, there have been gambling sites that have supported bitcoin deposit since many years ago. It is modern but not something new again.Quote from: Outhue on June 26, 2023, 06:30:59 AMIf you want anonymity, Bitcoin is not the right call for it, look into XMR instead, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency and once you send it to a online gambling platform, you are not in possession anymore, the decentralize is broken then. So how monero is the anonymity coin? Once you send monero to a gambling sites, you are also not in possession of the coin (monero) again, the gambling site will be in possession of the coin. It is true that monero is a privacy coin, but not in this example. Quote from: Outhue on June 26, 2023, 06:30:59 AMFinding optimal wager based odds using the help of AI makes sense but it still won't stop you from losing money, AI is here to make hard works less of a hard work, things will get easier with AI and it's going to be useful for those that are running a casino too, it's not going to be easy to keep paperwork when loads of people keep boarding a new online casino, AI can do the work easier. He used AI for marketing purposes in his posts above.Although some people as gamblers may want to use bots in gambling too. There are way bots are always helpful, but gambling is gambling and it is very risky while the gambling sites have house edge which bots can not break to win overall. Quote from: Outhue on June 26, 2023, 06:30:59 AMIf I am right, Esports are form of competition using video games, like multiplayer where pro players comes together to form a team and go to battle with other team's to win a prize, are you saying you can bet money on a team? If this is what you mean then I haven't seen or heard a lot about this. If you are watching the in-play matches on some betting sites, you will some games that will end before 20 minutes, those are eSports which you can predict who to be the winner. Some will take just 8 minutes if not less. You can also bet on eSports.",

Sure, they can spit out better probability numbers than any human mathematician. But the probability itself will not be influenced or changed, so gamblers will be disappointed because they think they can outsmart the system somehow and make more money from games which are based on pure luck. But if an AI could do that so easily or at all, would we not already be seeing people using AI in gambling? I myself have not heard of an AI used for better gambling results.Same goes for trading. There are trading bots but I doubt the existence of a bot which can predict the future price of the traded asset.",

E-Sports is really getting a lot of popularity since most of the new generation play computer games while e-sports mostly focus on popular games that everyone plays a lot like Dota and CSGO. I think the E-Sports community is almost catching up to most of the sports market since it has a wide range tournament on different games covered.I don’t play much other games aside from Dota2 but I’m surprised to check how vast the active tournament right now on different games when i check on the Liquipedia. E-Sports is really a big deal on sports betting. It’s like online gambling when they are rising its popularity.",

Back in the day the e-sports scene was mainly old starcraft and shooters like quake that offered basic 3d, then it moved to an era of high quality graphics, but this is slowly reaching its limits as players noticed that better graphics makes its sometimes harder to aim, so most of them play on low anyway. I feel like next move will be into immersion, maybe games that react to your eye movement, games that make you see and hear things around you, maybe even feel being shot, make you smell gunpowder... AI is a difficult thing to bet on because we don't know if it won't get banned by people who fear it. It's like Early bitcoin that could get stopped in its early days, but wasn't and now it's too late.",

It will be more on a PVP instead of the current odds that players against casino bankroll since bookmaker will adapt to the current status of betting to still have a profit.We mght see a very low odds on strong teams since only few will bet on weak team unlike the current odds structure which bookmaker is confident that bettors decision will be split because there’s no AI that will give them prediction.",
