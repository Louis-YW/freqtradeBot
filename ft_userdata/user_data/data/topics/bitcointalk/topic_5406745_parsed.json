  "content": "According to Glassnode data shared by crypto analyst Will Clemente, Binance has overtaken Coinbase to rank as the largest exchange with the most BTC held.This narrative seems to be well supported. A recent Glassnode Insights report noted that Coinbase has experienced net outflows of Bitcoin for the past two years, totaling over 450,000 BTC. It states that the Coinbase BTC balance decreased in a consistent 10K to 30K BTC step function and adds that the reduction was caused by the transfer of these coins to new wallets unrelated to the Coinbase entity. Given their size, Glassnode makes the speculative claim that it could serve as custodial solutions for institutions. On the other hand, over the same period, Binance's net balance increased by about 300,000 BTC. As a result, Binance has now flipped Coinbase as the exchange with the largest Bitcoin supply, as highlighted by Will Clemente. In its weekly on-chain newsletter, Glassnode noted that there are many indications that a deep and complete capitulation has taken place as Bitcoin prices have now been trading below the Realized Price for more than a month. Numerous signals, therefore, suggest that the genuine bottom formation could be taking place.Read more on so visit U.Today https://u.today/binance-flips-coinbase-now-has-highest-btc-for-exchanges",

Even with me being quite active in the broader cryptocurrency space, Coinbase sure loves listing unknown crap. I'm actually confident that I'd do a better job at picking coin/token listings that'll actually get trading volume compared to whoever handles Coinbase listings. They're THAT bad.",

It was highly expected though for binance, many people already see them as the best option these days. Now that they have achieved this feat, a new responsibility lies with them to be able to ensure that they can accommodate the many crowd that will be flocking their way.",

They offer interest on btc held there and also make things fairly easy to find too (coinbase is really bad at that). It's really sold as the exchange to quickly deposit->trade->withdraw with and not much else seems to happen there.",

I wonder if Binance is on the same path and if they are close to being shut down.I think this zero fee is temporary. Sooner rather than later Binance will implement fees once again. This zero fee is probably being implemented during this bear season to encourage people to trade and do more activities despite the bear market. Binance has been on the road of being repeatedly kicked out from countries. But as one door closes, another opens. CZ is doing hard work in shilling Binance to countries all over the world.",

You reap what you sow Brian. coinbase is not a 'solo' company. its a subsidiary of the DCG conglomeratearmstrong thinks his role is secure and backed by his sister companies. and the price of business sometimes is downsizing staff to get rid of the time wasters/least talented of the team. those with talent usually are the ones kept on or at very worse if they are cut, they usually find a better job easy(handed a position from a sister company the same day, so its a simple job swap rather than a loss), so they dont hold any harsh resentment much. its the ones cant/wont get a job easy that think their career has ended that get angry. so from a business point of view. those upset are usually the ones with less talent and they are proving it by not just getting on with getting a new job and instead grieving the loss of old job.. so he chose to get rid of the correct peoplebut heres the thing. armstrong aint the boss. he is just the CEO of a baby company of DCG and DCG can chuck him out toohe might have 19% stake in coinbase. but that just makes him a high income share holder. not a leader. yep armstrong can get voted out still",

Coinbase is an American company hence it was greatly preferred by Americans.The more and more strict KYC goes on everywhere.
