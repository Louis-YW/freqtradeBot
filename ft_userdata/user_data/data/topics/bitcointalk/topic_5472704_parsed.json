The only advantage of having swapping feature is that you don't have to take multiple steps before you can have the crypto you desired. You can convert your token other tokes with trading so there's no point to add swapping feature in the exchange especially if you're using Binance with it's new feature \"convert\", you really don't have to pay for the fee.",

The Only issue why still people are sticking to the CEXs is inappropriate information and Network fees.The DEX trading costs far more fees compared to the centralized trading platform. I've seen maximum users preferring their trading activities on the CEXs and risking their funds custody just to save on the fees.OP I have some suggestions for you such types of topics are really not considered Quality contributions, You should put more effort while creating a new topic, such questions can be asked on any relevant thread by mentioning any senior.",

It is a multi-signature wallet with 3 or more keys and one of these keys is for guarantee.What is happening is that some CEX platforms are trying to attract some customers by adding features that do not require KYC or tokens that do not need to be listed, meaning that some CEX platforms are managing a smart contract and allowing others to use it.",

I think it's a pretty interesting development to see centralized exchanges (CEX) incorporating decentralized exchange (DEX) capabilities like swapping. This trend seems to be driven by the growing popularity of DeFi and the desire for users to have more control over their assets. It could potentially offer users the best of both worlds: the liquidity and speed of CEXs and the security and privacy of DEXs. One platform that comes to mind is BitgetSwap. It's a relatively new player in the space, and it's been gaining some attention.",

But it will have full cex account connector and depend on it so it can't give full joy of DEX.Â  Cex and Dex will not be the same but two completely different things.",

It's like combining the best of both worlds. CEXs can become more versatile and user-friendly by offering DEX-like features. IMO, this would make trading cryptocurrencies easier for everyone.I'm not sure about it but what I know is the centralized exchanges are almost hitting their limits there's nothing they can do anymore, the reason why they're still the center of attention is due to the new entries in the industry and the only cheap option, but when it comes to the transparency & security they really cant offer better than this.No doubt their overall user experience is far more developed compared to the DEX's but what DEX's are offering is far more superior to the centralized excnages, I'm sure in near future with the network fees solution ther'e gonna lead the way.",

Some traders are trusting CEXs because they can easily get support when they need it, particularly from those top trading platforms. This integration actually is not new, it has been there for quite a while now as they need to cover all potential clients. In my opinion, the use of this feature depends on the trader himself, whether he sees this as advantage for him or not.",

They only adopt some of the decentralized exchange capabilities anyway, and inspite of it, they are still a centralized exchange. If we don't like our funds being hostage by a centralized exchange, we are always welcome of using a decentralized exchange. On the second thing that you said, many are like that and it's funny right?If they truly support decentralization, then they should also use a decentralized wallet, but I guess there is this unique feature that only a centralized wallet and exchanges have and this is why they are still leading.

Decentralized things implemented in a centralized platform doesn't make it decentralized. Instead, it's just a feature which is centralized but act the same way as decentralized platform. So if privacy is your first concern, things like decentralized exchange which is swapping / converting that are implemented in centralized exchange should not be take into consideration.It cost a little bit more or it cost a little bit which is available free in centralized platform indicates that those centralized platform are taking advantage thus they are giving the service for free. Could also be for attracting more people. But the more people use the service the more money they make. Something was just cheap isn't always bad and also something that cost a bit more doesn't mean it is good. But when there are hidden agendas involved, doesn't matter how cheap it is, it is better to stay away from it. Use the thing that is meant to be doing what it says even if it cost you.

Actually CEX has most of the capabilities a dex has and on top of that CEX provides some extra benefits like massive liquidity and excludes the necessity of transaction fees. Perhaps this is a reason why CEX is still more popular than dex even after incidents like Mr.Gox and FTX where their users lost millions of dollars worth of assets.",

Most Exchange users are comfortable keeping their funds in and using some of these existing CEX and following the recent news of Regulations and all, I think some are really trying hard to keep up to the expectation of the people in order to show their commitment to their users. I read of a particular CEX, I think Bitget in short secession making partnership with an off Exchange digital asset custody outfit, increased their user protection funds and updating their proof of reserve. They also along with Binance, coinbase and others are among the top cex that have implemented it. All these I feel are geared toward satisfying their users and making their Platform more attractive to investors. We shouldn't mind the bad elements in the space and ignore the efforts of the few commitment ones.",
