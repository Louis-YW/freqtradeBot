  "content": "QuoteTo many, it’s a good thing that the metaverse seems to be sputtering. The largest tech platforms have already established enormous influence over our lives, as well as the technologies and business models of the modern economy. It’s also clear that there are many problems with today’s internet; why not solve them before moving on to what Mark Zuckerberg calls “the successor” to it?The answer is embedded in that very question. The metaverse, a 30-year-old term but a nearly century-old idea, is forming around us. Every few decades, a platform shift occurs—such as that from mainframes to PCs and the internet, or the subsequent evolution to mobile and cloud computing. Once a new era has taken shape, it’s incredibly difficult to alter who leads it and how. But between eras, those very things usually do change. If we hope to build a better future, then we must be as aggressive about shaping it as are those who are investing to build it.QuoteSo what is this future? Think of the metaverse as a parallel virtual plane of existence that spans all digital technologies and will even come to control much of the physical world. This construct helps explain another common description of the metaverse as a 3D internet—and why establishing it is so hard, but also likely to be worthwhile.Source time.comSo what are your opinions on metaverse and how are you guys preparing for it? is it by participating in some of the highly advanced metaverse new projects launching in the space or accumulating some of the top existing ones?",

Not to mention that a lot of gamers who aren't really keen on the idea (since they know people are just milking the idea without doing any actual development), and I say that it matters because the probable first group that would experience and test the development of metaverse are those kind/types of people imo.",

Imagine all the interactivity of the educational learning process, an in-depth pitch-perfect projection of infrastructural projects. A combination of visuals, text, and sound that blended into our everyday living in a digital age could boost the human being as a whole.Unintended consequences would be the implicit risk behind it. Are we sure that the whole of ideation Metaverse would be brought up by companies like Meta? a company that sold our life for advertising purposes which breach our everyday lives. It surely would benefited them the most, instead for the good sake.After all, the ideation is preserved for a way ahead in the future, but we must thoroughly see how it developed and maintain the basic aspect to prevent those unintended consequences. As of now, the scenes are way too fertile, that most of them, pretty much experimental ones, and could be easily to be shifted only as profiting, especially in the cryptocurrencies spaces.",

I think still a big issue for this one.We can only move from the traditional way of gaming into the metaverse world by developing the metaverse space with projects that meet standards. wouldn't it be more beneficial if you can play games and earn from them regardless of the size of profit? Should gamers continue to spend big bucks buying games to play, enriching the big gaming company just for fun! it is a matter of time before the traditional gaming method will be faced out for a more rewarding technological advanced way of gaming.",

We have to follow.Changing a name of a company will not give such level awareness, Facebook change the name of the company but they haven't create any outstanding projects to be the cause of what metaverse is today. This is as a result of the collective innovative ideas of different organisations, companies who believe the metaverse ecosystem will be the future of digital reality and not because of Facebook name change. Those who thinks metaverse is a dream, AI already existing in many companies and it is part of the whole metaverse ecosystem. The world is going digital on a daily basis.",

This technology certainly has potential, but it seems to me that all the praise is somewhat exaggerated.Quote from: PrivacyG on July 24, 2022, 01:52:07 PMMetaverse is a niche.  I do not think it is comparable to the early days of the Internet.  I have exactly the same idea and it is unlikely that metaverse will repeat the success of the Internet. But the problem is that we can't know for sure and can only guess.  Quote from: PrivacyG on July 24, 2022, 01:52:07 PMMetaverse could be successful considering I feel some kind of rise of anti-social behavior, but getting as big as the Internet's growth was is mostly impossible and, if it ever happens, would actually be sad since real life is seemingly becoming less and less important in peoples lives.This trend was laid by the Internet, which is becoming more and more evident over time. Real life is increasingly receding into the background and in theory metaverse can greatly accelerate this. But for this, the technology must develop well, which will require additional time. Perhaps humanity still has time.Quote from: PrivacyG on July 24, 2022, 01:52:07 PMAlso, I do not think there is going to be a 'majority' using it.  And here surprises are possible. If big companies like meta don't lose interest in this technology, then it is possible that, having developed, metaverse will just attract the majority. It is no coincidence that they spend millions in this niche.",
