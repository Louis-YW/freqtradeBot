  "content": "Sam Bankman-Fried now faces a total of 12 criminal charges because 4 more charges have been added. His current charge is that he conspired with two of his former FTX executives to donate tens of millions of dollars to influence US politicians to pass laws favorable to the company.Federal prosecutors claimed that SBF donated to both Democrats and Republicans to ensure that he will be favored no matter who wins the elections. It is unfortunate how politicians receive funds from corrupt businessmen without considering the consequences of their actions on the people. They are in these political positions for selfish reasons. I am sure these bribes affected their regulatory functions, which made SBF run FTX like his family business.The receivers of this donation should be compelled to return these funds because they can be used to pay some people that lost money in FTX.https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64740128",

The are politicians and they always need money either for personal gain or to run and support their political ambition. Politicians can know that the individuals supporting them are fraudulent or have bad record, but they will decide to act the blind eye and behave like they have no idea about the nature and character of the person they are dealing with until the person is caught and they claim they never knew.",

Death sentence perhaps?I mean as the OP said, he is faced with 12 criminal charges. Is this a procedure that happens to everyone who are protected by the all mighty elite?Or are people just waiting he walks free after all this spotlight. Thatw would need a miracle now.",

Thatw would need a miracle now.Even if that were on the table, they wouldn't give the death penalty for even the worse financial crimes. The guidelines for non-violent crimes wouldn't even allow the judge to sentence criminals to death. Bernie Madoff stole roughly 20 billion and he was sentence to 150 years, most people seem okay with a life sentence. Guidelines would allow a judge to sentence SBF to prison for the rest of his life if convicted, but they get discretion.Also possible the prosecutors would request a lesser sentence to the judge as well instead of aiming for the maximum penalty.",

I know we had MtGox & weâ€™re taught, not your keys not your coins but I just did not see FTX being one of the bad guys.SBF turned out to be one of the worst fraudsters in financial history. I hope him & his whole team go to jail for a long time. So many people are financially ruined due to their dishonesty & incompetence.",
