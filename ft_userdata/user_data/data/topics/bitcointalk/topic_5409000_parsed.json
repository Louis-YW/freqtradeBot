  "content": "This forum houses members with different names that sometimes one would wonder where they got those names from. Some of them sound good while some look scaring. But every name is a brand that offers certain service to the forum. The service might be substandard or quality services. But members must ensure that their names are associated with quality services that is contributing to the development of the forum. Hence, I would want to discuss names as an identity, symbol of integrity and quality. Name as an identity: This forum has no policy on name selection. This means that prospective members are free to choose any name they want in the course of registration. But this freedom doesn’t give you the privilege of choosing names that depicts or promote immoral behavior. Newbies must note that the first impression any member would have about him/her is the name because nobody is seeing you. And you might not have the opportunity to explain to people the reason for choosing the name. Choosing a suitable name is important because it might never be edited or changed. It is better to choose a meaningless name than to choose a wrong name. A member’s name;  fare sesso con la sorella  which relates to someone having s*xual relationship with his sister received enough criticism from the forum community that he felt harassed. Another member stated that the reason why another member is not receiving enough merit was that his name  AnotherAlt  sounds like someone’s alt account and merit sources tries as much as possible to avoid helping Alt accounts to rank up, and this is because they are avoiding being accused of and criticized for supporting account farming. Name as a symbol of integrity: Although nobody can be fully trusted, but there are names in this forum that can never be associated with scam or fraud. These set of members have built their integrity beyond reasonable doubt. Some of them have been treasures in this forum and have fully accounted for the funds at their disposal without any form of misappropriation. Their yes is yes and their no is no. They ensure that their dealing with members and organization in this forum is without shady dealings and fraudulent intentions. Hence newbies must ensure they disassociate themselves from all activities that appears or confirmed to be fraudulent.Name as a symbol of quality: There are some members in this forum that upholds excellence in their posts or other forum activities. Perfection might be unattainable but these set of members work hard to ensure that they give quality information to the forum. There name is synonymous with quality educational and problem solving posts. There are members that put little or no effort in their posts and members know them and don’t take them serious most times. But there are some members that people rush to their post because of its quality. Newbies must study, research and strive to achieve this feat because it would make their name a good brand.In summarily although newbies are free to choose any name of their choice but they should choose wisely this is because your name represents you. Shun scam and fraud to give your name a good status and people would trust you unconditionally. Strive for excellence and give quality information and members would respect you regardless of your nationality or age.",

Unfortunately, I was unable to post with that account because that account contained a few evil points. A Few weeks ago LoyceV helped me to get whitelisted my older account. Quoted below:Quote from: AnotherAlt on May 24, 2022, 04:37:53 PMQuote from: LoyceV on May 24, 2022, 04:31:07 PMQuote from: AnotherAlt on May 24, 2022, 04:21:42 PMHi! LoyceV, I have another account that was created back in September 2020.If you post the username, I'll whitelist it.Thank you. Username is Crypt0S0ulI had created several accounts before paying the evil fees for this account. Unfortunately, I have forgotten the usernames. This was the last one and I was running out of ideas for usernames. So I choose AnotherAlt. The reason I paid the evil fees for this account: it was a small amount than other accounts which I also stated in LoyceV's Thread. Quoted below:Quote from: AnotherAlt on April 10, 2022, 12:44:08 PMQuote from: LoyceV on July 20, 2021, 03:59:04 PMThe tricky part: apart from including your Bitcointalk username, you'll need to convince me you deserve it. I know this sucks, and I hate jumping through hoops too. But it's the best I can do to help new Bitcointalk users without giving spammers a free pass.Hey LoyceV! Could you please explain what the criteria to convince you are? I understand that you don't want everyone to give a free pass. But, How can I prove that I am innocent and have never done bad things there? I have created three accounts (Including this) so far, and every time my IP has contained some evil points. This time I have paid the evil fees to unlock my account. I mailed you a few days ago to open my other account, and you said you were not convinced. The reason I have unlocked this account is this account contained a little evil point. So it costs fewer fees. Please explain the criteria and how to convince you.Quote from: Zlantann on August 07, 2022, 12:07:51 PMChoosing a suitable name is important because it might never be edited or changedActually, it can be edited if the admin does it for you.

But if my username is \"bitcoin guru\" and i am a spammer, scammer, i will be addressed as one, the username doesn't matter in that way.Needless to say that newbies should protect their username and make sure it is associated with only good things in the forum, but \"protect your username\" doesn't mean newbies should worry about the wordings or semantics of their username, but what they do with their account that carries the username.",

Almost always, they are the same.If I change a name for reasons of appearance, then I only change the display name. The username remains reserved, the user can still login using the username, PMs can still be sent to that username, \"search member\" allows searching for the old username, etc.If I change a name for reasons of privacy, then I change both the username and the display name. In this case, it is possibly hazardous to reserve the old username, since it allows someone to test for the existence of that username, possibly defeating the privacy benefit. If you're worried about being impersonated, then simply don't seek to have your username changed.",

The service might be substandard or quality services. But members must ensure that their names are associated with quality services that is contributing to the development of the forum.And that's one of the biggest mistake most people make when registering on the forum, that is, I mean creating an account before thinking what they could offer to the forum, instead of thinking of what they could offer the forum before creating an account. And that was exactly what I had in mind before creating this my account \"CRYPTOHEADLINENEWS\" because the reason why I chose the name was because I had in mind  to be reviewing latest crypto news headlines to the forum, while leaving people to react to the news, but it's it unfortunately as I never for once did itQuoteThis forum has no policy on name selection. This means that prospective members are free to choose any name they want in the course of registration.I think you are wrong on this, because the forum actually has a policy on name selection because you can't choose a name that already has been chosen by someone else. That is no two person can bear the same name on the forum, which is actually a policyQuoteChoosing a suitable name is important because it might never be edited or changed.I think someone above @ AnotherAlt just proved to us that name can be changed, of which only Theymos has the power to do so.",

Perhaps here one should give it a wee bit more of a thought upon signing-up, because of the above. Nevertheless, with 3.479.831 accounts created so far, chances are that the one one would like may be taken. If we don’t racket our mind a bit, we end-up with DdmrDdmr or some other gibberish (of course one never knows if he’s going to be around here for a quick ride or a long and sturdy one)…- The name as in reputation, obtained through deeds, the content of the posts, and whatnot.
