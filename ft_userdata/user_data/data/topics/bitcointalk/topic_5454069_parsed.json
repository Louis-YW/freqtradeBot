Increase in interest rate is to fight inflation, not the other way. Does it mean there are no other better ways to well fight inflation in the economies other than raising interest rates cause it's the citizens that suffer from the ripple effect of these concurrent rise's which has led to increments in prices of goods and services on each rate raise. Looking at all these you wonder how productive is the raising as it hasn't been able to solve to a very good level the problems  as to why the interest rates are raised.",

If the primary reason is tackled.If the foreign reserve is depleting as a result of buying goods and services from outside the country, I mean importation, government will have no option than the discourage citizens from taking the foreign currencies abroad. One of the thing they use to discourage this is increase in interest rate.If Nigerian is producing more, exporting more than importing is the solution. If not for crude oil, it would have been worse than this.",

      "body": "The rise in interest rates is to counter inflation. It is part of a more recent undertaking by even most African countries too, who are experiencing same issues of inflation. Zambia, Congo, South Africa among others have either had to raise their interest rates or reduce it to soot the economy. It is a good call by the CBN governor, Emiefele, and am hoping that despite the huge deficit this country is incurring, the incoming administration should be able to create more opportunities to support unemployment so as to alleviate the situation of hardship in the country.",
