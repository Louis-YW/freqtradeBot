Miners have years to plan for the halving, which means they are given the chance to readjust themselves to see if they can continue the mining task. Halving is not done because the miners are to receive rewards and we then assume they make the plan and preparation for that to come and when not to happen, immediately once a particular block mined had been achieved, halving occurs and this is been done within the target period of four years intervals, except the entire blocks have been completely mined, miners still have the right to continue the process a d after that, they will depend on transaction fee to generate their incentives.Quote from: ColdLava40 on January 03, 2024, 01:38:51 PMCertainly, profits might not be guaranteed, especially when working as a solo miner.Why not guaranteed as long as the whole network protocols was being strictly adhere to.Quote from: ColdLava40 on January 03, 2024, 01:38:51 PM2.

Satoshi wanted the supply to be finite, but didn't want to release them all at once, so opted to introduce new ones in blocks. Here now posed the problem that I would assume led to halving;• If mining reward was left at 50BTC per block, we would have had the entire apply mined within 8 years, after 420,000 blocks. Way too soon.• This would have caused an issues cause miners will be left to rely on fees was too early and can lead to loss of majority of miners.• Including halving into the protocol was genius. It eases miners into life without mining (coinbase) reward and also factored in how price changes. Early on when the price was low, 50 units should be enough incentive, but as the price increases, as low as 1 unit or less will be valuable enough to motivate miners.",

Your contributions are welcomed, have a blissful day ahead.From your post, I think you have interest in mining activities for cryptocurrency and want to understand why the halving is as important to the miners as it is to the investor or trader.BTC halving was implemented to act like a break on the fast evolving and developing initiative of Bitcoin. Although, miners would have to make do with much lower fees due to the halving, still, the proportion of their earnings would be in natural correspondence with they earned before. The halving is not to put anyone investor or miner at a disadvantage, but to ensure the existence and continuity of a genuine idea which offers hope to those who have grown tired of using fiat for transactions and payments, mostly when it is across borders and much fees are required. One bliss about the halving that we all must take advantage of is the bull run that follows and it comes with hope for those who are into trading and those who DCA or HoDL because all will not be lost as the value of their BTC still remains intact nonetheless.",

Now miners create new Bitcoins by running nodes and solving complex cryptographic math. As they do this they get block rewards which are calculated by hashrates. The bigger the hash rate the bigger the rewards miners get after every successive block they mine.Now during halving these hash rates are halved which in turn causes the rewards for each mined block to reduce also thus slowing down the rate at which new Bitcoins are created and preventing declination in value due to excess coins in circulation.If not for the halving protocol the entire Bitcoin supply would have been mined completely a long time ago, making miners to then rely only on rewards from transaction fees. Besides this would infact make transaction fees to also increase.",

Your contributions are welcomed, have a blissful day ahead. Figured that he knew from the get-go or at the very least that bitcoin could go on par with the common commodities that we have in the market way back in 2008, so to jump the trend and also give bitcoin a bit of a fighting chance at longevity they implemented a deflationary feature that would make bitcoins practically scarcer and harder to acquire while at the same time making it even more valuable in the process. I believe he's also had visions of bitcoin becoming a pretty powerful economical tool, hence why he included features like the halving in the first place, and a couple other more that promotes bitcoin's high volatility rate which thus far worked well in its favor. The thing is that miners have all the time in the world to prepare for when the halving comes, us investors do not have that liberty as we would need to always time our buys and calculate our risks. Just a few of the awesome things that miners enjoy just by actively contributing to the industry.",

Certainly, profits might not be guaranteed, especially when working as a solo miner.Miners have to build up their strategy because mining is like an investment but requires very long time to get break-even. If they take risk too much, don't have good strategy, they can have bankruptcy. We usually think Bitcoin miners easily get profit but it is not like this. It is a risky investment for newbies and with each halving, we will have many new miners join this mining industry.New miners are most vulnerable with market shocks, corrections because their budgets likely are not too deep and they over take leverages, risks. Experienced miners are like senior investors, they know what to do in bull and bear market and how they can reserver their block rewards for halving and bull run.",

We are still in a last flippening time between a curve and a flat area of the Bitcoin supply curve. When the flat area is touched, people will discuss like Will it be the end of Bitcoin because Bitcoin miners will receive less coins from mining. I read those discussions many times and similar topics like will Bitcoin die after 2140 when all 21 million bitcoins in total supply already mined by miners.It's too far but if Bitcoin adoption continues to be bigger, Bitcoin price will be higher and miners will have more money from transaction fees like we see since 2023 February with Ordinals spam on Bitcoin network.

Indeed, there are electoral cycles in the behavior of assets, for example, in the stock market. There are also 4-year astrological cycles.
