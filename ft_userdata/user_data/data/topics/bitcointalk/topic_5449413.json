Could someone here please help me?If you're using the GUI, you can set it in the \"Welcome Screen\" where you've initially set the data directory and other settings.To launch Bitcoin Core with it, start Bitcoin-qt with the command line option: -choosedatadirThe advantage of this is you don't have to use a specific shortcut with the -datadir command line option.Here's a simple guide to do it:Go to Bitcoin Core's install directory, it's in \"C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\" by default. (copy the path for the next step)Open 'Command Prompt' (use search if you can't find it) and 'Change Directory' to the dir above using the command: cd \"C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\"Then start Bitcoin Core's GUI with the said command line option using the command: bitcoin-qt.exe -choosedatadirThe Welcome Screen will open where you can set the datadir.Take note that your old data directory wont be automatically moved to the newly set dir, you'll have to manually move everything in it.",

As of now, you can use the new directory but  Also as the senior said the Old data directory data needed to be manually moved. for this, again don't forget to close the Bitcoin core and then you'll need to copy the entire old directory content you can find by default old data using this route; Code:\"C:\\Users<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\"",
