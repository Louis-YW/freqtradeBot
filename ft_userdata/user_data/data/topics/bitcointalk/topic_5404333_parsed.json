Especially now with all the shortages going on.I think for people who want to jump into GPU mining prices are just about right,sure they may go down further after a couple of months but if I can make a 2500 USD rig with 7 x Rtx 2070 Super that would good for me,it means a near 300 Mhsh rig for just that price,it is doable right now and I don't consider it a really high price,of course taking into consideration that you jump in for the long term profitability and not to just jump in to make a quick buck,if you do so to make a quick buck this was never beneficial nor it is now to anyone.",

Especially now with all the shortages going on.It seems to me that the whole market of video cards depends on the price of bitcoin. If the price of bitcoin falls, then the price of all altcoins that can be mined on video cards will also fall. Even now, there are very cheap prices for video cards on the market, and Ethereum mining has not yet ended.",

I regard 'cheap' as at least 10% below MSRP. Once the RTX 3060 dips < $300, that is cheap. But there has been no decline for most models over the past 15 days despite the huge crash in BTC price. I think the 15%/month decline we've seen for the past 6 months will continue for at least 2 more months. It will probably stay static after that until PoS. So I won't build rigs now.",
