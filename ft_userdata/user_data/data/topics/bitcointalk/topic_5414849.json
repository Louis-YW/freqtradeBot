  "content": "Hi all,I'm interested in selling my 2014 Casascius Bitcoin Bowl coin. It's still in the original slab from Mike in 2014.  2,000 were originally produced but Mike scrapped 1,150 of them (due to quality of the slab which tarnished the coins). This left 850 of the coins in the wild. Original post here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=903503.msg10956463#msg10956463I'm interested in selling mine. Looking for BTC only. Pictures below.",
