I've decided to create this record of some worthy-of-note Bitcoin's historical events, both past and present. Every information on this post can be found scattered in different places online, I decided to bring them(the important ones) all together in one place here for easy accessibility to all, most especially newbies that are just learning about bitcoin. All the events or histories i put down on this post is at least 85 percent based on research and 15 percent based on personal knowledge, so i am open to corrections if you find any mistakes or misconceptions in any part of this post.Thank you..

When I first came across an article of several individuals who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the first question that popped up in my mind was \"Who really is this Satoshi Nakamoto that everyone is claiming to be?\". It is commonly known or understood that Satoshi Nakamoto is the person or group of persons who invented the Crypto currency which we all know as Bitcoin, Bitcoin has turned out to be the world's best performing crypto asset of all time(I hope am right about this) at the time of making this post. To fully understand who Satoshi Nakamoto is, let's read Wikipedia's full description of who Satoshi Nakamoto is.Since the invention of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto has continued to remain anonymous, and with the huge success and worldwide recognition that Bitcoin have achieved, many individuals tried so hard to take Satoshi's glory, in the table below, we take a look at all the individuals who have claimed or proclaimed themselves Satoshi Nakamoto or have claimed to know Satoshi Nakamoto in person but were unable to prove it.[Please note that content of this table is sourced from various sources online.]#|NAME|COO|OCCUPATION|AGE at TTOTP|AOD at TTOTP|YOC|REFERENCES|REMARK1|Craig Steven Wright|Australia|computer scientist|52|Alive|2015|Economist.com|He claimed to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto.2|Phil Wilson|-|Software Programmer|-|-|2018|Bitcoin.com, Bitcoin Origin, finder.com|Also known as Scronty, He claimed he was a member of the real Satoshi Nakamoto group which consists of Craig Wright, Dave Kleiman and himself.3|Ronald Keala Kua Maria|Hawaii, USA|unknown|-|Alive|2018|Bitcoin.com |He claimed to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto.4|Debo Jurgen Etienne Guido|Belgium|unknown|-|-|2019|theparadise.ng|He claimed to be the real inventor of Bitcoin.5|Bilal Khalid|Pakistan|unknown|-|Alive|2019|Yahoo.com|Also know as James Caan or James Bilal Khalid Caan, He claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto.6|Jorg Molt|Germany|A popular DJ turned Scammer|49|Arrested in 2021|2019|Bitcoin.com, Nakamolto.info|He claimed to have helped in the invention of Bitcoin but turned out to be a big lie.7|John McAfee|United Kingdom|Computer Programmer|75|Died in 2021|2020|Forbs.com|He claimed he knew exactly who Satoshi Nakamoto was and was going to reveal, but unfortunately, he didnt before his arrest and death.Who will be the next person to claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto?

If I am not wrong with this assumption , then I like to let you know that the price prediction part of my post is just a contest am launching as a fun thing and also my own little way of trying to giving back to this community, it isn't something to be taken serious and I don't intend or want it to act as a decider to or for anyone, as to whether they should invest in Bitcoin or not, I will clearly state and make this disclaimer bold enough for everyone to see as soon as the contest is launched.I hope this clarifies your argument, thank you sir/ma.",

Their voices have power to affect the crowd, to make them FOMO or panic. I would prefer to warn them they when they read opinions from influencers, they must try to figure out that opinions are given based on emotion, personal incentives or based on any models. If based on models, are those models good enough?Freedom of speech, influencers are free to say what they think but it's your money and influencers don't save you when you get loss. Influencers are not always right as the graphic shows.",

It is very terrible and deadly if you rely on their opinions for your investment in Bitcoin.Some KOLs are just stating prices out of nowhere and thats really worse. But some of them uses some historical information or technical analysis which quite commendable. I guess it depend on the one you followed or subscribed on. I watching some cause their information is quite good or naturally realistic.Actually on this space no one is right. Whats the difference of KOLs to bitcoin OG here in terms of opinion is not much relevant since market cant be prrdicted accurately. Some hates those KOLs for their statement but they not noticing their opinion about price is not different too.",
