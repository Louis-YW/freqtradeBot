Probably this site can be helpful for you: https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458Know that graphics card are also slightly expensive. For bitcoin mining? Use ASIC. I know of Antminers if you want to go for ASIC. ASIC can only be used for mining, take note of that. Buying graphics card for bitcoin mining won't be profitable.",

This is the same price as the RTX 3070 Ti, but that is still a $100 increase compared to the last-gen non-Ti SKU. For this, gamers will get 4GB more memory, newer RT and Tensor cores, support for DLSS3 tech and more advanced video encoding (AV1).Maybe you can buy it for $600.",

My observation about the hashrate on new coins in this post.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5447543.msg62038432#msg62038432But do not rush to buy, wait for the reviews.",
