I actually don't like a CEX exchange because when you have no control on your assets it's in danger. So using a custodial wallet from an Exchange is the most risky for your funds. You may see sudden ban or locked your transection or they can ask you to verify again. That's why I will suggest to use Bisq Network decentralized exchange for the best security.Even I use Centralized Exchanges for trading and I follow these to choose a perfect one:1. Must have a great reputation and a good customer service.2. Exchange should have a user-friendly interface and everything is easy to accessable.3. Exchange should not have a bad experience or history in past like it has been hacked before. But I can compromise if users aren't affected like FTX.com or not a major attack.4. Must have P2P features to cash out my profits easily.5. KYC should not be implemented but I have to problem to do KYC if exchange is very perfect for me and trustworthy.So observing all of these I mostly use Binance and for some trading reason I try to use ByBit. Though I have compromised some of my requirements but they are enough trustworthy to use. But I never store funds in Exchanges for long term because we don't know what will happen in future. So that's all about my observations And I hope you guys will also have some requirements but I will not suggest to use any suspicious exchanges with lower reputation though it offers lower trading fees or anything else.",

Though let me correct the impression I never said all the things I listed are the only things to consider when you’re choosing a CEX. After the issue of FTX there are certain things the public expected from most CEX in order to clear the FUD that is already hitting the crypto space, revealing their proof of reserve and showing evidence that they hold user asset 100% just like the Mekle tree proof by Bitget. Binance and Bitget revealed their proof of reserve and that was able to calm the crypto space for a while. To me I feel most users should have their research carried out before adopting a CEX and also look out for genuine recommendations.",

Top on my list as I wouldn't want to worry about my assets not being safe. (Yes, I'm one of those who still leave their assets on Cexs if I trust them)-Good UI-Nice trading volume -Good trust score on coin market cap.As a copy trader, they have tons of elite traders to copy from too.  Lol you can tell that I use Bitget.",

Mostly, it's very possible to find a CEX that will require no KYC. But things have changed now, Binance and Kucoin that have been the exchanges that don't implement KYC before have already asked for it.That's why for the exchange that you want to find without asking for a KYC, it's mostly going to be a DEX. And if you do are going to comply with KYC, make sure that you like that exchange and aware of its things.Quote from: Bitcoinpoly on August 01, 2023, 04:32:41 PMTo me I always try to use different exchange to have a good comparison of them all, there are lots of exchanges you can trade on.

You wouldn't want your orders to remain unfilled for long hours. Aside from that, I also consider, of course, the usual UI and UX, certain terms like KYC, trading pairs, and so on. When I tried trading years ago, proof of reserve wasn't a big thing, if at all. That your funds are also somehow insured was also not that of a big deal. Binance's SAFU was the first popular approach of its kind. All in all, I guess the standard is that the exchange should have a solid track record or reputation, not necessarily a long one. I tried Binance perhaps months or a year at most after it was launched. It seemed to have earned the trust of traders rather quickly.",
