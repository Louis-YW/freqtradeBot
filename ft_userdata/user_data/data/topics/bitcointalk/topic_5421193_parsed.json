I have attempted to contact them on all of their social media with no response despite them being recently active.Why don't you raise the issue on their ANN thread as I seen OP has been active few days ago? I see that you left a comment there but no mention of the withdrawal problem. Quote from: ThisSucks on November 16, 2022, 04:17:12 AMI will gladly change my negative reviews to neutral once they process my LTC withdrawal. Nothing more to say besides I STRONGLY suggest nobody use this site.Since you left them negative feedback you should have provided the evidence immediately because if you provide the evidence other members can jump in and possibly help to solve this issue.",
