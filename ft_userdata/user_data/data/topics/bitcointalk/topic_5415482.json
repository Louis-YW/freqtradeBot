For more information contact on Telegram @BTCJazz01The only thing that i can suggest you is you can compete with another marketing management through make your own thread. It's important to create one in the service section and break down all of your track record in your thread. this to make sure that if the developers of altcoins or something else will try to be interested with your offer and starting to hire you as their marketer. This may good for you. Have you made one before? Introduce your service in the right section which has so much traffic",
