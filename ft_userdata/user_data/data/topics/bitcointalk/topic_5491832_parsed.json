You can get the price of bitcoin from the internet, as long as you are not where you don't have access to the internet. If you are planning to buy at the dip, you can be saving for that, and when the dip comes, you take advantage of it and you that money that you have saved to buy.If you don't want to use CEX p2p, you can use DEX. But to put it straight to you, if you want to use centralized exchange, after buying through p2p you need to transfer your coins to a noncustodial wallet like electrum, blue wallet or sparrow wallet , where only you have access to your private keys, instead of leaving it in the exchange.",

The cons in Bisq is the rate, even you see the current Bitcoin price in many sites is $68K, but in Bisq it could be still at $70K due to low volume.For alternative you can use bot that will send a notification on your email/telegram/sms https://cryptocurrencyalerting.com/bot/telegram Then you send your coins to CEX, if you want to get the best rate.",

Now the same bot you want is similar to this centralized exchanges because they need to hold your coins to buy the dip for you, I will strongly advise against it if there is something like that at all. Last time I heard Solana chain had it and when it got hacked people lost their funds on it. I don’t know if there is something like an alarm reminder for certain price that you can set on platforms like coincegkco or coinmarketcap. The one I know of is the alert system used by traders on trading view and even that isn’t that useful if you’re not so active. My advice is don’t wait for certain price just dedicate time like weekly, bi-weekly or monthly and just buy bitcoin at those time, it is way safer and better than any bot.",

That why most time we have been advised to continue buying with DCA strategy. Which is buying at different price interval either when the price is high or low and one can fixed his DCA monthly or weekly, just to avoid any scenario of missing out .Even when you set some kind of buying limit, what if market endup not reaching the price you set or even went dipper before surging in price . So we can't predict it , so I will give you same advice just continue with your DCAing , in buying at different time interval, and you might even endup buying the dip still. Using a cex account not actually bad because one may choose to gather some good amount of Bitcoin before transferring to a noncustodial wallet, due to fees.",

But the problem here is that OP doesn't want to use centralized exchanges and unfortunately only centralized exchanges provide this feature. As far as I know, no decentralized exchange offers this feature. But what I also wonder is using Bot means we need to have USDT in our wallet and OP said he hates centralization but meanwhile USDT is also a centralized altcoin. So what the OP asked for is very difficult to meet.",

We have bots that are capable and positioned to trigger our orders without having any significant differences. You're absolutely right, exchanges and brokers have buying and selling orders, it's one of the good features and have enabled most traders to have solid ground in the market.",

This is why it would really be just that depending on you on how  you would really be doing such actions.For me it would really be that more convenient if you have set a buy order on a specific price point that you do like.

Then, you could create a script to transfer the bitcoin from the exchange to a wallet under your control. Alternatively, you could set up triggers on TradingView and manually purchase the BTC from an exchange, then send it to your wallet.

Most half-decent centralized exchanges have a limit order feature; unless you're trading P2P.This is exactly your solution. You don't need to overcomplicate things, especially if you're using centralized exchanges. I've also missed some opportunities because I was asleep, at work, or simply couldn't access my phone, and I could have prevented it had I used a limit order. Still, that isn't as good as being present when the dip occurs because your limit order might still be too high and you end up purchasing at a higher price, but at least it'll save you the trouble of completely missing out.You sound a little too paranoid, claiming that CEX may have collapsed by the moment you return. It's a bit ironic when you claim that you'd use a bot to trade for yourself. Another user mentioned using alerts, but that doesn't guarantee anything. What if you don't have internet access at the moment, or access to a phone or computer, or because you're simply sleeping? Although the idea doesn't sound bad, I don't think it's always applicable.",

I don't think you can really automate a P2P buy without having things break on you every time knowing how much things can potentially break(and potentially lose money) when automating a peer-to-peer transaction that includes interacting with another person using a bank account.And yes, centralized exchanges do collapse from time to time, but the chances of you getting screwed over are very low if you're just setting up offers for a long weekend or something; also take note that I'm pretty sure you're not setting up weekend buy offers with a huge chunk of your net worth.",

The only way that you can take advantage of dips is when you've got a lot of money so you get more bang for your buck with your bitcoin. Just remember the adage, buy low, sell high and you're good to go.

It is impossible to imagine the life of a modern person without constantly having a phone with the internet in his pocket. So take advantage of this and buy bitcoin from your phone. What problems might there be? This can be done outside of centralized exchanges. There are plenty of services that allow you to do this.In fact, the moment of falling is not one single moment per cycle. There will be many moments that are profitable for buying, and I am sure that one of them will be caught and the difference from the maximum drop will differ by several percent.When investing, I would not trust the purchase to bots, because if a failure occurs, you will strongly wish for this intention. It's best to do this manually.",
