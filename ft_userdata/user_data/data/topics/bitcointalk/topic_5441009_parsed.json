And transaction fees are still there, but at that time they will become very important because they are the only source of income for miners and this fact was predetermined in Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper.and once all the bitcoins are available in the market and people start using them to buy or pay, the number of transactions will be very high and mining will be required to do that. And miners will earn transaction fees for making that happen.and if I'm not mistaken the last bitcoin is slated to be mined in 2140, and maybe all of us dead who won't know what happens next and for now only know the information that already exists which doesn't necessarily get there, and surely the price of bitcoin will increase substantially and transaction fees will be high enough to offset the fact that there are no more block rewards.",

However it's possible that we won't be alive when Bitcoin reaches 21 million and is fully mined. Who would have known it would exist before then? We are unable to make accurate predictions, not even knowing if we will survive. But if Bitcoin is still around by then, I have no doubt that its value will skyrocket. Miners will always support Bitcoin since they will continue to profit from transaction fees. When the number of Bitcoins reaches 21 million, the price will be very high.",

In other words, it is not possible to reach or mine the 21 million bitcoins. I don't know if I understand you correctly, but the 21 million bitcoins can be reached. There is nothing to be said against it and it is only a matter of time. Current projections say it will be in 2140 and all bitcoins have been mined. Sure, by then more bitcoins will be lost and there will probably never be 21 million bitcoins in circulation, but they were mined nonetheless.But what happens next is difficult to predict. Perhaps the bitcoin price will then become more stable, if it still exists at all. I don't think any of us here will experience that anyway.",

It may very well be a long time from today but when that time comes, and it will, the world would have most likely adopted bitcoin. The price of bitcoin then would either become stable or go upwards. I thing I know; when that time comes, it would be a highly sought after commodity, and the increase in demand would only result in the increase in prices.",

Of course, the price is determined by supply and demand. But by 2140, many coins will surely have been lost and large amounts of bitcoins will be held by few whales. These can reduce the supply, since no new bitcoins can come onto the market through miners. As a result, the price could be pushed up and also quite stable. But maybe that's just a wrong mind game on my part. Unfortunately, I won't live to see that point in time anyway.",

However, the fact remains that no more bitcoin will be mined. The miners' reward for successfully mining a block into the blockchain will end. Bitcoin's price will almost certainly be much higher than it is now, and it will almost certainly be stable by then, with widespread adoption. Although these are all fictitious facts about it, few or none of us will be alive to witness it, but one of these events is very likely to occur.Quote from: Nwada001 on February 23, 2023, 08:38:22 PMQuote from: The Cryptovator on February 23, 2023, 06:44:57 PMBut if Bitcoin is still around by then, I have no doubt that its value will skyrocket.

I know little to nothing about how mining and its charges work.After a block is mined into the blockchain for every successful transaction; for a normal wallet the miner earns the reward for it. However, if it is an exchange or custodian wallet service, the higher portion of the fees goes to the exchange and the lower portion to the miner’s as it’s shown on the blockchain explorer.",
