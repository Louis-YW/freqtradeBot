They're making a new model for its economy to be alive again. Those that have been stuck with this game and has a lot of assets will have to study again how its market and tokenomy works. These are NFTs and they're pricey before but not anymore this time. It's not a bitcoin game but it's an NFT game that OP is looking for. Before getting in, be sure to know how it goes this time.Because if you're in it for the hype once again, you'd definitely lose. Or if you're not going to lose then there's a very high chance that you will.",

They're making a new model for its economy to be alive again. Ive just saw the post or noise via social media, so how does the new model works? Ive had some axies left stuck on the wallet and if ever theres a chance to liquidate that then possibly Id take it. Of course I love the game but these axies become useless for a while so Im thinking it could be sold at a good price even not with the price of axie nfts before.",

I am trying to get a complete overview of how many games are out there to generate or create a play-to-earn games list for 2024. check it: https://playtoearngames.com/hello OP, this website seems like only reviews p2e games and I checked the links one by one on the homepage but it got 404,. If you want to find a p2e platform that you can trust, check in coinmarketcap in this link: https://coinmarketcap.com/view/play-to-earn/. or you can look for social media like Twitter and Reddit which have special groups where new and upcoming P2E games are often discussed.",
