Believe me, don't be like others who only decide to buy when the price of bitcoin is too high.And I also think it will happen a few months from now. It seems that we are already in the countdown to the approaching bull run, to be honest. This is what I see and observe now.",

Bitcoin is going all-time-high and the least that people should be expecting is $100000. Bitcoin may not reach this price before halving but you should wait for some months after halving and you will be happen. Some people will be looking for bitcoin to decrease to a lower price before they will invest but bitcoin can disappoint such people after increasing more and more.",

The reason is pretty simple. Bitcoins are limited in numbers, that is no more Bitcoins can be created or invented, hence it made the coins very valuable. Now as the days are passing more people are trying to buy the coins. But as the coins are limited, in order to meet the demand, the price goes up. And hence if we buy the coins at current price and hold for some years, still we can make 3x the profit.",

I can also see it on chart that every four years there is a significant peak on the price of Bitcoin that is why it is for me worth the wait if it really happen if not then not a problem.",

Is it now the best time to invest in Bitcoin? It depends on how much profit you expect. It was definitely better to invest when the price was 30K but it's not late or wrong to invest today because bitcoin will reach and surpass its all-time high. From 52K to 70K, you'll see some profit, so it's not late. Btw keep in mind that Bitcoin will definitely reach not only all-time high but will surpass it and reach 100K.",

The fact that you asked this question makes me think that you haven't taken the time to research bitcoin and you just want to invest based on other people's advice. Because if you take the time to learn about bitcoin, you will know that it is never too late to invest in bitcoin. Instead of just looking at the historical low and comparing it to the current price, you think it's too late to invest. Why don't you try to compare the current price with the price it can reach in the future, for example bitcoin will reach 1 million dollars then you will know that it is too early to start.",

Despite this, I personally think that bitcoin still has a lot to improve on therefore I know that the bitcoin’s price will increase more. Not only the price will double, but it can even triple. Bitcoin is volatile and even though a lot of people think that bitcoin’s increase in price is linear, there would be correction phases even during the bull run. The price might go up or go down sometimes and it is all normal. When the price goes down, it is generally a good time to buy and there would still be plenty of time where the price is not constantly going up but also going down. So no, it is not yet too late for others to jump on in the ship.The key is to know when to buy and always be mindful of your goals.",

As a result I want to invest in Bitcoin by taking money from family or borrowing money in hopes of double profit. Since Bitcoin is limited, the bull run hasn't started yet, and Bitcoin is getting halved. On the other hand, I am afraid of losing. Now I am at a loss as to what to do. So I'm waiting for the price to drop to $25K–$30K. I don't know when Bitcoin will come back to this price.I want advice, without being greedy, should I wait 2/3/4 years for the price to drop?  Or do I need to take the risk and invest in Bitcoin now?",

For an invetsor it is still the same to have 1 old share for 2000 USD or 10 new shares for 200 USD each.Bitcoin has not this option to split / look cheaper, so people will always worry if the current price is maybe too high, because of the high numbers",

We know bitcoin halving is still some time since our bitcoin halving is coming very soon so you have to accept that after bitcoin halving the market will definitely go up. If the market definitely goes up after the Bitcoin halving then there is still a good time to invest but rest assured that if the bull run starts a few months after the Bitcoin halving it can definitely go between $100k and $160k.
