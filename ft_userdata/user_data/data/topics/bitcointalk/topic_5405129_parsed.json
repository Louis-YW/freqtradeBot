Most people has a small understanding about what bitcoin is.There is still a upward potential, a lot of room to grow in adoption and usability, but bitcoin has already achieved a lot.",

Correcting people 'because this may be a better way of saying it' will probably get better responses.-DaveI'm definitely not looking to correct the critics on this one.  Their reaction is perfectly reasonable.  My point was that we're the ones not making things clear enough.  The onus falls upon us to explain ourselves coherently.  It's our phrasing I'm seeking to refine, in order to avoid confusion for those \"on the outside\".  The premise is to ask supporters of Bitcoin to be aware of the difference between the technology and the level of adoption.  To avoid conflating them.  I'd suggest a phrase such as \"Bitcoin acceptance is still maturing\" would provide greater clarity than the infancy-type phrases people often use.  That way, it's clear to anyone that we are referring to the usage of Bitcoin.//EDIT:Quote from: franky1 on July 04, 2022, 02:32:44 PMstill maturing = immaturewhere as evolving/growing = expanding, gaining energy size, experienceFair point.  Any further improvements people would suggest upon \"Bitcoin acceptance is still evolving\" in order to give greater clarity?",

What I see is they are looking at the price of Bitcoin to determine where it is. It's not suppose to be like that but rather the amount of users that are utilizing its service. But to know that needs a deeper research which most people won't do. Lazy human nature. I admit I see the progress as slow but its because of the sudden broad of competition in the altcoin industry. It's not a healthy competition anymore.",

In society, especially in my environment, this kind of comparison is quite reasonable and can be adapted to the realm of understanding of the people who are still lacking in technology. As for other terms when dealing with children after adolescence, the comparison is different from what I explained to the public at the age of +50.So, the ideal move would be to describe Bitcoin in terms they hear often but have a valuable selling point.",

Probably 1 per 100 people will be able to explain what bitcoin is and how to hold it. Some studies estimate that over 1% of people around the world own bitcoin, but that's pretty low compared to the number of people around the world who own gold, which is close to 10%. I agree that it's more in its teenage years because I doubt it will surpass the penetration of gold unless gold becomes diluted somehow by new cheap mining.",

Many people that saying that obvious shill post is maybe just new or have a heavy bags of Bitcoin that bought at top. I don’t understand too why the word “it’s too early” is always brought up when they are trying to encourage others to buy and why not brought up the good features of Bitcoin instead so that all new holders will not gonna look only on price but rather on its technology. If we consider the span of growth and development of bitcoin, it has already matured. Bitcoin would never survived over a decade and pass through a lot of attacks if its still in its infancy stage. Those people who always consider and recognize bitcoin as in its early stage and has not proven its worth yet, then probably they are the ones who are new here in crypto but would act as if they knew all about bitcoin. The thing which is most frustrating is that all their claims turn out into fake news, like they are the one who'll not gonna survived in this long journey of bitcoin.",

That most cryptocurrency developers with no moral character try to give solutions to non-existent problems, and re-propose ideas that had already been implemented before, just to make a quick-buck in a seemingly dignified way?The only thing I can tell to a critic is this: Bitcoin is the technology; not blockchain.There's this principle I feel obliged to follow when I code open-source software, and that's probably why being open-source is so beneficial:QuoteOpen source means each problem only has to be solved once.The problems were double-spending and decentralized minting. Someone did found proper solutions and released the code that implements them publicly. The software works like a charm since 2009 with a few protocol changes. However, the entire thing is dependent on a game theory which is also dependent on the system's money units. People who want to try out their ideas in this ecosystem can only make it more powerful by insisting on the currency.Building on top of different currencies causes a fine mess, makes it harder to comprehend the usefulness, and cuts the innovation apart, but unfortunately, the technology incentivizes such creation.",
