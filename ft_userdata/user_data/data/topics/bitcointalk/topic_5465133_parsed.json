  "content": "Currently seeking accredited investors for a bridge round to rebrand/revamp UpTweet.comHere is the purpose of the round: Relevant links:1. https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/uptweet-social-media-and-bitcoin-meet-again-13564839892. http://uptweet.com 3. https://twitter.com/briansantoshi1.Â Â Â Rebrand to a standalone platform that is no longer tied to Twitter. The new name will give us a unique identity and integrate other popular social media networks including Facebook.2.Â Â Â We have successfully developed a Bitcoin advertising platform for sponsored posts. It's now easier than ever to post, comment (post), and repost. 3.Â Â Â Account verification tools are now in place to determine the authenticity of an account (bot or not), and we're working on additional controls to enhance platform security.Future plans:In light of volatile trends in social media and cryptocurrency, we have some evolving strategies to grow our user base and raise more capital:1.Â Â Â Launch of $TWEET, the UpTweet platform's own governance token. It will enable users to foster conversations, win prizes, and vote on significant platform changes. We're also considering a rewards system for $TWEET holders, which would be fueled by the platform.2.Â Â Â DogeCoin integration is on the horizon, because of their massive community!3.Â Â Â Integration of Ethereum and other smart contract-enabled blockchains, including the tokens & NFTs they support. This will help us expand our user base more rapidly and attract sponsorship from emerging Web3 projects.4.Â Â Â An upgrade to our current (buggy) WYSIWYG editor is due. The new editor will be mobile-friendly and meet modern standards.5.Â Â Â We plan to improve our video embedding functionality and introduce user-uploaded videos, similar to YouTube.6.Â Â Â Live streaming functionality is in the pipeline, reminiscent of Twitch, but with real-time Twitter-style conversations (tweets under the stream).7.Â Â Â We'll introduce a leaderboard where users can earn XP, win exclusive NFT badges that can be resold, and compete for weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly prizes.8.Â Â Â To maintain a positive community environment, we're developing enhanced content moderation tools to keep bad actors at bay.Thank you all for your supportâ€¦Â  ðŸ«¡If youâ€™re interested please DM me. All questions welcomed.",
