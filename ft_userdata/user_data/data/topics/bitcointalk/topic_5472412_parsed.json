      "body": "Hallo LoyceV,Than for kindly suggestion, but is not properly as you think. I’ve a lot of different coin staked on more Exchanges. Also I’ve a lot of FUN token staked on freebitcoin. Each loan I take end when some of my staked investments end: so i be sure to have money for repay my debt at any case. As l wrote on other discussion (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5466577.msg62835668#msg62835668) I use loans for my trading activities: this is a sort of money management, that prevents me take too much risks by trading too much money . Everyone could be a good trader, but without money management everyone will be a loser. My results are really good, but I think that the key of my success is money management.Each time i had good results I repaid in advance and started a new loan: this happened a lot of times . Other time results wasn’t so good, so I have to wait stakes deadline for repayment. By taking loans i will be sure that i will never risk more than I can. And I known a lot of person that lose money because they invested more than they could (especially when they initially had some profits).Other about me: in real life I have a good job and just 4 months ago a i bought my first electric car ( I made a post about it on Italian board. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5444827.0). Paid in cash , no debt: at least in real life    Quote from: LoyceV on November 01, 2023, 03:08:35 PMI have to ask: for the past 2 years, I've seen you take larger and larger loans.
