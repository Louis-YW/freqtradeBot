  "content": "Hi fellow degens.I recently found an interesting project called Weavechain  apparently aiming to bring big data over to web3. With strong data ownership rights, increased collaboration, and trust in technology driven by cryptographic truths.The reason I find it really interesting is because Iâ€™ve heard of the difficulty of big data migration and integration onto web3 Weavechain has three main attributes that make it actually useful and key to bridging big data over Performance Architecture that satisfies enterprise data governance: private permissioned sidechains that are networked through a public permissionless mainnet to get the best of security and interoperability.Interoperability for (actually) integrating web3 instead of rip and replace, by giving users the benefits of web3 without the need for new engineering expertise or risky rebuilds.With this little context, what do you guys think about it?",
