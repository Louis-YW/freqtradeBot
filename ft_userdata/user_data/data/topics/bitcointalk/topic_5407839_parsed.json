The next and incoming ranks are achievable as long ad you keep doing contributions and even humorous posy and replied on different topic here.  Piece of advise, dont get discourage if some are gonna criticise you or teach you that you think is right here. Just blend and adapt. Dont be intimidated by some higher rank who thinks they knew everything, cause the truth is everyone here are all newbies as well. Keep it up!",

If you continue to contribute to the forum regularly in a constructive manner, you will move up more ranks. But don't cheat, because there are too many people in your situation who get desperate and choose to take the fast and dishonest way out, so they end up getting caught and it's worse.",

For me, the first priority when i join this forum is to learn and get some knowledge and exchange ideas with other member of this forum and apply it in life, when someone really appreciate your work that is when they give you points. I think this should be our mindset. Does a rank really matter? hmmm at some point it is, where it gives you amount of benefits this forum has to offer, but we should also don't forget why Satoshi made this forum:Quote from: Phoebe BandoyBitcointalk is a public forum where blockchain enthusiasts, developers, and crypto investors discuss topics about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain in general.Source : https://www.meetbunch.com/the-bitcointalk-guide",

You made a mistake with the link.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5391471.0OP, @Agbe is right. You've gone up in rank, and if you think about it, you're not the first, right? Therefore, in order not to create heaps of similar topics, with thanks to yourself or the forum, try reading the topic that @Agbe pointed out to you.Do not take this as criticism, just understand that everyone is tired of such topics. The Merit fishing stunt no longer works as smoothly as it used to.Close the topic, and talk about your rank on this topic.
