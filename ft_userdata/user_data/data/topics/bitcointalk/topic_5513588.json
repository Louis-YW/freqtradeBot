  "content": "As you know, the founders of Samurai wallet are going to trial soon for writing code which is considered free speech. The gravity of this case and the consequences of the decision could be insane for Bitcoin holders. Basically depending on the mood of legislators. You having self custody of your bitcoin could be called a money transmitter and arrested in extreme cases, OR if your code is involved with the block chain and somehow moves enough BTC or crypto currency you could also be arrested.There are sites raising money to attempt to defend Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill by raising funds. I'm here to see what peoples thoughts on this are and I'm sharing links to some sites attempting to do something about this.https://freesamourai.com/https://p2prights.org/donate.htmlI didn't see anything wrong but don't forget to vet and protect yourself before possibly giving or diving further.Cheers!",

The entire point of Bitcoin is to transmit money.Quote from: hypersonic1 on October 18, 2024, 03:31:27 AMThere are sites raising money to attempt to defend Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill by raising funds.

You can defeat the government by running code, you can't defeat the government by begging them for mercy in their own government courtroom.",

There are more cases of trying to arrest/shut down different people and mixers all around and also some not so known exchanges, Cryptex, Bitzlato, and so on.I do think it will continue that way and maybe even further the gap by going after bigger exchanges in some extreme cases, if there is a reason for it.",
