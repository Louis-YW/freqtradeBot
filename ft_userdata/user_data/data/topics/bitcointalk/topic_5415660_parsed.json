Thanks!There are popular channel showing icos and idos but of course the result will not always be the same. Even for groups who continously endorsing new projects, cant really have a consistent record or track of successful projects. There are always outliers and some will turn out to be rug projects. In crypto space only few really got the sense to make a usable project.",

Thanks!There's no need for you to pay for such service because there have been websites like icodrops and as well as coinmarketcap and other the same websites where they're giving the same information for the ico's to come. But since you're new to crypto, you didn't know that ICOs are a thing of the past and they're no longer that good anymore to invest in. It's better for you to buy bitcoin and other top rank altcoins if that's what you're looking for to invest.",

      "body": "If someone urges you to buy something before official launch, always have this doubt that they may be a part of the team or are paid to promote these things. Apart from watching these guys explain why their project is good, do some self digging on all information that you want to know about the project. A lot of times when people say you have to be in a project, they just want to fatten the pig before culling and feasting on it. Yoi can try Telegram groups, reddit, or even this forum for your needs. No need to pay a service, you can learn these things all by yourself and you'll even sharpen your skills in identifying whether a project is great or not.",

If you are looking for ico and ido for now I think they are no longer needed and currently there are many fraudulent projects, so always be careful if you want to invest in new projects. In my opinion, if you want to invest with good altcoins, you better look at the top ones on Coinmarketcap, that way you won't be fooled, because searching for the top altcoins is definitely safe and you will benefit from your investment in the future.",
