  "content": "Bitcoin started its journey from that year 2009 and currently reached 2024. Bitcoin's phenomenal success over the past 15 years is truly mind-boggling. Bitcoin started its journey in 2009 with a very low price. In 2009, the price of Bitcoin finally reached $0.30 and currently the price of Bitcoin is close to $46000. Bitcoin's contribution as the first digital currency in the world is indeed the greatest. One such coin is accepted by the EFF. In the beginning, the value of Bitcoin was very small, but in the four years between 2010 and 2013, the value of Bitcoin reached $123. Again, between 2014 and 2017, the price of Bitcoin went to 750 dollars. In the middle of 2015, Bitcoin suffered major losses. About 50% of Bitcoin's value went down. Also 19 thousand BTC was hacked. But the point is that in 2017 Bitcoin made the first history in the world of crypto currency Bitcoin gained almost 1300% which is really amazing for that time. Poloniex made almost 60% profit in six months with Bitcoin. Thus, between 2018 and 2022, the price of Bitcoin was from $3000 to $30,000 in early 2021, and in mid-2021, the price of Bitcoin exceeded $65,000, which is the highest in Bitcoin history. In 2022, the market price of Bitcoin was again at $15,000, and by the end of 2023, the price of Bitcoin reached $46,000. In the current year 2024, I believe that the value of Bitcoin will exceed $10,000.  All past data suggests that bitcoin price bull markets tend to move upward too quickly.  I think Bitcoin will skyrocket between 2024 and 2026.",

I am sure it will increase and we might again witness atrocious fees that can go beyond 200sat/vB. The miners know it and the developers want the network to get spammed, to keep them from moving anywhere else. I feel this is the first time that the miners are making more in fees than they did in the previous halvings.Quote from: Septex on January 10, 2024, 07:10:44 PMSnip..A small advice when you write on a particular topic ensure that it is divided into paragraphs and does not look like a wall of words. Whatever interesting and engaging topic you wrote will all go down the drain when you write in such a manner. The next suggestion of mine is to reduce the image size, if you are not so clear about BBCode then start learning as it will only help you in presenting your topic more presentable. Here is the code that you need to use while posting an image. You can find more details in this post from BBCode on how to post images. Posting images with BBCode",

I promise you that for example rising from $0.1 to $2 is the same rise as $50 to $1000 and $1000 to $20000 and all of them are a 20x rise.The point is, these ups and downs were happening from the start and just because at the beginning the \"number\" was small doesn't make it less important.Quote from: Septex on January 10, 2024, 07:10:44 PMI think Bitcoin will skyrocket between 2024 and 2026.I believe we will have a bull market but to skyrocket (in the same sense as previous \"bubbles\") is unlikely in my opinion because the sell pressure caused by the global economic strain is still there and as long as it doesn't go away it will prevent that skyrocket.One sign of it going away would be interest rates coming down.... There still is no sign of it though.",

I believe that the reason why the bubbles and bursts are decreasing over the past couple of years is because of the subsequent economic crisis at global scale. Basically ever since 2019-2020 we were in crisis mode with Pandemic and now the Wars. That significantly affects bitcoin's adoption and consequently the size of the bubbles.In other words I believe that if the economic crisis were to end today and they decreased interest rates we would start seeing the biggest bubble so far and half a million as the peak is not going to be that hard to reach.",

But I believe ATH will be achieved next year based on last two bull seasons data as many are expecting bull run this year and we may see some dumps which we have to capitalize on to buy Bitcoin at lesser price.Definitely, if we look his past history, there are patterns on prices, but it's hard to predict where and when and what will be the highest it will go through. And that's why there are early bag holders who tend to sell instead of holding as they thought that bitcoin will not go that far. But look at what happen to it, majority of them regret their decision to sell early. Nevertheless it's not that late for them and for the majority of us to buy and then HODL (specially for those who don't want to trade).And in the incoming bull run, or right after the block halving, bigger prices are to be expected, again. Speculators are predicting a minimum $100K at least as our new all time high. But we will see, it could be +/-, however, if we have accumulate this past couple of years, we might be just sitting in the bull run and see how it unfolds and look how bigger our portfolio will grow.",

I know you get what I mean especially knowing if there's news or event like halving even though halving is known since it will happen once it reaches the amount of blocks being mined.",
