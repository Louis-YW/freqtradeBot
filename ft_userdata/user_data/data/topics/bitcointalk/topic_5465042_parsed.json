  "content": "Binance teamed up with authorities to help arrest key ISIS members in Tajikistan and Turkey, demonstrating their commitment to fighting organized crime involving cryptocurrencies. They played a significant role in capturing individuals connected to an ISIS affiliate by analyzing a Telegram channel and locating a crypto wallet used by a terrorist commander.This collaboration with Tajikistan's Financial Monitoring Department and TRM Labs underscores Binance's dedication to aiding law enforcement and using open-source intelligence to identify risks. While specific details are undisclosed, Binance's involvement has been praised for advancing counterterrorism efforts and combating crypto-related organized crime.Impressive work by Binance. This is a win for counterterrorism and a win for the crypto industry. But at what cost?Some people have raised concerns about the implications of Binance's cooperation with law enforcement. They argue that it could set a precedent for other crypto companies to be forced to share customer data with governments, which could erode privacy and security. Others worry that it could make it more difficult for legitimate users to use crypto, as they may be subject to greater scrutiny.Is it worth it to erode privacy and security in order to fight crime?Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/binance-trm-labs-assists-in-arrest-of-key-isis-members-in-tajikistan-and-turkey",

      "body": "The real point is that if you limit your crime to little, tiny pieces of crime each day, you look way better than a criminal who robs and thieves and murders and steals and terrorizes all at once. So, governments limit themselves to tiny crimes, but a whole bunch of them to make their money... like taxation. They look better than the out-in-the-open terrorists, so the people support the government. Besides, loss of property and imprisonment for not paying taxes.",

Besides, loss of property and imprisonment for not paying taxes.I find your point really intriguing, though I have a different perspective. I believe you might be simplifying how crime works and the role that governments play. Crime is not just a matter of quantity, but also of quality. Some crimes are more harmful than others, and some crimes have more victims than others. Taxation is not a crime. It's a way of pooling resources for services that could possibly benefit everyone.Governments aren't perfect, but they aren't inherently bad either. They consist of people with diverse opinions and interests who answer to the public they serve. If you disagree with how your taxes are used, you can elect a different government or get involved in civic activities to influence policies. Using crypto could give you more control over your finances and let you support causes you're passionate about. But completely avoiding taxes wouldn't be fair to society and could harm the greater good.",

Binance strengthens its position so that it is not said that it encourages the financing of suspicious activities, and in doing so it sacrifices the privacy of users because nothing guarantees that a terrorist or any suspicious person will use his real identity when using Binance or any of the Telegram channels, and it must be proven that the person is involved with the same name used in registration. In order not to accuse another innocent person.",

When you look up the 'something', you find that it means 'something else'. When you look up 'something else', you find that it means fraud or thievery. So, tax is fraud and thievery, illegal stuff.",

However, it must be clear were the line is supposed to be drawn in order to defend the basic privacy of each individual who is supposed to be considered not guilty until proven otherwise, in the case of those terrorist groups, law enforcement is supposed to proceed with the due process.The debate comes when exchanges and other services are allowed to provide complete information about us, our addresses and identities to foreign agencies, even though (because we are not criminals) we are supposed to be down in the scale of necessary scrutiny; whether we like it or not those kind of data bases and agencies categorize people according to characteristics which are not supposed to have anything to do with criminality: nationality, family members, age, even family name; something we learnt of the Snowden leaks.",

I don't like seeing crypto-currencies affiliating with terrorism at all, same for scams.I don't see any news about that in local news outlets though. I guess it's only for Tajikistan. If an arrest was made here, it would break the news eventually.",
