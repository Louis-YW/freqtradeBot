Most people lost their homes to the flood, and they have not been able to rebuild them due to a lack of funds, and yet the government does not lend a helping hand to them. The Nigerian Federal Government still thinks that this flood stuff is funny, so they will not combat it now until things really get out of hand. Instead, they will see it as a means of squandering money during the process of sharing those food items after every flood. Before Nigerians know it, the sharing of those food items after the flood will turn into a business deal where the team involved in the disbursement will steal from the funds and governors will steal from the states.I think until every part of Nigeria, both states, capitals, villages, and towns, gets affected by this flood, they may not really look for a permanent solution. This is the right time for them to fetch a solution.",

While those affected areas are suffering and still waiting for rescue, the senate are still arguing what to do instead of taking action to resolve the problem. There was also a time that the intended donations and relief goods along with the money were pocketed by the officials and the goods that arrived on the affected area are either expired or rotten. This was when Yolanda hit our country and thousands of people died.",

      "body": "This flood matter is a very big issue that has and is still causing many problems; from loss of lives to food insecurity. As a matter of fact, my community, at the bank of the Orashi River, was 98% submerged under water and this turned the once agricultural community to a place of hunger and starvation.  Worse still, there are still predictions that the flooding of this year will be bigger than that of previous years (source: https://www.thecable.ng/actions-should-be-taken-early-nema-warns-of-massive-flooding-in-2023/amp) .Combating the flood will need the intervention of government and various stakeholders as the process is capital intensive and requires strong political will. Some of the measures that presents a feasibly sollution include but not limited to :1. Dredging of River Niger, River Orashi and other tributaries. 2. Building a tunnel that will connect River Orashi to the Soibriro River to take some of the volumes at peak period. 3. Building artificial water storages in Adamawa, and other northern states where such water can be used for irrigation purposes. 4. Ensuring proper drainage system and strong orientation on amoral dumping of refuse. If these measures are put in place, am confident the flood will be checked and we can even realise some gains from it in terms of agriculture.",

This lead to many unrest and lost to lives and properties, no one ever pray for their country or region to witness such again. Just recently, I heard from a friend saying that this year we’re going to experience more flood than the previous year, I don’t know how true it is, but whatever the case may be, I hope the government find a way to combat it before it escalates like the previous year.",
