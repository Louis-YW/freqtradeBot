  "content": "If you are still trying to find a good reason to buy some bitcoin, Well, over the night, I was watching some crypto related videos on YouTube, and while going through the comment section, I found this comment which really made a lot of sense to me, and I thought to share it here..The dude, who ever he is said, \"if he can spend a $100 to $200 dollars daily on food and drink, and wake up the next day to piss and shit it out without bothering whether there be profit or not, then not a bad idea to spend some of that money buying an asset that has the potentials of earning you some profit, no matter how small\".Sure nothing special about this statement, but I just find the analogy interesting, maybe its because this is something we do everyday and have come to terms with it as the basics of life and existence, many of us tend to easily without looking back, spend good amount of money on things that add very little to no profit or value on our financial lives, like eating out in an expensive hotel or restaurant, but when it comes to spending on that one thing that has the potential to add some positive figures into our finances, we begin to do a lot of calculating and analyzing  , is this not us indirectly cheating ourselves?",

Don't deprive yourself too much of your happiness.Good food doesn't have to be expensive. 100$-200$ food, what's so unique about it in terms of the enjoyment that food can give? Undoubtedly, this food is overpriced, because the owner of the establishment wants to cash in on you. The same applies to other pleasures and entertainments. A lot of things in this life are overpriced and a lot of good things, like good food, can be had for less. By the way, it is not the price that makes the food good and tasty.",

At some point, investment decisions should also be added to one's list of needs and not wants, as they are also important parts of one's life. People are just fine. It is very easy to spend money on their wants and pleasures without giving it a second thought, with the belief that those things are contributing to their happiness, which gives them a rest of mind that can equally guarantee their health and safety. When it comes to investments, you and I (Op) know that those are not easy decisions to make. The guy on YouTube used the illustration based on his own financial status, so those 100–200 dollars could just be like a dollar to him. But for an average earner, he needs to consider where his money is going,  the risk involved in it, if it's worth it or not, and if he is unsure of it. Sometimes it is better for them to spend it on things they think will add to their nourishment than put money on things they don't know what the outcome will be.",

You shouldn't limit your entertainment too much just to make investments imo. It is always OK to save money to buy bitcoin but living like a plant will harm you mentally in the long run. I would never advise this to any of my friends. If you are not going to enjoy a good meal and some drinks every once in a while, I can't call that \"living\". It is more like being a slave to me and I can't live like that. Nobody should because we are all people. Obviously that doesn't mean that we should spend all of our monthly income on booze. I don't mean that. There should be a balance.",

This context is quite fitting when applied to a situation where investing in Bitcoin takes precedence over indulging in temporary delights of food and drinks.I perceive the order of priority from the three contexts above as follows:1. Eating and drinking for sustenance and nourishment.2. Bitcoin investment.3. Eating and drinking for leisurely enjoyment.Moreover, investing in Bitcoin not only holds great potential for profits but also, under unfavorable circumstances, can deplete one's funds. The money that could have been spent on creating momentary happiness ends up lost due to weak investment strategies in Bitcoin.Regardless of the perspective, I concur that Bitcoin investment should take precedence over eating, drinking, and reveling in fleeting festivities. We can celebrate and enjoy ourselves later, once we reap the benefits from Bitcoin, which deserves top priority.",

His point is that it is important to try to get the attitude and habit of investing daily in assets as you eat and drink daily. investing little by little may not look like you are doing enough, but little gets to much with a consistent habit of gathering little. Also, we can also say that as you try to consistently invest, do not do it at the expense of food, that is you skip meals and eat less nutritious meals just because you want to invest. Good food is necessary for good health.",
