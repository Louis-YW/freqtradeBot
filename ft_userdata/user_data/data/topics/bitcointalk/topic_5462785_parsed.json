I have known a site like AliExpress that they have sellers that are selling ASICs. But best if he ask for help on this forum if he wants the ASICs cheaper. Bitmain Antminer is the best manufacturer for ASICs and he can go through their site to buy one of the lastest one that they have. He can even make some research and look for offline places that he can buy such machines from. I was surprised when I found out that I can buy ASIC from a town very close to my town, I noticed this when I some someone on TikTok that bought his own there, but the price is not still cheap at all.",

Your best course of action is to reach out to your bank, discuss your available options, and ask whether they can initiate a SWIFT recall.",

Many high level youtubers stated it's real and was shipped their products. These included Rabid Mining, Red Panda mining and many others.2. Kaspa discord server also shows many people ordered from there and successfully received their goods.3. The company was presented at an event in HongKong with their products. See more here: https://twitter.com/IceRiverMiner4. There were many fake \"reproductions\" of the original iceriver.io website (the same happened for Jinglemining with the Jasminer back 2 years ago).However, I think they have either ran out of product and are still accepting payments, or in some cases are completely unconcerned that payments have been made and just don't care and that's why they've added more bank accounts and closed others.I believe they are a legitimate company that is now scamming people by accepting their money and having no products to send and therefore claiming that no-money ever arrived.",

That means they have your payment now, so that is why they put it waiting for delivery, it's not yet over until they deliver what you ordered, what matters is they confirm that they have your payment so they have to deliver.I'm sure you can track your order so you'll know it's coming, there are a lot of other complaints I wonder if they already addressed it or if they have a chance to get what the others have ordered, let's see their action in you case in the coming days.",
