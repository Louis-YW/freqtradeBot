  "content": "I like new innovations, I do, but some needs to be questioned because this days many are running after new ideas and they are ready to throw money at any, that's not me, will it work? I have every right to ask questions, so famz please follow me on this ... A minute of your time is all I ask Have your heard about Mask Network? With Blueish icon and smily face? This project claim it allows it's users to Send encrypted messages over Twitter and Facebook, it acts as a bridge between the internet and a decentralised network.Trying to run decentralised encrypted messages on twitter and Facebook which are both fully centralised doesn't make sense to me, this can make the project a target from the centralised side of power hungry entities, you know what I mean.It will become a threat faster than anything, like I've said, this could be a childish guess, maybe there is more I don't know but imagine sending encrypted messages on Twitter which can't be traced, they aren't gonna like that.What's your take on this? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”",

      "body": "If i encrypt a message (either using symmetric or asymmetric encryption), it's either only the receiver that holds the private key that can decrypt it (asymmetric encryption) or both sender and receiver can decrypt it (symmetric encryption). The medium you use to post an encrypted message doesn't matter for the technical encryption and decryption part. If you send an encrypted message over an non-ssl encrypted connection, it should still be secure (if you chose a good encryption scheme)... The only difference between sending it over an ssl encrypted connection and a non-ssl encrypted connection is that in the first case, only you and facebook/twitter can decrypt the package going over the network, and in the latter case anybody can read the packages going over the network... But the encrypted message is posted on a public page anyways...That being said: if you use a platform like twitter or facebook, you are right... It's possible they won't like it when somebody posts encrypted text... I don't know... that's completely up to them... Also, if you don't take the proper precautions (like using tor, or a vpn), they'll know the ip of the sender and the receiver (unless you use a thirth party to post encrypted messages and receive them... In that case the thirth party probably has your ip).This idear seems like a big hassle to me... Why put a big company that keeps loads of logs in the middle between an encrypted communication channel?",

I'm satisfied with this explanation, I lack some knowledge about the decrypt part so thanks for sharing. It thus look like something that will work out, I will definitely spend more time on the project before spending a penny.",
