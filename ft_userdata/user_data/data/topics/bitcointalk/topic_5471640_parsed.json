The four pinned posts on the beginners and help addresses almost all first time questions and then they still ask those questions, i have settle with it that those questions seems like an initiation process where one just have to ask them to announce he just registered. Many of us did it and many will still do it. Moreover it is sometimes not just a simple task to just pin any post because that will mean the forum administrators or moderators agree totally with the pined thread. The only thread I will wish to see been pinned is the  Beginners & Help Encyclopedia by Ratimov because entails almost all meaningful threads but will that eliminate the threads created on questions about the forum? I will say NO",

If you look carefully, the topics pinned at the top of the META AND BEGINNERS AND HELP board should suffice for newcomers looking to start their journey with the forum and Bitcoin. Unfortunately, many of these threads are outdated. When new members create such posts, as mentioned by @Zaguru12, it's essentially an announcement of their registration and a request for guidance from other members. It would greatly improve the experience if newbies were provided with up-to-date guides upon joining the forum.",

      "body": "Like Zaguru has said, it won't work. There are a lot of threads that have been created to help newbies stand out and don't ask a lot of questions, but the issue is how many of those newbies will find it necessary to read through those threads that have been made available for them. They will see the pin post and still create threads to ask questions that have been answered multiple times. If there is some solution that will aid this, which I doubt will even work, it's for the forum admin to help and pin some of the useful posts on the registration page, where newbies will have to see the message pop up whenever they want to sign up or immediately log in to the forum. They should be able to see some of the forum rules pop up just as other platforms show their T&C, but even as that, many people will still click on what I have read and understand without even reading it.",

Many of us did it and many will still do it.  You have a point on this. Whether you pin these helpful guidelines and write in bold letters \"must read\" there's still those who will deliberately pass it and still do what they wanna. For me, this suggestion is not only a waste of time but effort as well because it will just occupy space. By the way, who said these noobs can't make use of the search function? I've seen some make reference to previous posts been made on the forum when they are trying to make a point. It's just that some of them are either too lazy or just enjoy making spamming.",

I think that was were I was getting it wrongly because I didn't devote my time and energy at then but till I have to change my ways of posting and reading then it was that easy. To hide important things from people who doesn't read is to put it in written form I know many people won't see it.",

      "body": "A very nice idea that you came with but unfortunately it won't work on the newbies of this forum. Most of the newbies don't read pinned posts because they think that pinned posts as they really want to explore the forum themselves and that's why they will ask questions again and again until they learn about forum in detail from other members. There are a few newbies who will not understand anything for long durations and in search of learning they create so many threads. A single pinned thread won't satisfy their questions and that's why they will continue to search for some answers and in that search they will create more threads. However, I believe that you idea is a good one and I suggest you to work on it yourself and if your thread contains all the information then who knows the moderators of that board might consider to pin it up. But, I still think that it will be among many other threads that are available on that board.",

When I was new to this forum, I read a lot of forum rules in pinned threads. The problem isn't a lack of topics explaining how the forum works but rather that new members don't take the time to read.Too many pinned posts are also unsightly, new posts will be below them and not very visible. So what is there now is good, no need to add new posts to pin, just update it",

I have a suggestion that the thread be a \"Beginner's guide from A to Z\". In that thread there will be all the instructions for beginners to read in full about the forum guidelines and rules. Like:1. Forum rules 2. Rank System 3. Trust system 4. What is DT 5. etcIt might help new members to learn about the forum, but if they want to read it",

Well, seriously, today’s beginners need a post with capital letters stating that there is enough information on the forum to learn about Bitcoin, and the first thing to note is that this forum is not about making money. Unfortunately, many beginners are quite hasty and do not understand that education is the same as money.",
