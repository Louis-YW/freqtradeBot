I wish we see less speculators adopt bitcoin who want to make a quick (fiat) profit and get out. I wish to instead see more people adopt bitcoin who want financial sovereignty. QuoteDo you think that with the lower inflation rate and upcoming halving Bitcoin can finally be put side by side with Gold?If you mean bitcoin's \"inflation rate\", I don't think halving is going to change anything about bitcoin to put it side by side with gold. They don't fall into the same category regarding age, spendability, adoption scale or even supply cap (gold isn't as limited as bitcoin).If you mean the global inflation rate, your question makes more sense since inflation will always push people towards converting their fiat to something that is a better store of value. Both gold and bitcoin are good options for that.QuoteAre there any possible ways that Bitcoin can be regulated without Nakamoto? I think only centralized exchanges will remain regulated and projects like Bitcoin can't be touched. What do you think?With or without the inventor of Bitcoin, it can never be regulated because it goes against its principles of being decentralized. However, centralized services like exchanges will be built on top of bitcoin and will be regulated.QuoteWill banks and BTC forever remain enemies or something new will come up?I don't think their position is going to change until mass adoption (which we aren't even close to).",

With or without Satoshi Nakamoto, it is not a matter for governments.QuoteI think only centralized exchanges will remain regulated and projects like Bitcoin can't be touched. What do you think?Bitcoin will be regulated indirectly when people want to sell their bitcoins on centralized exchanges, use bitcoins in merchant platforms.Fortunately, if people store their bitcoin in non custodial wallets, governments won't be able to touch it regardless of they have reasons to catch you as a crime.QuoteWill banks and BTC forever remain enemies or something new will come up?They compete with each other and force each other to improve but they will co exist. Banks and Bitcoin won't have their missions to kill the another one so I don't consider they are enemies.I wish that more people will read The bullish case for Bitcoin. It is helpful for them to build up their knowledge on Bitcoin and strengthen their belief in Bitcoin.If they want to buy books. Check out The bullish case for Bitcoin on AmazonLindy effect will become bigger with time and Bitcoin will be another gold.QuoteFurthermore, the Lindy effect suggests that the longer Bitcoin remains in existence the greater society‚Äôs confidence that it will continue to exist long into the future. In other words, the societal trust of a new monetary good is asymptotic in nature, as is illustrated in the graph below:",

But I'd also add that I wish to remove all of the misconceptions about bitcoin for more people to recognize its usage and to lessen the number of people being a victim of volatility in its price because they lack the knowledge. As more people are knowing this technology, there is also a growth with the articles and topics which could give awareness towards non-crypto users. And if this progressive development would continue, I believe that it would yield for a betterment of this technology in general.Quote from: Ojima-ojo on January 04, 2023, 11:35:22 AMQuote from: Broadanbig on January 04, 2023, 11:26:33 AMOn the occasion of bitcoin forth coming birthday celebration, here are my wishes for bitcoin;I believe bitcoin will gain more adoption as the year's roll by and for the fact that we already have two countries who have legally adopted bitcoin, it will become easier for those coming into bitcoin to at least build some knowledge because what we need in the Bitcoin ecosystem is true Bitcoin users who know the fundamentals of bitcoin as an alternative currency and also an asset.
