The price of bitcoin dipped further since weeks back, exchange inflow is normal because people wants to sell their bitcoin at the time.

Basically there are only 2 occasions where it was very profitable following those alerts and it was 2 weekends ago when bitcoin dumped to $17.5K and ETH to $885. And the hint was that during Saturday open there was lots of coins being sent to exchanges which was odd on a Saturday and a huge dump happened right after.Second one was when that Shiba whale sent his Billions dollar worth of ShibaINU and everybody started dumping the coin as a result because he was going to start liquidating his holding. I think if you shorted there you would of never had it move against you and would be in great profit.Other times it didn't mean anything when large wallets were moving around coins.",
