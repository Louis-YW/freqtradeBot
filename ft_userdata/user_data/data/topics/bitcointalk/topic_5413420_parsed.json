I agree with you, this site doesn't have any difference from the other ones who promote casinos just to get new referrals.I would like to see a site different too... maybe some video reviews of the casinos or maybe some simulation tools would make the difference.",

I see you have quite a list of crypto casinos and I think it will confuse your visitors to choose the right casino site for them. I can't say anything because your site is ready to compete with other review sites and if you can promote your site to become a good review casino site, you will get a lot of members who join through the links on your site.",

So I advise you do all that is within your ability to stay clear from offering reviews to scam casinos with a bad reputation.",

The difference are the reviewed casino websites, biased rating, even giving higher rate on proven suspicious and scam casino.

How do you expect your site to gain traction when most sites are FIAT sites op?Also, another common mistake is the inclusion of shady sites like Bitstarz which implies that you don't mind advertising them for your own benefit op.",
