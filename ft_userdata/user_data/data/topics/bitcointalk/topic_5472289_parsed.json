  "content": "With the recent problem wey dey go on for Rivers State nai make me come up with this yarn and I say make we all put bodi. None of us be stranger to the term or word \"godfather\" because people dey use am Wella as e no dey get only one use case. The term Godfather mean; a sponsor at a baptism or one having a relation to someone analogous to that of a male sponsor to his godchild. Such as one that founds, supports or inspires. This definition nah according to Oxford dictionary. For the Nigerian system and infact for politics at large, godfatherism nah a politically corrupt way of an influential candidate handpicking a less influential candidate to attain leadership in order to exert influence or authority. In lay man terms, this nah so that the Godfather fit still dey rule even when he no hold physical power of office. Now, we all know the recent issue wey dey happen for the State of Rivers between ex Governor Nyesom Wike wey be Minister of works for Abuja and the incumbent Governor, Sir Siminilaye Fubara. Though, the main reason behind this cata cata never dey revealed, sources believe say Wike don too press the governor, like say him no suppose get say in the affairs of the State. To him(Wike) Fubara sopoz be ceremonial leader. As everything wey get beginning, dey get end, oga Sim don tire and e no wan do again. The result of him disobedience; Wike don put call to impeach am and nah the mata we dey try to settle like dis. E no get how e wan be, once you become a godson to these overbearing Godfathers, just prepare to be a puppet and I come dey ask, e sopoz be like this? For how long wey we go dey need a certain approval or push before we get to certain pedestal for life? How una see this mata, is Fubara sopoz to fight for his freedom or e just dey raise dust wey go still settle after Wike don settle the right pipo?https://punchng.com/rivers-assembly-in-crisis-as-wikes-loyalists-move-to-impeach-fubara/",

How can a governor of a state like Rivers not have a single opinion when if the state fails he will receive the blame and vice versa. By law, he is the chief security officer as well as chief executive officer of the state... it will be wrong for one man somewhere to decide who he gives contract, who visits him, who he talks to and when he should go out. Being a godfather requires you relaxing and watching your boys deliver while consulting you once in a while to seek guidance and opinion. We know the Wike played in the election of SIM, we know he made him the governor but that is not enough reason he has to choke SIM that much. Allow the governor to breath abeg... you don serve 8 years so make the young man put things in place and give you the normal returns and regards you deserve. Being a godfather comes with sense!",

As a godfather,  your duty na to give fatherly advice and guide your godson base on say you get plenty experience.  Normally the godson suppose appreciate the political godfather.  But for this our naija, appreciation money dey fixed. Terms and conditions dey follow godfather/godson agreements. Make political godfathers allow their appointed godsons work!  This people dey rob us under our nose. I love this fight,  it will stop to an extent some excesses of godfathers in the state. Now, the governor can be fully accountable to the people and not his godfather . For the past few months,  the governor has been rendered incapacitated because he had to dance to the tune of his master(s). This is liberation for the Rivers people.",

      "body": "Although the who news about the impeachment and other incidents surrounding it like the bombing of the state assembly complex and the shooting of the governor's envoy in an attempt to either shoot the governor or scare him off the power are still allegations pointing direct fingers at the former governor Wike who is now the minister of FCT.What further makes the pointing of these accusing fingers fixated on Wike is not far from the reasons below.1. It is a trajectory in the political history of River State where Godfatherism has always been a case between the predecessors and successors. Although, it is not Rivers state in isolation, it is a case that has been plaquing our democracy since from inception. As a foundation, before I come to Rivers, it has happened in Lagos in the case of Ambode who was to return to office for a second tenure but was truncated and given to another person, who seems to be more loyal to the godfather.Another case was that of Adams Oshiomole and Godwin Obaseki, who was the voluntary Chairman of the Edo State Economic and Strategic Team and handled closely all the economic activities of the government. Because of how delicate that position was and the his performance in policies and other reforms, he became very close to his boss and was to later succeed him as the next Governor. Obaseki became the first Governor to be elected under the APC in the state through the Anointment of Oshiomole. Afterwards, he was to be controlled and micromanaged by the predecessor which caused them into chaos and the rift led the predecessor to be suspended in the party and subsequently, reduced popularity. This gave birth to the popular slogan \"Edo no be Lagos\".Another one was in Ebonyi State between the governor and deputy governor. The governor, Elechi in Labour party never endorsed his deputy but the deputy, who later succeeded him as the governor, David Umahi ensured that the predecessor retired back to his farmland.Similarly, it happened in Imo state when Rochas Okorocha anointed his son-in-law and tried to bring him to power but failed too. The same thing happened in Rivers state between the then Governor Rotimi Amaechi who brought his boy but failed ony for Wike to become his successor. And the list goes on.So, ordinarily, when you see these incidents happen, a tussle and fight with an incumbent Governor, it is not far fetched to point accusing fingers to the predecessor.2. Since the Rivers state crisis unfolded, with the case of the bombed state assembly complex and other cases, the past Governor, who is now the Minister of FCT, Wike, have not responded to calls from journalists and other media platforms to react to the incidents. Although he claimed in an interview with Channels that he would not interfere with the new government but there have been several news reading to his overbearing powers to install cabinets of the new Governor with or without his personal input. It is only natural to resolve that he is the masterplanner of the crisis since he has made himself unavailable to respond to these allegations leveled against him at this material time.3. Another thing is that, the elder statesmen of Rivers state have traveled down to Abuja to meet with the Minister to iron out the differences they must have had with the incumbent Governor so that the rift can end amicably without further chaotic incidents. It is obvious that he is a key player in this, hence their move to meet and discuss with him.4. The utterances coming from the governor further validates the notion that it's another incident of Godfatherism between him and his former boss. Wike single-handedly brought Fubara to power by campaigning for him across all the local government areas of the state as well as using the resources at his disposal to ensure Fubara emerged at the polls, so it is presumed to be a case of 'rub my back and I rub yours'. Now that Fubara have tasted the sweetness of power, he wants to be left alone to work for his people or run his government.Will This Crisis Last-long or Be Short-lived?The longevity of this Crisis will be dependent on the major actors in the resolution of this dispute.The Followers, The Elder Statesmen, The Incumbent Governor and The Minister of FCT.The role of the followers is simply for them to stand with what is right and make their voices heard on it. Their clear interest and outcry to justice will speedy up the resolution of this dispute most especially as it will persuade the godfather to sheath his sword and let peace reign. Culminated in the followers include the Civil Society Organizations who should also put their words out there and ensure that they put pressure on the godfather to let peace reign.The role of the Elder Statesmen is for them to hold on to the truth, gather the right information and approach the godfather with their stance in the case. Wike may be stubborn to follow their instructions but their level of composure and compulsion will help to pressurize Wike to let go of this fight. They also need to approach the president should their visit to Wike isn't honored as supposed, to mske sure Wike allows Fubara reign in his kingdom.The role of the incumbent Governor is to stand for what is right and inform the negotiators or mediators of whatever commitments he had made to his boss before taking this seat. I am pretty sure there would be some covenants or commitments he must have made in terms of promises to follow his commands, he should let the negotiators eg. elder statesmen, know about it so they can find lasting solution to this problem.Lastly, the role of the minister, Nyesom Wike, is to give a listening hear to whatever arrangements the negotiators come with and allow peace to reign. He should also realize that the development of the state is at stake and it is practically not possible to impeach the governor as he now commands some powers and respect. Wike must also learn to give in to the decision of the negotiators and agree to whatever solutions they intend to proffer especially as it positively impart on the people of the state.",

The only problem with Nigerian style of mentorship its that the so called mentors turns into dictators with time. Lemme further settle on the case in rivers state, its a case of excess greed from Wike, who poses as the man of the people and secretly  oppresses them. He brought Fubara in quite alright, but his demands from him are beyond comprehension. From information I gathered through some political big boys, Wike is demanding a whooping 25% of the total allocation of the state while Fubara is agreeing to give him 10% going forward. You can never see these information in the media cos its classified.If the above is true, then Wike is very wicked, selfish and doesn't want the progress of rivers state people. Upon all the money he has made for himself and is still making, he still wants to cripple his successor by leaving him with very little to execute his official duties. Its very sad that most governors don't perform well because of these entanglements with previous administration.",

Who know fubara before wike endorse am and use all the illegal means take put am for seat. If you aren't going to be loyal, don't accept the deal to begin with because wike dey very right at wetin him dey do when you look am from the point of business and loyalty which is what they have all turned our politics to but morally wetin wike dey do no good because it'll be hindering the growth of the state and if him love us as him talk make him focus for Abuja leave Rivers state alone. Rivers state can't have a godfather, I been dey think say wike go fit do Jagaban for Rivers but e dun dey scatter already. Port Harcourt politicians can't be loyal and that has just been proven.

If wike wan pull down fubara him go fit do am because him get state and federal power. Wike na coded man oh, I sure say him get dirty on fubara before giving him dat ticket because na wetin him dey do from time. Wike is a political father and from this side wey we from, godfatherism will always be a norm. Even for oyinbo land dem get godfathers but their own na say their politicians dey help develop the place and not just stealing money into their pocket. When a state get better plans, the state go dey move forward like Lagos state irrespective of the godfatherism wey dey happen for the state. As fubara dun talk, this is a inhouse fight between father and son and I believe it'll be resolved soon.",

How can a governor of a state like Rivers not have a single opinion when if the state fails he will receive the blame and vice versa. By law, he is the chief security officer as well as chief executive officer of the state... it will be wrong for one man somewhere to decide who he gives contract, who visits him, who he talks to and when he should go out. Being a godfather requires you relaxing and watching your boys deliver while consulting you once in a while to seek guidance and opinion. We know the Wike played in the election of SIM, we know he made him the governor but that is not enough reason he has to choke SIM that much. Allow the governor to breath abeg... you don serve 8 years so make the young man put things in place and give you the normal returns and regards you deserve. Being a godfather comes with sense!When you have a godfather in this country just forget all your problems are already solve and it is very very crazy when it comes to the time of politics in country if you want to context for any post for this country you just make sure that you have one big politician and you will definately win the post you context for.",

He must be someone that have capacity, someone that can fix things for you and who will be willing to go dirty to make things align for you. Godfatherism is seen in everything, even in the ministries, educational sector, religious institutions.  There is this popular saying: \"follow who know road\", that is a way of glorifying godfatherism. It may not actually be a Nigerian thing because in the formal world, they call it mentorship. It is believed that when you have a mentor, you grow faster in your career and in life generally because he will be like a guide to you. Unfortunately,  the Nigerian context added some modifications to make it cult-like where the mentee is sometimes bounded by oath, this is where the problems start. This practice also add a kind of master-slave relationship to the entire thing thereby making it look discouraging to keeping a mentor especially in politics.",

People need to understand that life is in phases and at certain phase, you will need others to get to your desired destination just like they also became something through other people.The case between sim and Oga Wike na one whenever I see people analysing it, it annoys me to my bone. Before Wike became the governor of the state, Amaechi was there and others also assisted him before he won the election as the governor. While he was the governor, if the truth is to be told,  you will know that he was a serious dictator and I doubt he was loyal to any existing structure or past leader and so it make me laugh when I see him expecting loyalty from another person.He should understand that he has served the state well to the best of his knowledge and should give sim his own chance to give to the state whatever is plan his",
