A lot of revolution has taken place in the financial system from the inception of trades and settlements, the decentralized system might still not be the end. Government are still issues here, it might not take too long for them to take their final stance on this.And yes, I believe the world is still experiencing, more developments are still yet to come.",

It will not be a miracle it will be chaos and you can see it happening everywhere it has been tried.Quote from: Z-tight on June 16, 2023, 08:30:24 AMSo many bitcoiners all around the world are managing their finances easily with BTC, all you need to do is use a self custody wallet, and if you control your keys, you control and manage your funds.There are just 6 million addresses with a balance of over $1000, let's go way lower,  $100, that would be 16 million at maximum, probably way less by at least 1/5 since a lot of users have funds in multiple addresses.So, we either agree that less than 0.1% of the world owns Bitcoin, or....that the majority still hold their coins on centralized platforms.",

Humans are capable of learning, there are already people who are capable of managing their finances.  There are even lectures and books and how to do that.  I do not know why you think human are incapable of such, the world is to huge, we have to look out of our window in order to see some of them better yet to explore the vastness of the world.QuoteOr is Bitcoin an experiment to show that we're not capable of managing our own belongings and do require central authority?I do not know what are you trying to convey here, there are people who offer to manage other people's belongings so it means people are capable it is that many are too lazy to do or learn it.",

As much as we think that it will take over the world, no, not going to happen. We still have the central banks and fiat like the USD which will still be here.Crypto and bitcoin is just another alternative. And as we can see, governments are trying to curb it out as early as this year. When bitcoin is still in it's infancy (10+ years of existence). Of course we can used it to make profits and maybe live a good life, but that's it though.",

Or is Bitcoin an experiment to show that we're not capable of managing our own belongings and do require central authority?No, Bitcoin isn't the final form of decentralization for humans because no one knows that what the future holds for humans. The things will be very different from today in coming decades and the technology may reach very high heights in future. Although, Bitcoin is the best form of decentralization till date but considering it the final form won't be justice because who knows that in coming era there will be more and more inventions that could take decentralization to another level. The Bitcoin is truly a savior for the lover of decentralization and its the king of the crypto-currencies, and after its creation the many new decentralized projects started appearing. In the world of decentralized finances there isn't a competitor of Bitcoin and there won't be one in coming years, but the decentralized technology is not limited to finances only and there have been other decentralized technologies like decentralized VPN's and Tor. Those things are at another level of providing decentralization and may help you to browse internet anonymously without sharing your personal IP address.",

Or is Bitcoin an experiment to show that we're not capable of managing our own belongings and do require central authority?If I understand your question correctly, you wonder if the idea of Bitcoin may be doomed to fail, because humanity could continue to require centralized authorities.I don't think that's the case. There is still a chance, decentralized solutions will fail. The reason being, those in control are not willing to give up their power.The next years and decades will be full of turmoil, old-power-structures vs new-freedom-seeking individuals. Who will prevail I don't know. But one thing is for sure, we do not require central authority, especially in regards of sound money. Maybe there will be a long phase of transition, where some central authorities are inevitable. But at some point of technological and educational development they will become obsolete. Although Bitcoin's technology may be a century too early for that, yes.",

But Bitcoin is the first successful implementation of decentralized architecture in the financial world. Prior to Bitcoin, everything was centrally controlled. Whatever tokens you are seeing in the market today, are all based on the idea of bitcoin. So I am not sure what other steps to be taken really! Also, Bitcoin is not here to prove anything to anyone. It has just given the power in the hands of common people which wasn't there earlier. It's a hard reality and nothing sort of an Utopia. So if you are referring to the end of an Utopia, I bloody don't know what you are talking about!",

Or is Bitcoin an experiment to show that we're not capable of managing our own belongings and do require central authority?It's more than just controlling your Bitcoin/assets. It's about decentralization of power to avoid abuse. The Bitcoin Model is actually necessary for the survival of  humanity and proper functioning of human society. The model exists in nature, for example the human cells. They are more like billions of little humans, each having  a copy of the \"Blockchain\" in form of DNA for checking and balancing the decisions other cells make for the body/system. They are quite similar when compared with the Bitcoin system. The humans/nodes are more like cells having copies of the Blockchain to check and balance the activities of others within the Bitcoin system. The Blockchain is record of information chained vertically to one another similar to the DNA. Get a picture of a DNA and compare it with the Blockchain and you may be amazed. Every cell within the body has a copy of the DNA just like every node/human within the Bitcoin system should a copy of the Blockchain. That's how things are supposed to be in nature and human society. The current centralized model of the Fiat system is artificial and dangerous/evil. Nature seems to value decentralization especially in an imperfect world. It's dangerous to hand over your power, rights, assets, etc to centralized power in such a world. Unfortunately, the world currently does it because it's in deep sleep, dead or enslaved.",

But anyway,  I tried to get a better sense of understanding from your questions,  @OP.@OP, first I want you to know that Bitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency, and ever since Bitcoin making success, there have been some cryptocurrencies that tried to mimic Bitcoin, but their success is still tarrying (and likely will not succeed). Also, even some old coins like Bitcoin Cash and LTC and nonsense BSV have not been able to beat Bitcoin, so, as far as crypto is concerned, I still don't believe there could be any other coin that could suppass Bitcoin, so, yeah, Bitcoin could be the only decentralized asset or currency that humans can live with (or may not in the century to come, I can't tell the future).Quote from: lepar on June 16, 2023, 02:16:52 AMDecentralization has long been dreamed by all different social models, is there another step to be taken?not all, but by some, I guess.QuoteOr is Bitcoin an experiment to show that we're not capable of managing our own belongings and do require central authority?It's not an experiment to show anything, but whatever...

And the community is quite split for now, there are people who want to be independent and people who prefer relying on a third party for help.But I personally think this comes from a much deeper cause. We haven’t been taught how to be independent in schools. Instead, we’ve been taught we need banks and a corporate job if we want a good life. So before we attempt an utopic scenario, I think we first need to sort that out and educate the young that independent is better because you have more control.Until we do this, it’s gonna be hard to convince everyone (or at least the majority) that it’s better to be your own boss. It’s probably because it’s more comfortable too and the much quicker option of the two with the fastest results, both positive and negative. We’re still far away from a change of poles imo.",

The human civilization is always evolving, there's nothing final here. Finance is evolving as well. The people used gold and silver coins centuries ago. They moved from gold coins to paper money, that were backed by gold. Later on, they moved to fiat money(not backed by anything). I guess that the next step would be moving towards digital currencies.There will be a constant battle between centralized financial infrastructures(banks, CBDCs) and decentralized financial structures(blockchains, crypto).
