  "content": "If you are buying BTC throughout an exchange, be aware of UPHOLD. I had an account with them until just right after the war in Ukraine began. In March, they went nuts and started asking questions about public keys where I had sent BTC from the exchange, the origin of my funds, information about my employer, and other that would have revealed personal information about people I have economic relations with and that is absolutely nuts. Actually, it is illegal in the European country where I live, as it probably is in any EU country to reveal such information, as it is protected by personal data protection laws. They did not care. I refused to provide such information because I could be legally liable for that information release, but they did not care. They kept on asking for it and, finally, they blocked my account. I had no funds in that account, but if I had had, guess what… I could have never recovered my BTC or my fiat. I do not hold anything in exchanges, and I hope serve to others who still trust exchanges. DO NOT! Remember, not your keys, not your coins! So, be aware of UPHOLD. Look up for other options. There are plenty. UPHOLD is just a shitty exchange sold to the interests of who knows what government or country (probably UK or some other Baltic Republics that have gone absolutely nuts with the war in Ukraine).",

Gox but there was no update on the complainant, for those who are about to use UPHOLD check all the warnings first before trading here.",

      "body": "It's make sense why they're block your account since they have a rule to ask your identity, although the information that they ask is really far than it does. This is the reason why anyone shouldn't use centralized exchanges if they're can't send any KYC that the exchanges demanded.I wouldn't call this is a legit scam accusations, but it's more like a warning for anyone before using this exchanges. Perhaps the origin of your funds somewhat had a connection with Russian citizens.Quote from: https://uphold.com/en-eu/legal/membership-agreement/eea4.2You must comply with anti-money laundering obligations in order to open an Uphold Account.
