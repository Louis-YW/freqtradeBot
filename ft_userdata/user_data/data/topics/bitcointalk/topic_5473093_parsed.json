If I open some threads, compose my posts and hit Post after one by one, I believe campaign managers will not have issues with my posts.The hidden fact is most of posters who make burst posts are shit posters and their posts have no quality to contribute for discussions. Consequently companies that hire them through signature campaigns won't get anything good or very little effect in term of marketing. It's waste of money to hire shit posters in a signature campaign, hence manager usually kicks those low quality participants out.",

A reading beginner may likely not burst post. For a beginner to burst post, it means they do not read replies which is not a good sign. This is why it is necessary to let them know of the possible implications.

What matters is how quality the post is. People can come here and do more than five posts in a short period of time, and you will see their posts as meaningful, so even the newcomers can post as long as they know what they are saying. However, I have never seen any signatures or bounty campaigns that include what you are saying in their rules. All that is needed is the quality of your post.",

Campaign managers consistently monitor the posts of participants so such a person will be removed from the campaign. There is a need to plan how to maximize your time in the forum to enable you to contribute meaningfully to the community. If you are been paid for the services, then you are required to give your best. Writing useless posts will not also lead to the member getting merit which will also affect his chances of being selected in campaigns. Quote2.

I am not saying forum members might not be doing that, some members can go to extra miles just because they want merit and they are not ready to make any impact on the forum. I am sure if you are making a contribution to the forum, you will receive merit without contacting anyone for merit trading.I don't know if you have received a similar message before? If you have received a similar message, you should have just reported the account. Since you have evidence that the account contacted you, you don't have to keep on covering up for members like that. A thread can be created on the reputation board with your evidence attached to it. Also, if you find yourself in groups like that, you can just try and get their forum account, and you can easily report them.I just remembered that you didn't mention people that do buy and sell forum accounts. I think that's really common on the forum here. There are people that do sell forum accounts. We all have to avoid buying forum accounts because with time you're going to be exposed. It's better to create and build your own account.",

I would have agreed with you if you mentioned beginners. This is because a full member could also be regarded as a beginner. But in the Op as I bolded above, you mentioned NEWBIES. A newbie cannot burst post, no matter how they try to. When I was a newbie I tried posting fast consecutively but I was restricted by the system. There is a mechanism that stops newbies from posting fast consecutively, but as they grow in rank the restriction fades away because the time between posts is raised.So, burst posting is not a problem of the newbies but rather established members.About what you said in number two, merit sharing. It would have been good you bring an evidence",

If they are still beginners then they haven't had the opportunity to register in the signature campaign because their rank is not yet high enough to meet the campaign requirements, so I don't think it's appropriate for you to give advice like this.

Trading of merits: I've never received a PM regarding someone requesting or sharing merit, so I don't know whether things like this often happen or not.

Trading merit is discouraged by forum community because it helps shit posters, farm accounts to rank up. After they rank up from merit farming, they will spam in forum and makes the forum worse in quality.Trading merit is not prohibited by forum rules but are forum rules important or is community voice more important?Quote from: theymos on February 05, 2019, 06:57:48 PM - Giving negative trust for merit trading and deceptive alt-account use may be appropriate, but you should use a light touch so that people don't feel paranoid.Quote from: theymos on February 05, 2019, 07:06:50 PMIf the \"gaming\" takes the form of strategically sending a lot of merit, creating sockuppets, and stuff like that, then no. That sort of gaming might get me to blacklist people, in fact. But if it looks more like politics, then that's OK, and that's what H8bussesNbicycles's thread looks like to me.Quote from: theymos on April 24, 2018, 05:36:51 PMThe current status quo seems OK. If you have to pay $20 per merit plus a risk of getting red trust, then that's a situation that doesn't concern me at all. I'm not going to lose sleep over people going to ridiculous lengths to buy merit, since only a small number of people will be willing and able to do that.As long as merit sales are a black market, I'm happy, since that makes it far more difficult and expensive to buy merit. If that's the case, then the small volume of black-market merit trades don't themselves bother me much, and I think that it does more harm than good to get too witch-hunty about it.",
