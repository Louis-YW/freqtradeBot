I doubt you really want to check the entire CEX for that. Just browse the site and it's not just for coin tracking purposes but rather there are other useful tools there and if you are a trader you can use the indicators and tools there too as part of doing analysis and future strategies.",

      "body": "If you are asking about the coin tracking website or app that I am currently using besides Coingecko and Coinmarketcap, I would recommend Cryptowatch which will give you the price information of all coins in one screen. It is perfect for large screen use so it displays all Bitcoin and altcoin prices for all CEXs (customizable).A few weeks ago I found it because @hugeblack shared it when someone asked about Muli-chart in one screen. Quote from: taufik123 on August 29, 2023, 02:33:28 PMQuote from: hugeblack on August 27, 2023, 02:31:30 PMCheck ---> https://cryptowat.ch/I finally found what I was looking for. It is no longer difficult to monitor all crypto assets and create portfolios, monitoring in one screen with price comparisons on each exchange.Not only that, it comes with the latest crypto news which helps in Fundamental monitoring. And it's also available as a mobile app so it's multi-platform. I would say this is the complete package I found and you gave a good recommendation. But about coupling EXchange with Cryptowatch, I haven't done it yet because this is my first experience, and whether or not it is safe to connect to my personal exchange. Cryptowatch is available for all Desktop Windows, iOS, and Android devices.",

I've also visited https://www.multicoincharts.com, but CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap are the most widely used and are still the mainstay of many people.And which website is better. It really depends on what you are looking for and need.And if you need accurate prices and want to see all the relevant information about a coin, I think CoinGecko is the answer. However, if you just want to quickly check the prices of a few coins, CoinMarketCap may be enough. And both can also be said to provide a Bitcoin price tracker which I think is good.",

I like the interface and the way they present the data. There are various ways that you can see the price and use analysis. Also at the bottom section, there's an option named Markets in which you can find all the past and present data about where it is listed and what the recent price is. Although it is not the perfect solution because there are always latency and errors that we need to count as well, we have to work with what we have at hand.  But when you are trading live, try to watch the chart provided by the platform you are using to trade. Anything outside of that platform could give out false or incorrect information which could lead to wrong outcomes.",

There are some news and social media features as well.",

But anyway, I'll just say my opinion about the three, coinmarketcap, coingecko and tradingview. So, the first two are really like the holy grail in terms of price trackers that has data from various exchanges. In tradingview, it has also got good way of displaying the data that it's fetching from other markets and exchanges. ~ https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/markets/",
