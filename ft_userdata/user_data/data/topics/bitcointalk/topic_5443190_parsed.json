First, he needs to confirm if he is the developer or part of the development team if he is not then he should not, he cannot answer important questions about this project/platform OP could have stumble it and just want to share it with the community or he was asked to post it here for discussionQuoteIt sounds the same as BFG. No, it's very different, it's not a casino, no staking features the mechanism is very much different from casinos and your rewards are their native token since they are not accepting Bitcoin it cannot be posted in the gambling section, unlike BFG token.",
