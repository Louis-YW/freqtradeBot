For a record, I think since this board is a discussion board, I think this should be the right place for such as you would likely get them here.This particular board  has a  outstanding  records of long term post which we are  very much aware of. Possibly, since you requested for an old article and old member. This is simple. Go back to the page 1 of this thread board to do your research there you could find old members, memories and articles of the past ten decade to read otherwise you wouldn't be able to get it. I think this opinion can guide you through to seeing what you want.",

Can I ask you to recommend them and their content, please?Would be hrd to get in touch with those who have held for that long. Also, what's the point of doing so? If they tell you to buy at this point would you do it? Ofcourse they's be positive towards this industry in general simply because they are having huge profit already. But this is not to limit you at the present. You may invest at this point and earn profit in the future. However if you desire having the same profit as them, then that would be impossible unless you are okay with putting huge amount in this blockchain to be held for years as well. You may read articles of people who are having Bitcoin holdings, surfacing the web.Bottomline here is what would you do after seeing some? Would it be enough to convince you to do it as well even if no one has the assurance that its market price will continue increasing for the next decade?",
