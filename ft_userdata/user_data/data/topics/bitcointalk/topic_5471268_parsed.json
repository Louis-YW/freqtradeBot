This depends on what you really mean by BTC on the BNB network; maybe you mean this  BEP-20 BTC  If that's what you mean, then it's not BTC; rather, it's referred to as BTCB, which means bitcoin on Binancechain. That's a pegged token and not really BTC, if I get you correctly if thatâ€™s what you mean then you can receive it on BNB network.QuoteI received the transaction and I have checked the TX on a number of Blockchain sites and it appears to be a genuine Transaction Hash but I am unable to access the BTC coins, I am assuming that is because it is on the wrong network.Where did you receive the transaction, and who gave you the TX? Maybe you can share more details to enable us to determine what you mean by details. If you can see a transaction on the blockchain, it means the transaction is confirmed and legit, but it doesn't guarantee the guarantee of that coin or token. Providing the OP with more information can help users verify more of what you are talking about.",

Alternatively you can send and receive it through Bitcoin Lightning Network but it is off-chain.BNB is a native cryptocurrency of Binance Smart Chain. BNB is different than Binance Smart Chain (BSC) as a first one is a cryptocurrency and a second one is a blockchain.On Binance Smart Chain (and other altcoin blockchains), you will see some Bitcoin Wrapped tokens but they are not Bitcoin. What you send and receive is Wrapped Bitcoin tokens, not Bitcoin. Those tokens might does not worth any value if their pegs lost.https://coinmarketcap.com/view/wrapped-tokens/",

Pretty impressive how much work goes into market manipulation here. There really doesn't seem to be any choice.Respect that they managed to reduce the BNB relatively little during the bear market.

This is a sign of a BTC scam attack, and you should not interact with them or try to sell them. Good thing you asked for opinion on the forum. Just leave them there, because BTC and BNB has two different chains there is no way a Bitcoin transaction can be made in Binance Smart Chain.

Just add the token address and scan to see for yourself. It was very helpful to me after i fell for a scam at a certain time.",
