IDK.No it's not same as social media because while creating a wallet or using it we are not giving any personal information and also we mostly use the wallets which stores the data locally which means everything is stored on our device so wallet doesn't keep any of the information. @OP, that's interesting question though some of the most used wallet doesn't have any ads, swap feature, or flat fee structure so they are probably not making any money.",

I thought Coinomi used to have ads, but it doesn't anymore as i didn't see one now in my mobile. I use Coinomi (I know it is not the best, but just carry a few 50-100 usd in my phone)Personally, I wouldn't care if some ad show up from time to time in a good mobile wallet. I just want some wallet which allows me receive any coin/token from the main blockchains easily, to transfer money fast. Holding some cryptocurrencies, specially bitcoin, when travelling abroad has been proven be useful for me in the past. Sometimes international bank transfer may take a long time to get completed, and bitcoin is way cheaper and faster",

Many users suffered losses with this hack and even the largest user losses amounted to $ 7.95 Million in Tether. this is a huge amount and the total stolen by hackers is $35 Million.the Atomic Wallet Developer is fully responsible for the loss of user assets and must immediately replace them when the stolen funds have been found and where they are going.",
