  "content": "Bitcoin has gone over $100,000 this year, and some analysts are predicting even bigger gains next year. With this, many financial advisors are recommending at least some caution, while investing in cryptocurrencies and making sure only a small portion of your overall portfolio is being used for investment. Bitcoin prices have fallen, but have recovered quickly after the Federal Reserve signaled it might cut rates less frequently next year, but they have more than doubled. Asset manager Blackrock recommends a 1-2% allocation to bitcoin in a portfolio that otherwise consists of a traditional stock/bond allocation due to bitcoin’s volatility. Experts like Malcolm Ethridge and David Rosenstrock weigh in on the risks and rewards of investing in bitcoin, emphasizing that it’s important to know why you want to invest. Buying bitcoin directly, investing in an ETF, or buying shares in companies that trade bitcoin each involve a number of different considerations. New investors should consider ETFs as a beginner-friendly option, but experienced investors like Douglas Boneparth prefer to hold bitcoin directly, for more control and security.",

So as long as you are investing what you can afford to put aside for a long term into Bitcoin, you are good to go through with Bitcoin volatilities because of the long-term perspective of the investor.",

With the current and future movement of Bitcoin and many people being optimistic of the future growth of the Bitcoin market, I believe it was been always the right time to invest in Bitcoin.  But if you are somehow hesitant, you can apply DCA where you regularly allocate a fund to buy BTC.  This way you can observe the Bitcoin market movement without spending your investment fund in one go.",

But that's true, they're very beginner friendly and they're trusted just as how people trust them on investing that way. And as everyone is encouraged to buy and hold their own Bitcoin, if you want it to be secured then choose a hardware wallet that where you can hold it to. But there is nothing wrong if an investor wants to invest also into those ETFs.",

Knowing that bitcoin is something that has a value or has a way of growing over a long period of time, it is required to invest what you can afford to put aside for a long time. The challenge most people have with investing in Bitcoin is investing money they have need for urgently. This is not how investment in Bitcoin work because it will make you to panic in case price does not go your direction immediately.",

You need to trust them with your privacy, your information, and many many more...With bitcoin you just need to have a wallet / private - public key. Get coins. No fees. No checks. Trust numbers.

Taking all the knowns and rephrase it to come in an unpopular context.I think the greatest advice or strategy that have ever come to Bitcoin remains the simple and popular dollar cost averaging (DCA).It leaves no obstacle unturned as it matches through your streams of income, your status in society, the market price at every given time and doesn’t give room for procrastination.Where you can find excuses, DCA strategy just makes room to accommodate it. One thing that people should take out of the price mark that Bitcoin did attain in this year is the fact that, there is always that prediction into the future with price and Bitcoin always manages to climb. Having to invest and hold surely takes you there.",

For those who are already familiar with Bitcoin, the advice to buy Bitcoin with money you can afford to lose is unacceptable, but for newcomers, that is the best approach if you want to introduce them to crypto. However, we must still encourage them to learn more about Bitcoin before they invest because knowledge is important, and in the end, it is their decision whether or not to risk it after learning how volatile BTC is.",

We can see that the Bitcoin market was at a high of $108,000 and from there it is currently at $95,000. We can see that even though Bitcoin is at $95,000, the market is still very high. Moreover, if we believe the predictions made by various big companies and various influential people, it is still the right time to invest in Bitcoin because they say that the market has the potential to create a new ATH by 2025. So if you think the market is too high right now, you can wait or continue investing using the DCA method. If you use the DCA method, you will not have to suffer from market volatility.",

How do you think that experienced investors became experienced? Buying real bitcoins, making some mistake, surely not buying ETFs.",

You can buy Bitcoin on schedule and constantly for some terms you want and you know when you can stop your buying. Investing in Bitcoin is a personal decision so we must learn before we decide.

It's not smart and it's terrible in individual capital management.Make sure after you invest money in Bitcoin or anything else, you still have money left to use if your investment turns to 0.How many percent of your capital can be used for investment is safe?It's definitely not 100%.",
