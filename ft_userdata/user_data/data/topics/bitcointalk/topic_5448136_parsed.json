      "body": "Happiness and joy are related but distinct concepts. Happiness is an emotion that ranges from contentment to intense pleasure. It is often achieved externally and involves pleasing oneself. Joy, on the other hand, is an inner feeling that endures hardship and trials and connects with meaning and purpose. It is a stronger and less common feeling than happiness and is often triggered by selflessness to the point of personal sacrifice. Joy is about selflessness and ignoring one's own feelings to benefit someone else. While emotions are generally more unstable and ever-changing, mindsets like joy are more consistent. I have 30 y.o",

      "body": "Joy is when you go out of your way to care and give to others. It is the feeling that comes with that self-sacrifice and learning to be more grateful, thankful, and peaceful within you. A good example would be Christmas day, you give presents to your family and friends. This gives you a feeling of joy inside of you because you're going out of your way to give to others without expecting something in return. As opposed to happiness, which is about oneness pleasure, or satisfaction. Although happiness maybe is a temporary emotion, it is not the same as the feeling of joy. Take for example buying a brand-new car, you will be overcome with pleasure, satisfaction, and bliss. All these emotions are associated with happiness. Another example would be buying your favorite meal. You will be happy because you know you will enjoy your food. But that happiness is only temporary and not the same as joy.",
