However, I was hesitant because I had heard that it was complicated to set up and took up a lot of storage space. I created a brand new topic for just this to make sure I am not missing any information and able to make a clean and simple installation. You are welcome to share any tips on using bitcoin Core wallet perfectly.",

Actually you can use an external disk for the Bitcoin data directory (the big one)! Bitcoin Core will still be installed on your main drive, but will take up almost no space at all.Just specify the path in your bitcoin.conf bitcoin configuration file.Simply add a new line like this, pointing to the right folder on the right drive, of course.Code:datadir=/mount/drive1/bitcoinIf you use the GUI version of Bitcoin Core, you can open the configuration file through its settings and 'Open Configuration File'.",

That's why there's pruning: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/58767/how-can-i-prune-my-bitcoin-core-correctly-the-other-way-did-not-work-for-me-ha In summary, you can enable a setting in Bitcoin Core which dumps blocks a little after it verifies them, to free you up space. The downside with pruning is that if you want to re-index the chain (for any reason) you'll have to re-download it. One common reason you might want to do this is for importing new wallets.",

Even with 4GB of RAM, full sync will take like a year. I've tried it on a Raspberry Pi with 1 or 2GB of RAM years ago and it took weeks to even reach 80%.Here another experiment of mine. Notice how a (dirt cheap) upgrade from 4GB to 8GB dramatically sped up the IBD.1GB is enough for running, but not for initial sync.Quote from: n0nce on October 15, 2021, 02:46:21 PMI let you guys guess at which point in time I upgraded the node from 4GB to 8GB Disk space is suggesting a user runs full blockchain (since for pruning 2GB are enough); however today, you need at least 500GB as a bare minimum.

For the price, of course, it will be more expensive than a regular SSD.I'm like 99% confident that NVMe won't make a difference for Bitcoin Core sync. Remember it's not a pure disk I/O process; it involves a lot of computation which will be the bottleneck as soon as you get an SSD of any kind; definitely on a lower-power chip, at least.With a good rig and any SSD, as long as your internet bandwidth allows it, the full sync can be done in like a day; fast enough in my opinion.",
