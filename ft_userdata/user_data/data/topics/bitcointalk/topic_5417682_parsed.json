  "content": "RX5700XT Sapphire Stable Miner ?I used the phoenixminer. It was really good. It starts to give errors after several months. I use HiveOS.I asked the developer about it. He told me HiveOS use different kernels from phoenixminer and the problem is that.I started to use Team Red Miner. But there is is always errors.No matter ethash or another alogirthm on TRM.I have 8 rigs, each rig has 12pcs GPU. I dont know what should I do ?I changed the risers, the riser works well at another gpus.do you have any advise ?There is no any error if i play game on windows.Code:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[2022-10-19 10:00:27] GPU 5: detected DEAD (13:00.0), will execute restart script watchdog.sh[2022-10-19 10:00:27] Watchdog script executor thread executing script 'watchdog.sh'IMAGE:",

With another miner my rig started to run 24/7 again, but after several days, another crash...Maybe it's some random bugs, you have the option to try windows on at least the problematic rig, windows is not so hard to maintain.",

Each watt is important.Lolminer I have been using it for my rig which is with a lot of different cards and one Rx 5700 Xt Gigabyte in it and never gave me any problem while all other miners after a certain time usually a maximum of 105 hours meaning just over 4 days they crashed,in Lolminer I had an whopping 375 hours without problems and it was only electricity going out that the miner was shut down.For electricity the 5700 Xt if tuned correctly should not consume more than 115 watt for a card which I think for 55 Mhsh is a great value for the money.It is all because of the stupid Russian war that energy prices have skyrocketed this high unfortunately.",
