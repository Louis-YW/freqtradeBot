  "content": "Hello, I have Antminer S19, It has Vanish Firmware installed, and I just realised that after turning it on, it does not show any indicator. (Red and Green) Fans are fully working but stuck at full speed.Waited long enough already but still no indicator.I read about indicators on Bitmain website, per them if both indicators are not showing even once, then the control board is damaged or I need to change firmware/factory reset.Not sure how to proceed with a factory reset or if need to flash Vanish again!(If need to install Vanish again, I need the green indicator to understand when to remove and plug USB OTG in the process, hence also the confusion  )Sources:(https://support.bitmain.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018826774-What-do-miner-s-signal-lights-mean-)Fault 4:The control board is faulty, use the SD card to upgrade the control board or replace the control board.Indicator light judgment during server operationFault light(red)           extinguish   flashing   long light   extinguish   extinguish   flashingNormal light(green)   flashing   extinguish   long light   long light   extinguish   flashingWorking conditions   normal   fault 1   fault 2   fault 3   fault 4   fault 5Help me, Thank you",
