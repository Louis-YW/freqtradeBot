  "content": "Today I was checking spam folder in one of my emails. Not the main one. I use this email address on low importance sign ups where I don't trust that website that much to use my main email. And I found maybe 40 messages send by same person between 12th and 21th of March. Here is full message that I got (removed password and BTC address from it:QuoteHi, today there are sadly some bad news for you.Your device was infected with my private malware, your browser wasn't updated / patched, in such case it's enough to just visit some website where my iframe is placed to get automatically infected, if you want to find out more, Google: Drive-by exploit.My malware gave me full access to all your accounts, full control over your device and it also was possible to spy on you over your cam.If you think this is some bad joke, no, I know your password: *******I collected all your private data and I RECORDED YOU (through your cam) SATISFYING YOURSELF!After that I removed my malware to not leave any traces and this email was sent from some hacked server.I can publish the video of you and all your private data on the whole web, social networks, over email and send everything to all your contacts.But you can stop me and only I can help you out in this situation.The only way to stop me, is to pay exactly 900$ in Bitcoin (BTC).It's a very good offer, compared to all that horrible shit that will happen if I publish everything.You can easily buy Bitcoin (BTC) here: www.paxful.com , www.coingate.com , www.coinbase.com , or check for Bitcoin (BTC) ATM near you, or Google for other exchanger.You can send the Bitcoin (BTC) directly to my wallet, or install the free software: Atomicwallet, or: Exodus wallet, then receive and send to mine.My Bitcoin (BTC) wallet is: ***************Yes, that's how the wallet / address looks like, copy and paste it, it's (cAsE-sEnSEtiVE).I give you 3 days time to pay.After receiving the payment, I will remove everything and you can life your live in peace like before, don't worry, I keep my promise.Next time make sure that your device got the newsest security updates.ClientMailID: 6993041Usually I don't pay attention to such messages, but there is one interesting moment - in few of his message he wrote one password that I really used in some not important websites. In other his messages he wrote password which looks similar to that one, but I haven't used such one. And in few other messages he just wrote some random passwords made from my email address.There is one thing that made me sceptical about him - he wrote that he recorded me satisfying myself with my camera. But there is one thing - there is no camera in front of my PC, so, even if would did what he wrote, there is no chance for him to record it . Also, he said that my browser wasn't updated, but I always use newest version of browsers. Finally, he gave me 3 days, but few weeks already passed since I got these messages and nothing didn't happened. I also didn't noticed any strange attempts to login to any of my accounts recently.It looks like a bit more sophisticated scam attempt. maybe it's really possible that he got my password from one of websites where I used. For example it can be some IPTV providers or Bitcoin faucets which I used many years ago and who sold their database.I'm not concerned that much because on all websites that really matters I use different and strong websites and 2FA enabled. But I advise for everyone to take safety seriously. Use 2FA, make strong and different website for every website. Don't use your main email address for low importance sign-ups. And don't fall into such scams.",

If not for someone who is more exposed to cryptocurrency like you are, you may have fallen victim too or perhaps not.

I don't know what would require me to read the entire e-mail although some of the data may be similar. This is a bad trap, and the more they read the entire email, the more convinced they will be of what the scammer is saying. But I'm sure this is an old trick, but there are chances that it works when it comes to newbies. So be careful and ignore suspicious emails instead of reading them.So far I haven't received any such email either, but to be honest I very rarely open email and have probably ignored hundreds of email in them. To the OP, this thread is good for warning other users especially newbies, but please don't give scammers a chance to brainwash you with multiple threats.",
