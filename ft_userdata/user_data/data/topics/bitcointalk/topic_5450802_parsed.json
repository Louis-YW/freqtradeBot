Once the hacker knows the private key, he can connect it to a high-speed bot, and thus, once the time expires, he will be able to send those coins to his wallet.Quote from: Carol548 on May 01, 2023, 09:32:09 AM Oscarswap has implemented a time locking smart contract to ensure that the community governance decisions are implemented.

That's similar like Bitcoin where no one is control it and any new proposal need to be accepted by most of Bitcoin developers.Quote from: Carol548 on May 01, 2023, 09:32:09 AMThe interest of all stakeholders are taken into consideration.
