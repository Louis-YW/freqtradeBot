  "content": "I read every day about a new superstar moving to the saudi league and I think this is slowly becoming a problem for European football. I grew up with the fact that all footballers in the world are pursuing the dream of playing football in a top European league at some point. For me, leagues like the Premiere League, La Liga, Seria A or the German Bundesliga are part of it. But even our weaker leagues were popular to players to prove themselves as good players. The European clubs have also paid almost the best salaries or transfer fees worldwide. China has been able to attract a few good players like Iniesta or Hulk with high salaries, but these were just very few players. Since Ronaldo's move, we've been faced with the big problem that a lot of top players have followed him, some of whom are very young, and of course that's very good for the Saudi league, but European football is losing very important and great talents. The current year is the first year where so many players change at the same time, if this should continue for another 2-3 years I can well imagine that Europe will run out of good and well-known footballers. With the salaries that are paid, it is also understandable for me that the footballers change and the clubs sell the players, but how do you think the whole thing will continue? Will European football lose its special position? And while I was writing this, I read again about a new possible move: Mo Salah is said to move to Saudi Arabia for a transfer fee of €100m and a yearly earn of €200m. Just crazy!Here is a list of well-known footballers who have already transferred: To Al Hilal: Neymar Koulibaly Milinkovic-Savic Ruben NevesMitrovicBonoTo Al-Ittihad:Kanté Benzema FabinhoTo Al-Ahli:MendyFirminoMahrezMerih DemiralAllan Saint-MaximinIbanezKessieTo Al-Nassr:RonaldoBrozovicManéFofanaAlex TellesLaporteTo Al-Ettifaq:Moussa DembeléHenderson",

Will European football lose its special position? This definitely has been a crazy year for football in the Middle East, so many big names transfered over there. The question now is what is going to happen in Europe, and my answer is that probably not much is going to change. First of all Europe can't compete against the prices offered in Saudi Arabia, these are state sponsored teams that receive direct money out of the oil trade. There is no real point in trying to compete and just let the players leave. As long as there is no direct tournaments between Europe and the middle east like letting them join champions league or other big cups I don't see a problem. The level of European football might fall for a while, but us eventually going to recover. What makes football so special in Europe or south America is the fans, there are million of people watching all the games and go to the stadium. Just because a few big names are now moving to Saudia Arabia it's not going to change the fan landscape. People follow their regional teams, because that is where they visit the stadium. Only a very small majority might consider rooting for a middle eastern team because their favorite player is transferring there. I think the hype some of these players will fade over time as some fans are angry towards the player for going so far away and selling out.",

      "body": "When Saudi clubs go crazy with having the audacity to use big budgets to sign top European players then the problem that might occur is that most of the top European players will prefer to play for Saudi clubs as opposed to playing for big European clubs, especially when the Saudis really get to play. get into the Champions League or have a League that is equivalent to the Champions League then it is likely that great players who are famous have no doubts to play there.With the great interest in playing with Saudi clubs it will also be difficult for European clubs to get talented players because most of them prefer bigger fees.Some rumors also state that there are European club coaches pressing FIFA to be able to regulate the issue of player transfers to Saudi clans so that in the future it can be more balanced with European club transfers.",

Point of view from players will also become a factor in this case, I mean if most players are money oriented then there will be much more players move to Saudi in the next few years. Not only players who are already old enough but young talented players may move there too because of money. However if players are still care about bigger achievement (not money only) then they will stay in European leagues. Everything is possible to happen, Saudi league may become bigger than most other European league in the future but it can be just a short hype as well.",

I do not think so.in fact there are still lots of fans and bettor who still watch every team match from european league.",

Basically, the football world likes to watch Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar, Sadio Mane, Karim Benzema play and their popularity is currently very high. So if these popular players are included in Saudi based clubs from European, EPL, Italian and Paris based clubs then the popularity of those clubs has decreased a lot. Now most of the football fans prefer to watch Saudi club games. Therefore, the addition of dozens of new players to Saudi club-based leagues has become a cause of concern for European clubs.",

The main purpose of setting up a business is for profit making. The clubs are selling to SPL because they need huge profit to take care of some expenses and even buy more players. It is like sell one and have the funds to buy two. The latest thing that I have observed is that players have also put money in their mind and believes that it is better to play in a club that can afford to pay them 3X their current pay,which makes them not think about either it is European league or not. It wouldn't be a problem to the European football because there are enough players in the world that can satisfy every strong league,as long as they can afford to pay the players. Saudi Arabia is buying players to create awareness in their league and to also use football to bring the world to their country for more firm. It will be fun if we have more weak leagues upgrading in football and drawing attention with the signing of world class players to the league.",

However, if Europe continues to let its top players move to the Middle East. This will boomerang itself for European football. The move of the mega star CR7 is a small example where Middle Eastern football is immediately eyed by the world community and likewise with investors who have started to switch to Middle Eastern football because they see a pretty good opportunity. and if this continues then sooner or later middle east football will become the toughest rival for european football.",

So they shouldn't take it as a negative though. And just to let you know, even in boxing, Saudi Arabia has become one of the hot spot as there are a lot of fights that are being held in that part, and obviously it's become of the huge money that they offer.",

For example, Cristiano Ronaldo playing for Al Nassr and all his fans will watch their game. It will increase the demand od streaming their match on broadcasting companies and it will generate income for the Saudi league. There are a couple of other factors as well. Clubs get money from selling jerseys as well. People also buy jerseys of their favorite players and teams. There are a couple of players who are top rated like Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar Junior, and Lionel Messi. Two of them moved to Saudi Arabia and Messi moved to America.

Just know that the Premier League will remain the most valuable league in the world, not by funding but by reputation.",

Players are compelled to make decisions that protect their financial future when clubs in the Saudi league offer salaries that European clubs cannot match.While it may be difficult to watch the familiar faces from European stadiums migrate to Saudi Arabia, this change may also be seen as a leveling of the playing field in the sport of football. For many years, European leagues dominated the sport; however, other leagues are catching up. Its merely the fundamental economics of supply and demand.Regarding the future? Well, European football has a storied past, unparalleled infrastructure, and a well ingrained culture. While they might encounter opposition in the near future, I think European football's core values will hold up. Clubs will change, policy may alter, and tactics may alter.",

What I see is that,  the Earopean league/clubs side are well developed enough with good foundation that can easily propel them to success regardless pf the players as long as their is team work and energetic calculative players,  player like Christina Robaldo have created a world record name for themselves in the European league so it time to build the Saudi leagues this is also very important.",
