Also, try to look at their fundamentals since we’re talking about long term here, having a solid target in the future can be a big project as well.",

I think those are some of the best ways to set an average purchase price but that's been my experience while investing in bitcoin.About based on cycles, come when prices fall - sell when bullish, maybe it will continue to be the same cycle but remember this way is still difficult especially if you are not in a mature plan.",

Let's say when Bitcoin was below 20k price that was a good time to buy and be able to hold for long term goals. But this year bitcoin did not drop to 20k, which indicator is the best? In my opinion, as long as the bitcoin price is below the old ATH and below the target where you will sell your bitcoins then you can buy whenever you have the money. No one can predict bitcoin's lows during the bear season and the highest price during the bull season. So don't try to search and wait for the lowest price to buy, instead we can use DCA strategy during bear season.",

You just need to learn to hold, and if you can learn to hold then you are going to end up making a profit eventually.There are a lot of people who fail to do that, they end up not holding for a long time after buying, and that causes them to lose a lot of money but I personally can't be bothered with it at all. I just hope that the best thing to do right now should be keep holding it as much as possible, and because of that I believe that we need to end up with a better result in a short period of time as well but if we have to we should be holding as long as we need to.",

Bitcoin has lost over 50% of its value since his last ATH in 2021, so I guess you know what to do instead of asking about the best indicators.We have had a bearish period in 2022, I think that is one of the best indicators why you need to accumulate. But another useful strategy that you can consider is; buy dip and hold and accumulate as much as you can.",

It took a while to analyze the chart but it was necessary if we wanted to invest in the right project. But as we are talking about long-term investment, even without using this, as long as we are investing in Bitcoin we can say that we can earn a profit surely. As long as we can manage to hold it after buying and then sell during the bull season, guaranteed profit is always there. Some people just lose in Bitcoin because of being impatient which is why we have to change it and become certain of our goal.",

You need to consider the bearish market as one of the indicators, but technically, of course you can use several indicators for monthly TF.For times like these I think the best advice is something like this; Prepare your budget, do an analysis, buy - withdraw your bitcoin to a non-custodial wallet - be a holder for the long term (at least until a new ATH appears).",

I was just thinking about the same thing. I invest for the long term and I don't look at indicators. I look at the essential properties of Bitcoin and its history, which makes me think that the price will continue to rise more and more during the following cycles. Therefore, at what price I can buy now is not so important. I do DCA and that's it. But even if I had a lump sum to invest for the long term, holding it for a couple of cycles, I would invest it today at the price it is, because trying to get it right if the price goes up or down a bit is not going to make a significant difference in profitability, and you can always be wrong.",

You don't need to wait when to buy, no need to time the lowest low or bottom price because no one can see that.All you have to do is to just buy as much as you can in years regardless of what the price will be and then HODL and then like what others did, wait for the bull run and then sell and make profits.",

If your coin is bitcoin, you must be clear in determining your target selling price, and if it reaches your selling price, you better sell it immediately, especially if it is the new ATH price for bitcoin. When it reaches the peak price, the bitcoin price will definitely experience a correction, and often we see the price immediately drop to the lowest price again and will be there for some time. That's what I do for long term investing in bitcoin, so I don't think too much about the volatile price it is right now.",

You don’t need any major buy signal to purchased tokens while you can use DCA method to safely enter since your goal will long term. You are decided to trust the project that’s why you will go long term or else you should just invest short term.Simply browse the chart and use a ling time frame so that you can see what project is down a lot from all time high and stay at the bottom until now. Make sure to use fundamental analysis to backup your technical analysis to make sure that you are not buying a dead project.",
