Never get tempted by Welcome offers or other reload bonuses and use that as a reason to sign up somewhere. Casinos don't like giving out free money, they just like to give you the idea that they do. Big bonuses are usually accompanied by big wagering requirements. A 40x rollover requirement is on the higher end of the scale. I have seen crypto casinos offer 15 or 20x. Compared to them, this offer of 40x is huge. On the other hand, fiat casinos can even go as high as 60 or 70x in some cases.",

First is by buying copper membership where you have to pay for it but think of it as a shortcut to be able to post images. The other option is to rank up your account or increase your rank to jr. member which requires you to have 30 activity points gained from posting a total of 30 activity points (takes time before you rank up) and 1 merit (I think this won't take that long if someone will send you 1 merit right away. That all is what will help you making this ann thread of yours much presentable if you don't want to type, write or say anything in the Ann thread and just post an image right away. Also read the forum rules too. Good design by the way and good luck .",
