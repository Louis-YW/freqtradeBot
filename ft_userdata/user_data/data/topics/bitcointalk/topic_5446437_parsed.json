Derive the key from it, pull the key from it, what did you mean?Do you want to derive a private key from a public address?It is impossible because if it is possible, your bitcoin will be stolen, my bitcoin will be stolen and bitcoin will have zero value.Mastering Bitcoin (Keys, Addresses - chapter 4)https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/raw/develop/images/mbc2_0401.pngPrivate Key > Public Key (By Elliptic Curve Multiplication) > Bitcoin Address (By Hash Function, One-way).You can not go from Bitcoin Address > Public Key > Private Key.",

If you have two transactions spending coins from the same address and therefore using the same private key, and these two transactions also use the same k value (and therefore have the same r value), then it is possible to calculate the private key for that address.However, this situation is a well known vulnerability, and there is no current wallet software I am aware of which utilizes reused k values. If there was, all its users would fairly rapidly have their coins stolen. Most good wallets will generate the k value deterministically using RFC 6979, ensuring a different k value for each transaction.",

No matter how many times you use an address, you only reveal the public key and the respective signature.Quote from: franky1 on March 27, 2023, 08:23:25 AMfirstly there is no point making a transaction to send all funds to the same address..You might want to leave a message. So, you burn 0 coins with OP_RETURN and send the rest to the same address. Quote from: franky1 on March 27, 2023, 12:09:19 PMand while you say that stuff pre 6979 is a risk.. again satoshi has respends of same address and 14 years of opportunity.. no one has bruted his fundsReusing k value is irrelevant to Satoshi's P2PK funds. Just because he didn't it doesn't mean you can't create such transaction.",

This is a simple fact. I made no statement whatsoever regarding old transactions being vulnerable or anything pre-6979 being vulnerable. This is all nonsense you made up simply to argue against.",

Correct me if i am wrong .. but if you send payments to yourself without a change address, wasnt it possible to have a leak sorta speak..Not referring to the reused R value which is not present...or something where you use the rsz to narrow down the results.. etc ...",

Nobody could work it out with just a transaction which empties an output to the same address. If you meant the public key, then every transaction reveals it, regardless of whether it reuses addresses or not.",
