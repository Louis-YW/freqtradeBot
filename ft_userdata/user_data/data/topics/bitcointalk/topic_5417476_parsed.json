  "content": "Hello, I'm having a problem with Bitcoin RPC's send method. Here is my RPC call:{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"send\",\"params\":[[{\"3NKnXgAuRZ52uUMgDztyQM1aNsXoyoxM7D\":0.0002462028}],6,\"economical\",null,{\"change_position\":1,\"subtract_fee_from_outputs\":[0],\"inputs\":[{\"txid\":\"69c77704508f14949448a989b2b5662292128f92cad9620961118f767799d1be\",\"vout\":0,\"sequence\":0}]}]}This is the RPC response:{\"result\":null,\"error\":{\"code\":-3,\"message\":\"Invalid amount\"},\"id\":null}I'm aware of the other question on this forum that says -3 is a type error that only appears when amount is negative or zero, but that is not the case as you can see above in the call body.As you can see on a chain explorer, this transaction ID has more than the send amount at that index. As a test, I removed the additional options to see if it would send without them and it results in the same error.I've tried specifying the amount as a string and a number, neither work.Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.",

      "body": "Quote from: n0nce on October 17, 2022, 11:58:26 PMCan you share the whole cURL or code snippet you're using to submit that request?It's hard to get that because I'm using my own RPC library. The JSON body I put in the post is printing from inside the library right before it makes the request. Here's the TypeScript code that's trying to send:Code:const response = await bitcoin.send(    [{ [output]: sending.toString() }],    6, // conf_target    \"economical\",    undefined, // fee_rate    {      \"change_position\": 1,      \"subtract_fee_from_outputs\": [0],      \"inputs\": [input],    },  );Again, I have run it without the options object and have the same result. Additionally, this code works on the testnet but not the mainnet if that helps.",
