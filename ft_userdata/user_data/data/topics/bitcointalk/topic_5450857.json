  "content": "I am waiting are you too? The infinite value of Bitcoin was predicted by Simpson's in Episode 18 of Season 32. It was titled Burger Kings.It was on a character named Marge Simpson who is into stock trading. Will we see this ticker in our lifetime?The last time Bitcoin created a new ATH was on November 10th, 2021. We saw the USD value of Bitcoin on the verge of crossing 70k. At the moment it is hovering around 28k to 30k. That is why I would like to ask everyone here, which year do you expect the Bitcoin price to go beyond a USD value and achieve an infinite value?",

But if people think that we can just sit comfortably at home and do nothing and infinite bitcoin value will come out of nowhere, no, no, that's not gonna happen.",

It's funny that people are using The Simpsons in an attempt to predict the future, not only for Bitcoin; this cartoon has been used for pretty much everything. The Simpsons was always a sarcastic cartoon covering controversial subjects in a subtle way, but in no way could it have predicted anything. In this case, the infinite loop is probably referring to its price, which has no specific boundaries and doesn't have a ceiling, as it could range anywhere from $100 to $200,000 or even more; there's no limit.I think it's best to lay back and enjoy the journey; we have plenty of years ahead and a possible bright future. For us, trying to find a possible meaning in pretty much everything in an attempt to come up with our own predictions doesn't help at all.",

About the infinite value, we're beginning to see and take note of that in terms of its relevance in today's world. However, The Simpsons failed to put year and the expected price tag to Bitcoin so as to bring its forecast closer home.

By the way, Let it first cross all the tenths of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions of prices before we begin to reason about the infinite value price of bitcoin. For bitcoin to reach her new ATH of $69k, it took more than a decade. Then calculate how long it will take for her to reach an infinite value after it must have crossed all the hundreds of thousands of values plus the millions price. Talk more about the limitless value you hold in your heart by Simpson's. The infinite prediction by Simpson will take a very long year for it to happen. We may all have left this mother earth by then. The new world generation might be the one to see it happen(if it is to happen)",

Note that Bitcoin's price exceeded $1 in value between February and April 2011, which was over 12 years ago. As for when Bitcoin's value will rise a lot again, I have no idea to be honest and it's really difficult to predict. However, I believe it may happen within the next two years, perhaps around 2025 and I estimate that the value of 1 bitcoin could reach anywhere from $100,000 to $120,000. It would be probably 1million in 10 years:D but infinite value? I don't think so.",
