Most ATMs have cash inside and there are even sites where you can check how much they have, so that you don't go to withdraw from an almost empty one. A local physical exchange operator that I used to go to allows you to send them a transaction and choose the ATM you want to withdraw from and updates the cash status of each ATM at least once per hour. I've heard in the news that there's a wave of ATM attacks and the most of them occurs in Germany and The Netherlands, but unlike these guys, the EU gang uses explosives and targets fiat ATMs.",

However it's just funny how 13 years old since Bitcoin was invented, they didn't even search if Bitcoin is tangible asset or intangible asset. This just prove there's many people still not using google to conduct a deeper research, maybe this is why many newbies still got scammed until now.",

By themselves they don't weigh that much, but 2 layers of them make it just about impossible to take it out without opening it and taking the bars out 1st. Unless you look like Lou Ferrigno in his prime.BTAMs, ATMs, vending machines, anything with cash is going to be a target. Operators of these machines just have to figure out the balance of security vs. making it more secure but having to deal with the obsticales that making it more secure creates.-Dave",

That it's not for people who already have enough coins and just get rid of those lost coins. As far as I know, there are still people who will steal bitcoins because people already lost their coins so they have less chance to steal bitcoins.    To get Bitcoin out of that ATM, you had to find some exchanges that allow you to use bitcoins, while some of the exchanges offer you Bitcoin for free.      If you are not sure about the exchanges and bitcoin wallets, then it's better to search for a trusted wallet or a fake bitcoin wallet.",

People with a basic understanding of crypto wouldn't take such action because they would realize that bitcoin is a digital currency and that even if they were to steal it from a bitcoin ATM, the stolen bitcoin could be tracked and its transactions monitored.
