  "content": "Banks are made out to be an essential service for the benefit of society similar to other basic amenities we use to get through our needs, but in reality banks are businesses and we are the profit, meaning we exist and patronize the banks to make money for them. Let's take a look at some of the ways banks make money[1], Quote from: https://www.msn.com/en-xl/money/personalfinance/how-do-banks-make-money/Here’s a look at the ways that banks and credit unions make money, often off your money, no less:1. Deposits: Banks know how to leverage money in genius ways. When you deposit money into your savings account or certificates of deposit, your bank will pay interest as an incentive for you to park your cash there. That’s because banks need your money to make loans. Your cash isn’t really physically in your account, waiting — your bank is making lucrative deals lending it to other customers and businesses until you need it.Banks want you to trust them enough to keep your money with them in the promise to safeguard it for you and would even offer you an interest to keep it, while they use your money to make even more money. They convince you that you are protected by fractional reserves for any incidence that occurs, but banks can still fail to balance their sheets between your money that they took in and the amount they lent out, leading to a bank failure:Quote from: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-failure.aspThe most common cause of bank failure occurs when the value of the bank’s assets falls to below the market value of the bank’s liabilities, which are the bank's obligations to creditors and depositors. This might happen because the bank loses too much on its investments. It’s not always possible to predict when a bank will fail.In the event of this they would bail out the banks with more money, making you poorer by increasing the money in circulation, until the economy can take no more.Quote2. Banks Make Money With Bank FeesFees are one of the more obvious ways banks make money. Imagine millions of customers paying the following banking fees regularly:Account fees for having a bank accountFees from loan applicationsOverdraft feesMonthly maintenance feesOut-of-network ATM fees for cash withdrawalsCommissions charged for investment services or making tradesPenalty charges like credit card late fees and bank overdraft feesIn addition to loaning your money out the banks charge you for the services they provide and in some cases do not provide for you. With overdraft fees, the banks could encourage you to spend above your limit so as to charge you the fees and can even manipulate the transaction history to rob you milk out more money from you[2].Quote3. Banks Make Money With Interchange FeesRetailers pay interchange fees every time a customer uses a credit or debit card in a sales transaction. Interchange fee rates are set by credit card companies and are normally a percentage of the purchase plus a flat rate.Here’s a simplified example: The interchange rate set by a credit card provider for each transaction is 2.00% plus $0.15. You buy something for $100 with your debit card. The small business or store would pay an interchange fee of $2.15. The store keeps $97.85 of the purchase price, and the $2.15 interchange fee goes to the bank that provided you with the credit or debit card.4. Banks Make Money Through InvestmentsInvestment banks are different from commercial banks. They make their money by selling services to companies, governments and investment funds instead of earning their money from consumers. Although this doesn’t apply to consumers, it’s good to know it’s another way banks make money, thereby making it possible for you to enjoy your free checking account.Banks are designed to profit at your expense, through legitimate or even fraudulent ways, and with the protection provided for them, they can fail multiple times and would be bailed out, to ensure you continue to trust their services and keep your money with them.Do not be part of the fiat rat race, use BTC.[1] https://www.msn.com/en-xl/money/personalfinance/how-do-banks-make-money/[2] https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/07/overdraft-scam/- Jay -",

This deposit is not just done by you and me but by millions of people; the money you deposit into this account can't come out the same way again; they charge you for card maintenance, SMS charges, etc. They use depositors. a sum of money to lend to investors who are winning to pay back with profit at their agreed duration, with tangible collateral that can be sold out to recover both the profit and the lend out amount. When depositor A wants to withdraw his or her money, they will use depositor B's money to pay depositor A, just like that. If everyone wants to withdraw all their money at once, that's where you hear of network downtime and issues from one place to another. They delay because they run around to recover all the lend-out money, and if they can't get it all, you hear about bankruptcy and depositors' money is now at risk. It's now 50/50, so the chances of recovery have become very small.",

This gives them the opportunity to use your money for business by loaning it out to people with interest at the end of the day. The use your own money to make profit for themselves and leave you the owner with no profit. We also take permission from them before we can use our money that is been entrusted to them.If nobody takes his money to the bank then the banks will shutdown due no unavailability of funds to run the business. Anyway,there are some people that are weak in taking charge of their businesses finance or they are poor in handling personal funds,so they take them to the bank to help them manage their money and to keep it safe. The main purpose why bank is needful is because we can't keep huge amount of money or treasure in our houses to prevent it from being stolen by a thief. We also needs the banks for our daily transactions either to receive or send money to someone in a distance from us.",

Instead of paying you a fair interest for your idle money there compared to the total sum of profit they make by investing it, they just pay you a small percentage, usually inferior to the yearly inflation of the country, while filling their pockets with the largest portion of the profit made. And unfortunatelly they are protected by the government and its laws.If you borrow money from the bank, you are going to pay high interest rates, but you are forbidden from lending money to other people with the same rates the bank charges, under the risk of being considered a loan shark, a thief. So, isn't the bank a loan shark as well?",

And if we keep it as FD then the bank gives us 5-6% interest and they cut income tax 10-15% from here.  And on the other hand banks provide loans to customers and charge interest ranging from 8-15%. And the bank deducts annual maintenance charges, debit/visa/master/credit card charges, sms charges and other charges from us.

      "body": "Of the four steps banks use to make money from customers, the most rewarding one of them all is number two: banks make a lot of money from the charges they deduct from customers every day.For example, with the way banks charge on every transaction, which in my country is about $0.05 per bank transaction charge, which depends on the amount you are transacting at once, if you are transacting about $500-$1000 at once, you will be charged a transaction fee of about $0.1.So if 100,000 transactions occur in a bank per day, with a service fee of $0.05 each, that's a whopping $5000 profit, just in one day. If it's also $0.1 per transaction X 100,000 transaction, that another $10,000 profit in one day. OP I concur with the first paragraph of this thread that we are indeed making more money for the bank.Without us (the bank customers) patronizing them, first, they would not have enough money to loan out, and they would not make money every day from the fees they charge on each customer's transaction.",

Money isn't made from printing it alone, it's made from making its concept tangible, which also happens to be the case when you make debt. You ask for a loan, the bank lets you borrow money to be paid over a certain period of time and wait, you also have to pay for the interest itself! Oh no, where did this come from? God knows, they just made it up. But this is okay, from a business perspective, except using our money for them to invest in stocks, bonds, and real estate, the banks make money off of issuing debts to people. I don't really see it as being a cash cow, because after all you get something out of every interaction you commit to with a bank. Cash cows are especially reserved to enterprises that bleeds their customers/users out of their money, with the customer not getting anything from the ordeal.",

Honestly, I do not think holding Bitcoin made a difference from holding fiat money. And still thinks that it is better to use a service that can give us interest on our money.  But in the current situation, since Bitcoin keeps on appreciating its value, we are very optimistic in holding BTC in our own wallet for profit, and I agree.  Indeed it outweighs the interest banks offer but what if in the coming years, Bitcoin price becomes stagnant, can we still say that holding Bitcoin is way better in terms of profitability than depositing it in banks that give small profit?In case, I always think Bitcoin is advantageous in terms of sending transactions due to not needing a third party to process the transaction.  But in terms of holding it, I do not think it is different from holding fiat money in our vault when the volatility of bitcoin somehow becomes stable.",

I honestly agree with the past banking system, which provided guarantees for the money they spent, namely peg with gold which was the measure of value and made money printing, so it was quite difficult to print money without the gold they had as a guarantor, but that changed with a money system that is no longer held in gold, of course bankers can easily print their money as they please.then the solution is bitcoin which has a limited supply and cannot be played like they play with fiat.",
