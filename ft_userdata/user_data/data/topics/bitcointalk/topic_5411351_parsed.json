The have been blasted with alot of crises lately since they became a federal parliamentary republic; this, as a matter of fact ain't helping things go right, coupled with :          •degradation          •population increase          •no proper plans for environmental rehabilitationI saw a couple of informations yesterday about the situation.The government shouldn't fold their arms and watch citizens dying; countries that are part of thier common wealth should help!    ...the likes of china etcI had an info about the current attack on them,the ILLUS at :   https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20220826-air-strike-hits-capital-of-ethiopia-s-tigray-region-as-fighting-resumes",

With terrorists and bandits. Some are refugees even in their own countries. Living in displaced camps and hoping for their next meal to fall from above. The world powers a playing politics and of course fighting. But when two elephants fight, the grass suffers. Chinese government I do not see much problem with them, but they are indirectly owning the economies of African countries by giving them high loans and investing in critical sectors of their economy. I wonder what will happen by 2030. But when it's not among the high powers, the media down plays it.",

      "body": "I think the media was silent during the rwandan and armenian genocides. There are many today who deny the armenian genocide even occurred. The same can be said of independence movements around the world. Catalan independence did not receive much attention. Same with the arab spring. The only one that received much attention was #brexit.Many pride themselves on not following international news. There isn't much of a market for current events around the world. A large part of the reason why many cannot put current events into their proper context. And find themselves caught by surprise when trends which were common abroad for many years, finally come full circle, landing on american shores. The cure for violence and war is knowledge and information. Its easy to get caught up in stone age lifestyles. When you don't know there are better ways to live.",

The world powers see is as an opportunity to sell and dispose some of their military capabilities. Also war time is the best time to get cheap economic and investment treaties because the warring factions are under-pressure to get support from these developed nations. It has been reported that there is an ethnic cleansing of the Tigray region. There are no evidence of this heinous crime because the government is not giving free access to the press to showcase these atrocities. The US and its allies are focusing only on the Ukraine crisis because Ethiopia is in Africa. The issue in Ethiopia has a tribal historical undertone and not just about democracy. Abiy Ahmed was democratically elected, but the Tigray region wants more autonomy and that's the main cause of the war.",

However the media plays a role and if the government of Ethiopia make it difficult for journalists to report in an unbiased way, then naturally fewer stories will get out of the region. Let's just be clear though, China is friends with no one - it exists only to advance it's own benefit and every economic project has been extended only in the most expensive and self serving way possible. If China lends you money, they charge you 10% and insist on importing Chinese labor to complete the project. At least when countries like the US assist they charge much lower rates and at least generate plenty of work for locals. It seems like you have it backwards anyway, any normal person would want freedom and democracy, China's authoritarian style of government is happy to support any level of terror or dictators without any qualms.",

It remained the only country in Africa with Liberia that weren't colonized.Quote from: zasad@ on August 26, 2022, 07:34:08 PMIf you do not want democracy, then you will have a war in your country .. how many times will this story be repeated?I see this pattern all the time too and I see the hand of the US in it. It was the same fate Libya suffered under Gaddafi. A country that was well run but the US felt it should be a democracy and ousted the charismatic but stubborn Gaddafi out of office. Till today, Libya has remained in a troubled state. It's the same thing that's likely going to play out in Ethiopia. When will Africans learn?Come to think of it, the super powers are often the problem of this world and the crisis therein. They like to head to countries they know they can get something compensatory from if they have to intervene in their crisis. There's always a point of interest. Otherwise the stay out. Most times, they're the troublemakers who hide pretentiously to act the good guy. They instigate the problem and then act like they're offering help.",

The first country doesn't try to get involved in something that doesn't favour or add value to her country. Am yet to understand why the news of what is happening in Ethiopia hasn't gone viral for the whole world to know about it. African countries should unite and stop all this unnecessary waging of war hovering around their territory than waiting for the first country to get involved in all their wars before they put a stop by finding a lasting solution",

There are no demonstrations or riots here. Probably because most people are not aware of what's going on because Ethiopian government is censoring independent news agencies that try to report the facts.
