Did any researcher done any research to find Satoshi's IP Address ? It doesn't matter one bit if you find out what his IP address was, because that wasn't his real IP.  Satoshi was a genius when it comes to being anonymous, and the guy who built bitcoin, solved double spending, etc sure as heck knows how to use a VPN and Tor and knows how to do so very well.  It would be amazing if Theymos did release his private messages, but I understand why he decided against it.",

      "body": "The only IP address you can get is 127.0.0.1 also known and local. In spite of the fact that we cannot obtain Satoshi's public IP address, there is a high likelihood that he uses VPN services to hide, even if we did have his IP address. This would be a person who has been anonymous for years and we have no information about his real identity, so it is impossible to determine if it is a single person or a group of people who knows how to hide himself and his IP address. However, I guess they have access to the IP address he used in the forum, but he won't divulge it to anyone, regardless of whether it is a valid IP address or not.",

I don't think anyone would want anyone to do that researching satoshi's IP while it's just a waste of time, even though there used to be rumors of Mcafee knowing satoshi's identity but in fact it's still a mystery and it seems there is no need for people to know who satoshi is better just enjoy what he creates for all person",

How will knowing satoshi's ip address help you?I think it is time we allow the sleeping dog to lie in peace,  satoshi didn't want his face in the public or his identity known, why can't we just respect his decision and stop digging already?Let's say for example, we find Satoshi's IP Address, then what next?Or assume we are able to link an ID to the ip address used by satoshi, then what next?I think it's time we stop chasing after who satoshi is and just enjoy his invention - Bitcoin.",
