Therefore, there is no need for strictness for depositors, and perhaps the necessary strictness for stores, as the total of their transfers will definitely be more than a thousand dollars.Many countries do not have clear legislation for encrypted currencies, and therefore, as long as the transfer does not contain US dollars, most of these legislations are useless.Isn't this a bad choice for users?
