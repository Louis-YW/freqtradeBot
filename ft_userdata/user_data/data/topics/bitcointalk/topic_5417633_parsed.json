  "content": "We know this common phrase 'not your key not your coin'. It is just about exchanges, they have the private keys, which means address they give to users are for the exchange owner and they have full control over any money their users send to the addresses. This can lead to inconveniences like blocked or freezer account, withdrawal maintenance, inability to access your coins and many other things that can come up.Not only that, another are hackers. Many exchanges has been hacked in the past, many exchanges are hacked yearly, even Binance and some other trustworthy exchanges has been hacked before.These are common reasons we should not leave our coins on exchanges. But how are traders helping themselves? Not to hold on exchanges is good for holders, but would be hard for scalpers and day traders. Are you traders able not to leave your coins on exchanges? How are you able to manage transaction fee and the likes? You are day traders, your coins on noncustodial wallet will most likely be a stable coin like USDT and the transaction fee is not high, some exchanges even make transaction fee for their listed stable coin to have zero fee while cheaper fee while transfering from noncustodial wallet to the exchange. After you finish trading in a day, because of the stable coin low fee, did you move your coin to a noncustodial wallet and move it back to an exchange if you want to trade next time? Or you just leave it alone on the exchange you are using?What effective way you use to protect your coin as a trader?",

I tried doing it that way for better sleep but it was really annoying. You know trading is not like buy and hold, when I analyze the chart of any coin and see the right time to place an order and if I keep my assets in my personal wallet, I have to make a deposit and it takes about 10 minutes to complete the deposit process. During that time, it is possible that the coin I intend to trade, it may have increased or decreased and is no longer a good entry point. Sometimes it only takes a few minutes for us to miss an opportunity, a profit in a trade of only 10%-20% is too stable to take profit and it usually happens very quickly.",

It helps with the fees, plus some may use trading bots that actually trade there 24/7 (or at least watch the market).The problems start when people keep all their money in there, like in a bank, failing to understand that their money is not insured.",

And that should be okay, since it's also advised to not trade money you cannot afford to lose.It is better to trade with the money we can afford to lose, but this is often told to newbie traders. Some pro traders just prefer not to be looking for the amount of money they can not afford to lose in profit, but using high amount of money to trade, with a very low leverage that would most likely makes their trading profitable.I started to check about copy trading recently on Binance, I can see some traders that disclosed for other traders to see the amount of bitcoin or altcoin they used to trade, you may not know Â the actual amount from the size because some people use leverage, but you can determine it by checking the Return on Equity after the coin they are trading has moved in some price away from the mark price of the coin they are trading. I have noticed some used 1x and trading with over 10 bitcoin. Maybe they can afford to lose that though, but I am still doubting that always, but they are pro traders that if they are losing, they may leave the coin for a while and the market may correct itself. I do not against what you said that traders should trade with the amount of money they can afford to lose. This is because if a trader is not discipline himself enough, emotions and bad mindset may be experienced and leading to losses in a way all the trading amount would be lost within just little period of time.Recently, I have used some approaches which I like, but which I think other advices can help more about this.One of my approaches is that I leave just the trading amount on the exchange, it is little amount of money. If I gain, I withdraw it. If I lose, I have extra amount like 10% if my trading money that I will add from spot or funding account to my trading account. But if I have overall gain, I withdraw. Some traders think to withdraw $1 worth of fee transaction is high but they pay more when they are trading at times. I have noticed that I pay $3 to $6 or more as fee for opening and closing a position. The second approach is that, assuming I want to go for 1x using $500, I will go for 3x with $167. The worst that would happen is to transfer money from my wallet to my exchange account which won't take more than 3 or 4 minutes or less. This helps to reduce the amount of money I leave on exchange. But the disadvantage is for a trader to see increasing margin ratio or leverage to be profitable, but actually a trap for newbie traders to effectively loss their money.",

I use the binance exchange and of course it's safe in my opinion, using google authenticator 2fa and some other supporting securities so it's not easy to break into.
