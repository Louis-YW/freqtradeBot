Having become widespread and growing day by day, the Internet has become a way for people to express themselves.For a long time, mankind has strived to create some better parallel world with great opportunities, this is how the Metaverse appeared.The Metaverse, which every fifth Internet user is familiar with, is a hypothetical repetition of the Internet.This report will provide general information about the \"$CYBER Token\" and \"$CYBER Token Project\".PROJECT $CYBER TOKENThe $CYBER project developed in Metaverse World is formed and created as a game project.

The field was created to make it easier to write software in binary.Each $CYBER Game player starts the game with a default avatar from the \"Character Design\" and \"Upgrade Box\" fields. The user, thanks to the high-quality functionality of the game, will be able to easily form and improve his character with the help of items that he finds / receives during the game or buys, or with the help of NFTS.Avatars in the $CYBER Game, assisted by artificial intelligence and machine learning, analyze and study users' gaming routine throughout the week. Thus, avatars can independently perform acquired chores when players are not in the game.THE ARENA FIELDThe arena field, which consists of a $CYBER Game field with an area of ​​512 square meters, is a field where players team up to compete for the $CYBER token and immediately receive a certain amount of $CYBER tokens when they win.According to the rules of the game, teams in the Arena must consist of 2 or 4 characters.A player who wants to fight in the Arena will have to deposit any amount of $CYBER tokens individually into the team chest, then they can join the Arena.Teams meet in the Arena in random order and must have the same number of $CYBER tokens in the chest.THE CHAMPIONS ARENAThe Champion Arena, which consists of a field of 256 square meters, is a field that only the top 10 warriors in the ranking system can enter, where they are ranked after battles in the game.Warriors who, according to the rules of the game, can join this Arena, must also deposit any amount of $CYBER tokens in order to enter the Arena.After each duel, only one victorious warrior remains. This player advances by owning all the $CYBER tokens contributed by the opposing warrior. In this system, at the end of the duel, the winning warrior will be rewarded with both the $CYBER token from the opponents and all the $CYBER tokens he has collected.THE DUEL FIELDThe 256 square meter duel field is a field where players compete individually for the $CYBER token and they immediately receive $CYBER tokens if they win.Each player, according to the rules of the game, must deposit any amount of $CYBER tokens in his own duel chest.After the confrontation, the victorious warrior receives $CYBER tokens from his opponent's chest.At the end of each battle, the $CYBER tokens in the defeated player's chest are sent to the $CYBER Token House for use in game development and duels.AVATAR DESIGN & UPGRADE FIELDAvatar design and upgrade field, consists of a field of 256 square meters in $CYBER Game.Each player starts the game with a free default character.The following characters can be purchased and upgraded in the game:WitchElfCyclopsMetaGoblinDemonBartonAngelHarleyP.S.

Using wearable technology with the development of the ecosystem created in the game, $CYBER Token investors and players can transfer their emotions in the real world to the virtual world with their own unique avatars. They can experience everything that happens in the game and in real life through wearable technology.Example : When using wearable technology that is produced with integrated systems, you will be able to sense changes in the weather in the game using receptors on your skin in real life in the Metaverse.
