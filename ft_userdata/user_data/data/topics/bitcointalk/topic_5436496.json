A maximum unrealized failure of 75% from the all-time high was sustained by long-term investors as BTC fell to $17,000 midway through the year. An important indicator of the true worth of one's Bitcoin assets is the net unrealized profit or loss (NUPL).Is the Current Bitcoin Bear Market That Bad?At its present NUPL value, the Bitcoin network is experiencing a loss. A review by CoinGabbar indicates that there is still room for maximal BTC investment at this time. In contrast, it appears that institutional investors are not actively buying up Bitcoin. Compared to the Bitcoin lows in July 2022, the present loss condition is significantly better.Bitcoin has been on a downward trend recently. The cryptocurrency market hit a three-month low of $18,432 earlier this week. CoinGabbar reports that the current price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $18,930, down 3.21% in the previous 24 hours. Since its price dropped recently, Bitcoin's share of the cryptocurrency market has shrunk. This means that Bitcoin now accounts for 41.02% of the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies.Institutional Investors Have Little FaithGrayscale, a company that manages bitcoin assets, has noticed a decrease in its Bitcoin volumes. What this says is that institutional investors are not optimistic. The largest institutional investor in Bitcoin, Microstrategy, has increased its holdings. According to their most recent SEC filing, the firm has spent $6 million for Bitcoin at a price of approximately $19,851 per token. Together with its affiliates, Microstrategy now governs over 130,000 BTC. Logged",

This means that Bitcoin now accounts for 41.02% of the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies.Your data doesn't add up to the current price chart. As this post has been shared recently, the current price of BTC stands at around, $22,700 according to coinmarketcap. The bear market is currently at a position where people have invested few weeks earlier, are making profits. But the bear demand is still high if you compare the recent price to BTC's All-Time High price which is $69k. It could be a bull trap or maybe an indication towards a bull market, who knows. The market is still unstable if you are trying to do tradings. So it is best to DYOR and focus on that collected data rather than collecting data from other websites.",

Do not be afraid of the correction. You have to maintain your presence in the market because the bull is coming very quickly and you should be there. By next May, in the halving event, the price will be somewhere near the highest level. Before ever, it follows the same cycle it always has in my eyes, so a bear market is an opportunity for anyone who wants to invest and it's never a bad thing.",

The pump we've got now could be pseudo to what we expect and there could be further drop in price, then they could invest.Though, I like to beleive that the bitcoin deep has been established already but don't see this pump to be the introduction of a bullrun. It's just a little correction for price movements.Quote from: albon on January 24, 2023, 05:01:14 PMNot that bad, this is the case in the volatile crypto market, we are considered to be at the end of the storm as it seems to me, That's accurate.

The difference for these two bear markets are totally a lot and we can say that it's much better to look at this time because it's still 5 digits unlike on the past one which made bitcoin at $3k after hitting $20k. They've got their each share of the percentage losses and if we'll look at how much it had lost, basically, it's totally a lot if it had came from to $69k down to $16k.And as it swings and enters to $23k and goes back to $22800 then that only means that it's doing good but again, it is volatile and it may surprising go up or down within the next days.",

So it's not right to call this a bear market as bulls have taken over. Bull market doesn't mean crossing ATH, for everyone who has bought BTC at 17 or 18k it's the bull market as its time for them to cash out and get profit. Bear market is ideal time to buy not the time to cry.",

An important indicator of the true worth of one's Bitcoin assets is the net unrealized profit or loss (NUPL).You must be living in alretnate reality. The 69 thousand was in November 2021, not January. I'd also like to address the fact that long term investors did not lose 75%. Long term hodlers are people who bought in the bear market of 2018 - 2020 or before that, not people who bought in 2021 and decided to hold on to their coins no matter what. Those who bought in 2020 or before did not lose anything. Their coins are worth more and in the worst moments at 15 thousand some of them were maybe at a 10% loss. if they were holding coins from that small bull run in 2019.It's the same for people who bought in 2020. Most of them were in the green in this bear market. QuoteBitcoin has been on a downward trend recently. The cryptocurrency market hit a three-month low of $18,432 earlier this week.

QuoteInstitutional Investors Have Little FaithGrayscale, a company that manages bitcoin assets, has noticed a decrease in its Bitcoin volumes. What this says is that institutional investors are not optimistic. The largest institutional investor in Bitcoin, Microstrategy, has increased its holdings.Do they? If the largest institutional investor is buying it doesn't look like they're not optimistic. Institutions were mostly investing through proxies and these proxies were getting insolvent one by one last year because they were lending money. It's not a lack of trust in bitcoin but in centralized entities that custody bitcoin. I'm fine with that, maybe they'll finally learn to custody themselves.",
