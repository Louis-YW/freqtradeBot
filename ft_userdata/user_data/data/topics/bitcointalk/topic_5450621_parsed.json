  "content": "What are your top sites where you get your Bitcoin/Crypto news from? Lets just start right off the bat here, only drop links that come from credible sources. But I am interested to know where do you go to get all the most recent, accurate, and fortifying Bitcoin information from news outlets online? shoot even tabloids and newspaper programs i don't care where the info comes from, a magazine? Anything you think is worth sharing. Also, I am curious how much time you spend on any given week searching the web for information on current events, future events, news, research, etc on crypto related information. I'm really looking forward to the feedback on this one. In addition to news sources, feel free to just post any other crypto related sources for readily available information such as countdowns to crypto related events, crypto games, crypto charts, etc etc. Cheers, TREAD",

Basically one stop shop for everything you may need. Ther are also \"latest\" news parts and the trending ones as well, that way you get to see which ones are getting more attention, there are so many useless news so checking only the latest would not give you anything, you may miss the important ones but if you check the trending ones then you will be able to actually make some profit from it if you know the trending information.

In addition to news sources, feel free to just post any other crypto related sources for readily available information such as countdowns to crypto related events, crypto games, crypto charts, etc etc. For information globally, I still use BitcoinMagazine.com, Coindesk.com, and several other sources such as Twitter, which are only fleeting when they do have information that has not been posted by other channels. As for local news, I personally need it in order to see how far Bitcoin is moving and to what extent people in my country really have accurate information in understanding Bitcoin. Basically, I am always open to any channel of information and in fact, have more reading sources even though further research is needed to ensure that the information obtained is truly accountable.",

Thank you to all the members who kept me updated with their threads lol. Another is reddit. I use it a lot so I've joined several bitcoin related subreddits and also made custom feeds to categorize them lol. OSS's news bot seemed good as well so I plan to sub when I've created a telegram account again.Reading your post, op, I figured I should drop the thread about news aggregators we had last time, see: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5448024.0",
