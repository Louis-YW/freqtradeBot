Liability of one is asset of another. So, a gift card is simply an evidence of an asset. When number is send to you via Nakamoto's communication system no entity has liability towards you. So you own no asset with the name BTC. You claim you do own it. So, where is it? Blockchain only has info on that number that was sent to you. But no BTC, no asset exists there.",

I am trying nothing except getting an answer to my question. You people claim to transact with bitcoins but get only numbers send to your address via Nakamoto's communication system.Sending and receiving numbers is not making transactions. I could sent “5” to you via SMS and then claim that you now own 5 pieces of some revolutionary asset. Claiming in some text (Bitcoin Whitepaper) that people own xx BTC when a system sends numbers to their addresses after they invested electricity to keep the system alive, doesn't magically create an asset called BTC. Nor it creates it when electricity investors send numbers further. So, where did you get the idea of bitcoin being real?",
