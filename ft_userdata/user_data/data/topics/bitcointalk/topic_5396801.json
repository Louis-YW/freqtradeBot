  "content": "Theory:Take common passwords from the Internet, convert them to WIF (line by line), import them in Bitcoin Core, check for transactions (these are there, but addresses are empty),export transactions, mess around with this export to get back commonly used words/texts as private key sources (that had transactions).Effect:From 500 000 passwords I've got (SHA256 once and later twice which gives 1M passwords) ca 200 passwords that have been used as source for private key (later converted to WIF).Each line represents text which converted to private key/WIF (sha256 once and twice) would give address with transactions. So these are \"passwords\" which people used for their generation of addresses.These are the passwords:Code:012012910653322450711199609532945111985aag19924221unseen120630452068344225048525101970251079254948257035812580456259107al2598897259988267949226942267933678364156415644lords66210347388b4c47sistersA#45adagio123adagnyafddssdfagnomicalalexboy1algoristicanathemaapogeearioseatacamenanautograph'savsp55banivabarrigudabeachingbeachlessbeast'sBette'sbillablackseedblya64BoingBoing00But I do not propose all these thingsbyteme1cabireancalyceraceouscalyptracd0d4cc32346750408f7d4f5e78ec9a6e5b79a0dcherriedconch'sConfucian'scrane'screvasse'sCriscodatachip60datorndaunasdauntsdaveDevil#2017downspoutdune2DuPontedgarelaedgewiseedwardeanefendimefever79effacement'seffaceseffectfulentophyticallyextracranialfellingFerrari@13579finnishfl4tr0ngastroalbuminorrheaghghgh77glaciometerGolf001gordongrotesquegrouped and combinedhallelujahhhhsmhHonshu'shydroferrocyanichyperalgesisinconsideredincorrigibility'sinfamizeingeinveighing incessantlyjacket'skaartje1Kenyansknighthood'sknurlatirostresleinad99Like attempting to number the waves on the snore of a limitless seaLizzielomekol1lx76M@ster#5555maikemakermandarinatemarcus15marjam52MaronitemeannessMeuse'smicaelamischievousnessmizzlemouilluremuslinedmyrokermythologist'sneglectinglynettlefireNova#54octupleOne@45orthodomeoschealotorrhagiaototomypancreatismparallelepipedicpomp and pageantryprepricepromptness'sproteroglyphicpuseypyroheliometerpyrrhonicquinolineraspberryrattonerrecarbonateredivertiblereplicatoryreplightreprosperreptilityrhemistsalicylizesanguinicoloussarahwsarcocarcinomaschizaeaceousscrofulodermascrofulosisseacoast'ssemimagicalseroimmunityServer#98settee'ssevimShadow4444shamondSign1111skola190snowbergstandeestartleSudokuswarbiet3st1ngtarnishmenttellurismTORRES33trionychoidTrudeautruelikeunavertiblyunconfinednessunique personalityunkemptlyunpoundeduntumultuousustaswalepiecewarmth'swhoknows420wilma0823wingspread'swondermongeringWroclaw'sWww$wyneyak'szaki67zeuxianzingiberzyklop",
