  "content": "VICKREY AUCTION - BABOLEX CARD PACKThis is a well established format for auctions, but not one I've seen used here on the forum before. Please read carefully and ask any questions prior to bidding if you do not understand. A Vickery auction is a \"closed envelope\" auction where bidders do not know what bids others have submitted. THE WINNER OF THE AUCTION IS THE PERSON WHO SUBMITS THE HIGHEST BID. THE WINNER PAYS THE SECOND HIGHEST BIDDER'S BID. ¬†Bids will be submitted via PM to me directly. I will respond to you with a quote of your bid and update the thread with all who have placed a bid, but the bids will remain secret until the auction is over. My knowledge of the bids does not impact in anyway other's bids. If you do not trust me, do not bid, but this is hard for me to manipulate. Once auction is over I will post quoted bids placed by every bidder. This will determine the winner and price. PLEASE READ THAT AGAIN to be sure you fully understand the auction format. Auction TermsUp for auction is 1 (one) unopened pack of 7 (seven) Babolex cards.  Made by Vincent Faudemer this pack is the English, orange, version and contains cards depicting the cartoon character Babolex and the 7 wonders of the ancient world. These cards were originally produced in French, but this is the English version. There are 49 total cards to collect and each has a secret code that (according to the website) will be able to be redeemed for the printed satoshi value on the card and for game tokens to the future Vincent Faudemer token (I remain skeptical about these claims).I make no guarantee about the cards in the pack, their value, or future ability to redeem them for anything. ¬†Here is more information direct from the website if you are interested: Babolex Cards WebsiteHow to bid: Please submit a PM with your bid to me (geophphreigh) directly. DO NOT POST YOUR BID IN THE THREAD. It is OK to comment in the thread about the auction or that you are submitting a bid, but keep your bid secret!! Bids in Bitcoin only, no minimum and no maximum. ¬†Only one bid per person, bids may be changed prior to auction end time, a PM will be sent to confirm any new/changed bits. End time: No more bids accepted after BLOCK 738,335 (~1000 blocks from start, ~7 days)Shipping: Shipping from US, cost will be based on location. Willing to ship international and/or direct if I have worked with you previously. Paid by winner along with any import/VAT taxes. PM will be sent to each winner to confirm payment and shipping details.Escrow: Escrow with trusted forum member (such as Minerjones or Krogothmanhattan) mandatory for new members, welcomed for others based on prior interactions and preference. Escrow fees to be paid by buyer. This is to protect both buyer and seller.Sniping: Not applicable for this style auction. No bids will be accepted once end block height is reached. Excluded from Bidding: I may exclude bidders at my sole discretion. No alt accounts. Pay To: 383Nf7ymmNEpuh8TYcXG8oW6SxNUkgq6tG Payment in bitcoin only and only to this posted address. It matches the address listed in my profile. Payment expected within 24 hours of auction end. I will not ask for payment to any other address.IMPORTANT: I will not ask anyone to pay prior to the auction end time. I will not contact you outside the forum requesting payment. All communication regarding this auction will occur within this thread or via forum direct message. PLEASE BE CAREFUL and do not send any payment to potential scammers. I made this a self moderated thread so if any bids are placed in the thread they will be removed.Have fun, happy bidding!Geophphreigh",

I tried to pick out a low priced item so people would have fun bidding with a new format and not break the bank, low risk. Wanted to try out this format to see how a known price item would do, vs. a price discovery auction. There is no benefit to waiting until the very end of the auction as bids are sealed, so get your bids in!Geo",
