One thing to learn from is that they stated that they are putting their bitcoin holding into a self-custody wallet. As a person or organization, there is nothing better than to have your keys and your coins than to depend. This means a lot to me and to people that prefer self-custody. Tether has $1.5 billion in bitcoin. That is 2% of their total reserves. 85% of their total reserves is in cash, cash equivalents and other short-term deposits, primarily treasure bills.https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-to-buy-bitcoin-based-on-monthly-net-profitsBitcoin will be a coin that people and organizations will depend on. More organizations will see that bitcoin offers value more than fiat, but they need to understand why, when and how.",

One thing i also believe is that not only tether is into this, there are many other companies and organizations that do buy and hodl bitcoin consistently without us knowing as long as they are not making noise about it, this are investors that don't only rely on their own coin, they uses other's invest with them to secure a guaranteed asset with bitcoin in case of times of uncertainties.Quote from: _act_ on May 17, 2023, 02:04:02 PMOne thing to learn from is that they stated that they are putting their bitcoin holding into a self-custody wallet.They all invest with bitcoin and have their coin in their personal wallet while their own investors will have theirs with them, what an irony.",

Be careful whoever is holding a decent amount in this coin because this many times reminded you that the next major crisis is gonna be related to the tether. As most of the reserves are on equities and bonds whatever they call it short-term or whatever but they can't provide enough liquidity on the spot if USDT gets de-pegged and that's gonna be a great disaster again.If they are thinking to increase their BTC reserves it's great but it is again alarming for us because it will lead to more volatility in the market if any fud occurs similar to the LUNA. If any fud occurs and USDT gets de-pegged for the liquidity team will sell out Bitcoin as LUNA's team did and that will lead more market volatility.There are a few key features of Tether;♣ Lack of Transperency.♣ Unconfident Reserves.♣ Regulatory Risks.♣ Counter Party Risks.♣ Uncofident Supply (Token Printing).",

How can a company as big as Tether keep all those juicy gains with them all this while and not invest in Bitcoin? It makes no sense. What I don't want to hear about Tether company is that they come up with an idea to build something for crypto space, maybe a metaverse project or a layer 1 project, I will stop using usdt at that time because anything can happen. There might come a time where they will announce a bankruptcy,  and that will bring the whole market down, Tether USDt should stayed Tether USDt, please lol.",

If yes, it's a great decision to be taken as a business.  Microstrategy is definitely way more bullish on bitcoin than anyone else. But this Kind of approach that Tether is taking makes sense.

But yeah, you're right it's all about the team.While Luna and UST's management have really something into their minds to do some dirty work then Tether has proven themselves that they've got reserves. Anyway, that's just all what I've thought of and hopefully this would encourage others to focus and buy Bitcoin.

An attack to the company will clear do a double damage to them because they are same while Tether is using Bitcoin which is a different entity. Bitcoin is performing very solid for many years and also they only use 15% of their revenue unlike dumb Luna that directly pegged the price on their token value by manipulating the token supply. Tether is the most use stablecoin in crypto market.
