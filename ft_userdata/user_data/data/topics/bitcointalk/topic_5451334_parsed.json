And beginning with I have a lot of things out there that are just as bad, if not worse.BUT come on, clean it up a bit if you want to work on maintaining for code something like core where you are going to be responsible for peoples funds.Other then that since I have casually been following he seems good. I just never looked at more till now.-Dave",

      "body": "yeah, ryanofsky seems a good choice, for a variety of reasons. he's been working on the project a long time, and offers thoughtful and insightful dialogue to others, both when reviewing and when his code is the subject of review.naming no names, but there was disquiet among the \"there needs to be a formal process\" camp of people, which seemed to be a thinly veiled attempt to criticize the lack of support for (in essence) their choice of candidate for maintainer late last year. The same loose group seems to have noticed that creating an alternative implementation of a bitcoin node is the only meaningful recourse, evidenced by their (unsuccessful thus far) attempt to drum up support from developers to start a new project that would \"fix governance problems\" in the Bitcoin Core project.it seems as if the activity around the Bitcoin Core project is gradually getting smaller than it was 2012-2017, although that's just an impression. for sure at least some developers on the project have opined that there's significant work to do, and not enough devs. regardless of whether one agrees with the direction of the project or not, that sounds to me as if they know what the direction is, they just need new talent. (FWIW, every sub-project make sense to me, with the possible exception of the v3 transactions/package relay stuff, which sounds overly complex as solutions go... but I'm undecided as of now)how the project could possibly be helped with squabbling over meta-process bike-shedding is perhaps not such a mystery... let's just say I'm glad these people are being politely ignored",

I have a lot of crap sites out there. I 100% admit it, a lot are not maintained or even looked at. But are still sitting out there, if you happen to trip across one of them so be it. If something dies on one of them like the letsencrypt renewal, then also so be it.However, since the link was directly in his github profile I would think that he (or someone) would have noticed it an fixed it, or changed the link.As Carlton said, more maintainers is better.-Dave",

Even if I think he could update his SSL if he wants to work on bitcoin core I don’t think that it is actually a good indicator if he is a good coder or not.In any case I hope he is added and will bring some fresh ideas to the core development, since I think that is always a good thing.",
