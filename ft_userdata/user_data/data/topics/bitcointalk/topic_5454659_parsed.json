But i will answer to it when you fix it as this is something i am interested at.Quote from: avikz on May 31, 2023, 04:27:40 PM-cut-ICO, IDO, IEO, STO - these are all same processes under different naming just to fool people.

Securities are a different thing then utility tokens, even though the fundraising or \"offering\" method has been same. Mostly those are legal nightmare and tokens in their current form doesn't really suit for securities.",

I am completely aware of that fact. But does it change the modus Operandi? No! Coin creators are constantly finding new ways to lure investors in. But what's the end game? Sell coins and wait for them to be listed in a CEX/DEX. The majority of the time, creators sell their own holdings and get out with fat profits while the common investors like us rot in hell. I personally hold millions of dead tokens which have no value at today's date.",

Agreed on that. I was amazed when people were doing IEOs and IDOs etc, while saying same time that ICOs were such a scam. They were somehow totally unaware how that sounded. And obviously STOs even though no one seemed to understand why and how it was even legal. If i recall correctly some did anon STOs . That point it was obvious that only few seemed even understand what real securities are.Quote from: avikz on June 01, 2023, 04:20:38 AMI personally hold millions of dead tokens which have no value at today's date. You and me both . Somehow i am still annoyed that some of my wallets are filled with dead tokens forever if i don't burn them. Some of them are just advertisement spam though. And those dead tokens are showing in my portfolio app forever if those apps don't delist them.",
