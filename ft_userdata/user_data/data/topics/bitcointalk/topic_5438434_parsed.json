  "content": "Hey there!Sometime ago (to be more precise, it will make tomorrow 2 years), I've tried to run a contest[1] within our community aimed at celebrating Pie Day (3/14)[2]. The whole theme was very similar to the pumpkin carving contest run by ChiBitCTy[3] recently but instead of focusing on carving pumpkins we would challenge the community to make delicious Bitcoin themed pies, such as this one (taken from here[4]):Sadly my contest didn't harness any interest and I ended up not having any entry for it. This year, however, I would really like to try to \"push\" this idea again, just in time for celebrating next month Pie Day! As for rewards, if I'm able to, I would really like to gift a Foundation Passport Batch 2[5] to the winner. If by the time of opening the contest I'm not sure that I'll be able to offer that hardware wallet, I do know that I'm able to offer a Trezor Model One[6] for sure (I would order them for the winner). What do you guys think? From my perspective I think that's always nice to have thematic events within our community, but I'm open for different opinions...If there's enough positive feedback regarding this idea, I'll open up a more structured post about it in this section of the forum and officially launch the event.

      "body": "I've been thinking for a while regarding the small set of rules that could be implemented for the contest to be based on... Considering the community feedback, this is the set of assumptions I'm currently considering:Rules:Pie must be made by yourself and the theme should be Bitcoin related (you could even include a homage to bitcointalk  ).In order to be qualified you should post a picture containing your homemade pie + a piece of paper with your username and date;Only 1 entry per user (you're free to include any number of pies on your picture);Competition will be held in two phases:1st Phase - From 14th February to 14th of March : This is where all the users are free to submit their entries;2nd Phase - Voting process from 15th of March to 19th of March. Winner shall be announced on the 20th of March. I believe that the voting should be made by means of MERITING, but I'm willing to discuss this with the community (also, another thread would be made);The prize would be distributed according to the following quantity: 1st Winner would get 60 % of the price pool, 2nd winner 30 % and the 3rd one would get 10 %;Accounts prior to a certain date are excluded from taking part on the contest;No minimum entries for the contest to run;Prize:Passport Foundation Batch 2 / Trezor Model One -> Replaced by BTC only (to preserve users identity/personal information). As of now, the total size of the pot is the following:UsernameAmount (BTC)RickDeckard0.0065Total0.0065Questions to the community:What would make you more at ease? I could post a donation address to whoever wanted to contribute to the amount in the pot, controlled by me (and that would mean that the community would have to trust me) or I can try to talk to a fellow escrow that I know to hold all the funds (including my own funding);Should I change some rules?

On the other hand, polls can tricked by using multiple accounts. I'd rather suggest to use the rules applied to lattest edition of BitcoinTalk Community Awards. From my perspective (which was shared by a dozen of other users -- you can read posts made inside this topic) a no merit rule combined with setting a minimum amounts of earned merits are very helpful:Quote from: GazetaBitcoin on November 08, 2022, 02:17:41 PM2. No merit sending is allowed from nominees to users which nominated them. This should improve dramatically the accuracy of results and offenders will have to support a penalty. For each merit sent, 1 vote is deducted. So for example, if in the voting topic Alice sent 5 merits to those who nominated her in any category, then we will not count these votes (but the rest of the votes that are addressed to other nominees will be taken into account). In addition, if a user voted for Alice in two categories, then the votes for each of the categories will be unaccounted for.3. Eligibility-wise, the earlier ruleQuote from: icopress on January 24, 2022, 10:07:00 PMYou must have 50 merit or be a full member or higher to vote ➥ Note.will be changed toYou must have 50 earned merits to vote ➥ Note.I believe though in our case, of a pie making contest, there are lower chances for abuses, therefore the merit threshold can be lowered. Maybe 30 earned merits? Additionally, those two rules may be supplied by a rule for a minimum amount of activity in order to be eligible, which may be set to 30 as well. After all, the idea is to limit an eventual accounts farmer which could join with 100 Brand New accounts (although I think this is highly improbable to happen), therefore an amount of 30 activity points would be decent enough for still allowing a very large pool of users to participate, if they would be interested.Quote from: Helena Yu on February 10, 2023, 03:45:01 AMThere are 2 ways:Every contributors just hold in their own wallet, when the winners have been announced, every contributors can send the prize to the winnersUse trusted escrow if you and other contributors doesn't want to get confused or want to be more efficientIn most likely, allowing sponsors to hold their own funds accepted, as there are low chances to have a liar or scammer pretending to offer a sponsorship.Quote from: Helena Yu on February 10, 2023, 03:45:01 AMQuoteShould I change some rules? Or even add more? I want it to be a fair contest for everyone but also prevent double posting from users who may create new accounts for example ...Only Full member and above are eligible to vote, or any ranks have been received at least 50 MeritsOne user can vote x user(s), or there's no restriction and one user can vote all participants, as long as he want?I believe that limiting eligible ranks to Full Member and above (combined with setting a minimum of 50 earned merits) will make the pool very small for a pie making contest. In the case of BitcoinTalk Community Awards, this rule allowed, if I remember well, about 3000 users. From these, only 141 (eligible) voted. And this was a contest with a very high exposure. Most likely, for our pie making contest the exposure will be lower, therefore the real pool of possible voters would be dramatically lowered.Here I'd suggest instead to eliminate the rank requirement, as long as we keep the merit requirement and have the merit requirement set to 30 instead of 50. Regarding abuses, again, chances are very low: who would make some merit abuses to merit his accounts from a possible own accounts farm, in order to have 50 earned merits per profile just in order to participate at a pie making contest? Tl; dr: my suggestion is to extend voting period to 2 weeks, set an eligibility rule allowing only users which earned at least 30 merits and 30 activity (no matter the rank), forbid merit sending from nominees to those which voted for them; and allow eventual sponsors to hold their funds and personally send them to winners",

After considering the feedback it actually ends up making sense. Considering not only this will be a small event, we would need to have a good sample of time in order to gather enough feedback to have a clear winner. Quote from: GazetaBitcoin on February 10, 2023, 10:48:07 AMTl; dr: my suggestion is to extend voting period to 2 weeks, set an eligibility rule allowing only users which earned at least 30 merits and 30 activity (no matter the rank), forbid merit sending from nominees to those which voted for them; and allow eventual sponsors to hold their funds and personally send them to winners This is a great contribution (again) Gazeta, and shame on me not even considering taking some rules - and tweak them according to the scale of this contest - from the already well organized event that was Bitcointalk Community Awards. I suppose that the rule to forbid merit sending from nominees to the ones who voted for them is to prevent users to vote in X user because he knows that there's a high chance of receiving merit from him/her correct?As for the required merit & activity for the contest, the suggestion from Helena Yu, yourself and CryptoHeadlineNews totally makes sense and it's far more balanced than the one I proposed. I think that 10 merit is too low as a requirement because I really would like to send a message to users that if they want to take part in this awesome contest they should try their best in making positive and informative actions whithin our community, thus earning them well deserved merit, activity and thus providing an organic growth to the platform. That is why I'm more geared towards values around 30 merit & 30 activity than lower ones, even if that means that we do end up loosing some participants (and even so, if you are really confident that you would make a great entry, I don't see earning the required amount of merits such a herculean task.)As for the prizes, I think that having multiple users/sponsors holding their funds may make the distribution of the prizes a tad more difficult regarding each user sending Y amount to each of the winners (considering 60 % for 1st place, 30% for 2nd and 10% for 3rd), but that's easily achievable by a good spreadsheet and management. I'll also apply this criteria to the pot Things are looking great guys! We're having great points being discussed, and I'm really seeing this contest being able to be launched right on time! I'm building the thread as of now, still open to suggestions until 13/02/2023 23:59 GMT",

However, it's not a herculean task even by far. I am sure that those which have at least 10-15 merits can manage to obtain a few more for becoming eligible, if they really want to. After all, for ranking up from Member to Full Member you need a 1000% raise of merits (100 merits is 1000% more than 10).

However, it's not a herculean task even by far. I am sure that those which have at least 10-15 merits can manage to obtain a few more for becoming eligible, if they really want to. After all, for ranking up from Member to Full Member you need a 1000% raise of merits (100 merits is 1000% more than 10). In our case it's \"just\" 300%  Indeed, I don't think that 30 Merit & 30 activity is such a high bar that will make such a high barrier to participate in the contest. If certain users really want to take part in the contest, they for sure will try their best to gather enough merit & activity in order to take part in the contest.Quote from: GazetaBitcoin on February 11, 2023, 04:59:07 PMI'd have one more mention, about how many nominees a user may choose? Should it be only 1? 3? No limit?I'm more geared towards only 1 vote per user - This would make sure that you'll only pick the one that really, really stood out from the rest of the entries. It would make each user actually use different criteria to judge a certain entry and cast their vote on the one that they think truly represents the winning pie. But, then again, this is my point of view and I'm open to hear other users opinions on this...",

      "body": "And another year is just around the corner. I am planning on creating a 2nd edition of this contest but I would like to know if I should change/add rules or requirements to it. As for now the only change that I will probably implement is the voting system to a ranked choice voting style (I got this feedback actually from @JayJuanGee back when the contest was running). To anyone unfamiliar with the concept here is a quick summary by Wikipedia[1]:QuoteThe term ranked voting, also known as preferential voting or ranked choice voting, pertains to any voting system where voters use a rank to order candidates or options—in a sequence from first, second, third, and onwards—on their ballots.If no suitable winner can't be found in the first round - meaning that they don't have 50% + 1 of the total votes - then another round would be held where the previous votes would be cast in the other candidates (respecting the voters rankings). This helps users who were indecisive last year and is a more representative solution considering that no vote gets lost (you can still support other users entry even it it wasn't your top pick).This would probably have a limit of 5 entries per user and a tie rule would have to exist but I think it would be a nice shift. What do you guys think?[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting",

I did not see a contest based on such rule before (I mean on the forum) so, why not, you should try that too. It may bring some frustration to those close to win but which just did not get to 50%+1 thus they have to go through another round of voting but, in the end, I think the winner will have much more satisfaction while looking back and remembering the emotions felt during preliminary rounds.So try this Nevertheless, I am more than happy to hear that you want to organize a second pie baking contest. I wish I'll win second one too; not sure if I'll be able though, but I certainly am interested in participating again",

I think that a ranking voting is a good option for this contest as it would mean that every voter would have the opportunity to support their favorite entry even if their first option doesn't win. This way no vote goes \"to waste\". I am still studying the available options within the ranked voting system, but I am really eager to try it out in the next contest.Quote from: GazetaBitcoin on January 28, 2024, 10:23:16 AMNevertheless, I am more than happy to hear that you want to organize a second pie baking contest.

Looking forward for your entry  .EDIT: One of the principles behind the current voting ranked system that I am considering running - Single transferable vote - is that it is designed to find a group of winners that proportionally represent the voting population. This means that, with this method, there won't be a first, second and third place.",
