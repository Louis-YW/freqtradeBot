Just see what happens to a wheatfield when it's flooded.While there are floods in some countries, there is also drought everywhere. Both can bring same difficulties to the lives of the people, this is very interesting events actually as they also occur while we are all experiencing wars, geopolitical crisis and economic shift. If you wear your tinfoil hat to connect them all, do you think someone out there controls the weather?",

Imagine those transport of goods that should be on the right time for delivery and the same goes for the travel and commute of office workers and other things that needs to be transported.The delay of their transport is also causing a delay of the money that flows in the economy of a country. That's why huge flood control projects must be implemented and the climate change also has something to do with this. But mainly, one cause of flood is due to the trash and garbage congesting the flood ways.",

A third of Pakistan is underwater. Many other countries are also on the risk of getting flooded due to global warming. The more flooding will occur, more and more crops will get destroyed which will result in significant reduction in production. All are linked to be honest! Smaller countries will have to spend significantly more to secure food grains going forward. Also with Ukraine (largest producer of wheat) unable to produce required amount of wheat, the supply will eventually suffer big time!",

A flood in itself wouldn't cause an economic crisis unless it's a greatly prolonged flood though(probably months?).Not to mention the damages or losses caused by flood itself especially to those places wherein some cases are really devastating. Given that there are obvious negative effects, it is not a hidden idea that it is not solely flood which is affecting a country's economy. It could also be how leaders of those countries manages or handles such situation. So If I would be asked, governance is the bottomline and is the biggest factor that would reflect to one economy, no matter what natural/man-made disaster comes.",

Floods in areas in rice fields will certainly cause crop failure, floods can damage infrastructure. Floods will hamper the traffic of an area, especially in the distribution of food or logistics, causing the supply to be disrupted.In this condition, when demand is greater than supply, it can cause an increase in the price of various commodities. or an increase in the inflation rate this will have an impact on increasing the prices of various commodities so that they contribute to the inflation rate.but the flood itself will not cause a country's economic crisis.

Because that is a natural disaster. There are some floods that are caused by human beings by blocking the drainages or from the federal government by opening the dam and one thing I discovered from flooding in Africa, Companies benefit from the disaster, mostly, matrass (Foams) Food etc. Government also make money from flood because in the flooding period any amount of money that is spent in the flood period it does not count for because it is a disaster period. So government Ministers of disaster always used this opportunity to embezzled the money that is budgeted to help the victims of the disaster. Human beings are displaced by flood disaster. Schools are closed Farmers and Fishermen are suspended.",

Farmers or their plants rather will need a sufficient amount of sunlight and water (rains) so that they can grow their crops healthy but because of what some people are doing (bad things which affect the environment) this breaks the balance of the weather.Sometimes we feel too hot and sometimes too cold or too much rains, which is not good for those who have a farming business. When people starts littering around, that is also the number one cause of floods. Floods are very damaging not only to the farmers or their crops but also the people who are going to be affected with it.",

I have seen on instagram and in news too- people were devastated. But I was impressed to see the determination of Pakistani people and the way they all stepped fwd in the time of need. There were picture circulation on social media - the young children where opening their small money boxes for making donation for the affected people in times of crisis like this, you will see that there's still humanity left within us. it is no surprise however, to experience this type of environmental disaster because of the climate change that we are experiencing. so in our own small way, we can contribute in lessening envi pollution. it is not too late to act now. we should not wait for government initiatives but we can already start our routine change in our home. always remember the concept of zero waste, and i believe that's more than enough to contribute in taking care of our environment.",

If we are talking about the production facilities, no.Natural disasters will change the infrastructure and the house building industry. Future buildings and houses will have to be rock solid and they will be built in order to be resistant against all sorts of natural disasters- floods, earthquakes, fire, etc. The increased safety will come at a greater cost. The insurance industry will also have to pay more for the damages caused by various natural disasters.The economy would be shifting towards less fossil fuel consumption and more renewable energy, but I don't believe that this would change the process of global warming in the short term, which means more floods and hurricanes in the future.",
