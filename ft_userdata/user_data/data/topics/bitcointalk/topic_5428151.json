  "content": "Dogecoin gained popularity due to its low cost as well as its welcoming community. Its community of users behind Dogecoin is involved on various social platforms, and it gained popularity specifically from Reddit.Doge could fail because - Dogecoin could fail in the near future due to its outdated blockchain technology. The Dogecoin blockchain is built on the Litecoin blockchain, which is based on Bitcoin's Blockchain.One of the main issues with old blockchains is that they're not scalable. They are unable to manage large volumes of transactions without slowing down or mistakes.Investors advice on investing in Dogecoin now as this is being the best time to purchase doge. Dogecoin prices are expected to rise as we approach the annual close. The increase in price fluctuations may eventually assist the price to soar and as per Coinpedia doge price prediction it will close the year at $0.118.Are these cons going to result in dogecoin price failing or Elon Musk support for it make this coin price increase?",

      "body": "Dogecoin will not be abandoned, it will always be remembered as one of the low cost coins and people will always use this coin for transactions. But to invest in this coin, I personally would not do it, because basically this coin doesn't have strong enough fundamentals and ecosystem, only relying on their community which continues to shill like for example what Elon Musk did some time ago. Do you think that Dogecoin will experience another fantastic price increase?",

In the future, there are varieties of changes and innovations regarding his company and it would depend if he still merges the use of Dogecoin with some of his company or if he continues to ignore the people's suggestions for Dogecoin, will be the very same reason for the investors to slowing to merge to another investment if they sense that Doge has no potential anymore.",

I understand the risk of investing in this project but looking at the market it is something that shows the stability of its position. It will die if nobody will use this but as long as many traders still using this coin, I have no doubts that it will stay and get support from the community.",

That's not the case! Dogecoin has a very strong supporter like Elon Musk and that's probably enough for Dogecoin to survive. Also if Elon starts accepting this coin in Twitter, its value may even skyrocket by few hundred percent.",

Second, Elon Musk holds 2.5 million of Dogecoin based on what heard, so I think that amount will still be there because as we can see this man loves Dogecoin.  So, therefore, there's no reason Dogecoin will collapse or becomes a failure in the future.",
