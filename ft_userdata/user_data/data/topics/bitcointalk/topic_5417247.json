  "content": "Hello all,So I've been advised by several very knowledgeable folks here that the official website for Bitcoin Core is https://bitcoincore.org/ after questioning in a previous thread the reasons that bitcoin.org doesn't point to version 23 but rather version 22 as the current version of bitcoin core.  I guess that's all fine, however today when I was looking at the Bitcoin Core site and looking to upgrade a to a previous version (prior to taproot) I found that at the following link https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.20.2/ there is a version listed as 0.20.2 which can't been seen on either: https://bitcoin.org/en/version-history nor at the github repository here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases . I started digging a little bit and performed the following check on the windows installer file Code:certutil -hashfile bitcoin-0.20.2-win64-setup.exe SHA256SHA256 hash of bitcoin-0.20.2-win64-setup.exe:6bee1cc525f950bb3c665d37b0dcbcecd84c8d238c2abefcce5ed05043290e8eCertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.A quick google of the hash produced came back with absolutely 0 results which is kind of abnormal.  In fact the only reference to this version or that hash of the version is on the link here: https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.20.2/ and in the file SHA256SUMS file. Either way, I was hoping that someone out there might know why this version is MIA from the GITHUB list as well as seemingly no other mention of its existence outside of the bitcoin core site. TIA!",

You can find it here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v0.20.2I don't know why it's missing from releases, possibly because it was made after 0.21.2 and it \"breaks the ordering\" and can make the things confusing for people not paying attention.However, you already had the binaries, now with this you should have the source code too for 0.20.2.",

      "body": "This is entirely a procedural error.There is a git tag for that release that is retrieved when cloning the repository. Additionally all git tags are listed at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags. Previously, GitHub would create a \"release\" for each tag, but no longer appears to be the case. Creating these releases are now a manual process however it is not part of Bitcoin Core's release process to make these, it was just that sometimes a maintainer would remember to do so on their own. For the most part, Wladimir would do that in addition to making the releases. However the release in question (and another, 0.21.2) were done by a different maintainer (as part of Wladimir's effort to split up his duties) and no one remembered to add the release to the releases page.",
