  "content": "After the recent announcement by Kucoin that new users have to pass KYC, and existing users cannot withdraw without passing KYC. I wanted to know which CEX still allows deposit, withdrawal, and trading without the KYC requirements. For the simple swap, I am aware we can use DEX, for actual trading Kucoin was the best option until they came out with this mandatory requirement. I knew a few CEX that did allow a user to trade on their platform without KYC a year back. They never had INR withdrawals but were good for traders who did not want to pay the surplus tax added by the Indian government. Since I was not sure whether they still have the same policy I went ahead and checked them today and I found only a handful are still allowing trading without KYC norms.   Eventually, every CEX would make KYC mandatory until then anyone can trade in these three Exchanges. OKx still allows users to trade up to 10 BTC without KYC.TradeOgre allows users to trade up to 1 BTC without KYCMEXC exchange allows 30BTC worth transaction without KYCBitget exchange allows $50k withdrawal without KYC every day Suggest an ExchangeIf you know any CEX that is allowing deposit, withdrawal, and trading without KYC requirements then please suggest. Do remember I am looking for CEX and not DEX.",

The fact now is that you would need to pass KYC for any deposit or withdrawal on their platform. These a genuine and trustworthy CEX and they would need to comply with local laws if they need to operate. Most exchanges that offer non-KYC trading are DEX, most of them are nothing but swapping platforms and are not meant for proper trading. For proper trading, you would need CEX which cannot operate without a KYC policy.",

Kucoin had been notorious in the past when $150m was drained through a hack and the same goes with Okex as well.If we are unwilling to pay the surplus tax levied by the Indian Government then it would be better to register in an exchange which is working outside the jurisdiction of our government and had nil ties with our government in the past. International exchanges such as Kraken, Binance and Coinbase had been loyal and trustworthy to their users and went to greater extent to protect their users thereby opposing the governments too.In such a case, it is safer to provide KYC in these exchanges and in turn trade multi chain transfers at an enormously lower fees while comparing it to DEXes.

In the past and in present their have been instances when a good project uses these exchanges to get listed, rather than a big exchange. That is why traders used to have accounts on exchanges like Kucoin, huobi and others in the past. As KYC becomes mandatory not every trader is happy to provide personal details to these exchanges. That can be one of reason why still people are searching for non KYC CEX. About Coinbase, they have stopped thier operation in India as of now. A few days back Indian users were sent emails informing their accounts have been closed with a wiered reason.",
