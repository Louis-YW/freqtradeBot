      "body": "It's the idea almost every beginner in the crypto industry seems to conceive. Without mistaking, I once had that idea while coming up. Never knowing of bitcoin to have other denominations like the Sat and mBTC and so any one who deals in crypto was thought to have a lot of money as per bitcoin price at a time and most of them came by this fortune through trading, airdrops, arbitrary trading and more of newbie stuffs like that.I only got to know better after joing on the forum and haven't spent some time here. Got to know more of altcoins and the probability of success to be very much 10% or less for the once out there and trading was/is the easiest way to loose a lot of money. Hence, one can only try everyday to keep having an edge to the day to day analysis of possible scenarios of the market.Haven't gone through your thread, I guess there is a few things I hope to understand and that is, the application of the DCA you've talked about.Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on July 02, 2022, 05:08:12 AMDollar Cost AveragingLike technical and fundamental analysis.  One gets to understand that there are certain news when it comes to fundamental analysis that sends doom and spreads fud in the crypto space. News like, China is closing all the mining houses or passed an anti crypto law. When we come to fundamental, we get it that, there are certain tools in such as the RSI that tells you, who is the dominant force in the market and possibly, if a resistance or support line is been closed on or could be broken. I guess you understand the picture now.Coming down to look at the DCA, am a bit confused on the narrative that follows and it's application or use in trading. How do I read this and actually apply it in my trading over a period.",

      "body": "Sites that calculate DCA for altcoins may be misleading and inaccurate because they do not give the normal distribution that occurred to the price of bitcoin based on a period of more than 10 years, these currencies have short lives and most of them achieve long-term loss, especially from 5 to 10 years.Bitcoin is a long-term trading strategy. Even if the prices are crashing, you will come out with capital (at least) if you decide to wait for a period of four to seven years.There are some hidden losses that may appear to you as withdrawal fees from the platforms that must be taken into account and try to reduce them.",

How do I read this and actually apply it in my trading over a period.What the OP is trying to say, in my opinion, is that DCA should be encouraged more because it lessens the overall impact of volatility, as opposed to actively trading cryptocurrencies, which on the other hand run a higher risk when dealing with volatility over a short period of time.What I mean is that DCA imposes discipline on people by allocating a portion of their income to buy bitcoin or any other asset they believe in on a regular basis regardless of price, allowing them to avoid counterproductive and inevitable decisions like buying at a peak or selling at a loss",

Also, thank you very much for the informative post If you are ready to invest for the long term, then I see no reason to be skeptical about when you should start investing, especially if you now have the opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a significantly lower price than a few months ago. Although it is possible that in the coming period the price of Bitcoin may be lower than today, DCA enables you to invest as much as you can afford at regular intervals.I suggest you visit the links posted in the first post, because you can learn a lot from some concrete examples.Quote from: https://dcabtc.com/Investing in Bitcoin with no DCA (Example)It’s January 1st, 2018, and John decides to purchase $5,000 worth of Bitcoin today.The Bitcoin price at the time was $13,800 per coin, which means that John now owns 0.362 BTC.Investing in Bitcoin using DCA (Example)It’s January 1st, 2018, and Alice decides she wants to purchase $5,000 worth of Bitcoin.However, instead of investing the entire amount today, she decides to purchase $500 every month, for 10 months.10 months later, Alice owns 0.61 BTC. That’s allmost twice as much as John, even though both invested the same amount.",

Also, thank you very much for the informative post Bear market is great to practice DCA and accumulate good coins. Bitcoin is the best coin for you to DCA in bear market.Don't DCA other altcoins in bear market because they will be divided more than Bitcoin. If you want to invest in altcoins, you must wait for bottom signal from Bitcoin and start to buy altcoins. If you DCA altcoins, you will see your porftolio falls in value a lot.DCA is for investment with your money, the money you own it, not what you borrow from other people from lending service or money you get from exchanges by using leverages. It is not your real own money.",

I had an investment of $2,800 and a profit of $150 in 4 months.Actually I wouldn't expect any profit from DCA-ing on bearish season for few months, because DCA is for long term holding e.g. 1 year, 2 years and so on. There's few early adopter still not sold his coins while they only bought each Bitcoin for $500-1000 only, but they're still hold until now. They may become a billionaire if they sold all their coins now, but they're not do that and still waiting the next ATH.",

You don't even need to use these things to be a successful investor; sometimes just buying the right assets and doing DCA makes you beat like 90% people who try to get rich quick.",
