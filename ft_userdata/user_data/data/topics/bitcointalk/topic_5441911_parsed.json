Â So let me get this right- you have earned a lot of money at a casino- they are requiring you to send 10$ from your wallet to \"verify\" you!Can you share the casino name, cause I have a feeling you're about to get scammed as this verification makes no sense, everyone could make an address and furthermore they could have taken those 10$ from your earnings!",

A more logic request is sending them Bitcoin Cash to verify your identity with Bitcoin Cash. However, even so it sounds like scam too.They are ask your to sign a message from a Bitcoin Cash wallet to prove your identity, ownership of the address from which you sent your Bitcoin Cash to their casino as deposit before you win big.More seriously, they can ask you to KYC.Summary, their request sounds like scam.",

Anybody can make mistake and this is your life lessons so just accept that you're scammed by a scam casino and don't waste your time and more money to do something further about this because no legitimate casino will ask funds to be transferred for verification process and this is only done by scammers to scam you further until you get rid off it.BTW how much money you deposited there and how much money you won there?",

Is it what you think of it guys as well?If it's not what I'm thinking and this is just a sole process of kyc then that's not going to be an issue.It's not a problem if they want to send your money from btc to bitcoin cash if they don't have that anymore on their hot wallet. But usually a casino do have a lot of choices for payments preferred by their customers.",

Your description is a bit unclear. Posting a screenshot of their message would be helpful since the link you shared needs an account to access it. Just upload it on an image hosting service and don't worry if the image doesn't show up since you're just a newbie. From their terms of service and what you described here, it sounds like you're talking about the KYC process[1]. That being said, their small deposit for a check is definitely shady as hell, especially if the minimum amount is $10. If you can provide a screenshot it would make it clearer.That being said, I think you can find more help if you post this on Gambling section since the issue at hand is not really about any altcoin but a casino service. Even if they are legit, my suggestion is to look for other alternatives. There are tons of casinos that have more reputation on this forum, I'd avoid using an unknown service with little to no history at all. Where did you find them anyway? Is it from an ad? Does anyone recommend it to you via e-mail, or something else?[1] https://www.luckylegends.com/terms-conditions",

Obviously it's scam, just like how ponzi scheme or exchange asking for security money or fee to withdraw the coins. It would become worst if the casino ask your KYC too, they have earn $10 with your KYC where your identity can be used for many thing e.g. create scam project, online loan etc.",

Make sure that you have all of the necessary documentation and that you're following the instructions closely.I think the key is to take the verification process seriously and to be diligent in following the instructions provided by the platform.If you're still having trouble, I suggest reaching out to customer support for the platform. They may be able to provide additional guidance or troubleshooting assistance.It's also worth noting that the verification process can sometimes take a while to complete.

Don't know about the reputation of that casino he was talking about but there are actually legit casinos who are doing the same thing. One of it would be Trustdice casino. I won a good amount with it last time using their free 25 USD sign up bonus but I got a prompt that I need to deposit first before I can withdraw all my winnings.I think the amount that I deposited was also 10 USD. I didn't hesitate of doing it because I believe the casino is legit and it seems I am right because I received my money immediately. They never asked me for a KYC but if they did I will still do it. On the other casino that I play which is called blackjack.fun, they never ask for a deposit by the time I withdraw the money that I won from the free spins but they do ask for a KYC. It was a little tough than usual but I still managed to complete it.",
