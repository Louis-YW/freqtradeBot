  "content": "My people, time don reach again wen we gat ask the question: which way Nigeria? Nigeria is one of the most blessed countries in the world with a rare combination of a vast arable lands, access to sea, abundant natural resources and mineral deposits, not forgetting the human resources the country is blessed with. Do we really have any business with being a poor nation? How did we become the poverty capital of the world?The citizens of the country are the easiest to govern. Nigerians are patient with leaders, they are willing to endure harsh policies with optimism and everyly law abiding in the mists of provocations. Only in Nigeria will citizens pay for electricity that they never used and pay taxes that are never used to build basic amenities. Nigerians are hardworking with firm resolve to survive. Nigerians are self motivated, always looking inward for solution to their problems. The energy and resilience of Nigerians are unmatched anywhere in the world. Anything we put body to do, we dey give our best. What then is the reason Nigeria have not assuming her rightful place in the comity of nations? The closest answer to this question is leadership as a result of the system of government we practice. Without political will, no nation will prosper irrespective of the resources they have. For instance, China was worse than Nigeria in terms of corruption and what have you until someone came on board and exercise the political will to enact laws that makes corruption punishable by death; this was the turning point in Chinese history.  In theory, Nigeria practices federal system of government,  a photocopy of the system in USA. But the irony of it is that we copied only the title and not the system itself. States in the US are independent; they make their laws, generate their revenues and manage their resources... only contributing certain percentages to the centre that is incharge of immigration, health, defence and few others. Conversely,  in Nigeria, the federal controls everything making the centre too rich powerful and attractive and this out less check and balance in the entire system. This is the origin of our problem. The Nigerian system is prone to manipulation as the foundation is flawed. This is the reason external forces do interfere with the elections processes to ensure that the worst of the people are installed into power. So, how do we change the narrative? Does it mean there is no hope? Well, changing the narrative is very difficult but possible. To dismantle the system, issue of religion, ethnicity and tribalism have to be addressed because these are the areas they use in divide the people in order to rig the system. If we can have just one leader that will reawaken the nationhood consciousness such that will make eberything Nigeria first before any tribe, culture and religion, then that will mark the birth of a new Nigeria... until this is done, I'm afraid, we don enter the circle of doom.",

Lol, bro you finished him on this one, you just spoke my mind, I wonder if he even resides in Nigeria seeing all the rubbish we are going through.@Doan9269 you are talking about role, how can the role you play as a Nigerian bring forth good development when the entire system is corrupt ?, even the police we report to in other to act as good citizens most times we become the victim of our own generosity, boss I no go lie u the system dey f**ked up.though I still see point wey u dey make, the country nor be only the government dem dey spoil am both individual leader of any kind sef still dey put hand to make the country worwor. for example after I finish my ND I con go to find IT placement for warri edjeba, all the 5 companies wey I reach dem dey tell me say I must get connection for inside the company before I fit get IT for there, no be say na work I dey find oo, ordinary IT.so wit the wey the country don bad reach I no sure say we the citizens fit do anything to take repair this country, if we say we need  change by force e fit result to war and from there the country fit divide or military regine fit take over.the truth be say even this talk wey we dey talk for here nor go fit change anything so make we leave am brothers .",

Even as everything increase like this abi u don hear government increase salaries for workers or na this oil company dem don increase salaries for there workers.I can see Nigerians are really working hard for themselves even without the government supports, u can hardly hear a Nigerian died of hunger very impossible u see dem hulking, pushing trucks doing petty trades and everything just to sustain themselves and you call dem doing nothing and blaming the government?

There are thousands of people dying from road accident due to bad roads. If you travel from Port Harcourt to Akwa Ibom through the East West Road, you will realise why we should avoid this pretence you are suggesting and be very vocal.  Fine, other countries have their challenges but should we relax and pretend all is well because other people also have their problems? We are in Nigeria forum so we can discuss Nija problems here. Will it be a crime if Nigeria make good progress at least like Rwanda? Them swear give us to accept suffering and poverty as a way of life? I understand the Nigerian system have conditioned many to believe that good life does not belong to them... it is written all over some people comment in this forum. I will suggest you open a thread where we all will start pretending and praising Nigeria since that is what will make you happy.",

The direct tax system within the country is more applicable to those within the Civil service and institutions. It’s almost impossible to taxes the rest of the citizens directly so a more different approach is used and that’ll be the indirect system to taxation in the form of Value Added Taxes (VAT).Still, Nigerians are very easy to govern because we still believe in trying again despite the hardship we face but, is this really going to solve it without taking the bull by the horn? Even a newly elect with good plans have his plans choked by the thorns that already exists within the system. It’s a real problem that needed be tended not gently but with sharp edges and fire.Long as the fabric been rented and a new weave is most desirable. I don’t know how the people who have made things bad still be in governance within a new system and still, we hope to see better results, it won’t work! The old has to go.",

In the whole Africa Nigeria is the most blessed country by Natural Resources but the Natural Resources are caused to the country. Op to answer your question is very simple, the situation we are now was caused by the colonial masters, they came to the country dehumanized us, collect our natural blessed resources and create a poverty Nation for us. I don't want to tok too much on this matter, but when life faces you hard as a strong man you have to over come am by hardworking. According to King Jaja of Opubo, the only way to over power and over come your enemy is hardworking and the result from it which wealth. So Nigerians have been left to face the hardship of life by her own leaders. We pray one day we will come out from it.",

Personally,the best way to solve this endless problem and hardship in the country is if Nigeria can be divided so that it will lessen the hardship of the citizens and government dictatorship. We are just claiming to be a democracy country with our mouths and not by practice. Military is taking over in our neighbouring countries. Like we saw on news yesterday the Military has taken over Gabon government and the surprising thing is that the citizens where happy. This shows that these people have being suffering from bad leadership and corruption in their government. If na white people dey Naija them for don protest since cast everywhere due to bad leadership and empty promises from government.",
