This made us think if he really knows how to sell a casino script, there's already bad intention, you should have spoken about the features of the script you are selling, instead, you are trying to oversell a product by posting guaranteed to make money for the casino operator and lose 100% for gamblers, if you're a marketer your boss should fire you and if you are the owner of the product, change your profession you are not good at selling.",
