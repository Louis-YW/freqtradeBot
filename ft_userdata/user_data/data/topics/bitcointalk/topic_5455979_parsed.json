What are the readers going to gain with the story? Go back in time to mine their Bitcoin and come back to the present? Those who are smart among the readers would probably ask what's next to get into that early. And what they can find next are a bunch of crappy shit proof of work coins in the space. This story won't have any impact or effect on the readers than 'we already missed the boat', so this is not needy. If I have the skills of a writer, I would have love to write about how many times Bitcoin have died in the past and keeps coming back to life, I would write about how the world really needs decentralization and how Bitcoin have opened that door.",

If I have the skills of a writer, I would have love to write about how many times Bitcoin have died in the past and keeps coming back to life, I would write about how the world really needs decentralization and how Bitcoin have opened that door. I would like that story about using Pentium 4 PC. What month/year was that? It will have an effect because I have included the history of Bitcoin in the book. I have included how we need decentralization and how Bitcoin opened the door.Â  This story will only be in one version of the book called After Bitcoin. I separated the two themes. miners are like prophets in the bible. Miners profited they believed they would get a return of profit. So I would like to include you in the book your story maybe outside of Bitcoin what were you doing? how did you come across it? Its more than just the equipment what was going on around you? Life? What lead you to mine Bitcoin? Did you find out in jail or was it online? stuff like that. I want it to be like a narrative of a documentary?",

It is a mistake to hold all 100% of the mined coins to increase the price and also sell all 100% of the coins. Unfortunately, I sold a lot of coins, and then regretted it. Be sure to leave 10-20% of the coins for luck.",

That's true, different times, different stories, but that doesn't mean the old stories are no longer good stories to be told, anyway, eventually at some point in the future when block rewards drop next to nothing, BTC becomes widely used, many home miners will mine BTCfor the sake of protecting their money, and possibly making a tiny little profit, there will be no room for all these large players then, just a small 10-20th USB sticks or smart light bulbs that maintain the network.",
