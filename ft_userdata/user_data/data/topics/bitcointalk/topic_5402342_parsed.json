I made a withdrawal on 10th which was processed within hiurs. Xspeed Customer Service are worse than useless. The online chat appears to be a bot who just says 'be patient' and I am struggling to get any sense out of them. What do people think has gone wrong and what are my options?",

Maybe put some extra spaces in the url so google doesn't pick them up and gives them credit for the link...I'd like to give you some general advice, but at the moment it's all hindsight: when it comes to bitcoin, stick to extremely trusted services, research beforehand and ask questions beforehand (to us). And don't use an online wallet to store your funds either...",

Better not to use the site again. You can do this, if it is crypto like bitcoin you are dealing with, check the txid given you for the withdrawal, check your transaction on blockchain explorer like https://blockchair.com to be certain that it is a valid transaction, then check if your receiving address is correct. But, with what I have checked about this site, I will conclude it to be a scam site.",

But, with what I have checked about this site, I will conclude it to be a scam site.I came to the same conclusion...I've looked at the url you (OP) posted, the site itself is only 5 months old, the whois info is hidden, trustpilot has only 2 reviews (from accounts that made 1 review in total, i suspect them being fake reviews).Other than that, the site itself looks suspicious to me... Can't really put my finger on it, but my gut feeling isn't good about it.The bottom line, however, is that bitcoin is irreversible, trustless, immutable and transactions are allmost instant (eventough it might take a while untill they are confirmed, you should see an unconfirmed transaction mere seconds after it was broadcasted.... An unconfirmed transaction shouldn't be trusted tough!!!)What i'm trying to say: only the sender can send you the funds they owe you, and if they come up with lame excuses like \"we sent the funds, it's just not visible yet\" (or something like that): i'm 99,9% certain they're lying.",

What I couldn't fathom out is why I was able to make a number of smaller withdrawals with my profits and then these two didn't appear and a pending withdrawal I made after hasnt been processed. I guess it is wishful thinking that it is a technical issue.The USDT withdrawals completed to ny wallet are showing but the missing ones arent. When I ask for a Tx Hash reference the customer service stock response is \"your question has been forwarded to the finance department please be patient\".",

There are many legit websites out there, but unfortunately there are also many scams. Be careful who you trust!",

I haven't written off using BTC to make back what I've lost but will do some more research.  I won't write off BTC if i were you because you the greatest investment option and thats if you don't want to be a victim of another scam site like Xspeed but you have good knowledge about BTC investment and you can find some tips for your BTC journey on this forum. In the meantime, understand that crypto day trading is high-risk and this current market is mostly good for long trading and accumulation.",
