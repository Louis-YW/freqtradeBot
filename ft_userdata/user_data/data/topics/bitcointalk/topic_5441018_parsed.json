  "content": "Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387774.msg61807137#msg61807137Exactly one year has passed since Russia started the war and Ukraine is still free. It was a very difficult year, but fortunately the winter was quite warm, so the bombing of critical infrastructure and systematic blackouts did not affect morally, neither me nor the Ukrainians in general. I want to add that over the past year, in Mykolaiv, the duration of the sounding of the warning siren was 45 days or 1000 hours ... Just think about this figure.The absurdity is that Russia continues to accuse the West of starting this war, moreover, I am a little confused because I do not understand what logic the Russians are guided by when they sing a Ukrainian song at Putin's concert. I want to mention that Russia has not managed to capture a single regional center, despite the fact that there are now half a million Russian soldiers on the territory of my country.Anyway, I am reunited with my family again, I have already chatted on this subject with some of you ... and I want you to know that your kind words mean a lot to me. After the end of the war, I will make every effort to visit all those people who have supported me over the past 12 months. Returning to the topic of discussion, I want to say that people continue to donate white fabric (for camouflage nets), conservation, food, and warm clothes. Among other things, 6 chainsaws, 140 sets of thermal underwear, 50 flashlights, 60 liters of oil for cleaning weapons, 8 walkie-talkies and 12 potbelly stoves were transferred. ~Let me clear up some of your confusion. When Russians sing Ukrainian songs in concert, it's because Russia and her half-million soldiers don't really want to harm Ukraine. They are simply doing the thing you call an absurdity... responding to the US/Ukrainian government that was attacking Russians (and Ukrainians) in the Donbas (and many other areas).It isn't that Russia and her half-million soldiers couldn't run right over Ukraine. Rather, it's that they don't want to. They would rather wait for a time when US support fails, and they can re-unite Russian/Ukrainian friends and family.The fact of all the material support that Ukraine is getting - as you showed in your pics - proves that nobody wants or wanted to harm Ukraine. You, sitting right in the middle of fighting at times, can barely see what is going on in Russia, where the people are both in favor of Russia and against having to fight a war against brothers.Your real enemy is Zelensky. See https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5437200.msg61808218#msg61808218. See also The Imposter and the Puppet - http://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Article/339988-2023-02-22-the-imposter-and-the-puppet.htm - so that you can see that the American people are having as many problems with their government as the Ukrainian people are having with theirs.",

They are listening to their own greed... their greed to steal Russian land from the Russians. What they are doing is endangering the whole world.The Dire Significance Of Vladimir Putin's February 21st Speechhttps://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=217994After it was delivered, however, most pundits said he didn't say anything we didn't already know. Most of them focused on his announcement of the withdrawal from the START II treaty. However, he said something far more significant.An Existential ThreatWhat Mr. Putin said, when read through the lens of international law, should be chilling to the West.We would do well to remember that Mr. Putin majored in international law. His speech made a legal case against NATO.First he listed, by my count, 30 different ways in which the Western nations have attacked Russia. These included the expansion of NATO to Russia's borders, support of terrorists in Russia, economic war, terrorist sabotage of the Nordstream Pipeline, financing of the coup and war in Ukraine, directly assisting Ukraine to attack targets in Russia including Russia's nuclear bombers, and plotting to destroy and partition Russia into pieces....Russia has developed and deployed the S-500 and S-550 air defenses which are primarily designed to shoot down intercontinental ballistic missiles in space before they can release their multiple warheads upon re-entry. Each S-500 battery is capable of simultaneously tracking and destroying 10 ICBMs in the early to mid flight stages.The S-300 and S-400 batteries armed with the new 77N6-N and 77N6-N1 anti-ballistic missiles are also capable of shooting down ICBM warheads after re-entry at shorter ranges than the S-500....",

Under those conditions, you only need to say things, no need to reason, no need to argue and certainly no need for any short of verifiable source. In a modern Europe, the RF has no say on what the citizens of country want to do with their future.",

While Russia started the invasion, conditions to Ukraine (being that if they joined NATO, they can expect war) were given. Ukraine ignored and joined NATO. Here we are. As a whole, both sides are not any better or worse than another. To analyze who is worse would take a long, in-depth analysis of history that would be subject to long debate. The conclusion ultimately would be that both have committed a long list of crime and that the world has only paid for their transgresses more than anyone has benefited.",

If joining NATO was the real problem, as many of you, pro-Russian puppets suggest, Russia should be rolling tanks into Finland RIGHT NOW.If you're referring to me...Really, pro-russian puppet? I'm bipartisan here. I am only stating what I believe to be the cause of the war from what I have researched. NATO are instigators, and they successfully instigated this war. I have not said or supported anything else to do with Russia. Nor am I taking a side here. Both sides have evil within them. Neither are good. I cropped the rest of your post out because it's simply off the topic of what I was talking about.",

Florian Philippot, one of the rally's organizers, ripped apart a printed EU flag in front of a large crowd and urged France to leave the military alliance.\"I am in favor of France leaving NATO and NATO being dissolved; the machine should have disappeared with the cold war; It is a war machine,\" he was quoted as saying in an interview, as quoted by Ruptly.He also slammed the European countries for being subservient to the United States, which continues to be the largest supplier of arms to Ukraine. Philippot accused the US of \"blowing up Nord Stream\" and denounced German and French diplomats of \"not saying a word\" about it.\"But it is an act of war. It is a declaration of war, of course. We touch a strategic asset, an energy asset that affects our countries and economies, and we say nothing? We are totally submissive.
