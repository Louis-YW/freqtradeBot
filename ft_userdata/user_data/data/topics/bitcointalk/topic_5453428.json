I've seen a lot of stories, there have been some good but majority of them weren't really good enough when they've taken a loan and used it for investing in Bitcoin.I'm not discouraging you but that's just what I've seen from those people that thought it was a good idea to invest using a borrowed money. You see that you'll be paying that loan for 2 years. Yes, we're enthusiastic about Bitcoin's future but still with that period of time, you'll never know what shall happen to you and to the market.",

This is a direct red flag and it has always been advised that never go into Crypto-currency investment using capital gotten through loan.Bitcoin aside going into investment with capital you can't afford to lose is a dumb move and very risky and then going into any investment using money you can afford to lose that's gotten by taking a loan is completely a very silly mistake to do.Aside from the fact that bitcoin is very volatile and the price is not predictable even during the halving. Many halving period has seen Bitcoin take time to take of and some who are short term investor would have pulled out and counted their losses, also you have the chance of losing the coin or any potential risk. It's never advised to take a loan for an investment.",

BTC gives you the opportunity to make a profit, nothing more. Happiness is achieved in a different way.The next paragraph of your post looks no less strange. Bitcoin is a risky asset in and of itself, and investing borrowed money doubles the risk.To get into debt for 2 years, just in order not to miss the upcoming halving? What if something goes wrong and the start of the halving is delayed? In this way, you can definitely change your life as you wish, but these changes may not be what you expect.Behind every bitcoin success story there is a story of failure, which, most often, is not written about. You need to be careful in the pursuit of repeating the success of others. What you are about to do seems to me an irrational act, for investing borrowed money is recklessness. These are your risks, which you consciously take, as well as your possible profit, and all the consequences will be assigned only to you, and not to me. So, good luck to you if this is your final decision.",

Bitcoin don’t pump hard during the halving instead few days, weeks or months before the halving is the typical price action which followed by a heavy correction then a bullish cycle. If you really want to invest that amount of money then you should start buying instead of waiting next year when the event is near because this current price might be the lowest price you can see if you plan to buy next year. DCA now until halving occur. I’m sure you will get the maximum benefit of Bitcoin halving if you start earlier than later.",

But that is history, and there is no guarantee that it will repeat in the future. It's all speculation, no one can be sure about it. If things were going too easy, many people would be willing to sell all their assets to invest in bitcoin, not just take out a small loan to invest.Borrowing money to invest is not impossible, but you should calculate carefully and consider the worst-case scenario in which the investment fails. In that case, if you can still complete your loan with other sources of income then you can borrow.",

If you invest by borrowing, the thought of debt will always be on your mind. Maybe now some person or institution has assured you to give you a long term loan but if for some reason your financial condition is bad then you will find that the person or institution from which you have taken loan is pressuring you to repay the loan before the time.

Let's say someone is holding $10M and waiting to cash out his Bitcoin at the $50K Price range. Once Bitcoin reaches the price, he will sell it, and Bitcoin may go back to 40K again. Everyone is waiting for an opportunity. You never know when the right time will come. So, I won't suggest anyone to take loan to invest in Bitcoin. It's better if you invest your savings only.",

What we know is that there are good chances Bitcoin perfom well and hit a new ATH after the next halving which is going to happen in May of 2024.Think very carefully before taking a loan for that purpose. Make sure you won't regret about it if things don't go as you firstly expected. Always have a Plan B!",

The pump after halving does not happen immediately the halving occurs, it take some months to a year plus before the pump begins. As others have said that the price and occurrence around bitcoins is unpredictable. I believe accumulating wealth in a gradual process is better than high expectations with high risk which maybe unbearable. If you invest your savings and you make some profit, diversify those profit to other business that will increase your financial capacity against next halving. If you continue that way, you will achieve a remarkable result before 12years. 12years might look far but wealthy men have a long story of success to tell.",

When held for a lengthy period of time which may be extremely long Bitcoin is a solid investment that always yields tremendous returns. Taking out a loan to invest in something that might not turn out the way you intended it to is not encouraging. You may need more than two years to pay off your loan or make a profit. Using a loan to invest in cryptocurrency can be a very bad idea due to the instability of the market; the best course of action is to work hard and save up money first and invest part of the money without worrying about the invested money on BTC, you hodl and smile and smile later.",

Investing $90,000i is a big deal and can bring huge profits but it could also incur great losses. The best option will be to invest your saving and forget about taking the loan. Most people that take loans to invest are driven by greed and don't want to invest according to their worth. If you want to have peace of mind as an investor put in what you can afford or funds that fully belong to you. You still have close to one year (based on your predictions) to keep investing. If you can afford to invest half of your estimate without the loan, then you have done well.",
