You’re welcome. I’m glad you looked into it. YouTube is a great resource and there are all sorts of smart contract developers building things to help people make their own games with little coding knowledge. You could get lost in those videos for a month and end up building something pretty great if you are motivated enough. Be sure to post whatever it is you end up creating so we can have a look.",
