Well let's just cap it as it's their boards decision. I don't think they are probably viewing the whole thing based on the progress of their stock market and the adoption of Microsoft all over the world. I'm not aware of the status of the adoption rate of Microsoft currently but when I last checked trading views stocks, Microsoft is actually been bearish for quite a while now. Anyways let's be frank if it actually comes to the extent that they are lagging in stock value, they would likely end up still buying some bitcoins. That's part of the reasons why I don't fancy the opinion of big firms because a great deal of their decisions are profit minded and you see them flipping sides easily to protect their stock market.",

Yahoo! even add Google to their platform, like a free advertisement for a potential competitor and later when they started to see challenge from Google, they again refused an offer of $1B from Google founders. From these early mistakes with Google, Yahoo! fell down quickly but I don't agree that their collapse starts with Facebook negotiation.QuoteNow it seem to Microsoft shareholders that Bitcoin price is very high to consider adding it to their balance sheet,  well I believe they will definitely regret of this very decision in the coming future when Bitcoin must have gone 2x -5x of its current and they would have no option than to buy Bitcoin at that price.In market cap, Microsoft is only less than two times of Bitcoin. I don't know when Bitcoin will take over that position from Microsoft but it will, if not in this market cycle in 2025, it will make it in a next market cycle. Market cap of Bitcoin is potentially rising at faster rate than Microsoft market cap.https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/",

Microsoft's co-founder himself, Bill Gates, is not a fan of Bitcoin as well. But I guess it's just a matter of time. They will eventually succumb or risk falling behind and become obsolete. For now, there isn't enough pressure yet. Moreover, we have to take note that more than 70% of Microsoft is owned by institutional investors, BlackRock being the second largest of them.

Do they just not want to be associated with bitcoin? Do they think that they would be fine without bitcoin? Regardless, holding bitcoin will give them some benefits as I am sure that many investors who for some reason don't want to just directly buy bitcoin would want to buy their stocks if they were to hold bitcoin. That is what basically what happened with Microstrategy who bought bitcoin when it was cheap and people started buying more of their stocks due to this. Not only has their value gone up but they are also earning from buying bitcoin.To me, if you had a chance to buy bitcoin at such a crucial time but don't you are just missing out on a good opportunity.",

BlackRock only owns 5.2% of MicroStrategy but it owns 7.45% of the $3-trillion Microsoft. While Microsoft's largest institutional investor, Vanguard, isn't friendly with Bitcoin, the second largest, BlackRock, is a Bitcoin supporter. Moreover, State Street, the third largest investor of Microsoft, is also Bitcoin friendly. These giant shareholders could one day influence their fellow shareholders to adopt a Bitcoin strategy for the company.",
