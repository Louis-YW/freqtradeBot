To talk about the price, the mentors will be the ones that will tell you that this is the amount of money that they want to collect. They will tell you separately because you are engaging in conversation with them separately at different time in different location. You can then price it to see what would happen. Go for only one mentior with a better price.",

If someone is patient and reading to understand about trading, he will sooner or later know what that are necessary to be known in trading online because all necessary information are online. Like I said, the most important thing in trading is the strategies used, like not risking the amount of money that you can not afford to lose to trade, not using leverage, overcoming emotion, having a trading budget and do not go beyond it, averaging and some others.

It's best for them, right? So when you have found a mentor who makes you understand about trading, you must give him a nice gift as an expression of your gratitude to him, hopefully you will soon find the right person who is truly a professional trading mentor..",

Are you asking how much you should reward your mentorship even before you have one? I mean, dear, you really did a great job by practicing demo trading before going into real trading, but I don't think it's right or worth giving thought to this topic and spending time on it. Because once you find a good mentor, which is in itself a hard job, you should be asking what mentor you should follow.Well, I was saying once you find a good mentor, then you will have to pay a fee, like a mentor fee, which varies for every teacher. One thing I would like to add here is that not every teacher will be your mentor, so everyone will charge you a fee.For your convenience, you can reward your mentor on the basis of profits that he might have helped you earn. Because otherwise, why would you want to reward him? But what I think from your last line is that you are asking how much you should pay to the mentor, so that you could get an idea; if that's the case, then dear, you should not write a reward, and each teacher has their own rates; all you have to do is find a good one. Rates do not matter in this field.",

Thanks.Honestly you wont really be needing one considering that those mentors are speculators too on which dont think that they are really that better since they do have that called title \"mentor\" but this is something that wont really be that you could trust yourself on hovering yourself into this field of trading. Dont make yourself that believe that they are surely profitable.Also if you are really that serious on stepping up your game or skillsthen making yourself learn on solo way and also there are groups which are totally free on which you could really be able to snip out some trading ideas on which it would really be that something ideal or would really be that helpful on your part or with your progress. It all matters with the effort and the time that you would really be that spending because if you arent really that serious or really that determined then you wont really be seeing yourself to progress in your trading career. Be careful yourself into those gurus and professional out there specially on asking out some VIP subscription on which those things is never been worth. Things could really be learnt up if you are really just that serious on stepping up your game then it is really just that right that you would really be making out adjustments but if you do sit idle and wont really be doing any effort and time spendingthen you would really be definitely be ending up on a disaster.",

A mentor might only agree to this title if one already has a knowledge in the field, but placing a price tag on the amount of help you would get is more or less a bargain between a teacher and a student, not a mentor and mentee.If it is from your heart, once you start earning, consider a percentage of what you earn as his for probably a duration between 3-6months, that's if the mentor really brushed you up and you can confidently mentor someone else. Otherwise gratitude in any other form if the mentor is in physical proximity will do just fine, like a free dinner or free lunch.I don't think a mentor would sit all day and give you attention everytime, but if such a one can be a guide, then that's a true mentor.",
