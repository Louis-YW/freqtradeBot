Although there is some spike in trading volume when there is a high volatility,  the bear market is much worse for exchanges than a bull market.This is the time to withdrawal all the funds you have on exchanges.

Tech companies, don't always do this but look for 'a reason' to shrink staffing.It would be a lot tougher to go to staff last year when BTC & crypto were booming and tell them you are laying people off because they are not needed.Now with everything plummeting in price and all the losses, it's easier to show people the door.-Dave",

Do take in consideration that some events in the crypto world are just pure extreme examples, such as the LUNA event, but indeed these are not easy times for the companies.Big VC companies, such as Sequoia Capital and YCombinator, already warned[1][2] that they'll reduce the investment frenzy that has been seen in the past years, mostly due to the lackluster behavior of many tech companies in the past months (such as Netflix f.e). Since the business model of these kind of tech companies mostly relies on burning cash fast in order to expand (and then later deal with the pain of growing too quickly), they are now facing a problem where funding is uncertain which makes them having reduce costs in the short therm by mostly cutting jobs (see for example Glovo[3], Klarna[4] or even Netflix[5] (more complete list can be seen here[6])).If this happens in the tech market, for sure considering the whole crypto market status and especially the way that Crypto.com evolved to the brand that is today (by a mix of really strong advertising (burning huge amounts of money) + their credit card cashback program (now slashed)), this kind of approach is expected. Let's just hope that remaining companies (tech and crypto) are able to sustain current market conditions ...[1]https://news.crunchbase.com/business/sequoia-warning-founders/[2]https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/y-combinator-startup-warning-letter-downturn-2022/[3]https://sifted.eu/articles/glovo-foodpanda-layoffs/[4]https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/23/klarna-lays-off-10-of-its-workforce/[5]https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61489041[6]https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/tech-layoffs-2022/",

For this, exchanges can come up with any reason, fortunately, the user agreement allows them to do this easily and without current problems. Also, exchanges should have reserves, therefore, it seems to me, the reduction of employees is not a reason for a new panic, and now there is a reduction in the costs of the exchanges business.",
