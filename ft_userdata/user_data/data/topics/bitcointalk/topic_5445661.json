      "body": "I found it hard to understand your content sometimes. But if I understand it right this time, you are talking about the risk involved in investment and why we should invest what we can only afford to lose. Investing in Bitcoin or any other crypto has always been like wagering in a casino. You are only advised to wager what you can afford to lose. Since profit is not always guaranteed in all Bitcoin purchases, we are advised to invest only what we can afford to lose, even though most of us don't take that advice seriously. To me, I don't invest based on what I can afford to lose; I invest based on what I am willing to hold onto for a long time without the need for that fund. No amount is considered useless to me, and no amount is considered what I want to lose.Quote from: cafter on March 20, 2023, 12:30:28 PMalso tell about my english(feedback kind of) when i read imy sentences, i feel this is very bad english.Your English is kind of bad, but not to the extent that one can't understand it. It's just something you can work on yourself; sometimes you can give yourself a little self-tutoring, even if it means pre-reading your content over and over again before posting. I believe you can, on your own, figure out a few of your errors. I'm also constantly working on my own English to make it fit me best.",

That helps you to know how risky it is in what you want to invest on.If you invest big and you make huge amount of money, that is your luck. Or you invest hugely in it and you lose, that is it. But you know already that you are dealing with a risky asset.You should know how risky what you want to invest in is, research about the asset to know if that statement is entirely true or not, some investment are not that risky, while some are very risky.Like bitcoin, when the price decreased so significantly, you know you have more precentage in success rate, unlike when the price is high.

And so it's process, and really vary from individual to individual, maybe some of us can invest $100-$1000 without any issues with them.But there could be investors that will start small and then later as they mature and learn more, grow their investments.

      "body": "We can agree with the idea that there is never a lot of money. People will always have desires where money can be spent, and of course, no one likes to lose money. But you must understand that investing in bitcoin has always been a risky business. No one will tell you the exact date of growth or fall so that you can withdraw on time without causing yourself a hassle.On the other hand, the experience of investing in Bitcoin for a long period shows that people with patience make good profits. And of course, if we talk about friendly advice, then I would not advise investing at a time when people live paycheck to paycheck, literally saving on everything in order to save in bitcoin.Today, not everyone can invest large amounts, so it can be assumed that in the event of a price increase, only those people who have held for a long time and invested a decent amount will receive a big win.Therefore, the money that you are ready to lose is the money that you can forget about for a few years. If you are ready for this, then maybe one day you will be a winner.",

Asking questions such as how much are your monthly bills, have you planned for emergency funds (you get sick, your family suddenly is dying, etc), how much do you make each month, and if you suddenly lost your job for how long can you survive without using your emergency funds, etc. Let's say you make $500/month, has $5000 in your saving account, and your monthly bill is around $300 (food, rent, etc), so you have around $200 free money per month but you have no emergency funds. I'd say that spending $100 per month to buy Bitcoin is one of the alternatives you can do while you save the rest for emergency funds, at least for the first few months or so. This is just a rough approach though, you can also apply traditional finance rules for saving if you want to look for an alternative, such as the 50:30:20 rule.Quote from: cafter on March 20, 2023, 12:30:28 PMand also please share some very rock solid points that investing in bitcoin is profitable, and non losable in long term, we don't know if other satoshi came out in 1-2-3 years later(just an less probability thought)You can check out Bitcoin price history and the economic history of the world in general. We just have two or more bank run cases in this month so you can see how risky it is to store all of your wealth on fiat, especially if you're not one of the big players on the market. You should probably read more about Bitcoin before you ask somebody to encourage you to invest in Bitcoin. This will help you make a better decision and not blindly follow whatever the other parties tell you to do.",

It is risk-chasing game so you should never spend more than 1% of your capital for that game.How much is it will depends on your total capital. If your total capital is $1000, you should use $10 for that 100x risk-chasing game. Focus on investment in Bitcoin and try to stay away from 100x, 200x altcoin games.",

The word \"gambling\" is what I intend to refer to investment as, not \"casino,\" though I don't usually see a difference between gambling and casino. That's the word I use to describe any investment I want to make, so that I will make up my mind that either I win in profit or I lose the investment capital, which can later be regained. The only difference between buying Bitcoin and gambling to me is that if one doesn't sell, there is always a chance of gaining it back in the future, no matter how long.",

My advice is that don't mind those people who that are investing as much as 100x from what you can afford because investing is not a race, just like what I've said, they've got a different situation that's why they can afford to lose a much larger amount but that doesn't mean that their investments are much more important compared to yours.

Invest much you can lose, simply means an amount in which when everything goes down ( it is definitely hard for bitcoin to go down totally) it won’t bring you down totally with it financially. Then how much should we consider. Let’s say you are considering saving 50% of your income and you’re willing to save some in bitcoin then don’t put everything into bitcoin but rather have it split into 2 (25%) apiece and the take this 25% into bitcoin investments should the market be in bearish period and you’re in need of fund then you could look towards that other non bitcoin investment and this saves you the hassle of selling at a loss",

Budgeting is an important skills to have to find the right answer for yourself.

With this strategy for Bitcoin, I believe it would be a matter of when you gain on your investment rather than if you will lose. If you are going into your investment with a short term mindset then it's more of a gamble than an investment which the question of \"how much can I afford to lose\" becomes more applicable.",
