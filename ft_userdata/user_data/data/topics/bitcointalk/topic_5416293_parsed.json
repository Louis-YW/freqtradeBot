But wait, he's not making a profit, so you need to send him $10 more dollars to make him happy. (He really needs it to buy his dad's medicine.) Then it's an endless loop of him asking for another $15. He doesn't have any invites and is just scamming people for how ever much he can get out of them. MODS: Ban this guys IP!",
