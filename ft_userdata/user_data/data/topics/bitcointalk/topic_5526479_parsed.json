Because I'm seeing that there are more countries who are just keeping a low key with regards to this plan of the US.But if this is going to be approved, I'm seeing a lot of countries who are going to follow the lead of the US, it will be a avalanche of small countries who will get their hands on Bitcoin as their option for a national reserve.Worth noting though that El Salvador is ahead of the game already. And so is Bhutan, although not directly making Bitcoin in their reserves, but them being one of the biggest in terms of mining, they have taken advantage of Bitcoin already. QuoteIn 2023, Bitcoin mining revenue from Bhutan’s Druk Holding and Investments was used to fund a 50% salary increase for public servants in the country, according to local media reports.https://cointelegraph.com/news/bhutan-government-sells-66m-bitcoin-stash-price-tops-71k",

That would be a huge blow to bitcoin and a dump would be inevitable. Everything about government and politicians is a double-edged sword, so let's lower our expectations when it comes to them.Furthermore, we need to know that all these are just rumors or ideas of politicians. No formal proposal has been submitted to parliament for consideration, it is all just hype created by us.",

It can be a snowball with small countries want to try like El Salvador, Bhutan, then several big countries want to try.

People can use Bitcoin with many use cases and they don't need to use their bitcoin in a same way.

As you can see, it's all over, from Africa to Europe to South America Currently we are seeing many people taking Bitcoin reserves, which could be bullish news for Bitcoin. The upward trend in Bitcoin price that we have seen in the last year may be due to the effect that the acceptance of Bitcoin reserves is increasing day by day. At the moment, the United States is leading the way in terms of Bitcoin reserves, with several states in the country already accepting Bitcoin reserves. We probably saw in a tweet that a total of 8 states in that country have already accept Bitcoin reserves.By the way OP, I already made a thread maybe you should link it here too, as there was also a thread discussing Bitcoin Reserve.Donald Trump Confirms Bitcoin Reserve Plans",

Centralization you means is about Bitcoin distribution centralization, but it's not related to centralization / decentralization of Bitcoin network in hashrate. It's a totally different matter and I believe that Bitcoin network decentralization will be maintained well with time.Manipulation exists in all markets and it makes sense if Bitcoin market is not an exemption. Bigger adoption, more institutional investors join, governments join, hence more bitcoins will be accumulated by big whales and they will try to pull manipulative cards for their benefits. As retailed investors, we can hold our bitcoin tight and wait for their manipulation upwards to get profit. If they manipulate price downwards, we can buy dips and accumulate more bitcoins. Just don't sell our bitcoin cheap to institutional investors.Bitcoin Rich List will change a lot with appearances of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, many new institutional investors and government reserves in future.https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html",

Strategic reserve is now a hot topic not just in the crypto industry but the global financial system. Well done OP for the compilation. You're right, The government likes to control everything and Bitcoin isn't gonna be out the picture, since Bitcoin is anti-central control system of the government. They've used various avenues to try to bring it down, yet the true decentralization of Bitcoin has made this difficult for government to control Bitcoin totally, Therefore, the only option they've got to try to gain more control over Bitcoin is to adopt and buy large amount of Bitcoin, to be able to control the demand and supply side with pouring their Billions of dollars into the market and with some of their economic policies.Lastly, Op there is no way that countries will sit and fold their hands and watch US go Bitcoin way without them following suitA lot of them we aren't aware are just waiting on the sideline for the implementation of this strategic reserve to take a step.The bottom line is that, it's in the advantage of early adopters of Bitcoin, while the government comes in to buy more millionaires will be printed without dependency on government and you and I are already benefiting.",
