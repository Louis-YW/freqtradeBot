However it's an ironic if the customer support can't understand such simple thing, usually they will say the case will be forwarded to their developer to fix it, they did that just for convince you and make you satisfied. I was having a bad experience with lazy customer support where they straight forward answer my question by just posting their TOS link.",

How could these casinos grow their customers if the customer support itself is not worth of the customer’s time. Probably, the owner or the management of the casino has oriented them before they start their job, but since they are poor in English or any foreign language wherein customers often use, then they can’t tell or even understand the problem from the start. Well, that’s really bad for their business. However, if I am the owner of a casino, I will make sure that those people involved in customer supports are also regular gamblers so that they can easily relate to the problems asked by the customers or players.",

I mean their work are not the same.Haven't you called like bank before and one customer care will direct you to another? I have called a gambling site before when I place bet on a match that no goal before 10 minutes. Indicating on the LiveScore site that I was using that one club scored in 10 minutes and some seconds, but marked as a lost bet. I called the gambling site and the lady that first picked the call was unable to give the an answer, he gave the call to a guy that later answered me.But I think that all customer care supposed to know that question, that the game is provided not directly by the gambling site because I am definitely certain that you aren't talking about ads because gambling sites do not have ads.",

But I can see mods in chat that know what they are doing and how the system works. It's a good sign that they are hiring people who know their environment and how the website works. However, I did experience such low knowledge in a local exchange support asking me for information on where my money came from.  When I talked about a wallet that I used before sending it to them, I was shocked she didn't know about it, and could not even spell the name although it's a well-known Bitcoin wallet. It is not good for their business considering that is the industry they are in.",

If you're site is famous and have good traffics for sure they are the one will come then ask about possible reviews to their casino. So don't get mad about on what they do so better for now create a review base on your experience or to those legit gamblers who have experience on those casino so that you can get a legit reviews coming from real people.",

So if by chance that you inquire something that is out of their pay grade, then obviously you wouldn't get the answer that you needed.Another is maybe they are hiring or off-shoring this kind of support, so they don't have any access or maybe the selection process is poor and that reflect to the answers that your received as if they really don't know what they are doing on that industries.",

This is not good for business at all!This is a serious situation that needs urgent attention.  If they know nothing about the casino then they have nothing to offer. Customer service representatives should know the basic operations of the casino and should be able to guide or redirect clients to where they will get the necessary answers and solutions to their questions or problems. This is why the casino should employ experienced applicants for the job. They should also train and retrain their staff periodically. One of the strengths of any business is customer support because every gambler wants to get quick and valid solutions or responses. I will never be loyal to any casino with poor customer support and I guess others also feel the same way.",

Most of the live support system has a chat transfer feature.

Qualified tech savvy workers would never work as customer support.The employer is also guilty for not training the customer support employees well enough.What kind of questions were you asking? 99% of the gamblers don't know and don't care about the technical stuff about maintaining a gambling website, so they would never ask such questions. I can assume that most of the questions to the crypto casino customer support representative are about deposits and withdrawals(and ID verifications of course).",

Learning about the website of the casino is up to those hired people if they will learn more or just follow their manual in handling situations.But yes, they should have undergo trainings to fully give an assistance that will satisfy the needs of their users. Casinos should not hire people with the fit qualifications only, they should also require them to learn the basics.",

In this kind of issue, this is not about the game your played or what happened to your bet regarding to your account but this is purely technical and either from programming. So the customer service person should be able to know what to tell you if he or she is well trained. Sometimes you don't need super training to do a PR job, you need to be intelligent and wise to succeed in it. I have called some customer services of a mobile line on issues they are not aware of but instead of giving an annoying answer, they will apologize and tell you that the equipment to access the issue is still updating and that you need to call back while they update the equipment and download the issue. So by this, within the time before you call back they would quickly check on the issue themselves.",
