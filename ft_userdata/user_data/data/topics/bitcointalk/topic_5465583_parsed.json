  "content": "First, let me mention that this is supposed to be aÂ  post for the gambling board, but since Waje games is only serving Nigerians, and maybe some parts of Africa only, I decided our local community will be the best appropriate place to post this, this my personal review of this new gaming/gambling app..Waje games is a new and very popular gaming/gambling app any one can download from Google play store or iphone app store, they have their Google ads running and this ads is shown or displayed on almost every app on your phone that supports display of Google ads, they also have ads running on Facebook and some other social media platforms, so if you have not come across Waje games ad on the internet, then it probably means you are not an aggressive user of the internet like myself ..I cam across Waje games through their ad, and after seeing same ads for several weeks, I decided to download and try the game, interestingly , the app contained various type of very interesting games like whot-whot (which is my personal favorite and I am also very good at this game) Roulette and several others , I quickly signed up and if I still remember , I was given a 50 naira sign up bonus, I used the 50 naira to play whot-whot, I won several of the games and in just 3 or four games , 50 naira became 500 naira and more, but i went all in one round and it turned bad, I was beaten by my opponent and I lost all the money ..Finding the game very interesting by now, I had to deposit 3000 naira to still continue trying the game, after my deposit was successfully recorded in the app., I discovered that the system/game set up completely changed, now the minimum I can bet on each round of the game was 100 naira, on like before when I can bet any amount, even 5 naira if I want,Â  and also , previously , they paired me with just one other player which made winning the whot-whot game pretty easy for me, now that they had my real money, the system now paired me with extra three players which drastically reduced my winning chances by more than 99 percent, and the worst part is, those extra 3 players they paired me with, 2 are always bots, a computer program, while only 1 will be a real person/player.. Â The long story short is that, I played and played, this computer program was always winning and winning, until my entire 3000 naira was gone in just about 1 to 2 hours, they don't allow you to choose the number of players you want to be paired with, they just impose a four man game on you and make sure you never win until your whole balance is drained..After my bankroll became empty, I personally knew the entire game was super rigged and refused to deposit money anymore, but rather, I start playing the game in free mode, after 3 rounds of playing in free mode, they locked me out and asked me to deposit money if I want to continue playing ðŸŽ´ðŸŽ´ðŸŽ´.. Conclusion is - Waje game is a complete rigged game, I think it is not out of place to say that this gaming app was developed by scammers to use as a medium to defraud Nigerian gamblers, avoid this gaming app if you gave never tried it before and want to or have plans to one day, try them out ..If you have actually tried this gaming app, what is your experience like?, Please share .",

I have not tried any play to earn game before and I thought you will not deposit anything but play for free from how I did saw the ad pop ups with those girls and a guy with sugar-coated mouth. I did not know that it is gambling. Although, I should have known, but I am just knowing right now.I always disregard anything that I see about money online, especially the ones that do not look real. Example is the Waje game that those advertisers keep saying they did not deposit anything but won over â‚¦70000 in a week. Another example which is not about this discussion are those loan apps that give fake rate like you can borrow â‚¦50000 to pay â‚¦50250 back after 30 days. All these fakes look fake from their ads.",

If it was mean that deposited that amount and they swipe my 1500 from that 3000 you deposited I would had stopped playing and take back my remaining balance because plus or minus the money go still finished inside there if you no removed or moved am out from that place. Usually me no like games we go occupy my phone space, like free mining apps, gaming app and the rest all less na wallet to store my funds just as I dey use Electrum app for my phone and my laptop.

So I got carried away, deposited that same amount to play more, and never did I know that was my end, as from then, I lost all the whole funds. And since then I stopped playing \"Waje Game\". Which I think it's program to let you win first and then later your chances of winning gets slim",

Thanks always, my able colleague Fivestar4everMVP . Â  I see a lot of advertisements for this waje game popping up, especially when I'm watching Facebook videos; they will make it appear as if it's another great opportunity to make money, play, and earn, but I was not interested from the start because I knew something was fishy about it you earn by just playing games, not by taking surveys or doing anything else. I don't trust everyone in this country because they can do anything to make money. And I like the information because I'm sure a lot of people would have believed their scheme and began playing if you had found more information, as they say information is power, and we can also tell people outside the forum about it.",
