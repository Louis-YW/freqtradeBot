If you want to achieve big goals, then it takes lot of effort and consistency to find a way there.Quote from: Freeman66 on March 06, 2023, 06:40:18 AMEven if you don't win the mind of people who view your contents, there's always another, don't GIVE UP! Remember, \"Consistency is what transforms Average into Excellence \"Being consistent will bring you to the stage of perfection and many people will find it difficult to stay consistent, because too much hope is at stake, so that when it is not achieved they will give up on the situation.",

The number of your merits indicates that you are not consistent, although you write about being consistent. Should newcomers follow your lead? The forum does not need such \"valuable and imposing\" manuals. Try to take your time and read more, and you will certainly be noticed.

The bitcointalk forum creates a healthy discussion over important and relevant topics related to cryptocurrency, which means you need to learn from other members point of views, and they will also learn from your own perspective. There should be a consistent interaction so that the forum will become more alive and meaningful. Even newbies are not an exception. Maybe at first you will just read and keep exploring the forum as you are still in the process of acquisition of learning, but for you to grow and rank up on your position, you should also share some quality posts wherein other newbies and members in the forum will also learn from you and benefit from your shared knowledge and experiences.",

You don't focus on one job so you can't do your best. Try to focus only on one job at first and start to be consistent, it will give good results. That way it will work consistently well and the focus will not be divided by others.

I have to work hard to let that go. There's a saying that \"Good is the enemy of perfect\" but if you consistently make good posts, they will get better over time and if you continue to read and learn, you will continually have more quality knowledge to pass along. I am also reminded of a Bruce Lee quote \"Absorb what is useful. Discard what is not. Add what is uniquely your own.\" and I think that is a good way to learn more about bitcoin and then pass more knowledge to others. Absorb what posts/replies you find useful. Discard that which you don't find useful. Add comments with your own unique perspective, experience, and opinion.",
