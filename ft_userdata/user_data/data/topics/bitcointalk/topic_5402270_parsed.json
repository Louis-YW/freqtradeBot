      "body": "Brain wallets are terrible. What happens if you forget the important details to it, even if you think you'll remember it? You might think you can remember the simplest thing, but it's a pretty big risk. The advantage of brain wallets is that you can combine them with commonly used algorithms to store your data in an uncommon fashion, like by storing parts of your brain wallet at relatives' houses. Quote from: LoyceV on June 12, 2022, 12:13:19 PMSee: Collection of 18.509 found and used Brainwallets.Some of those were clearly not intended to be real stores of wealth, considering two passphrases were \"the\" and \"wallet\". That raises interesting questions about property rights if the original owners and the receivers were fully identifiable, with nearly all outcomes being entirely unenforceable.Quote from: LoyceV on June 12, 2022, 12:13:19 PMQuoteBut in a situation where the owner loses his memory or cannot remember his passphrase, what then happens to his BTC?Nothing.

      "body": "There's been debate through the years, and some users have even run some challenges to try, and prove that they can be secure. However, generally brain wallets introduce additional risks, which if you aren't aware of could potentially compromise you. Plus, as suggested humans are generally absolutely horrible at entropy. We tend to think similarly, and follow patterns. It's very much what makes us human. Most living things have patterns. The above challenge was never claimed, however this is a rather flawed challenge since we don't know exactly how it was generated. The question isn't about are brain wallets inherently insecure, it's more the human factor when it comes to generating the entropy. LoyceV, has a nice little thread there that demonstrates this weakness.So, even if you believe you've made a completely random password, it likely isn't. Our thought processes are flawed for entropy. Computer generation of entropy is almost always better.",

Which accounts for this impression that brainwallet simply doesn't work.However, more recent implementations uses a far slower and intensive algorithm which limits the effectiveness of the bruteforce as it would require either high memory intensity or resources. In addition, salt is mandatory in most implementations which makes for an additional round of protection. Fact is, while such algorithms cannot beat the entropy of your OS, you'll still have a fairly decent security as any attempts would be far more than a generic bruteforce but they would also have to take into account the salt, which is personalized and unique. Caveat being both your phrases as well as your salt has to be unique and sophisticated enough.",

Most users here probably don't have a inheritance plan, and simply forgetting or god forbid worse ill health, is a legitimate concern. People have had accidents, and didn't even know his own family, but even if it's not to that extent.

Adding a salt is not enough if your algorithm is naturally fast and weak; reaching your specific permutation would likely just be a matter of time (albeit longer, but still easier than other algorithms because hashing SHA256 is not really that difficult). Regardless, that is not what I'm advocating for and while it does make for a difference in the difficulty, it does not, by any means make it expensive or impossible to crack.Instead, what I'm advocating for is to use Brainwallet with a resource intensive KDF and salted. Doing this gives you the best chances; it is far, far slower to crack if it is memory-hard and it makes more sense to go through dictionary or known wordlists in that case with common salt permutations. When compared to the original brainwallet, the choice would be a no-brainer.",
