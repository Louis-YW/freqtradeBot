Maybe some of the information was not right, but I am sure I input the correct details.I then chose another payment method, and I was redirected to a p2p platform where I could trade with someone, but this time the price was the same as the one on the p2p platform.ObservationMaybe if the card details worked the price of USDT will be cheaper than that of p2p; but why require additional information apart from card details?",

I do not know how Treasura is working but I think it is a kind of P2P that makes transaction to be instant. I checked my Kucoin app just now and I updated it and I clicked on third-party, but I did not see Treasura. I only saw Simplex.    I think we should wait for sometime to see if we are going to see Treasura or not. It should be listed among the third-party. It deos not require card at all, it only requires bank transfer.",

      "body": "The big question is do our financial system support cryptocurrency transactions? The answer is NO because the CBN has placed a ban on any financial institutions from offering cryptocurrency transactions and that is a big setback for exchanges that looking for ways to further improve their payment system by incorporating NGN vs USDT but then the law has the oversight right to place and restriction and kucoin as an exchange wanting to operate a Nigeria subsidiary will still face the same policy restrictions that can delay their development. So the best possible means of making any NGN VS USDT on the exchange still remains the P2P method so nothing has changed but all together this is a good attempt from Kucoin.",

Security is the reason.This international online payment gateway that allows the use of our local card information requests those details in order to verify if the person trying to make a purchase with the card is the rightful owner, as the billing address that you are to fill in must be the same as what's registered with the account that issued that card. That information alone on some sites can authorize the payment without even waiting for some authorization from your bank; no OTP or even card pin might be needed. They are security measures that almost every site applies to card payments.",

Before it used to be free but I recently heard they now charge a small fee. Nevertheless it is worth it if you want seamless transactions.I was tired yesterday and unable to fully quote and comment about your post. It is true that if you use Chipper Cash virtual card, the payment would be successful, but it is not advisable.I do not know as of now when naira has been devaluated, but before , I used Chipper Cash virtual card to pay for YouTube premium personal account, it it ₦1100, I sent ₦10000 to Chipper Cash, dollar card was still ₦2000 at the time which was 2 or 3 months ago. I went for dollar card. Instead of ₦1100 to be deducted from me, ₦1750 was deducted. Let me agree that ₦1700 was deducted₦2000 for the dollar card ₦1700 for the subscriptionI withdraw the remaining money and it remained ₦5250, instead of ₦6250. Or maybe I made the mistake of dollar card? Was the fee increased or I thought it was ₦2000? I will like if you can answer this. Let me leave it beside for now. Chipper Cash dollar conversion rate is not favorable. Let me show you in a screenshot:   Buy at ₦901Sell at ₦788Is that not like a scam? You will still pay for the card if it is the first time that you are using it. The dollar card now is ₦3000Buy and sell for P2P is far better. Let me show you the rate I can screenshot on Kucoin now:   I did not use Chipper cash for like 2 months because of their stupidity and ways of making money too much from customers and my YouTube transaction was declined, I later wish to subscribe again just like how you can think while using bank card, my dollar card has which supposed to last for 3 years has been deactivated, saying their are many declined transactions. What banks can not do. No bank has done that to me before.So my conclusion is that Chipper Cash should not be used for this when there are better alternatives, centralizedexchangesP2P is far better. Not that Chipper Cash has privacy, why going for it when you can use the centralizedexchangesP2P that has no privacy too. Only what that can be good while using Chipper Cash is to buy airtime, send and receive naira. But converting to dollar to make transaction is not favoring at all. I wish we can go back to master card which I read that some banks have allowed again by now.",

Which I was thinking of giving this a try for an arbitrage opportunity.How, I think \"Remitano\" also accept both bank transfer (Deposit & withdrawal) on their Naira wallet, which works effectively in few minutesThat is,#10,000/11.4USDT =#877 Which means on \"Treasura\", 1usdt is been sold at #877",

Also according to what I found out, it is possible that the centralized exchanges P2P is better because you can see buy offer at $869 at the time.₦10000 buy at 869 is $11.50   ₦1 million = $1150.₦10000 buy at 877 is $11.40   ₦1 Millon =  $1140.According to Kucoin, fee would also be charged.

Long press on PlayStore app and click on app info -> storage and cache -> clear storage.
