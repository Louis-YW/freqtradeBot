The difference was not so big as it was climbing yesterday. As expected we have got the strong uptrend and keep continuing towards up. I said many times that it will break previous ATH soon and its on the way of it. I am waiting for to break it and hope it will break it very soon.The price is around 72,100$ are and i think its making correction right now if we get a good rally then we will break previous ATH soon.

It's hard to say what ATH is correct because it depends on formula used for averaged Bitcoin price across exchanges or what exchange you want to say about ATH for Bitcoin.This is not a direct answer, but it says a same thing like my opinion.Bitcoin Price History Chart (Since 2009). It was not updated recent years, but let's skip it, I only want to share information in the quote, not about price.QuoteWhat is the Current Bitcoin All Time High?The Bitcoin price all time high will depend on which exchange you reference.Bitfinex is the largest Bitcoin exchange, so it's all time high of $68,958.00 per bitcoin is the most referenced all time high.",

That is also my prediction, but we are unsure because it depends on the events that occur in the coming months. Surely $100k is not possible this month, the month ends tomorrow, December may even come too quick for the price to reach that amount, but that is even much more realistic. I'll just remain patient and see what would happen, next year should be very interesting for all of us, i am certain that weak hands have started fomo buying now that BTC has crossed the $70k resistance price, because they never believe in BTC enough to buy when the price is low.",

I am optimistic but I don't believe we will see $100k this year. If we look at how bitcoin is increasing so far, it's gradually. It's not just going to go from 70k to 100k in about 2 months. When Bitcoin does that from history we know it will correct itself and dip again, but its sustainable when it goes up gradually.",

At some point the increase was around 5% in the last 24 hours. And a result I could see bitcoin around 73k but it still didn't seem to break the price of our ATH. Looking at it from a candle stick pattern it seemed to have had a little pull back.Anyways I think the actual question should be which one to go with as literally different exchanges and different websites often have slightly different values of bitcoin price at a particular point in time. Anyways most of the time people often prefer to go with coin market cap and that's because it's quite popular.",

The mark yesterday was an unexpected one and don't be surprised that this week bitcoin is going to be marking a new ATH when it comes to bitcoin you have to reduce your expectation because the price of bitcoin will not just pump to 100k just like that, and am trying to think what will facilitate the price to jump to 100k and this expectation was around the period of ETF approval and halving there was a lot of speculation going on then but nothing happened and people that understand the process did not worry because bitcoin keeps recording new ATH so their will always be profits, to make and this is only for does that actually understand the whole thing, without understanding their nothing left for you to start thinking about ATH.",

That's just like a few minutes of fluctuation needed for it to surpass the former ATH but it wasn't broken. Everyone is alive and kicking again every time Bitcoin moves like this, this is the reason why many come back to the market and look for some entries again before they see the ATH once again. Those that do it are doing it wrongly. Anyway, with the argument on which is which, it's not a big matter to talk about but we're all on point here that we're all excited to see the next ATH for this cycle.",

If these whales have the powers to keep the price down such that their algorithm will not be altered, they should keep doing it even against the anticipated 2025 bull run since they are making profits. Or will there be a time that their resistance would be overpowered by the overbearing force of the market?If these whales are this powerful on BTC, it's a common sense that they can prevent bull run.",
