  "content": "Let’s say I have 2 hardware wallets, one of which is connected to the native desktop app for that wallet company (Wallet A). The other hardware wallet is connected to the sparrow wallet desktop app (Wallet B). I want to transfer all my coins from A to B. What would be the best way to go about this from a privacy and security standpoint? I understand connecting to your own node is probably the best method but let’s say that’s not an option at the moment. Would it then mean just simply sending over the coins in multiple transactions with different receive addresses each time to avoid a single UTXO? or is there anything else that can be done to emphasize a bit of extra privacy? Would connecting to a vpn beforehand make any difference? Sending everything over in one transaction would save on fees but it would compromise privacy correct?",

      "body": "Whatever you use to make transactions doesn't matter; all the transactions will be visible on the blockchain when a transaction is broadcast. If you want to protect your privacy, you have to use some other services to break the transaction. Likey VPN helps to protect you by hiding your location, but transactions will always be visible on the chain. You may break transactions in many ways, like by exchanging Bitcoin for something else, then again exchanging for Bitcoin and directly transferring to your wallet. You may use p2p or decentralised exchange. This way will charge you handsome amount. Mixers have a lot of issues now, and I advise you to avoid them.",

      "body": "Speaking of privacy I believe in this case it depends on how much Bitcoins we are talking about here. And please don't get me wrong, I am not saying privacy is not important neither am I saying you have to tell us how much coins you wish to sweep or transfer. But all I'm  saying is if it's just a few hundred dollars it won't be much of an issue.In my opinion even if you send it to multiple wallets it will still traceable to the final wallet.A possible alternative is for you to swap those coins to fiat or some other stable altcoins and they use it to repurchase Bitcoins. You con make all these p2p to remove the ability of an Exchange to trace you Bitcoins to the final wallet",

Just wanted to get an idea for best practices as it’s a larger amount that needs to be sent over. So am I better off using a tor proxy over vpn service? Even if said vpn service doesn’t log any details? I definitely plan to set up my own node in the not too distant future.",

      "body": "Well, it kinda depends on what type of privacy we're discussing here.  Do you simply wanna disrupt the money trail between wallet A and wallet B? Or do you aim to obfuscate where the money in your wallet came from? Maybe you wanna hide your true IP address when making these transactions? Is Big Brother or some shady outfit tracking your moves? You gotta figure out what specific privacy matters most so you can take the right steps to protect it.  Like if hiding your IP is crucial, you'd likely wanna route your traffic through Tor or a trustworthy VPN.  If your main aim is to confuse the transaction path, using a mixer service or Coinjoin could scramble things up.  And if total anonymity is essential perhaps a privacy-focused coin like Monero is the way to go.  Point is, defining the threat first allows you to counter it best.",

Is it your own location, or do you want to break the transaction between your two wallets? If it's only about location, then Tor or VPN would help, and make sure you use a premium VPN service. But everyone who knows your old address will know where the fund ended up. Tor or VPN won't protect your privacy if someone else knows the address of your sender's wallet.",

Keeping things private doesn't necessarily mean the user wants complete anonymity its all about the choice and who can get to know what I do. Obviously even if the funds moved to 100 different addresses instead of 1 the link isn't broken and can be traced back to its origin and it is not going to help if someone wants to hide their traces.But this will be helpful if you don't want someone you know how much you have left in wallet B.",
