The development follow the formal resignation of Mr Godwill Emefiele, I think this new Governor of CBN look like someone that will bring BTC back to Nigeria by lift the banned the formal CBN governor has banned BTC so that those that have interest on BTC by using it to buy goods and service like the way El Salvador and other government that made it legal tender. I have full confident in this new government that they will do something good to improve the youth of Nigeria, and to improve the economy the previous government has nearly collapse.",

      "body": "For now, he's the acting CBN governor until confirmation of his nomination by the National Assembly. It should also interest you that the Mr. Shonubi Folashodun who was put in while Mr Godwin Emefiele was arrested has also resigned. Let's hope this one is not one of their puppets. Here's the link to the news. It seems Op forgot to add it. https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/09/cardoso-assumes-office-as-cbn-governor/",

CBN is an independent body which has been politicized by the apc government. Cardoso has no right under the law to assume the role after nomination without being passed by the senate. The illegality has to stop!",

Nothing like illegal there bro, if truly you understand the law very well and you know how it works in our country, you will no that the president of Nigeria followed the due process to appointed Dr Olayemi Micheal Cardoso as CBN governor of Nigeria.",

The illegality has to stop! May I ask how he was illegally appointed? Since you know so much, why not enlighten us? Yes we know that the APC government haven't made good on their promises and as we're not seeing them, we'd just assume it's another beautifully crafted manifesto used by them to canvass for votes, but it doesn't mean Cardaso's employment is illegal please. Try not to be so sentimental when analyzing things like this.  Op hopes that this new CBN Governor will be Bitcoin tolerant and while it's the hope of every BTC enthusiast, I doubt it will be possible since he still answers to the ministry of finance who is appointed by the President. So, I feel that if the president is not okay with it Mr Cardaso is powerless.",

How senate no go approve the appointment wey be say na tinubu still put Akpabio wey dey send email to bank account. Na the same thing we go still dey see, naira dey fall every day despite say na new person dey there. If na America or UK dem change the head of the financial institution like a whole CBN, we for see how the currency for shake out and drop but this one e no be like say anything happen and currency just dey nose dive which is to tell you say CBN no get anything to do with rising the value of the currency. The indicators need to be right before changes go dey dey effective.",
