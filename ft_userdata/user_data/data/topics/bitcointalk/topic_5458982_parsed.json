And now....no blocks for 40+ minutes.And 6 sat/vb is not going to happen for 4+ blocks.Feels like every time I send a TX with *just enough* of a fee to probably make it into the next block.Just a Friday complaint, back to your regularly scheduled forum reading.-Dave",

      "body": "This is more of a psychological reading of the subject than an actual observation of a pattern. This reminds me of people who complain that every time they move up a level in poker they get bad cards and if they change sites for example, or modality, they get a good streak, when the reality is that streaks do not exist from a mathematical point of view.

It was just the 3rd of 4th time it happened to me recently. The next block just came in at the 48 minute mark.Not worth bumping the fee, I am just opening a lightning channel, but I wound up with that feeling of every time I don't use a large fee we have a big pause between blocks.I'm sure there have been dozens of times with I set the fee a bit lower then I should have and a few blocks came in back to back in a few minutes.

It looks like it's back to regular operation so just maybe 2 or 3 more blocks before your transaction is mined so you're still good I guess. Some unlucky senders that used 6 sats/vb had to wait a longer time because we got caught up in the spike due to the ordinals craze.",
