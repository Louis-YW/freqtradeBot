  "content": "I use a Ballet Wallet I ordered on Amazon.  I trust it based on the historic integrity of the company's founder.  I researched and listened to a couple of his seminars on YouTube.  In addition, I am not aware of anyone who has had a security breach due to the companies manufacturing process.  It seems to me that his company's success and reputation as well as his personal reputation are at stake.  In other words, if there were a security issue that was traced to the production process his whole business model would implode.The one issue that I am still trying to resolve is how to back up the Ballet Wallet.  I've seen a hardware device that uses metal plates to engrave a key code based on the words you used.  The idea is that they are indestructible by fire and more durable than paper.  However, since the ballet wallet is not using words any backup methodology using words will not work.  I am a little concerned with the fact that if anyone were to get physical possession of the wallet, they would have my bitcoin.  If I bury it somewhere or hide it and die then I can't pass the Bitcoin on to my family.  So, I am open to anyone with ideas on how best to back up the Ballet Wallet.",

      "body": "I checked the paper card wallet reviews on YouTube, these are the two I noticed the wallet is highly not necessary and not recommendable:https://youtu.be/xiFaL5BDgzUhttps://youtu.be/PTp_LbGpkLYThe private key was said in the first review that it was created in China, while the passphrase was created in Las Vegas. Not your keys not your coins.The passphrase and the private key are on the paper card wallet, anyone that sees it can steal all your coins.Peel the public key back and your private key would be seen. Also the passphrase is written on the paper card wallet.It gives false sense of offline security because you can spend from the wallet anytime. Some people will spend from paper wallet and the private key is no more cold storage.On paper wallets, because the private key is an online one already after spending from the wallet, they will move the remaining coins to another addresses that its private key is offline.Although, there are some ways you can spend from it in a way the private key would still be offline, but people will always exposed their private key online is what I think about this wallet.According to their site, it is $35 dollars. That is costly for me when it make use of private key. I can just add some money to it and buy seed phrase hardware wallet instead.I would prefer seed phrase hardware wallet because of many recommendable reasons, especially that the seed phrase and the keys are not reviewed by the wallet, if that can be argued with hardware wallet like Trezor, then also because the passphrase used are not stored on the seed phrase hardware wallet.",

It only holds a single private key, which you can only view by peeling off the sticker.You can easily (and much more securely) make this yourself. It's highly insecure to just use a private key that someone generated for you, as they can easily have a copy of it and sweep it immediately after funding, or later down the road.Anyhow, for backing this thing up, you'd want to back up the private key here (which you could engrave into metal), but then the sticker is peeled and I'm not sure that you can stick it back on.Damn, this is so misleading. They mention BIP38, which is just private key encryption. Meanwhile you want BIP39, which gives you a wallet that deterministically creates keys from a seed phrase. I'm sure that's why they put BIP38 in the advertisement, as otherwise it's not really a feature to brag about.[1] Sure, their wallet requires no set-up. Because they did it in advance - making it wholly insecure in the process![2] What's the use of a durable wallet when it's totally insecure? Also, you can easily back up real hardware wallets on steel washers or plates.[3] What's the use of a wallet that doesn't require firmware updates, when it's totally insecure? Also, you don't need to install those updates, and if you really fuck up flashing, you still have your steel backup anyway.[4] Wrong on so many fronts:    [4.1] What's the use of a wallet that is not hackable through USB if it's totally insecure?    [4.2] This is just a metal plate with a private key printed on it. To spend any funds, it absolutely needs to be imported into a software wallet, making it susceptible to all the attack vectors of a software wallet. Except if you're skilled to use an airgapped computer with Tails; but then you don't need this product in the first place.     [4.3] Airgapped hardware wallets don't need to be connected to a computer.Lastly, you can do this for free, in a secure way, e.g. using Tails:https://tails.boum.org/It is called a paper wallet.",

Of course, we can 'trust me bro' the vendors, but then we can forget about Bitcoin in the first place.

If inheritance is your main concern you can also take a look at time-lock transactions. But be careful, some services/devices are also scamming people or at least pretending that they're more secure while in fact, they are not reliable at all.",

If I wanted to give some coins to someone in such a form, then I would do it personally in a correct and safe way, and I would be sure that no one else saw that private key.I mean for passing around coins in physical form, there are much better ways, such as tried-and-tested / trusted devices like https://opendime.com/.As far as I know, the keys are generated from users' entropy during a simple setup process, which means CoinKite can't know the seed.There's no way to verify that, though. That's why I appreciate the open-source and verifiable avalanche noise source (actual circuit from few simple components) on the Passport hardware wallet.And obviously the ability to import your own custom seed phrase. This allows you to generate it with dice or whatever you deem secure.But again; these avalanche noise circuits are amazing. You can literally see them on the PCB, take an oscilloscope to it and verify that it does what it's supposed to and that there's no deterministic bullshit going on.Quote from: https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/passport-electronics/",

I can easily create a paper wallet myself in a way I can backup the private key and use the address for receiving bitcoin which is not large amount but used for small pocket money. But we are not in that era of no seed phrase private key wallet anymore, I will just prefer using online wallet like electrum on my mobile device for it.Maybe this could be a means bitcoin can be given to someone as gift, but I still see it not advisable in my opinion, I can just add money to it and buy a cheap hardware wallet instead.

Online wallets on the other hand are e.g. when you hold coins in an 'exchange wallet', but also exist(ed) as standalone services. People would literally log into a web service with email / password and simply get a view of their coins with ability to deposit and withdraw & send coins. Obviously that's highly secure and unrecommended - never use online wallets. Just wanted this to be clear. Quote from: Charles-Tim on October 08, 2022, 08:16:15 AMBut I am surprised that some Bitcointalk members are in support of what is not in support of one of the reasons bitcoin was created.I guess Bitcoin gives you the freedom to use a secure or insecure method, and anything in between. You're not forced to go hardcore-coldstorage-maxi, you're not forced to go online-wallet; there is total freedom of wallet choice. Some users (knowingly) accept a tradeoff of convenience vs. security, but this in here is definitely not it. Pre-printed paper wallets actually have no reason to exist; I agree on that.",
