How do you keep your gambling habit in check such that becoming addicted and out of control is something that never happens? (share your strategy for others to benefit from)Gambling addiction can ruin lives. It can turn a perfectly normal life into an abnormal one. It leads the gambler to commit crimes and engage in all sorts of criminal acts just to satisfy the urge. To keep myself in check, I do the following:1 Accountability Partner: I have someone who holds me accountable for my gambling. I tell the person everything about my gambling habit. My partner keeps me guided and is my go to person when I am on the verge of letting my emotions take the lead.2 Budget: My budget is my rod and staff. I have a strict gambling budget, and for the past 2 years I have been consistent in the amount I spend. Sometime it drops by 5% or increases by 5% it depends on how much income comes in.3 Time-Tracking: I track the time I spend playing a the casino. I try not to exceed 2 hours. This is also where the accountability partner comes in. In some months, I may decide to keep a log of the amount of time I spend and do some sort of calculation at the end.All in all, if you feel you cannot control your addiction and it is taking over your life, please seek help from a professional.",

How do you keep your gambling habit in check such that becoming addicted and out of control is something that never happens? (share your strategy for others to benefit from) Gambling once not controlled will eventually fall into gambling addiction. That is why I never gamble to make a living so I can control my urge in gambling. Instead, I only make it occasionally especially if I’m with my friends, or everytime I have spare money to gamble just for fun. That way, I can easily control my gambling habit, knowing most of my time is not focused on gambling. It’s a good thing also to create other hobbies like learning into arts, or simply develop interest like marketing and investment, so you don’t have to spend your excess money on gambling alone.",

For the most part, most gamblers will find it difficult to let go of the habit of gambling activities, because gambling is fun. it doesn't matter what type of betting, whether it's a casino game, or a sportsbook, all of them have unique values ​​and characteristics.Despite the fact, the probability that we have, to win the profits of each gambling session is very small. in fact, we are well aware that the ratio of defeats is higher than wins. but the funny thing is, we still gamble.well, I agree with what the OP said. that everyone is at risk of becoming an uncontrollable gambler. and referring to myself, armed with a long experience related to gambling. I have my own definition of what gambling is, and how I describe it.IMO, nothing but responsibility. at least, for myself. by having responsibility, I have a better understanding of gambling. therefore, self-control is formed. well, so, gambling for me is nothing but fun entertainment. however, with certain limitations and according to what I can afford to lose.",

Second, I stay away from conversations with gambling addicts on gambling. Self-discipline cannot be over emphasized. People are self-disciplined when gambling are the masters of themselves. They know when to call it quits and walk away. Secondly, gambling addicts would spend their whole day talking about gambling and one who is weak will end up becoming like them.",

How do you keep your gambling habit in check such that becoming addicted and out of control is something that never happens? (share your strategy for others to benefit from)In reality, education and financial stability should be enough to keep people away from gambling, because it will lose you money over the long term - there's simply no way around it. While many people get sucked in by the odd hundred dollar wins that a casino gives you near the start, they then forget after many thousands of goes, all the times they lost. It gets to a point where they are simply a monkey pressing a type writer and not comprehending or reacting to the outcome, once you reach that point the addiction becomes much harder to pull away from. You need to be aware of your actions, but these places often end up targeting the least educated, poorest and most vulnerable because they simply have not been taught to gauge the odds.",

But it does get easier.” If you put yourself into discipline mode and follow through with it as much as possible, you're already halfway there. As for the matter of what method I used to ensure I don't get addicted from gambling, I call this the \"three-method\", I saw someone from this forum talk about this too, and I employed it to my gambling discipline. So far, it has worked so well for me that it allowed me to not be addicted to gambling even after years have passed. In any case, the three method is just easy. You basically just stop gambling for the day or for a set amount of time, when you hit three wins or three losses. That way, you can bag whatever wins you accumulated during that run, or if you're not that lucky, you could ensure your losses are mitigated.",
