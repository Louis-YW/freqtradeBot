  "content": "I've been thinking about making a crash gambling site for a while, the same idea as ethercrash.io and bustabit.com.I'm searching for opinions and responses to a few questions:1) Would you be interested in investing in the game's bankroll if I got the site registered and provably fair? (The same way that people invest into BAB and EC)2) Would you be interested in playing the site if I made it?3) What cryptocurrency should the site accept?4) What types of features should I add to interest people to join?The primary factor that the site depends on is whether people would be interested in investing into it's bankroll. Exactly the same as the current leading crash gambling sites ethercrash and bustabit, the site will require investors in the bankroll for money to be winnable by players. If this is unclear or you do not understand, I will give a brief explanation:There is an area of the site where you can invest and divest 'x' amount of cryptocurrency into the bankroll of the site. This essentially means that if players lose, you will gain money on your investment, but if players win, you will lose money on your investment. Functions like any other investment, except it's on a gambling site and depends on player's winnings or losses. It will be divestable at any time, with low commision.I would greatly appreciate any responses to the 4 questions I asked. Many thanks![EDIT] I just want to say here that I appreciate all critisim and responses since there is a cooldown and I can't type a response to all of you individually. Thank you all",

Many thanks!Even though your questions seem a bit general and superficial, I will provide an answer to you regardless, although it probably won't mean much.1) No, I would not invest in a site where there is no reputation for trust. 2) That depends. You will have to make sure that there is some kind of incentive for the players. But even then, I would not risk big funds on a new site that does not have any reputation yet.3) First and foremost bitcoin. As for altcoins, those that are currently the most popular and have a low transaction fees.4) I have no idea. In order for a new casino to succeed, it must find its niche and the best way o attract players. Given the high level of competition in the industry, this is a very challenging task. If I had to decide, I would probably go for something unique and innovative, such as the most entertaining games I can come up with, or, something that has the lowest house edge possible.",

I appreciate the response greatlyI can only imagine how much work this will be, but you seem to have the right mentality. If you are planning to go into this solo, I suggest you start exploring options that make the least amount of capital requirement on the line. Keep it simple, focus on starting your own game and make it a fun hobby with the potential to turn a profit. That is where you get your initial seed money and with time, as the site takes off, more people join, more money comes in, more customers and more revenue is generated. With time, you will learn the ropes and develop a very niche business that has a positive future for you and your customers. There is no risk of big losses here as long as you start out simple and build a strong foundation. Just have fun and try to do the best you can. Good luck in your endeavors!",

Much appreciatedthe reason why it is hard to attain success in gambling is because of the competition that you will encounter upon setting up on your own. there are already established crash sites here and some people are hesitant to try a new site for so many reasons. but to answer OP's questions.1. No, because it is hard to spend money these days and you have no clue how will the site will do in the coming days.2. yes, of course we will try on a new site. but don't expect that people will spend good amount of money.3. btc, ltc or trx4. race contests, and other unique promos. think outside the box.",

How does that offer exactly differ from other casinos? Not to mention that there are probably other casinos out there that have a bigger reputation base and trust worthy compared to yours. Start building up your business first before looking up investors, it can even start at a small size even. 2.) Uhm, maybe bring out the site so I can judge it? The only info given here is that you made it and in all honesty, who are you even?3.) Major coins with cheap fees. Don't add any custom coins or shit coins imo.4.) If it's solely a crash game, then probably make some alterations to the game itself to add some new flavor into it, if not, then well you can just get most games from game providers and it should do well. But as I said, it'd probably be better to build it up small at first. It all comes down to you building your site slowly. No need to rush it by looking for investors, if players come, reputation grows, investors would naturally approach imo.",

Maybe later, I will try to invest in your site after seeing how far your progress in working on your site. Usually, that is what investors will do because it is very rare for investors to invest directly before they invest.2. Maybe. If your site has other gambling games besides crashes, I might be interested in playing on your site. Maybe you can add games like slots, cards, dice, roulette, etc.3. Bitcoin is a commonly accepted cryptocurrency by gambling sites. But altcoins such as ethereum, litecoin, dogecoin, trx, bnb, ripple can also be added as alternative coins.4. Features that you can add are bonuses every week, events every week, two weeks, or a month. You should pay attention to how you promote your site because promotion plays an important role in developing a site.",

It would have been better if you could secretly do some research and gather some info regarding people’s interest.Regarding the crypto currency thing, the more coins you add the more attractive it will look, and it will give players a wider range of options also.At last, you should develop something new and unique yet interesting, so that many people will join your site.Hope this helps you OP.",

First, show us the finished product(a fully functional website) and then ask for investors. Don't expect someone to invest in your project, just because you have made a website. Building trust is a slow and tedious process.2.I don't mind testing your website for free.3.Why do you even have to ask this question? Just stick with the big cryptocurrencies. You could add 1000 shitcoins, but this won't add anything to your service.4.A bonus system, or a decent referral system, so that you could get referral traffic and the gamblers do the promotion for you(assuming that you have a great website and you are not scamming people).",

This plus your initial bankroll. Maybe you can find someone here to estimate the developer's cost, an actual dev or owner would be your good resources.",
