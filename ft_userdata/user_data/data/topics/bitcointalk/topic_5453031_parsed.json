Can you recommend me one?Of course, you should buy them from official sources like if you want to buy Trezor then visit there official website and buy it from there official website. (Trezor). Or if you want to buy a ledger HW then visit there official website (Ledger).Point is, whatever hardware wallet your want to buy, you should buy it from official sources. Like there has been many cases when people bought wallets from third party sources like amazon or ebay at huge discounts and lost all of there assets when they use that manipulated wallet by hackers. Such as this scene --> Never, ever, buy your hardware wallet from a third-partyPlus, there has been made many other threads about making DIY Hardware wallets at home but you showed no concerns about them so i will ignore them and i would also not prefer newbie to use them. My advice is, never fall for phishing schemes in buying hardware wallet even if you have to pay more in your region to get your hands on Hardware Wallet, prefer that way instead of buying it at lower cost from some unknown person or newly made friend on social media. Because you will never know there intents.",

That should help you out tremendously with picking someone to buy from.The best offline store to buy from is the manufacturer itself. If you buy from an online store, it’s still the best idea to buy directly from them. But Ledger’s customer base has been hacked before, so why trust them? The safer alternative is using a disposable identity when ordering or purchasing from official resellers who don’t specialize in crypto things Someone who obtains your information and order history through illegitimate means will less likely put a red target on your forehead if they seeyou’ve purchased something off Amazon or BestBuy. If they know you’ve purchased something worth a Trezor off a crypto store, it’s more likely they’ll make a link and target you.",

Amazon is one of the online shops that I know deals on stuff like this, and most hardware wallets also have their own online shop where you can order and have it delivered to you nation-wide.If you are buying from Amazon, make sure you buy from authorized official reseller if they are selling it on Amazon. There are some products that do not have official resellers on Amazon, some hardware wallet sellers are not official resellers.Quote from: elevates on May 17, 2023, 07:52:10 AMI haven't heard any offline store selling hardware wallets.

Can you recommend me one?I believe the best way to purchase a hardware wallet is directly from the manufacturer rather than from someone else. By doing so, you can ensure that the product is genuine and authentic, minimizing the risk of receiving a compromised device. Just stay away from Ledger since it seems that they don't care about their user's privacy [check this thread] and go for Trezor maybe or any another trusted company that sells hardware wallet.",

People don't like learning the easy way, they always want the bloodier way before they wise up, I cant stop them but I will still advice someone like you and your decision after is yours only..Do not buy any hardware wallet offline, because those sellers are fully aware what a hardware wallets are, they can go to the lent of looking for ways to install any malicious software on the wallets before they sell them, and there is a way to replace the seal of the so called brand new hardware looks new and unopened. You buying such will believe that you are in safe hands since the seal of the pack is still sealed and unbroken, you know nothing, instead I advice you to order your wallets from official website and wait for it to get shipped to your location, it's better to be safe than sorry.",

Can you recommend me one?You should indicate your country so that we can check if the official store can deliver the item on your location or if there is official reseller available on your location.I purchased my hardware wallet on a local e-commerce store page which is an official reseller of Ledger. At first I was hesitant because there’s a lot of scammer in my country in regards with this kind of sensitive items. I browse the review and check the background of the company selling it and realized how long they are operating without any problem on their feedback. This is the time I decided to purchased despite they are listed as official reseller on the website.There’s no harmon double checking and browsing on the feedback of the store from previous customer is helpful when you are on decision phase of buying hardware wallet.",
