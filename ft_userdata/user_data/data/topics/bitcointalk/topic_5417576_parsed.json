I am not that interested in who he is fighting but I'd still watch the fight because I want to see Pacquiao in the ring again. besides, Pacquiao said that he'd give us a \"real fight\"(he said in one of the articles I've read) which I hope he would actually do. also, I saw in one of the articles that Proceeds from the event will be donated to the homeless in the Philippines and families affected in Ukraine.img source",

Good to hear that the proceeds will go the homeless in the Philippines, that is good to hear the Manny is helping his fellow countryman in whichever he can.",

Good to hear that the proceeds will go the homeless in the Philippines, that is good to hear the Manny is helping his fellow countryman in whichever he can.This is what I like Pacquiao, if he will go back inside the ring even just for exhibition fight. The proceeds won't really go entirely to his pockets, but there is charitable organization or entities that will benefit. If all exhibition matches will have this mission, I believe it is worth watching them even if it is not a real fight.Pacquiao is already a politician and he has good life already, but he is willing to be back for the sake of less fortunate people. I will also watch this for the mere thought that this Legend in boxing will try to show his prowess inside the ring one more time, even just for entertainment purposes.",

But I agree that we missed Manny in the ring, and so this is the next big thing for us to see, him and DK Yoo in a exhibition match. His presence in Japan with Floyd shows that this might be Manny's thing in the future. And I do agree that this gesture of giving the money that we will be making in this fight for Filipinos is what distinguished Manny from other boxers like Floyd, they are all for the money.",

Yes, after the busy life of Pacquiao in politics, it’s good to see him back in the ring. Is this already settled? Less than 2 months now and yet Manny is still in Korea doing some show. Well, let’s see if there will be odds for this exhibition match, that’s still possible though.",

Yes, he is present in Floyd's fight in Japan and Floyd even travel to the Philippines. So I expect that this is just the beginning for Manny and there will be another one in the future, maybe in Japan or Saudi Arabia wherein Manny has a lot of fans as well.",

He is also a businessman, there were articles that he owns a lot of businesses in his country so that's a very big factor for him to just give away his money. He doesn't need the money for he can survive and countless of his descendants in the future.The fight had been mentioned in some boxing threads but this is an exhibition fight that also promotes Korean youtuber.",

That's right, this is only an exhibition match, and looks like they are doing it to collect founds to help people, so, that's something nice, but i don't think they will really fight serious.I'm not even sure if exhibition matches get listed in sport books since they are as the nay say, just an exhibition. But if they get listed they i'm sure Pacquiao would be the easy money bet, let's be patient for the fight because before that we will have the world cup.",

I did tried checking DK Yoo match with Scott, he actually has the skills and he also claimed to have martial art experience. Although he put his hands down while fighting Scott, he did a lot of head movement and can indeed box.I think he is also following the path of the Logan brothers in Asia which he should be fighting the Logans instead if he wants more promotion. The only issue with this is the money since Logans its what they are after.",

So they're not really coming out hungry and angry, full of determination to win, in their best of shapes, etc. I would understand if bookmakers won't even release odds for this fight and other exhibition matches.",
