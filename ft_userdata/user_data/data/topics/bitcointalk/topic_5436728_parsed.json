I want to sell my Antminer S 19 XP 134TH Specifications141T3031.5W21.5J/TEquipment warranty period 213 days remaining.Warranty expiry date for reference: 2023-08-27 00:00:00s/n YDFTEABBBJGBI00TNno invoice/no documentsI have been using it for about 6 months. Now I have lost access to cheap electricity and I think that I will invest money from the sale to buy BTC Bitcoins (I think it will grow in the near future)  . I will ship from Germany. Shipping to the USA, Australia and Europe is possible. For now, I'll put the price at  $3000, which is 25% less than the price of new models, although the condition is perfect. Shipping included in this price. Payment is possible with cryptocurrency or with PayPal through buyer protection.
