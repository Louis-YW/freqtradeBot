Or nah just like another past  policies  wey nothing come out or abi na ey service this government just wan do?Abeg Chuk mouth!As you say make I chuk mouth. I go chuk am!The Naira has been in free fall since last month. Had about 12.6% devaluation against dollar last month, not to mention the inflation that has increased to about 24.08% as of July last month, we don't know what this month will say but bro, the government will be stupid to sit down and let Naira go to ₦1,000 per a dollar, they did something and Tinubu had to bring another policy from the CBN and NNPC.The NNPC had taken a loan but more on that later since this topic is limited to CBN new policy and that's the re-introduction of Bereau De Change, BDD as they call them.This new policy doesn't change anything, the IE windows remain the same. The government realized that their is hardship and the dollar they are getting is making it worse. So they had to call back the BDD to business because there is no any way the FX market will work without them.Now, the policy be say, they are allow back to their business but there is something missing from your point. The -2.5% and +2.5% which means say they cannot sell dollar with a profit above 2.5% of what they bought, if they buy at ₦750 per a dollar, the profit from that must not exceed 2.5% and they must also account for all the dollar they buy and sell.The thing that remain unclear from the report is weather the CBN will be the one to be given them the dollar or not but I assume to be so if they want them to operate in that sequence.This are just temporary measures for the government to reduce the demand of dollar from the parrallel market and if there is enough, we will have little demand and dollar will be stablise, atleast for now.",

No duplicate thread/Topic is allowed.And your topic is just a paraphrasing to the first topic. And this is what newbies were doing that we corrected. I never wanted to say anything oh, but seeing this statement from you @ Mate2237, just drew my attention again to chok mouth for this matter, because before I begin, I will like use to know the meaning of \"Paraphrasing\", which according to Oxford online Google dictionary, Paraphrasing means the process or act of expressing the meaning of (something written or spoken) using different words, especially to achieve greater clarity., which a good example of a paraphrase title is as follows, 1. Bureau De Change asking Govt to ban Binance to save Naira2. Govt go ban Binance base on advice from Bureau De Change3. Binance go stop operation in Naija according to Bureau De changeWhile other examples also include; 1. Nigeria government don return Bureau De Change2. Bureau De change go start corporation again according to govt.3. Nigeria government don uplift ban on Bureau De ChangeBecause for the fact that they all uses the phrase \"Bureau De change\" that doesn't make them the same, as what we need to look out for is the centre message which a thread passes if are they the same or not, as that's the important thing, and not a singular phrase. Because if we are to follow by what you just said then it means all thread which carries the keyword \"Bitcoin\" should all also be categorized the same and place under a single thread, but yet each day we have more than 100 post been made on this forum with the same keyword \"Bitcoin\".So, in conclusion, what makes a thread similar is when they all convey the same message, like the examples I gave above.

Where the Government policies are not consistent on following laid down policies, Economic growth will be deprived and stale.The issue at hand however boils down to the choices we make during election.Change in policies due to external political influences. I wish Government will wake up to this reality and put things right for citizens.",
