  "content": "The global food situation is worsening every second and in a month or two could lead to mass unrest followed by regimes suppressing the violence and eventually a wider war between countries stealing each other's food supplies to ease their domestic unrest, something similar but worse than what we saw during the first months of pandemic where Europeans countries were stealing from each other to ease their own crisis.Let's take a quick look at a series of events:1. Russia and Ukraine are two big producers, Russia invades and production is ceased in Ukraine.2. Russia is sanctioned to put economic pressure on them so their exports to 99% of the world is completely stopped3. Other producers like India follow this trend and stop their exports4. Price of food soars as scarcity is now a serious threat5. Other countries are embracing for the crisis by trying desperately to increase their own production but fertilizer exports are also ceased so the domestic production has also decreased significantly in most countries.6. China is mass purchasing any food (wheat, etc.) that are found in the world and is also pre-purchasing future production (as much as anybody would sell them) at high prices.7. France is already telling Ukraine to give up defending so that maybe they can avert food crisis themselves!The real question is how would each country handle this crisis. And at what scale is the conflicts going to break?In West Asia we are producing most of our needs already but the pressure is still felt here. The biggest problem we are facing is the neighbors. The borders are already being tightened as we speak to handle immigration and prevent illegal exports that are basically stealing food!Correct me if I'm wrong but Europe seems to be highly dependent on imports when it comes to basic food (wheat, oil, live-stock feed, etc.) and others and the supply has decreased while the prices are soaring.US doesn't seem to be doing well either as they are currently trying to rob Ukraine and transfer all their wheat supply to reduce the crisis US itself is facing through the western border while Russia is still busy in the east and south and the world isn't looking.This is starting to feel like WWII already when the Allies invaded India for example and how Churchil stole their food and starved more than 3 million Indians to death. The difference however is that the option to invade East to survive their European War aka WWII is no longer there for the West, so my guess would be a lot of conflict between different countries in Europe if the food crisis worsens, NATO falling apart and eventual mass migration towards East.",

You see farmers need fertilizers so that the soil can handle more production and more frequent production. Otherwise the soil won't have enough nutrition in it to help the crops grow.So we have a combination of decreased imports, decreased domestic production and at the same time we have an increased consumption. This sounds a lot like a recipe for disaster.",

Whatever is happening in Europe, is a pre-planned series of events formulated by White house and Pentagon. I wouldn't be surprised, if UK is also a part of this conspiracy or not but they are also very likely to be a part of it. Otherwise, there's no reason why US will force countries like Ukraine and Finland to join NATO. It would give them uninterrupted access to Russian border. That's what Russia is protesting and trying to protect their border from US invasion.  The UK and US imposed sanctions on them and look who are the most affected countries - european countries. US is all fine here! If you don't understand the gameplan yet, you are living in fool's paradise.",

You are right, a lot are now looking for like office job or other easier jobs. Because being a farmer, takes hard work all day long under the heat of the sun. We can't expect new generations to follow this kind of lifestyle. But I do agree, the more machines in the farm, much better not only for the yield but less tedious jobs for the farmers. And it may possibly encourage them to stay in the farming business.",

Its only logical to save their own people from hunger than sending wheat somewhere.  So little time left to grow crops before people will rally together out of hunger but maybe putting up an irrigation to the barren lands will work even for sweet potatoes just to survive this scarcity.  Wheat is just the most basic food for most countries.",

To this, Zelensky replied that he was not even going to discuss the issues of ceding the territory of Ukraine and its sovereignty. The office of the President of Ukraine added that if Macron wants to make Putin a winner in the war, let him give up his territories. With regard to food shortages, this issue is already being discussed at the highest levels. Russia is blocking shipping in the Black Sea and, first of all, the seaports of Ukraine. This does not allow Ukraine to export wheat and other agricultural products, which have already accumulated in the ports alone 4.5 million tons. The UN has already expressed fear of a famine that could begin in Africa. Therefore, they offered Russia to ease sanctions on the export of potash fertilizers in exchange for unblocking the ports of Ukraine. If Russia does not agree, then the US Sixth Fleet, which is now in the Mediterranean, is ready to enter the Black Sea to ensure the safety of navigation in this region. In this case, the likelihood of a Third World War increases, but no one is afraid of Russia anymore, since it has shown its military weakness and has already lost at least a third of its army in Ukraine.",

This is cereal production:The EU produced 286.5 million tonnes of cereals in 2020., which puts Europe in fourth place but it completely outclases both India and China in per capita production.And of course at the top when it comes to actual food exports,  with 6 of the biggest food exporters being from Europe. Just because in usual rankings pf production European countries don't make the top 5 is because the production is split between many of them with different crops for each one.So now that we've covered wheat and cereals your other concerns, sunflower oil, again 5 countries from Europe in the biggest exporters,  and live stock feed, with 8 countries out of top 10 being again European.Btw, speaking of crisis food riots, people getting shot in the streets, and the internet being closed down, why didn't you mention the 50 cents per day in food stamps the Iranian government is giving to the 80 million facing poverty and famine?https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-bread-costs-skyrocket-unrest/31838051.htmlQuoteMohammad-Reza Mortazavi, the head of Iran's Flour Producers Association, said on May 2 that the country was more reliant than ever on foreign grain, and would have to import more than 20 million tons of grain in 2022. With Ukrainian grain exports hampered due to the war and the reported theft of Ukrainian grain stocks, Mortazavi said that Iran could not expect the rising price of agricultural commodities to fall, and would increasingly turn to \"Russia or the Baltic states, and even [Western] Europe\" for supplies.https://observers.france24.com/en/middle-east/20220513-they-re-imposing-famine-on-us-protests-spread-among-iranians-faced-with-soaring-food-pricesSo no, Europe has no food problem whatsoever, the only things we might be concerned about are bananas and coffee so we might have to get a cafe latte instead of an expresso.

US strategy over the past ~50 years ever since Vietnam defeat was to not get involved in conflicts as much as possible and only fight by arming proxies, separatists and extremists, specially if they are facing an actual adversary. On top of that with the deplorable living situations that US marines have on the seas that has led to numerous suicides I don't think they are even combat ready.",
