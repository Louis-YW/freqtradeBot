  "content": "Digimint.finance is an exciting new NFT project where each Digimint NFT represents a share of our BTC mining farms' hashpower. This means you can start mining BTC just by staking the NFT without having to buy and host a mining rig. Our launch date is set for July 24, 2023. The genesis batch of 100 NFTs will be $100 each and will be selected from a whitelist. Join us in the Digimint Discord to get on the whitelist.",

And again, our mining rigs' output can be seen at https://www.f2pool.com/mining-user/b7810379711850792b7a365683629c67?user_name=digitalmintQuoteits better to have a full Video on the mining room and the mining rigs, this is to erase doubts that you are hiding something and this is another cloud mining scheme based on Ponzi scheme.There will be a live video feed of all of our mining farms up soon on our website. We're looking to expand in North America to have multiple distributed mining locations in addition to our Siberia location.You know what's a Ponzi: most of DeFi. We're looking to build a DeFi primitive that's not based on ponzinomics but rather backed by real, BTC producing mining machines. The best way is to mint your own and start earning rewards: https://digimint.finance",
