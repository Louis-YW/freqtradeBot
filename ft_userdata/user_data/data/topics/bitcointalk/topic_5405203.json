Why, after 3 actions, a lot of developer keys appear in the key manager if we added only 1.The signatures file contains many signatures created by multiple developers. You have imported one key, but gpg will check all of the signatures, and it tells you that it was unable to verify the other signatures.So long as you import at least one key of a developer you trust, and that signature verifies, then the binary is fine.Quote from: Muromskiy on July 05, 2022, 01:08:26 AMQuestion: After all these actions, I right-click on the installation file to check the signature in gpg suite -an error comes out.The dmg file itself is not signed. There is no direct signature of it. Rather it's SHA256 hash is signed, along with the SHA256 hashes of all of the other binaries that you could download. What you do is check that the SHA256 of the dmg matches the SHA256 stated in the SHA256SUMS file (which you did as Action 1), and then verify the signatures on that SHA256SUMS file (which you did one of in Action 3).",

I would like to hear the developers' stance on this.The Windows binaries for release 23.0 (and IIRC 22.0 as well) were indeed signed by a Microsoft code signing certificate.  One of the recent release wasn't signed because the certificate was expired at the time of release (if I remember correctly,) but that's an exception not the rule.Quote from: Muromskiy on July 06, 2022, 07:58:29 PM1 questio - Why after -Why did a lot of participants appear in the keys after 3 actions if I added only 1 -Michael Ford?The .asc file has many signatures in it, including Michael Ford's signature.  The GPG verification process checks all the signatures in the .asc file, regardless of how many (or few) developer keys you've imported into your keyring.  Quote from: Muromskiy on July 06, 2022, 07:58:29 PM2 question - the shazam -256 SHA256SUMS.asc command what does it have to do with checking the \"bitcoincore\" installation file? I can 't get the gist of it .the output of the command: a valid user signature gives additional confidence that the installation file \"bitcoincore.dmg\" is really good?I'm sorry if I misunderstand you, there might be some confusion due to a language barrier.  You don't need the sha256 hash of the SHA256SUMS file.  Use GPG to verify the SHA256SUMS file with the signature file, which is named SHA256SUMS.asc.  Once the SHA256SUMS file has been verified with GPG then you know the sha256 hashes within the file are authentic.  Now you can check the sha256 hash of the bitcoincore.dmg file, and it should match the corresponding hash you find in the SHA256SUMS file.Quote from: Muromskiy on July 06, 2022, 07:58:29 PM3 question -checking the sha256 installation file is not enough to make sure that the file is good?No.  That only provides half of the verification to ensure the file is good.",

Otherwise, someone could simply create a \"fake\" sha256sums.asc  that includes the sha256sum of their \"fake\" installer listed... by checking the digital signature of the sha256sums.asc file (against the signatures of trusted developers), you know that the file and the info in it isn't fake, and therefore all the sha256sums listed inside are valid.",
