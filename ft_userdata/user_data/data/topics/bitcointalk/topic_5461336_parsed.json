The trend now is into those fast launch projector memecoins that we do have in the market on which it cant really be that denied that meme coins could make you rich but it would really be having the disaster if you arent really that careful on what you are investing.I could really say that it would really be that a gamble if you are really that not careful on choosing but knowing that crypto meme coins doesnt have that actual utility then investing into itis really that not that ideal nor worth at all because you would really be putting yourself on great risks.Its not tarnishing because people already get used to those scams but honestly there's no one would be scammed if they wont really be tending to feed out those scammers or fraudsters with those fake projects around but it seems that people are really that fan on dealing with scam projects and continue on doing so.",

Truly they are tarnishing the imagineof cryptocurrency and there is nothing we can do about it unless the government comes in and sanction crypto projects that tend to become rug pull. We just need to be very careful enough so that we are not going to fall Victim to scam projects that will nit last long in the market.",

Those too good to be true projects are tend to be scammed but those who aren't are real. It's easier to said than done that's if ever we have a chance to accused a project, better to think it twice before we make a noise because we don't know what their real motive. Other than that, some of those in a government are good at taking advantage of opportunities so be careful.",

While some, while questionable, do bring about some value due to the avid fanbase it has, a lot of the rest are just scams though. I wouldn't blame memecoins though, every type fo industry has a bad side that most people despise, not just in crypto. And beginners, being well, beginners, can end up being there and incur a lot of problems. It's probably just more apparent here since money is directly involved. Besides, if people get to know crypto well enough, they'd know it's just that side there that's like that.",

Newbies should not think if a project is listed on Binance, it is not a scam project.Rug pull definition, what is it?QuoteThe definition of a rug pull is a malicious maneuver in the cryptocurrency industry where crypto developers abandon a project and run away with investors’ funds. Rug pulls usually happen in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, especially on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where malicious individuals create a token and list it on a DEX, then pair it with a leading cryptocurrency like Ethereum. Rug pulls thrive on DEXs because these types of exchanges allow users to list tokens for free and without audit, unlike in centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Furthermore, creating tokens on open source blockchain protocols like Ethereum is easy and free. Malicious actors use these two factors to their advantage.",

Memecoins are actually making crypto even more famous among the youngsters and that's obviously not a good thing. Lots of young people started their crypto journey with dogecoin probably. If dogecoin didn't exist, these people would never know much about crypto. Don't focus on the prices too much, yes climbing prices are a part of this game but the network effect is far more important and dogecoin brought lots of people in. I think there are some good memecoins and the absolute best of them is obviously dogecoin and I don't have any problems investing in it.",

But the reason why some fall victim to scams is because they saw crypto from the beginning as a means of making a short-term profit because of the pump and dump scheme of those alt and meme coins. Most people see Bitcoin as an asset whose price is too high for them to purchase, and for that reason they rush to look for those cheaper coins, which at the end of the day will still disappear with their money. The fact is that those memecoins will never cease to arise; people just need to get used to having better knowledge about crypto generally so they know what decision they are making to invest in any crypto.",
