The custodian you particularly trust your money with has another custodian to take care of the same money. You entrust your funds to custodian A, but custodian A entrusts the money to custodian B which, in turn, entrusts the money to custodian C, and then to D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and so on until Z. LOL! So many levels of trust. Not to mention that the money is not really in custody because they're actually risked somewhere else.I hope WazirX's reserve in Binance is not 99% in BNB and the other 1% in BUSD. LOL!",

When I realized how much effort Binance puts into maintaining the security of its wallet, I understood why they are so confident. It makes no sense for them to own another wallet if they spend so much on their current wallet. I just think Binance deserves recognition for its work in the space, such as low transaction fees, high liquidity, and security. There are so many attacks against him for what he provides",

India government is so persistent on taking down all business that involves crypto. This is a bold move by CZ and it involves a lot of risk especially a panic by the public knowing there money is not really on the WazirX exchange.I won't consider it the regular acquisition because Binance has always been with the project from launch and the reputation of the exchange was important in the launch of the project in India then when all laws was against cryptocurrency.

Really? 1/5 of the coins on Wazirx are Shiba Inu?Coindesk has an update on this. Binance is demanding that WazirX should retract all of their statements telling everyone that they are owned by Binance or have their service agreement terminated. The problem is however, WazirX will not retract their statement or erase any mentions of Binance in their terms of service.It appears that the regulators will begin looking closely more into this. I reckon CZ and WazirX should have done this argument more privately.But, this week, CoinDesk got WazirX’s proof as the disagreement was privately coming to a head.In the early hours of Jan. 25 – in India, a national holiday – Binance sent WazirX a letter requiring the Indian exchange to meet two demands by the end of this month, or risk Binance terminating its service agreement with WazirX by Feb. 3.First, Binance told WazirX to publish a pre-written “clarificatory statement” retracting WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty’s previous statements that Binance owned WazirX. It also required WazirX to erase all mentions of Binance in its terms of service.On Friday, Zanmai, WazirX’s official name, responded to Binance’s demands in a letter obtained by CoinDesk. It fought back, claiming that the demand letter was “unethical” and attempted to use “media pressure and threats to force Zanmai into issuing false and misleading statements as ‘clarifications.’”Source https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/27/wazirx-says-binance-lied-about-ownership-as-dispute-about-indias-largest-exchange-escalates/",
