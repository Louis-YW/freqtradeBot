  "content": "Hey guys,It’s my first post here. I just found this forum yesterday because I was researching on 1xbit and spent the night reading threads about 1xbit scams. I used 1xbet (with an E) for a long time and I loved the variety they had in sports, so 1xbit seemed like the obvious choice for my first crypto sports book. You see, I usually bet on smaller sports, or lower divisions. So 1xbet used to suit me perfectly.  Unfortunately it doesn’t seem like 1xbit is a good idea. Lots and lots (lots!) of complains around here. One thing I commonly saw more experienced users say on those threads was something like “you have so many good and trustworthy casinos out there, why would you go to 1xbit given it’s reputation”?I totally understand where this is coming from, but most of us had absolutely no idea about all the scams and complains against them. And besides that, we don’t know any more. How do I find the good and trustworthy when I have to look through dozens or hundreds of different casinos. I’ve been reading lists and lists and researching dozens of casinos but I can’t reach any conclusion.So I decided to create this topic to see if the community wants to help a newbie. A newbie who is very concerned right now after reading all the horror stories around here. Please give me some names if you don’t mind helping. Don’t point me out to more lists. I’ve been there form hours now. Which casinos are overall loved around here?Which one is safe to deposit my money on? Which one is your personal favorite?The only must is for it to have sportsbook. That’s what I am interested in. Oh and to be safe and honest. That’s also a must",

I've also tried Wolfbet in the past so that's also a go for me. For sportsbooks then Sportsbet and Stake.

Try and avoid the use of VPN as well and other than that 1xbit has to sort their problems out asap till then you should try one of these..",
