  "content": "Hello. Beforehand I clearly state that I am not, by any means, promoting advertisements.A few days ago, I found on reddit a post about Flash BTC transactions, what would be, according to the post, a strategy for transacting fake BTCs on-chain, in a way that the transacted BTCs could persist on-chain up to 6 months. After some hours, the post got banned  , no idea why  . That is the reason I am stating out loud I have involvement in any business related  . Although I am new in the environment of BTCs, I do not think this thing of Flash BTC transaction is legit, AFAIK, once something is stored on the blockchain, it is stored forever. So, how could that be, that a transaction would be stored for only 6 months? I would like to hear some comments of those more experienced in the area. Because, although it may be only a scam, what would be some arguments for oppositely proving the impossibility of these Flash transactions?Thanks and regards.",

      "body": "It's a fake advertisement. AFAIK something like this simply does not exist (and i've been around for a while, so if it was something real i would have heared about it by now).There are ways to broadcast a transaction with a very low chance of ever getting confirmed (for example by paying a fee that's way to low, or having unconfirmed parents with a low fee)... These transactions stay in the mempool of most nodes for about 2 weeks after which they get pruned from most node's mempools, but during this time they remain UNCONFIRMED transactions, and nobody should accept an unconfirmed transaction as a payment confirmation... Once a transaction is confirmed (and a couple more blocks were added to the chain afterwards), it stays confirmed.If you only have one confirmation, there's always a very low chance of a chain reorg, but even then, most transactions that are in the stale chain are usually also included in the longest chain aswell... And after a couple of confirmations, the odds are very (very, very, very) low...TL;DR; => it's a fake ad, probably aimed to scam people that want to scam others using these \"flash\" transactions?",

      "body": "Nope, it is a scam. First of all, creating Bitcoins out of thin air is not possible. Each transaction references a previous transaction output, which leads all the way up to a transaction which is generated from the block reward. It is impossible to fabricate this link in the first place. If the transaction doesn't reference a valid unspent transaction output (UTXO) of the previous transaction, then it would not be valid. Only transaction that doesn't require a UTXO would be the CoinBase transaction of blocks.Secondly, each transaction must be spending the correct amount of Bitcoins. Total output must be less than the total inputs, with the remaining being considered as the fees. If you were to spend anything more than your inputs, then your transaction is invalid. Each transaction must also be supplied by a correct ScriptSig, which fulfills the criteria as dictated by the UTXO, a signature that corresponds to the public key of the address for example. If any of these doesn't check out, none of the nodes would accept them and they wouldn't even appear in the memory pool of your nodes and no one would be able to see them.Lastly, confirmed transactions are final and cannot be removed. You can create a transaction with a very low fee that appears in the memory pool of the nodes as an unconfirmed transaction, but they have to be periodically rebroadcasted to ensure that they stay in the mempool. They are not \"fake\" Bitcoins, just transactions that are unconfirmed and can eventually be confirmed.",

On exchanges that allows one confirmation for deposit, they allow 2 or more confirmations before you can withdraw. Which means the exchanges do not accept one confirmation. Or can you name an exchange that allows one confirmation for withdrawal?My post is based on the possibility of chain reorg not to affect a transaction that the receiver thought to have been confirmed but later got revered. Although the possibility that someone can be affected is very low. Even if someone is affected, most likely that the transaction will later be confirmed.",

It is not more than 3 confirmations if I am not missing anything.A first confirmation is most painful in waiting time, later confirmations will come naturally and more easily.",

Haha, so its means scammers are scamming other scammers. That's quite a Karma. Well, it is good for their (scammers who are getting scammed) health too. Because they must also feel the way other scammed innocent people feel. I also watched a video in which the creator was sharing that his software is able to find those wallet addresses which are abandoned and those whose passwords are forgotten.Well, it is a thing and I do know that, but what is hard to believe is that he was also saying his software will break into those wallets by force or brute decryption. Like, is it possible, I thought it was only possible with Quantum computing. But maybe he was also selling a fake software which might do nothing.",

Bitcoin blockchain is a technology that when a transaction has been added to the blockchain and has also been confirmed, it is permanently there. What you said is a scam by another scammer. I have seen that these scammers are coming up with different tactics to scam people of their coins and it is only a scammer that will fall for them. If not why will one be interested on deleting his transaction from the blockchain after it has been sent or confirmed. It is just like sending fiat money to a friend and your bank has confirmed the transaction, then without you going to the bank,you want to delete the transaction that has already been in the bank database.",
