Not sure if you are selling it, looking for partners, or just launching your project.From what I saw in the casino website, I think OP is out to sell it, and the quota he talk about could mean his asking price is 0.01 BTC, if you check the sliding header, there a small button says, \"Purchase now\", when clicked on, it leads to an account on telegram supposedly belonging to OP.So I have a strong conviction he wants to sell it, but we should still wait for confirmation of this from him though.",

Now all you need os to make some serious investment in publicizing the site and you should get a lot of gamblers in no time. Just add new options and new games once on a while and things should go big. Best of luck for your casino!",

Not sure if you are selling it, looking for partners, or just launching your project.He is selling it. The purchase bottom on the demo site prompts to telegram @script017. I also don't understand that quota, maybe he means the price of this script is 0.01BTC? The script is full of games already. Is it possible for OP to provide a list of casinos that uses the script? Potential buyers probably are interested in modifying the theme of the casino. Maybe he could show the sample casinos.",

Fell free to participate in any topic you can discuss well. And bring good things to the forum. I browsed through the website, and I discovered that the site is still under development and it is almost finished. There are some casinos that have finished the development while some not available. It is a very good start of it. I will want you to develop your ANN thread so the features will look nice though since you are a new comer in the forum, it is a gradual process. Once again, you welcome.",

I would need to thoroughly check the script of the backdoors though.He does need to come back and explain if this is even a script he develops himself.

One thing that you might consider adding ... will be a PvP element to all those games.  It is quite becoming a norm, unfortunately. Well in reality, they are all on the same category offering gambling activities with slight differences; simply following what's selling to the audiences and what are not. What's unfortunate is the design and UI to the newer ones in this industry which makes 'copying' obvious just to attract existing players of the gambling site being copied. I'm not sure if these 'copied gambling sites' are aware that players won't moved towards their platform if the 'original' one is performing well and much more if it don't ('coz the negative image will be passed down to them). Given the similarities, for those who are just starting to introduce their own sites, the best way to attract players are thru promotions and bonuses, followed by good platform UI and ofcourse, in game support from devs for future developments.New concepts such as PVPs would be a good idea but I guess majority of gamblers are just not into such concept.",
