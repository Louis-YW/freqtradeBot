The offer the OP is making here is extremely frivolous. As far as I've seen, the OP previously offered to set up backlinks on other sites with high domain authority. If the quality of those domains is on par with his presentation here, I definitely do not recommend his service.OP, this is your 4th topic where you offer the same thing. In addition to the fact that it is against the rules of the forum, it will certainly not help you reach clients. But as an experienced SEO marketer, you already know that, don't you?",
