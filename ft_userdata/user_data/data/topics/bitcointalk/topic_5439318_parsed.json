If you open the exe file and install that malicious program, then without any doubt you have infected your device and enabled the attacker to do the final stage, which consists of collecting all the important information you store on the computer and sending it to the hacker. Just opening any e-mail will not do any harm, although some e-mail providers/clients will not even allow sending exe files precisely to prevent the possibility of malicious attacks.",

      "body": "With how crafty people are becoming just to score some free coins, I think the best practice to protect our data and crypto coins is not to open any attachments from email addresses that are unfamiliar/unknown to us. With techniques such as steganography, sometimes its not so obvious what's behind an attachment...This reminds me, google drive seems to be another place these guys are really trying to explore by sending out messages that have these macros scripts that auto run once their link in the message is opened on a pc starts to copy out private keys and the alike...we really need t be careful out here in the digital space.",

Attacks don't happen automatically (app will be installed after download). Afaik, android also has a default setting to prevent app installation from outside the store. The attacker has to make every pretext in the first file sent with the .txt extension so that the victim disables security and installs the app, then the attack begins.",

You need to be very cautious and check the extension of the file before opening it. In this example, it's supposed to be a word text file so it's supposed to end with .doc or .docx not .word.exe",
