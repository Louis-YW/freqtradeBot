  "content": "‌I'm so happy today and Just decided to share this senario about  how I made my first ride payment in Bitcoin. ‌Here is the story, I took a ride for very long distance journey for a presentation and we both agreed a price which cost me about ( $37 ) in my local fiat currency,  and we both agreed on making a transfer to him on getting to the destination , When we got to the end of the journey,then I requested his details for the transfer but I got a failed transaction, I tried the secondtransaction and had same issue, I was actually running out of time regards to the presentation because our car got over heated sometime along the road and we took some minutes to cool down the car.‌therefore, After this several attempts I had no option than to use the nearest ATM, when I slotted my card I eventually got my account debited without getting paid all was as result of my bank having network issues, I was really fustrated at the moment and I said ‌\"this is why I like Bitcoin\" , the guy replied and said are you a \"Bitcioner\" ?  I  said Yes,  I'm 75% exposed to Bitcoin and he said wow!, therefore you don't have an issue,  I will accept your payment in #BTC the guy brought he's phone, I scanned the wallet and made my payment of ( $40 ) swiftly  to him instead of ( $37 ) in order to encourage him in case of such senario in future with other people. These was how I had my first ride payment made in Bitcoin.With this experience I'm working on getting a ride that will accept Bitcoin in my area",

Bitcoin is gaining mainstream adoption and even the most uncivilized are getting to know Bitcoin as long as they can have access to smart devices payments can be made and received that is how unique cryptocurrency is as an alternative currency.",

Since you already mentioned that you agreed to pay for the transaction via a mobile transaction, that can easily be traced if he develops an ill intention to threaten and force you into sending all your money, but a forced transaction to a wallet address, you know how very close to impossible it is to track such. So always exercise caution and don't be too quick to indicate to someone that you use bitcoins especially if it is a one time transaction.",

While, you probably shouldn't go flaunting around how much you own, and how wealthy you're, simply saying you have Bitcoin isn't a problem at all.",

Not everyone who owns bitcoin is a millionaire. I don't see anything as worrisome as OP's case for letting others know he uses bitcoin, if OP hadn't said he was a bitcoin user he probably would have been in trouble that day because he wasn't either have cash. As long as you don't reveal how much bitcoin you hold and show off your assets, there should be no problem here. We are bitcoin users, so we should promote others in one way or another.",

That is why one would think if he or she should  invest in bitcoin they will be rich. I'm saying these based on experience and the kind of people am surrounded too.",
