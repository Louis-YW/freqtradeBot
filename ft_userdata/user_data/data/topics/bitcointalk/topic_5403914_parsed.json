  "content": "There is a deep history between Russia and Ukraine - Russia’s Black Sea Fleet have been stationed in Crimea since 1783 [1], but many people do not look past 2014 when discussing the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. Those who have been conditioned by the mainstream media will tell you that Crimea is Ukrainian through-and-through, and that the Russians brutally annexed this region in 2014, completely unprovoked. Of course, those same people are the ones who are spoon-fed prearranged Western narratives through the pixels of the propaganda machines in their living rooms, and proportionally the same people who seem to have no interest in finding out the truth, or bettering their own knowledge on an important world topic.Crimea was never 'Ukrainian through-and-through' - following the Russian Revolution in 1917, Crimea became an autonomous republic within the Soviet Union. The region was a part of the Russian SFSR until 1954, when it was transferred to Ukraine, as a 'symbolic gesture' by the Soviet Union [2]. Viktor Yanukovych, the President of Ukraine at the time of the 2014 coup d’état, was ousted from power by the Ukrainian Parliament in February that year - an operation headed by Western officials who wanted Ukraine to become just another shill for the United States and the European Union. This was similar to their proposition to Armenia in September 2013 - Armenia rejected the Armenia-EU Association Agreement [3], after they found out that the deal wasn’t about easing trade restrictions, but in fact, to antagonise Russia [4].You can choose to start from the Orange Revolution in 2004, or the 2008 Ukrainian Financial Crisis, or in 2010, when Ukraine scrapped a law that would lay out a roadmap to joining NATO [5], or from 2013 - Euromaidan. The Yanukovych government at the time had rejected a trade agreement with the EU which would bring about “closer integration” between Ukraine and the West. Yanukovych favoured strengthening trade relations with their neighbours Russia, whilst the Rada (Ukrainian Parliament), wanted a trade deal with the EU instead.Protests subsequently erupted particularly in Western Ukraine, where there has always been a lean towards more EU and collective West integration - essentially the anti-Russia parts of the state. The rejection of the agreement did not sit well with the Western oligarchs or the EU, or for that fact, the United States government, at that time under the Obama Administration. Violent protests ensued which eventually led to the appointment of Arseniy Yatsenyuk as Prime Minister, and Oleksandr Turchynov as President, to power - Yatsenyuk himself, was handpicked by Victoria Nuland who at the time, was the US ambassador to Ukraine. “The two officials also discuss frankly the merits of the three main Ukrainian opposition leaders - Vitaly Klitschko, Arseniy Yatseniuk and Oleh Tyahnybok. The female speaker [Victoria Nuland] says that Mr Klitschko, the former heavyweight boxing world champion, should not be in any new government. 'I don't think it's a good idea.' She adds: 'I think Yats (Arseniy Yatseniuk) is the guy who's got the economic experience'” [6]. The protests became so violent, that there are videos and testimonials that have surfaced that indicate that the snipers assassinating people during the protests, were hired by Maidan leaders themselves [7] - they were the real Ghosts of Kyiv.3 weeks after the 2014 coup d’état, and amidst the rising aggression against Russian-speaking Ukrainians, Crimea, a majority ethnically-Russia region, held a referendum to determine whether they should remain a part of Ukraine, or to become part of sovereign Russia [8]. “97% of voters backed breaking away from Ukraine and joining Russia”, and so it was that Crimea was once again, deemed part of Russia. Those of who succumb to the relentless Western mainstream media that actually bother to recognise the Crimean referendum, usually outright ignore or struggle to fathom the reasons as to why Crimea voted against Ukraine in the first place.Following the 2014 coup d’état, the anti-Euromaidan activists petitioned campaigns to allow local provinces to elect their own governors, hoping that this would provide some protection for themselves against the increasing tensions fuelled by the Euromaidan and the Rada. This demand, was one of the main factors that led to the fascists ganging up on Odessa, another area with a high population of Russian-speakers, shortly after.The constant antagonisation and bullying that the Russian-speaking Ukrainians [9] endured from Western Ukrainians was encapsulated on May 2nd 2014 [10] [11], with the now-dubbed Odessa Massacre. Notice the difference in narrative and wording between the partisan Western propaganda machine that is the Telegraph in [10], and the truthful analysis in [11]. 46 Russian-speaking Ukrainians were burned alive in the Odessa square, when a fascist-Nazi led mob of Euromaidan activists chased the 46 into the House of Trade Unions in Kulikovo Square, and then set it on fire, purposefully. Under Yanukovych, Russian was designated the second language of Ukraine, and rightfully so, given the large ethnic-Russia population, particularly in the south and the east. However, as soon as he was ousted, the dynamics changed, which may have added fuel to the fire that was heading in the anti-Russian direction. Some of the 46 died from the flames, others from smoke inhalation, others being shot and beaten to death when trying to leap from the windows of the 5-story tall HoTU building. The progressive activists and Ukronazis that conducted these killings, remain unpunished, in fact glorified and labelled 'patriots', whilst many of the victims who managed to survive the fire, now rot in prison, still, after 8 years, many of whom have never been charged with a crime, similar to '1/6' in the United States.[14]: “On the left - the pogroms of Jewish business in Nazi Germany under Hitler. On the right - the pogroms of Russian business, Russian banks in modern Ukraine. On the Windows of Jewish shops nationalists wrote \"death to Jews\", in modern Ukraine on the Windows of Russian banks write \"death to Russians\". Many decades have passed, several generations of people have changed, but the handwriting of fascism has not changed!”As you scroll further down [14] …[14]: “Left - the pogroms of the synagogue in Nazi Germany. On the right - vandals in Western Ukraine destroy monuments to Soviet soldiers. In the Third Reich, synagogues were destroyed, in modern neo-fascist Ukraine monuments to Soviet soldiers, military men, leaders are destroyed, arson and robbery of churches of the Russian Orthodox Church subordinated to Moscow are carried out.”It continues …[14]: “On the left - mass executions and murders of Jews and Russians in the territories occupied by fascists. All these executions were carried out in public in order to intimidate the local population in order to suppress the revolt in the root. Many decades later descendants of Banderovites, neo-fascists arranged actually public mass execution of people in the trade Unions Building in Odessa on May 2, 2014. The Odessa events call the second Khatyn as the purposes and methods of action of fascists and modern patriots of Ukraine were identical: mass murder for the purpose of intimidation of the others.”You get the idea. There’re many more photos on that website. This is the country that the West are supporting right now - at the time of writing, Ukraine are suffering heavy losses in the Donbas [15], and the Nazi Azov Battalion, recently surrendered in Mariupol, have now 'rebranded' [16]. I would recommend giving [15] a watch for a more in-depth analysis of the Azov Battalion and the hypocrisy of the Ukrainian government & Zelenskyy regime.The image in [16, 17], shows Zelenskyy’s official Telegram account (the image was also briefly posted on Instagram & Twitter before being taken down [17]), and what he posted on Victory Day - a day signifying Russia/Europe’s victory over Nazi Germany. It shows, in the main image, a Ukrainian soldier, with a Totenkopf/SS-Totenkopfverbände badge on his chest [18]. The Totenkopf were an elite Nazi division in World War 2, responsible for the Le Paradis massacre of 900 British and American troops, who had surrendered, as well as many other war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Totenkopf were responsible for administering the concentration and extermination camps for Nazi Germany [19], and now the West are supplying arms and moral support to the same insignia(s) that killed their own troops in World War 2.The .pdf [20], show a 2019 Congress letter asking the US State Department to label the Azov Battalion, as a terrorist organisation - an FTO. I wonder why there has been such a change of heart from 2019’s Congress, to 2022’s Congress. It’s an interesting train of thought.-=+=- References -=+=-[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Fleet[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea#In_the_Soviet_Union[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia%E2%80%93European_Union_relations[4] https://chycho.blogspot.com/2014/03/whats-really-going-on-bahrain-vs.html#UkraineRecap:[5] https://www.cleveland.com/world/2010/03/ukraine_to_pass_law_scrapping.html[6] https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26072281[7] https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-03-05/behind-kiev-snipers-it-was-somebody-new-coaltion-stunning-new-leak-reveals-truth[8] https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26613567[9] https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-one-economic-reason-russias-invasion-of-crimea-pulls-in-europe-2014-3?r=US&IR=T[10] https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10805412/Ukraine-crisis-dozens-killed-in-Odessa-fire-as-violence-spreads-to-countrys-south.html[11] https://popularresistance.org/may-2-remembering-the-odessa-massacre/[12] https://crimes-of-ukraine.ru/terror-betrayal-and-genocide-in-odessa-on-may-2-2014.html[13] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfsangel[14] https://crimes-of-ukraine.ru/photo-facts-of-neo-nazism-in-ukraine-historical-parallels-third-reich.html[15] https://youtu.be/gmwCs70o9K4[16] https://youtu.be/sR7g7uQV2fA[17] https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/world-news/war/zelensky-fights-alongside-nazis/[18] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totenkopf[19] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS-Totenkopfverb%C3%A4nde[20] https://www.scribd.com/document/564207042/LETTER-TO-MIKE-POMPEO-40-House-Democrats-Signed-A-2019-Letter-Asking-The-State-Department-To-Designate-Ukraine-s-Neo-Nazi-Azov-Battalion-As-A-Terroris#downloadhttps://verziro.substack.com/",

Russia is not 100% wrong and Ukraine is not 100% right.. the point is if Ukraine doesn't try to join Europe and break their promise to Russia, surely this war will not happen",

But where is Russia helping a country from a distance like the US is away from Ukraine? And where is Russia helping this country to fight a bigger country right on its border?There are lots of things that aren't being done fairly or rightly in this.",
