      "body": "It is impossible to predict the future with certainty, but it is important to note that the potential rejection of crypto/Blockchain technology by major countries does not necessarily mean the end of the industry. While CEXs may face challenges in such a scenario, there are other options available, such as DEXs, which may become more prevalent as the technology continues to develop. Additionally, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies means that they can still be used and traded without the need for centralized exchanges. However, it is important for the industry to continue to work towards mainstream adoption and regulatory clarity in order to ensure its long-term viability.",

Having no CEX around can limit people from transacting that much with cryptocurrency, we might be back to a slower era.",

Well we would lose those institutional investors we wanted to get in for so long. At your scenario there wouldn't be instant ban, as laws don't move as quickly we would have some time to prepare. But that prepariing would most likely be massive panic and people would try to escape out before fiat pairs would be banned.This would lead to lack of liquidity and total price crash. Most likely lots of people would even short it with leverage. I could see we might go back to 2013-2014 prices. As that what was happening before legit investors came. There were few big whales but it was a joke compared to current markets.In the end we would be coming back to roots. People trading p2p, hard to say how many people would do that but it would be way harder and charts wouldn't really exist as they are now.Some people would keep trading altcoin pairs (not stable coins tho). This would totally be a nerd and geek game after that. Some might think it would be a step up.",

Well, we probably go with the P2P market at least for Bitcoin this is how it was designed to be. Perhaps DEX will thieved or any other groundbreaking idea that will push the market to the masses. Although who knows, the price might be different, could be lower or higher. But it's going to be very difficult for us, although I think that there will be no heavy regulations that we have seen in the last five years. But I guess everything happens for a reason right? CEX is here since Mt. Gox and we have thrived and flourish since then. And I don't see them suddenly closing because government as simply coming after them because they cater for criminals, i.e. using them to avoid sanctions. It's going to be a battle though for many years between government regulators and this exchanges and other crypto services.",

QuoteWhat makes you think other countries will tighten regulations especially when they claim crypto can be used to avoid sanctions?IMO, regulations can vary widely from country to country, some are embracing crypto to make it legal tender while others banning or have heavy regulation towards crypto.  So the decision could be an eye on the government and it depends on their jurisdictions, we can't generalize them all.",

If all the cex were to stop today, maybe bitcoin could drop below $1k.  Because most people will think crypto is a scam then. And if liquidity is leveraged at sex, crypto will face near destruction. But it cannot be said that it will be completely destroyed",

Beside, at the beginning, crypto was meant to be decentralized, so it is actually all about P2P trading and, later, DEXs. Although there is no doubt that CEXs played a significant role in the development of crypto, If major countries reject crypto and blockchain technology, there could be a risk of CEXs shutting down their operations, but the crypto industry is not solely dependent on CEXs. With the massive development of crypto and how big the industry became, I think many countries will also think twice before banning it; they probably will regulate it instead. By doing so, CEXs could then adapt to the regulations and survive.",
