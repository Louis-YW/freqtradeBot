  "content": "The Token of Appreciation Exchange (TOAX) aims to be a place where users can not only buy the typical crypto, but also NFTs and ICOs that are launched by non-profits. We help non-profits launch NFT collections and an ICO for their coin that raises money for their cause.  In addition, each non-profit gets a share of the fees generated from each transaction across the whole platform, forever.  Ideally, non-profits will never have to fundraise again.  Imagine Make-A-Wish turning each Wish they grant for a child into an NFT that then feeds the next Wish for a child.  In addition, every token that is traded on the platform generates a fee that is then shared with Make - A -Wish.  They would never have to fundraise again.  We want to do this with 10,000 non-profits.  That's our goal.  Check us out: toax.ioWe are launching the exchange and NFT marketplace at the end of the month.We also created 10,000 NFTs to fund the project. They'll be available on toax.io at the end of the month. We've already sold 2500+ of them privately.  If you purchase one, you'll also be able to share in the fees of the exchange and marketplace, forever.  Imagine buying an NFT that allowed you to share in the fees of Binance when Binance was starting....Check us out! email me if you have any questions. We would love your feedback or to get you on the early adopters list.",
