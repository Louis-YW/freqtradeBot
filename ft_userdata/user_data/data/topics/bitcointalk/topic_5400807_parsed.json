  "content": "My heart is heavy right now. Recently on the news, I read of a story of a girl, how she was killed by her own uncle all because the fool wanted to make quick money, and it got me thinking.. how long do we have to sleep with one eye open all cause the government of the day has refused to play their part in ensuring security, stability and gainful employment for the masses?Â What can we say led this man to commit such a hideous crime against an innocent child? Is it poverty, greed or just outright wickedness?It's not about giving a beautiful manifesto when it's time for election, but can you follow through with it?What can we do to ensure a better society, because it seems the government of the day have failed.",

I think humans has always done sick shit like this, it's just that they are gaining more exposure now. Can't really blame it simply on the economics considering the majority of the poor don't resort to these evil deeds.",
