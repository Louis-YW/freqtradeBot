I go for top leagues like the EPL, Seria A, Bundesliga, French Lique 1 and those like that.

Match fixing does really exist but if you are dealing with those bigger ones then it is not that just possible because we know that odd actions will really be leading out that tons of questions if ever that happens.",

The gambler chose the best website to make the winning with no doubt.The stake will be the better website for the gambling,because it was the best gambling website in the world.The match fixing was affect the big betting gamblers,because the website will look to fix the match against the biggest betting money.Even in the World Cup Cricket,Some unofficial news was spread around us of the match was involved of 5million dollars worth of gambling in the Final match.Because as we know the India was in the strongest position with 10/10,but the final results purely seems like match fixing.The gambling owner only target against the maximum opinion of the game.",

I would say that I also witnessed match fixing in a horse race, it's obvious that the jockey, even though his horse is what we call outstanding favorite, will suddenly lose the race for unknown circumstance but you can see that he really didn't push the horse to it's limit and allow other horses to  get past him.So yeah, I would say that it's common occurrence here, but what the stewart will do is just suspend the jockey for that x races.But after that he will be back again with that kind of match fixing allowing only a few bettors to win and let the horse bettors down with huge amount of money.",

Anyone that is found involved are sanctioned. But despite the consequences and punishment, some club managers in small leagues still try ways to fix matches. One of the managers that has been the national team coach before in my country was found with match fixing and he was sanctioned. I do not know if because his mother was kidnapped was the reason because the adductors demanded for huge amount of money.",

I mostly agree with the advices those in this thread have given and only stick to big leagues in order to avoid to get scammed by match fixers within smaller leagues.Though, I must admit that the fact one cannot follow and bet in local sport events as one would like in case of being interested in them is quite discouraging... For example, here in my country we sadly suffer from an increasing degree of corruption and bad behavior by authorities, so I do not have any doubt there is match fixing going on as we speak with small leagues in Football and baseball. Which is bad news for fans of our national sports. The worst part about it is there is a lot of gullible people and bettors who do not even image there could be military and politicians getting involved with such scheme in this nation, in the end they will mostly get their money stripped from them in a very unfair way.Another reason I just like to bet when comes to World Cup or big events like the American Cup.",

What have your experiences about this been? Is match fixing considered a common occurrence in leagues you place bets at? It's not going to be healthy for gambler if they are the victims of match fixing. Just imagine you gamble and you think that base on your analysis, your team is going to win. And then you bet on them, but suddenly everything doesn't look right as everyone colluded to fixed the match. Hence you lose your bet and others too and only those people behind benefited. And then they can do the same process over and over again. For others as sports fan, maybe it doesn't bother them, but as a gambler definitely, you will find something is at odd with those kind of fix matches.",

In gambling and sport betting, If you are worried that one day you set a huge sum betting and then the match end up being fixed and you lose that bet. I suggest betting only in known leagues, LaLiga, UCL, premier league.....When we talk about fixed matches some decades ago, even most knows team they are evolved in that. Corruption is everywhere, you can't really avoid that or even know if that game is really fixed even when you win the bet. You best choice is to bet with average sums of money only.",

And then there is the point shaving in collegiate basketball if I'm not mistaken. And obviously in small league in football in some countries. So it's really prevalent to the point that we can call that it's becoming a norm.As for our concern, yes, everyone should be, we as sports fanatics wanted to see a all even field, or at least even if the team that you are supporting is the underdog, they will give everything to win, vice versa with the favorite. But if you see that teams are not performing well and just going to the motions of playing and in the case of boxing, taking a dive to end the fight, then we are going to be annoyed by it.",

Or, there may be sports that I don't know which offer those types of bets. If this happens in popular leagues then I doubt people will not see it. With so many cameras nowadays and many critics of sports, there will always be someone who will put it on social media to scare away fans and gamblers and I don't think any big league would like that to happen. In small leagues, they might not care especially those with less promotions because it won't hurt them. But I seriously doubt that popular leagues would jeopardize their business just to make a fixed match and profit from it. It's better to make a long-term profit than a one-time millionaire and lose all your fans because of one craziness and greed. I can see a higher chance of match-fixing in electronic games though, it can happen without our knowledge and even those who own the business.",

Before the start of every league match, whether big or small, there's no way an ordinary bettor could tell you that a particular match is fixed, unless the match is over, that's when you will be hearing such rumors that a match is fixed, and nobody knows about it until the end of the match. I think match-fixing is highly confidential to those who set it, and any of them who link it to the general public will be penalized with files. I remember the case of the newly signed Newcastle player who was filed, not to play for Newcastle for 2 years all because he bet on his team to lose against their opponent.",
