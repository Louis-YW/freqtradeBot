And my node has it, maybe it will be real, if mining will get more decentralized, or if my computing power will increase to enforce that.",

By using those settings, it means that by default there is a room for free transactions, up to 300 MB, or something like that. But of course if this mempool will be filled with 300 MB of regular transactions, those free transactions will vanish. And it is all by-design: allow free transactions if (and only if) there is a room for them, and allow gradually increasing fees, so that free or low-fee transactions are collected and broadcasted, and then they are batched into transactions with more fees, that will be mined, after crossing one satoshi per virtual byte. So, it works exactly as planned: transactions could be created as free, then they could contain low fees, and then they could pass the minimal fee, after being batched with other low-fee transactions.Another thing is that those settings can be used to enable P2P communication, and the best thing is that by default all of those low-or-no-fee-transactions are sent only between nodes that declare to accept them, so by using default one satoshi per virtual byte, you won't even receive them, no matter if your node is connected with those low-fee nodes, because they simply won't send you that, if they use the official Core client.",

Your full node software decide how much, how long and which transaction stay on the mempool.True, and all full node operators should be more aware of that, to not miss some hidden traffic from applications like P2P marketplace. Of course, it requires extra resource usage, for example bandwidth, but it may be profitable, while being trustless and respecting users' privacy.QuoteBut on practice, it's unlikely you'll receive any transaction with fee lower than 1 sat/vB.It depends on users. It is possible to receive some transactions with 0.999 sat/vB or lower, that can be joined (because of sighashes) and then broadcasted after reaching 1 sat/vB.QuoteDecent amount of node need to use same configuration as yours or Bitcoin Core change default value of those key to 0 to make 0-fee TX more practical.No, it is the other way around: it is practical to use only fees from excluded by default [0-1) sat/vB range in such subnetwork, then they are guaranteed to not be mined by most miners, and that means you can safely replace them. Also, each node broadcasts its own fee range, so you can easily filter nodes that accept such fees from those who don't. You can just leave your nodes running 24/7, and they should log all nodes with lower fee rates, in this way you can find them in a P2P way. It is like a not-so-obvious port, where you can choose a number from 0 to 999, because all numbers from 1000 upwards are standard fee rates.Another thing is that mining such half-baked transactions is not desired, even if they are technically correct, because they contain more information than usual on purpose. For example, a transaction with \"<pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG\" which has \"<message> OP_DROP <signature>\" scriptSig. That \"<message> OP_DROP\" is a part of some P2P protocol, it is useful when exchanging data in a P2P way between nodes, but it should be dropped when broadcasting to the main network, just for better privacy.",

All that is needed is multiplying each private key by each other public key, and then use that to symmetrically encrypt any message with AES, and then push it into the script. So, nodes could see the message itself, but if it will be encrypted, then the content can be safely routed. And if OP_DROP inside input is too much, then it is still possible to put it in the output, and then push one zero byte, when sending to the mainnet. But I personally prefer OP_DROP inside input, then it can be removed without leaving any trace that it was present.QuoteBut...when we have times like now with dozens and dozens of unfilled blocks I would not have to think about combining a ton of small inputs and what it cost me.And that's why I think some transactions in some cases should be free. It could be based on UTXO utilization or something, it is an open topic. Definitely, you can use dust outputs in some cases, and make it non-dust, for example by spending it with SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY and putting higher output than input.
