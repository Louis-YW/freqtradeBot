If history repeats, a new bull run will come like 6 months after halving but if history won't repeat itself this time.Like the bull run will start a few months sooner even before the halving. It only causes difference if people hesitate to buy and wait for halving to start buying.",

I'm more interested in your low prediction, since you got 2022 right. Where do you think the low is? And how much?Or are you saying the low you predicted was the bottom of this cycle? Because 4-year cycles usually have the bottom >1 year after ATH right?",

However, aside from the halving happening in April 2024 we are also expecting of another new thing to come to the market which is the approval of ETF and this factor might slightly alter the cycle maybe that can shorten the new ATH. Anyway, the big lesson here is for anyone interested with Bitcoin to increase what they are holding as avalanche of blessings can be coming to those with diamond hands.",

However, I am suspecting major adjustments in this, considering a lot of factors that will come into play in this market cycle. Next years halving might likely happen the same time that Bitcoin ETF will be approved with the later a powerful fundamental to cause Bitcoin achieve a new ATH. So, this combination might be a powerful combination to initiate an astronomical bull run before 2025. I will not be surprised if the bull run actually starts before 2025, when the whole world least expected. It will be a way of maintaining the dynamic nature of the market. Indeed, next year will truly be interesting year for Bitcoin as it will clear some myth about Bitcoin.",

These analyses are probabilistic and serve to give us an idea of what might come, but there are some things that cannot be foreseen, such as the COVID example you gave. Inflation and the war in Ukraine also had a negative effect on the markets and it seems that this also affected the price of bitcoin, as it led to higher interest rates, and people had less money to invest.",
