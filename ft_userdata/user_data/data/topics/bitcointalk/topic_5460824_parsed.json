  "content": "Hey guys,I need a 700â‚¬ loan. I could pay back 850â‚¬ at the end of this month.I have no crypto collateral to offer, as I would have cashed it out otherwise.Already needed the money since last week but I couldnâ€™t find a way to get it. Already asked some friends and family member, without any luck.I know Iâ€™m a completely new user and probably no1 will trust me but I would be ready so send all information about me, which u need. Like ID, proof of income etc. Would also verify those documents, if you donâ€™t believe itâ€™s me. Iâ€™m from Germany btw.Little to no hope that someone will lend me something but I still wanted to ask here, as im desperate atm and MAYBE there is someone out there who could help out.If you have any questions or need further information, just ask here or in dm.",

Going to police and tell them this guy scammed me 700â‚¬ and inter-pool is going to catch you to give the 700â‚¬ back to the lender? Who will even go this far LOLIf you have no one near you to support you with money then you are not belong to that society.

You have not record, no one knows you, seen you before. You have nothing to lose if you fail to repay the lender. Consider me. If I loan from someone, I have everything to lose if I do not replay them. In fact I will not allow anyone to destroy my account even for a few BTC at today's price. This account is a history, pride for me. And the pride, the history worth more than any amount of money. A lender knows it and they will never hesitate to lend me any amount that they think is safe for them to lose.I am sorry if you are really in problem but this is unrealistic for you to expect anything from an unknown place.",

But from this forum, you have zero chances. In fact if you continue pushing here, some will put you in their distrust list and will leave you negative feedback. I am sure you have no idea how this forum works.Sort out yourself then when you are good, come back to this forum. Spend time with us. May be some day you will be able to earn some pocket money from this place. But don't hope for anything now.",
