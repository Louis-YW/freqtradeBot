They apply the idea to all kinds of things including the game Resident Evil. And then I thought perhaps this is also true in the economic aspect of life. Perhaps this aptly applies to those whose economic lives are like the desert and whose little money they have they keep tightly for the hardest of days.When I was studying in the university far from family and relatives or even family friends, I had a difficult time. Money is extremely scarce. Early mornings are usually for hot drinks-- coffee, chocolate, milk, tea, or whatever. I realized that what made those drinks important is that they are hot. So I learned to drink only a hot cup of water which I could easily ask for free from the eatery in front of where I stayed.Come meal time, I would also request that the serving be made in half. That's to save money. But I had the money. I always made sure I have some. Emergencies and unforeseen expenses may arise anytime. So I need to have money all the time, but I won't touch it. Ironically, it also gave me hunger, inconvenience, discomfort at times.My story is rather uninteresting, but let me know yours. Does this idea also apply to you? You could have the money to buy a new car to replace your old and broken one but you prefer not to touch it. Do you hold yourself from spending what you have to the point of depriving yourself of what you deserve? Do you keep significant savings for occasions that might only happen in your imagination? Or at what point would you allow yourself to be drained of your last penny?",

I like having something left.\"The difference between savings and no savings is often just a few percent in...\"?A: SpendingB: InflationI think when it comes to untouchable savings it is also unavoidable to consider the economic environment and circumstances you are in. Argentina and Turkey had an above 80% inflation rate in October 2022 year-over-year. The \"untouchable\" somehow implies that you lock it away and perhaps even refrain from managing it. I know that is my assumption about what OP wanted to express with the question, but I just wanted to point out that in certain circumstances even the untouchable savings must be managed thoroughly. If with \"untouchable\" it is meant that someone earns fiat, puts it aside and strictly doesn't touch it, then those untouchable earnings might vanish over time despite any good intentions of the disciplined saver. If with \"untouchable\" OP refers to a fixed amount being invested in liquid and rather safe asset classes, that makes more sense if it is to be understood as a general rule or basic principle. When I read about an 88% inflation rate in Argentina, the bitter truth is that those who put their money aside for years with very high discipline, turned out to be the big losers anyway. So the fact of the matter is that building wealth starts with educating yourself about financial management and not underestimate the impact you can have on your own situation by familiarizing yourself with some basic terms and rules.",

Slavery is dehumanising and to give yourself such a treatment is just worse of it all, why deprive yourself of what you can afford? That means you suffer or labour to make money and you also labour to eat from same money, that is bad.

It may not be intentionally.

But I know personally of people who save to the extent that sometimes it seems that they need financial help, and at the same time they refrain from spending at least as much as they need for a life worthy of a human being.

Emergencies and unforeseen expenses may arise anytime. So I need to have money all the time, but I won't touch it. Ironically, it also gave me hunger, inconvenience, discomfort at times.Such saving through personal renunciation of something that you need to function normally is wrong for me personally, and I believe that you understood that after you experienced it on your own skin. A man cannot function normally if he is hungry or if he is cold, and at the same time he has means that can solve all of this, but he refuses to use them. Saving money by giving up cigarettes, coffee, bad food, alcohol and the like is logical, but being hungry and at the same time having a full wallet is simply wrong.Quote from: Darker45 on February 09, 2023, 09:45:38 AMMy story is rather uninteresting, but let me know yours.

In addition, the safety of you and those who are in that car can be endangered, so a new car is not a luxury, but a necessity that has a purpose. In addition, you can save significantly if you buy a used car that is in good condition.",

There are doctors and health experts who recommend that people avoid stressing or straining themselves. I did the opposite of that advice for many years. Which makes me wonder how I did not succeed in screwing up my health or simply dying. Even I do not know the answer. All I know is I ran myself ragged for a long time.It is possible approaching things as if you have infinite energy, is exhausting. Giving yourself an incentive to learn how to generate greater amounts of energy. While actively pacing and rationing the amount of energy expended. Gives zero incentive to learn to produce or gather more of it.The same principles might apply to money. Actively spending and going broke could produce incentive and motivation to develop methods to amass more money. While rationing expenditures might produce an illusion of comfort and safety.",
