  "content": "Can Bitcoin mining be turned on and off and then picked back up where I left off when turned back on? Basically, I bought a house with PV solar that generates an extra 20+ kWh a day more than I use. I’m curious if I could mine at a rate that only uses about 20kWh a day, or have it so I shut it off after about 20kWh and then it picks up where it leaves off? Or I could run it for a few weeks and then take a few weeks off. I have net metering and if I don’t use my excess the power company uses it for free. Power in my area is like 40 cents a kWh so I’d rather not go over what I generate. Would mining make any sense?Thanks in advance for any guidance on this.",

I don't think it makes sense.So, when you do pool mining, your miner gets work from time to time and sends hashes.Of course, you can stop whenever you want, but a PPLNS pool may penalize you a little when you're back. So you may have to read more about PPS/FPPS/PPLNS/PPS+ and whatever methods exist and see what is best for you. (One page google has returned to me is https://medium.com/luxor/mining-pool-payment-methods-pps-vs-pplns-ac699f44149f#)I don't know how many hours would your mining go every day (probably @philipma1957 will come with the proper math), I think that it makes sense only if it's more than 2-3hKeep in mind that if you are on PPLNS, you mine for 1h and the next block found by that specific pool is only after 4-5h, you will probably earn nothing. Again, you have to look for the pool type that suits you best (payment type and maybe also frequency of mined blocks). But imho you can mine too even if it's not 24/7.",

I agree with DaveF, get one older generation used miner, less revenue but at least chances of actually making a profit, that is...if the miner doesn't break. Let's see if somebody is up to date with used gear prices, as I have like zero idea where those are right now.",

No you should wait till September and see what happens to ethcards may drop in price. you may be able to build the rig under $750you can mine eth or etc and convert to btc. I do it all the time.",
