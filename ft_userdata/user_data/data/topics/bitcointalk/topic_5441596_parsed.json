      "body": "Personally one of the only real usage I have for Litecoin is the fact that it can be merge-mined with Dogecoin. It makes mining with Scrypt profitable (even if the profitability is boosted by Doge principally).I use it from time to time to buy BTC at ATMs, when BTC fees are too high (Ordinals hurt me haha). Once the mempool empties a bit, I exchange it for BTC, I lose 1% in fees but it's not a big deal. I have to admit that it's very convenient for that too.When it comes to cheap transactions Litecoin stands up well but could be replaced by other more efficient altcoins. In any case Litecoin is definitely useful (from a strictly personal point of view) for particular purposes, but I can't think of any other coin that can surpass it in its category. I'm curious, why are you so bullish on LTC? Is it for the speed of transactions? Low fees?",

Is it for the speed of transactions? Low fees?Its one of the few which is decentral, its fast and has low fees. Plus its maintained quiete well. I wonder why its not more popular, ok there are 25 000 other coins most of which are well central but promise more. Replacing Litecoin by others? That will be difficult, as most of the others don't even honor their Whitepapers. I propose to make whitepapers editable. There will be huge surprises from their respective fellowship.",
