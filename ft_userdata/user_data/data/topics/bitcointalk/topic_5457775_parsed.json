  "content": "Hello.I have set up my own node and I am also running an electrum server (electrs).I need:1. to connect my mobile wallet to my electrum server using my tor onion link, in order to have access from everywhere.2. to be able to monitor my multi-sig wallet (watch-only mode). Therefore the wallet must have the feature to import multiple xpubs in order to view my wallet's balance and generate addresses.Literally any wallet would do.I have tried:1. BlueWallet but it doesn't connect to electrum server through tor.2. Nunchuk but it doesn't connect to electrum server through tor.3. Samourai but it doesn't support watch-only multi-signature wallet, even though tor seems to be running properly.Edit:I have installed Orbit in order to use tor more properly, but no luck with it.",
