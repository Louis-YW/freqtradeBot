  "content": "Hi everyone,I would appreciate any advice or suggestions regarding the launch of my crypto project, so thank you in advance First, let's start with some history, it started when I was trying to collect data for another youtube service project that have nothing to do with crypto. I thought with the tools available today, getting a list of youtubers contact information wouldn't be a challenge, but after trying everything, I realized that mining data for startups like mine can be a promising business since then I have been working on my own solution and the idea kept evolving while developing the app, so now I have another challenge wish led me to crypto, the idea is to let users to create tasks for data collection, social boost, SEO, etc.. and pay a fair amount to users who perform this tasks, since the tasks are distributed to many users, the micropayments can't be done using paypal or similar service, so the first thing came in mind was lighting network, but when I shared the idea with the people that I know they have crypto experience, I realized that lighting is popular among crypto enthusiast, but my app is built for everyone, and believe it or not ethereum tokens are more popular nowadays because of NFTs and other projects.The question is, should I use bitcoin lighting or create an erc20 token?",

You don't have to do all that shmuck about tokenomics, whitepaper, documentation, etc, and could just, well, proceed to create the site itself and promotions for it. You can still use crypto as a payment method, but you can use well known crypto as payments instead like Bitcoin, ETH, etc.Quote from: Stelisto on September 25, 2023, 08:21:11 PM~I believe this project has a good chance because the vision is big, and the app will be ready before the announcement, so as an investor, you can test the live version of the app.My plans for the token are simple, sell 5% to first-comers to evaluate the project cap, let's say one week, once it's done, we do a branding, and UX improvement and then deploy contracts and add the app to Chrome store, start with the whitelisting to sell 35% to the public, once this step is done, we start the market with same amount as liquidity, so now we used 75%, the rest 25% managed by the company to make sure the vision the data collecting is always available to offer more features and services.What do you think? See here's the mistake in most people's thinking when they're creating a new project. It does not matter how much damn you give in your project, you're not the one investing, it's others, so stop with that self-hypnosis that the project would do good. It's also unrealistic how the project relies on investors before fully launching. At the very least, do a full launch, and then look for investors. We're way past that stage where people blindly invest in new projects imo.",

I see that a member have already suggested you making provision for multiple withdrawal option for the choices which you are thinking on to choose. When it come to withdrawal especially in a system where the user will have to be earning little by little, and the withdrawal can be very small unit most times, it will be much more appreciated if you can make provision for a payment option that can cost the customer less, maybe after making provision for lightening network and ERC you can also add network like LTC and trc as they also have a lower transaction fee and is popular accepted in most major exchanges so your users can choose from the option when they want to make a withdrawal. With time, if the system has seen any of the most popularly used network by your users, you can then disable the rest of it that are not being used that’s if they are costing you for them to be their.",
