Look at reviews of Cold Case on 8-12 Video Cards. This case has airflow separation and removable dust filters. According to reviews, a very good case, but from the minuses, it takes a very long time to assemble it. Or look at analogues in your country.",

      "body": "Having a closed case can be tricky.A regular gamer PC case will have heating and ventilation issues with only 2 GPUs. Usually one GPU will be fine but depending on how close it is to the other GPU on the motherboard, that one will have heat issues due to lack of ventilation space.If you really want to have 2, you can use a large PC gamer case but you should seperate them as far as you can on the motherboard and then with good intake and exhaust fans you will be fine. If you want more than 2, then you need a server chassis case which is good for up to 8 GPUs but its crazy loud.",
