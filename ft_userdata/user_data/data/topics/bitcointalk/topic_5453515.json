  "content": "Do we know when the word \"bitcoin\" appeared for the first time? Are we 100% sure it was in THE PAPER?I was wondering why it is \"bitcoin\". (Someone with more advanced linguistic skills could probably help a lot). \"coin\" seems be the easier part. It clearly indicates the thing has something to do with currency. Is \"coin\" the only word which could be used? \"note\", \"check\", \"bill\"? Maybe that could be interesting, as unspent output is usually an effect of many previous operations and depends on their result - any faulty previous operation makes the final result faulty.Talking about \"bit\" I am not sure if it should mean the concept is related to IT (computers, digitalization etc) or it has something to do with computer bits as a unit. I think already a decade ago \"e-\" was used for \"electronic\" versions of given words, like e-mail or e-market. On the other hand I think \"byte\" was a more popular word related to computer thinks. And we have also the root of the whole concept, elliptic curve. If we would take \"sec\" from secp256k1, \"seccoin\" could be also extended to \"secure coin\".I am curious what do you think about it, why these two words \"bit + coin\" were selected?",

However, the whitepaper could be regarded as the first official register for the name bitcoin.

He was aware he wanted something not centralized that is why he didn't go the way of dollars. He had a clear vision of solving the problem created by centralized fiat, it wouldn't make sense naming his project with the name of the sickness he wants to cure.With his conscious mind, that is why he choose a pseudonymous name and was able to conceal his identity till date. Nothing took him unaware and nothing happened coincidentally. I think that the word 'bit' is a know computer lang, but it is well connected with Sats as a unit of bitcoin. Which shows that it is a currency that will still be valuable even in thousands of bits. Maybe from here the 21 million cap was formed",

The bit shows the binary part and the coin refers to the money part, and if we add the technology part bit and money part =coin then we well get Bitcoin. If we combine those two words we will get Bitcoin and that's the real magic that's currently working for us. There wasn't any currency made of out of bit before it, and it was the first one which was made purely out of bits and was coded by Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi named it this way because he was sure that a digital coin with such name suits the real purpose and people will soon accept it as a form of currency.Some other crypto-currencies tried to copy the name and one such example was Bytecoin, but unfortunately they were unsuccessful in gaining as much attraction as Bitcoin got because even if byte was a larger number but it was still unable to compete the king. I don't think that there might be another reason for naming it as Bitcoin other than the one I described, and if you think there is another reason for naming it that way then kindly share the details with logic.",

That was before people decided to name the smallest unit as \"satoshi\", and even before Satoshi decided, that it should be divisible up to 8 decimal places, and not 6 (like it was in pre-Genesis version).For \"bit\", it may be related to counting zero bits in block hashes. Before the Genesis Block, there was a version, where bits were counted directly, and for example if you had your difficulty set to \"20\", then the meaning was that you need a block with 20 leading zero bits. Also, in the whitepaper you can read about counting zero bits, and not about the current way of handling difficulty. Comparing 256-bit target with the block hash, and using a nice, compact form of 32-bit number to express the target, all of that was invented later, after pre-release version, and after the whitepaper, but before the Genesis Block.",

Let me also make some insert on the topic. As you start it from the linguistics perspective let see how it goes. Unit is the general word for the both words of Bit and coin. Bit is use mathematical concept in computer and not in digital. Bit is the smallest unit of the decimal zero 0 point which is the only thing computer recognition. Coin in currency means the fraction of money that is smaller in unit. Now in general, bitcoin means part of Money that can be used online . This how I see bitcoin in my one understanding.",

On the other hand I think \"byte\" was a more popular word related to computer thinks. A byte is made up of 8 bits, whereas bits is the basic unit, as bytes are merely the smallest domination of bits, hence why it's more common reference than bits. Ultimately bits represent the binary values of 0 and 1, whereas bytes is merely unit of account. So when referencing something that is purely based on 1s and 0s, like Bitcoin, it does make sense that bits was used rather than bytes.

According to the wikipedia \"A bit (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store.\" and According to the wikipedia when looking at the meaning of coin in the context of money \"a flat disc or piece of metal with an official stamp, used as money.\" if we look at bitcoin transaction, their is always a stamp on each transaction which can not be wiped of and however, bitcoin was developed in the sense that the founder wants every bit of it to count in making a huge figure when it relates to finance ie monetary value.",
