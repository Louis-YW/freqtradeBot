  "content": "https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1646135432982286338?s=19According to Warren Buffett, Bitcoin is called a gambling coin because it does not have a fixed value. Warren Buffett cares more about paper money or fiat than Bitcoin, but one thing is very important that Warren Buffett cares about the dollar in this satirical/Critisized  interview.But in a tweet replay to Bitcoin Magazine, a gentleman gave a strong response to his satirical interview, which is brought to you all.Quote from: https://twitter.com/civic_cat/status/1646933596266168320?s=19Dear Mr. Buffett,I realised recently money is just intermediate value. It is value that hasn’t assumed the form of something we can directly use. So the value of a dollar is not $1–that would be circular. It is what you can exchange that dollar for. The seller determines this. Yet if the value of a dollar ever felt immutable, unchangeable, it was due to a web of implicit trust between buyers, sellers, and institutions. Institutions willing to enforce its value with might and steel. So the dollar, the most commonly traded instrument in history, never had intrinsic value. It had exchange value derived from trust and force. Banks safekeep and bookkeep money. They are exchange hubs. Their ledgers are codices of exchanges. Of transaction history. They also make money by issuing loans, but this third function relies on the first two.Money first roamed the world as cowrie shells, gold and silver, then cash. It roams bankspace through SWIFT, ACH, whatever networks banks run in the backroom, maybe FedNow in the future. Bankspace has become a superfluous middle step because we can now network directly with each other. Cash has become problematic because so much of it has been issued. Because so much of it has been issued, a lot of it is being spent, in turn driving prices up and lowering that exchange value of a dollar.Bitcoin is just money on a blockchainA blockchain is a peer-to-peer exchange network that bypasses bankspace. As a networked ledger duplicated across multiple nodes, it addresses the need for safekeeping and bookkeeping.Bitcoin’s like money. Because it is value in intermediate form, and tradeable for dollars. Like euros or yen or renminbi. And its value is ultimately decided by its buyers and sellers, just like money. And if people counterfeited or issued more Bitcoin, its value would drop in response.But it was born to have a fixed supply, unlike money. So it’s not a gambling token. It has characteristics as a network of value exchange that make it a more stable type of money. A money native to this reality where mobile devices are ubiquitous.Tweet reply from: https://twitter.com/civic_cat/status/1646933596266168320?s=19How would you respond to Warren Buffett's anti-Bitcoin comments?",

Anti Bitcoin comments are sometimes best ignored as long as they are not spreading malicious wrong information, like in the case of CSW. Warren Buffet has for a long time been anti Bitcoin publicly, it's no surprise he still finds a way to drop a comment or two on Bitcoin even if that is not directly related to the question asked. It's a sort of obsession many typical wealthy people have, they are surprised the network has not collapsed yet as they predicted.If I'm for formulate a reply; I would talk about how he tries to instill confidence in bank depositors, that their investment are always safe there and he does not see a system that operates on whims to be unsustainable. And I would ask that he doesn't use Bitcoin to make his interviews more popular.",

But some explanation of the myth must be answered with this one. So don't convince Warren Buffett about bitcoin, it's useless.Bitcoin has no intrinsic value (unlike some other things)QuoteBitcoin has no intrinsic value (unlike some other things)This is simply not true. Each bitcoin gives the holder the ability to embed a large number of short in-transaction messages in a globally distributed and timestamped permanent data store, namely the bitcoin blockchain. There is no other similar datastore which is so widely distributed. There is a tradeoff between the exact number of messages and how quickly they can be embedded. But as of December 2013, it's fair to say that one bitcoin allows around 1000 such messages to be embedded, each within about 10 minutes of being sent, since a fee of 0.001 BTC is enough to get transactions confirmed quickly. This message embedding certainly has intrinsic value since it can be used to prove ownership of a document at a certain time, by including a one-way hash of that document in a transaction. Considering that electronic notarization services charge something like $10/document, this would give an intrinsic value of around $10,000 per bitcoin.While some other tangible commodities do have intrinsic value, that value is generally much less than its trading price. Consider for example that gold, if it were not used as an inflation-proof store of value, but rather only for its industrial uses, would certainly not be worth what it is today, since the industrial requirements for gold are far smaller than the available supply thereof.In any event, while historically intrinsic value, as well as other attributes like divisibility, fungibility, scarcity, durability, helped establish certain commodities as mediums of exchange, it is certainly not a prerequisite. While bitcoins are accused of lacking 'intrinsic value' in this sense, they make up for it in spades by possessing the other qualities necessary to make it a good medium of exchange, equal to or better than commodity money.Another way to think about this is to consider the value of bitcoin the global network, rather than each bitcoin in isolation. The value of an individual telephone is derived from the network it is connected to. If there was no phone network, a telephone would be useless. Similarly the value of an individual bitcoin derives from the global network of bitcoin-enabled merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc... Just like a phone is necessary to transmit vocal information through the network, a bitcoin is necessary to transmit economic information through the network.Value is ultimately determined by what people are willing to trade for - by supply and demand.",

Yes, this is a free market on which everyone could really be able to give out and share their own opinions which we know that it cant be wrong nor it cant be right.Its not really that shocking thatthere would be those people who would really be that bearish when it comes to Bitcoin or someone who do really loves to criticize which is mostly into those people who are really that billionaires out of those traditional investments that we do know and heavily relying and depending on banking system which it isnt really that shocking that they would really be having that kind of feedbacks and opinions but its not something that we should be minding off specially for us who do support Bitcoin mainly.",

If they can invest in Apple, they can invest in cryptocurrency. If they do that, Bitcoin will surely be their first choice.

So what is meant by not producing something real, what does that mean, it's clear that bitcoin is real, and something real, will definitely produce something real.and about unproductive bitcoin, that's also a big mistake, because so far bitcoin has always been an investment asset that continues to be productive.Buffet doesn't seem to really fully understand bitcoin, because the opinion expressed by Warren Buffet looks like random speech, without being based on specific research. So I don't really care about what comes out of his mouth, because people's opinions are always different, so if Waren Buffett doesn't like bitcoin, go ahead, I don't think about it too much, and it won't make me switch from bitcoin.",

The value of any currency is its worth in the market. How much goods it can buy is the value of any currency. As much as I know, holding or using any currency is a risk because none has a constant value.And it is important to note that anything can be used as money and it will have value. If people in my country refuse to use the national currency as a medium of exchange and decide that human hair is now the means of exchange, human hair will immediately start having value. If people decide to use Bitcoin, its value will also go high and the government can do nothing about it. If the government decides to give its citizens freedom to choose the currency they want to transact with, many will choose Bitcoin and the government knows that's why they are using force to enforce compliance to their bad policies.",
