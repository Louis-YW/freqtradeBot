They can do anything without consent so whether or not the tax imposed on crypto is reasonable is an agenda to gain benefits from government programs. That's how the government works because all they think about is income through the tax sector and that is a huge profit that they can get for free through the growth of crypto and exchanges. In my country it is the same because the government considers taxes through exchanges and when we make transactions, deductions will be made automatically. But to go further I don't understand how your country taxes crypto but almost most countries will probably consider taxes as one of the income they can get from crypto.",

If I am not mistakenly I have had similar news without our country to start taxing all cryptocurrency traders and those who involved in any form of transactions using cryptocurrency, although I didn't see as something legal because, they can't tends to restrict cryptocurrency transactions/trading and still request for taxations from those who are trading it. Does this looks presentable? To me it's entirely No! It would be better they declared it a legal tender and imposed taxations this would be fine because at then every is open to use it and while paying tax they wouldn't feel it anymore becoming it's openly acceptable.",

If crypto is not yet a legal tender and you can't use to purchase goods or services, then it shouldn't be taxed. But unfortunately, that's how government works! In my country as well, crypto is not a legal tender. However, government has imposed 30% tax on crypto assets and it is ongoing since last 2 years now. If you are not using any local crypto exchange, I don't think you should be declaring your crypto assets at all. But if you are already using a local exchange, then you data is already available with the government. So if you don't declare, you may receive a tax notice. I will suggest you to speak to a professional tax lawyer to understand the situation in a better way and decide accordingly.",

What the government should have done foremost was to first put every security measures in place through the country's sec that would ensure the protection of crypto users against any manipulations and scams and somehow grant cryptocurrency in its jurisprudence some relative legality as a currency before forging on with a 15% tax on crypto transactions and others.There actions rather gives the impression that the government over there in your country is just after what they could get in profit from taxing those dealing on crypto. Nothing more, and it's really bad coming from them.",

If they actually have plans on taxing, then it means that it has been recognized, therefore it is not illegal. It is even impossible to declare all crypto assets legal tender, except there is a specific( like Bitcoin which we've seen in two countries).Besides there are centralized exchanges that operates and process transactions of Philippine citizens, so I believe this tax payment will only be visible while making transactions, and not necessarily declaring your entire crypto assets.Let's be honest, not sure if anyone will be stupid enough to declare all of his/her Hodlings to the government. At the end of the day, it still boils down to exchanges doing the work for the government, and at this point, those who do their hodlings on an exchange might eventually face something different.",
