Remember that the forum moderators do not deal with the scams, as proving one is a hard procedure. Uti cerebrum and all will be good.

Eg. banning bounties would undoubtedly reduce spam, but that'd be destroying an entire economy/population/culture which has been able to develop due to the forum's freedom. I am willing to take this sort of action, but only as an absolute last resort. It's always preferable to handle these problems by reshaping the environment to make them non-problems, rather than removing some freedom.It's wonderful when someone is able to constructively do something on the forum instead of continuing with whatever they were expected to do under the status quo. Enabling that sort of thing is exactly why Bitcoin and this forum were created.

Reducing \"grandfathered\" Merit has been suggested many times before. Losing 1 Merit per year would be enough to downgrade many old accounts. Or 1 Merit per 100 Activity, or 100 Posts.

The campaign managers are the moderators and can decide what they want in their campaign. But being considerate to others who are yet to perfect the forum well and earn merit within a short time will be better and appreciable. The little merit earned within the last 4 months before participating in most campaigns gives more hope and  action to do more for the upcoming members in the forum. This should not be much regularized or changed.",
