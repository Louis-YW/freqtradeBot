Doing a simple join task in exchange for a token reward always ends up becoming useless.For them it's not useless they collect people or telegram users to promote their tokens that usually have no value and does not yet listed in any exchange.They don't even have an announcement about their project it is likely the same as other tokens and NFT games like the game that I installed last year but until now the token that I earn can't be traded because no exchange supports it.I believe this would turn out to be the same as a scam or Ponzi project or the telegram group can be used to promote other businesses and those who join will receive a pm and they will try to convince you to invest on the cloud mining or exchange that you never heard before.",

Sometime this free airdrop or tokens are just a token of appreciation for joining then those who ask to participate gonna use your joinining for engagement or as followers, then change name again to another project until they farm users or airdropper for what? If you gained a large telegram group or social account with bunch of followers they canbuse that for monetization isnt it. In any case the one got used are those hoping for an airdrop.",

Anyway, we should always be open to any new entrants to the crypto space but projects should prove that they got something innovative on their sleeves otherwise it would just be another project having the intent to take as much money as they can. I hope to read the things DigiPanda is solidly offering that we can call as new and something interesting, in the first place.",

It's too good to be true and there are many ways to make this more appealing than those words. No one believes in those things anymore and it sounded like a clickbait. An old investor's first impression would always be a scammy attempt. It's better to present a project, inform who is on the team, make it clear about what their goal is, and so on and forth. It's not like we are buying here with fake money, those will be real money that could've been spent on better projects with better service.",

      "body": "Anything can happen in the cryptocurrency market, but the claim of a 1000x potential, as you mentioned, doesn't appear credible. It's not realistic for a project to achieve a 1000x increase in value solely by distributing free coins. Even though I am an active crypto user, I've never come across this \"Digipanda.\" Please don't take offense, my friend, but the marketing outreach for your altcoin seems insufficient. To begin with, promote it effectively and build a robust Digipanda community.You haven't disclosed any information about your current funding, and the absence of a roadmap raises concerns. Setting such high expectations without proper planning appears disingenuous. A genuine target wouldn't involve expecting a 1000x increase at this stage. Achieving that will require substantial effort. Mere words won't suffice, as evidenced by the numerous exchanges that provided free offers and disappeared unnoticed. Therefore, my advice remains: focus on promotion, enhance your credibility in the market, and only then contemplate the potential success of your project.",
