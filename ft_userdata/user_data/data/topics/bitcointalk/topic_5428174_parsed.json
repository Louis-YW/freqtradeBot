They hope to penetrate the Moroccan defense too, but I don't bet on the semi-finals later, I wish you luck",

If we take into consideration, that there are not weak teams in World Cups, but who Morocco plaid against ? Croatia - draw. Belgium. Canada (these guys were not on ice skates and without sticks, otherwise they would have won). Won in lottery, I mean penalties against Spain. Lucky score against Portugal. How can you call it a beating, when Portugal ball possession was 76% ? I believe France will show them who is the boss.",

Is your bet valid or consider cut in such situation? AFAIK this option is similar like draw no bet, if the match ended draw but France winning via penalty, bettors who bet France will win and get the share. This is why the odds is really small, you can find the odds on the other bookies where France is @1.53, draw is @3.80 and Morocco is @7.50. But what I like in Freebitco is the minimum bet is really small, you can bet even for 1 satoshi, while most of the bookies will require you at least 1 dollar.",

      "body": "Seriously speaking. Betting on Morocco is a good choice same with Croatia because they have capabilities to make an upset match tournament. I just don’t think that betting huge amount is a wise choice because you are relying only on an upset match not with the sure dominance of the team. France is composed of multiple star player with synchronized play to each other while Portugal which Morocco beat recently is just good individually and not as a team. Your amount is too huge for 7.4 odds on Duelbits for that team. This is a very high risk high reward and I hope that you are using free money since this is just your first bet. I do a single bet too on this team but with just 5 bucks. I still feel that France will not gonna give this game easily because they are so close to defend their title this world cup. Good luck on both of us then.",

Freebitco will consider the team as a winner who will qualify for the final. There is no option to place a bet on draw. And the title of the betting event says this \"Which team between France and Morocco will progress to the finals?\"Quote from: Plaguedeath on December 13, 2022, 01:40:11 PMAFAIK this option is similar like draw no bet, if the match ended draw but France winning via penalty, bettors who bet France will win and get the share.No, it isn’t the 'draw no bet' betting feature. Draw no bet means a different thing which is valid for the regular time (90 minutes + injury time) of the match. It is similar to the 'to qualify' betting option of other sportsbook.Anyway, OP has taken pretty good risk by placing a bet on Morocco. He said that it is his first bet in his sports event!",

I think they have already gone further than they expected. To bet money that I don't mind losing at all, I would bet on Morocco, as the prize is bigger but I don't think they will win.",

I don't see morocco beating france, remember that france have good players like mbappe who make a big difference in critical moments, and morocco doesn't have a good attack, they managed to win because they have an excellent defense and not they wasted the few opportunities they had, the opponents of morocco were wasting opportunities, in addition to having internal conflicts in the team, portugal for example had noise between ronaldo and the coach of portugal, and the coach put the same 11 players to play, that was obviously it was the same strategy and morocco knew how to take advantage of it, but i doubt they will have the same luck against franceQuote from: Mahirap on December 13, 2022, 11:20:05 AMThis world cup is unpredictable; Morocco is playing very well throughout the world cup. Anything can happen to this match.I don't expect many surprises in this game, to be honest I see Franca winning this game by a difference of 2 goals, I don't see Francia losing in this game, they are a great team and their attack is very effective, even playing against teams strong like england and france did very well, they will not lose in this game against morocco, the odd for france to win this game is @ 1.50, while the odd for morocco to win this game is @ 7.20, honestly , just looking at these odds, I already put France as a clear favorite",
