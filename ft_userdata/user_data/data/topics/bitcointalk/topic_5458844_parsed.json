  "content": "Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has delivered his prediction for the next Bitcoin bull market.In a July 5 “ask me anything” session on Twitter, CZ covered BlackRock's intention to enter the crypto market, updated listeners about ongoing regulatory action against the exchange, and gave his thoughts on the next bull run.CZ explained that the price of Bitcoin has historically moved in four-year bull cycles and his best bet was that this would continue to occur. While he admitted that he couldn’t see the future, Zhao emphasized the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024 and declared 2025 to be the most likely year for the next bull market, stating:    “The year after Bitcoin halving is usually the bull year.“Asked whether he was concerned about BlackRock’s recent entry into the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund arena, CZ welcomed it, saying it is “hugely beneficial” for the crypto industry.Since the firm’s June 15 filing, many have raised concerns that the intention of major TradFi firms stands in direct contrast to the ethos of Bitcoin as a decentralized monetary network. Zhao also brushed off concerns that BlackRock could eat up Binance’s market share in the future, describing the overlap between their respective customer bases as “minimal.”    “Anyone who’s coming into crypto that’s not in crypto today will bring additional people into crypto. Will they compete for any of the existing users with us? Yes, probably a little bit. But to be honest, look at our user base. The overlap is minimal.”Zhao explained that increased institutional interest and Bitcoin’s upcoming halving are the two primary reasons why Binance wants to be “prepared for higher [trading] volumes” over the next eighteen months.Zhao’s comments come just hours after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink praised Bitcoin as an “international asset,” saying that it could be used to hedge against inflation and the devaluation of certain fiat currencies.During the Twitter Space, Zhao was also questioned about the status of regulatory action against his exchange. While he acknowledged that he couldn’t talk specifics, Zhao said that he and Binance are looking for “the most expedient, reasonable and mutually agreeable solution possible.”See NEWS SOURCE",

You're making this discussion more of exchanges discussion because we are less concerned about cz in the context of this.Quote from: MOProgress on July 06, 2023, 10:26:29 AM    “The year after Bitcoin halving is usually the bull year.“ Bullrun occurs normally during or after the halving.Quote from: MOProgress on July 06, 2023, 10:26:29 AMAsked whether he was concerned about BlackRock’s recent entry into the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund arena, CZ welcomed it, saying it is “hugely beneficial” for the crypto industry.Or rather beneficial to people like them who are centralized exchange and Institutions that are after making their own profit by satisfying their clients, spot bitcoin ETF will give them more opportunities for making more offers for their investors and increases their services as well to them, but either of the decision is being beneficial to the bitcoin network.",

People are now aware and learned a good lesson from the past halving events. So my prediction is that Bull Season will start in 2024 but we may see ATH in 2025.",

If you have study bitcoin life cycle,you will notice that history repeats itself in every four years. That is why the advise presently,is to hodli you bitcoin till the next bull run which will be 2025. The halving is April next year and after they halving,we would wait for a little time before the bull run will come. We have had a lot of this discussion so many times. If CZ and Binance doesn't know this then something is wrong somewhere. For this event to take place it is institutes and investors that will be rushing to buy bitcoin making the demand to be higher than this supply and this will skyrocket bitcoin price.",

There's something key that most people are missing from these predictions....that is the relief/recovery before the halving. As you can see across all of the charts, Bitcoin is already recovering before the bull cycle begins. These bull run predictions are all predicting continuations from ATH, not really considering the rise prior.I find it extremely suspicious that large exchange owners are predicting a bull run 6-12 months after the halving. Demand is completely different this time around, I think entering in 2025 would be entering well and truly into the bull cycle...rather than entering before it starting.",

We all know that many institutions have filed for Bitcoin ETF, approval of an ETF takes around 90 days. Which means by October of this year we might see some traction on the existing price of Bitcoin, the condition here is if an ETF is approved by the SEC. Most probably his statement suggest that ETF might get approved and if it does then before halving, Bitcoin might reach to its last ATH and after halving it might create new ATH. All of this sounds like market manipulation, as after hearing his statement a lot of Bitcoin enthusiast would start accumulating Bitcoin. What he might have forgotten that the current global economy situation is not that good. Rather investing in Bitcoin, people would think about saving the money for the future. I won't be suprise if the number of small countries line-up infornt of IMF for lending to help their economic situation. The economically big countries don't need a loan but the rising inflation would stop its citizens from investing money in Bitcoin.",

It shows his faith in trends that he says \"the year after Bitcoin halving is usually the bull year,\" but such predictions are highly speculative and hence fraught with danger.The enthusiasm with which CZ has greeted BlackRock's foray into the bitcoin market is funny. While his words and actions show he views them as a partner rather than a rival, I worry that this might throw off the equilibrium of the market. Given BlackRock's enormous size and influence, his argument that the two companies' client bases overlap just \"minimally\" comes out as foolish.His statement about potential regulatory action against Binance reads like a nervous tightrope dance between cautious optimism and full disclosure. Regulatory obstacles may have a significant impact on the longevity and credibility of a platform.",
