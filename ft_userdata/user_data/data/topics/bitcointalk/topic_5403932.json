Average ATM's in Europe use from 6 to 12%, most found are between 6-8%. But in situations like this people are looking to elimante liquidities in case of buying BTC, so it is covering the fees.",

Alread been through the 'Tube.Yes, look into Bisq.  It's a peer to peer exchange that often has face to face offers in various locations around the United States.  There have been a couple of offers in my area, but I've never taken advantage of them.  Bisq's rates are very fair, and there you can see what margins others are asking.  That will give you a better idea of what the market will bear.Quote from: spectre71 on June 28, 2022, 02:02:32 AMIn my minds eye it's like buy 100oz silver off my neighbor over spot. Who cares? Well maybe someone does. Is BTC considered \"money\" to Jonny law?BTC is considered an asset by the IRS, and like any other asset they don't care if you buy it for more than it's appraised value.  But, they most certainly do care if you sell it for more than you paid for it.  If you do sell for a profit you'll have to pay taxes on the capitol gains.  If you sell an asset for less than you paid for it, you can claim the difference as a loss (deduction,) to reduce your tax burden.",

I my time of exchanging crypto to cash and cash to crypto I seen it all. I traveled whole EU from Croatia to Ireland and what people will do to get money is crazy. Worst was Italy where I was scared for my life  . Only crazy stories here... Most of all there is to much empty negotiations where ppl don't have anything just looking to waste time or just scam you on the end. Be very careful or just do via bank P2P.

      "body": "yeah the laws are much more strict in europe, punishment is much less severe though obviously. Spending and using cash in the US is much much more accepted than it is in europe. Do you think you would be rejected from buying an iphone paying cash in the states? No, you wouldn't, in france you can only pay 900 euros in cash the rest must be card. Stores call the police if someone is trying to spend over a certain threshold all the time as well. Cash carrying limits are far less as well. So in general the rules are more strict. As far as how many people are in jail for unlicensed exchanges, I'm not sure, probably quite a few, just because the one localbitcoin story was public doesn't mean it's not happened over here as well. Regardless 15 percent is an a crazy fee to charge anyone anywhere in the world to convert cash to crypto, if it costs 3-4 in moscow with global sanctions, I think 15 percent in the US is a stretch.",
