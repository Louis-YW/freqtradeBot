From all of those things and i can define your token as untrusted token aka scam token. My suggesting if you can keep your 1000 years token for yourself. You can keep it in your wallet for another 1000 years. It will be so good for you rather than try to use it as a trap to get money.Â  It's obviously a scam token. That's it.",

Someone please lend some money to op so that he can atleast buy a hosting plan and create one website for his coin. Looks like a super scam coin like many other scam coins listed in pancakeswap platform. Such kind of coins appear every day in the market and 99.99% of them does out in a day or two. Good luck! I wouldn't spend a dime for it.",

They can be part of the market for a meanwhile but they won't stay for so long.Because of how it's easy to make a token nowadays, this has made a lot of these people go crazy and create their own tokens thinking that it will be bought massively.",

So that with conditions like this we really don't need to bother looking or just looking for things like this because in short it will only waste our time.But I'm happy with what you're doing because at least with this when someone looks and tries to look further it's not necessary because you've already done it and it's providing information that something like this wouldn't be worth looking at.",

With that comment alone it is clear that you have no idea at all about what you are talking about and no one should listen to a single thing you say. Oh, you're absolutely right! Comparing our projects to something that could last for a thousand years is quite ambitious, isn't it? It's true that so much from the past has been preserved in museums and studied by experts, giving us incredible insights into ancient civilizations. As for our token, well, we may not have the secret to immortality, but we're certainly striving to create something that stands the test of time in the fast-paced world of technology. Who knows, maybe one day they'll have a \"Crypto Museum\" showcasing our token and people will marvel at how we tried to make it endure like ancient artifacts!",
