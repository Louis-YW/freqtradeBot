  "content": "The second-most populous city in South Korea, Busan, on Tuesday agreed to collaborate with the international cryptocurrency exchange FTX to create a digital asset exchange.FactsQuoteFTX will provide technical and infrastructure assistance to Busan city in establishing the digital asset exchange.The Sam Bankman-Fried backed crypto derivatives exchange is also planning to cooperate with the city in promoting various blockchain projects and partner with local universities in providing blockchain-specific education.Amy Wu, Head of Ventures and Gaming at FTX, said that FTX will launch its Korea office in Busan next year, and will help the city become Asia’s digital finance hub, according to a press release by the city administration.The development comes after Binance also announced an MOU with Busan last week for the same purposes.Busan city was designated as a “blockchain regulatory-free zone” in 2020 where developers can bring blockchain-related proposals or projects to the city government that may not be considered elsewhere in the country due to regulations.FTX was recently reported to be in talks to purchase Bithumb, one of South Korea’s top five crypto exchanges.https://forkast.news/headlines/binance-south-korea-busan-city-exchange/https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/26/crypto-exchange-binance-to-help-s-korean-city-of-busan-develop-its-blockchain-industry/https://twitter.com/watcherguru/status/1564884158521810944?s=21&t=Hc5VsO7I1h7t4pY3zIWK2w",

While this is not really exciting if we talk of privacy or anonymity since this is government-owned and so information sharing will certainly be free-flowing with other government agencies, this seems positive in a way because this is like an official stamp which vouches for cryptocurrency's legitimacy. While other places are only regulating and implementing policies on crypto, Busan has brought things to a whole new level by coming up with Busan Digital Asset Exchange.",

In this situation, the card that the city of Busan took out as a solution is the 'Busan Digital Asset Exchange'. The city of Busan, which received the Busan Digital Asset Exchange Advance Information Request (RFI) in May, plans to establish the Busan Digital Asset Exchange by investing a total project cost of KRW 75 billion over five years from this year to 2027.Quote from: Darker45 on August 31, 2022, 09:02:12 AMWhile this is not really exciting if we talk of privacy or anonymity since this is government-owned and so information sharing will certainly be free-flowing with other government agencies,It's worse than that... They're going to rely on third parties to manage it and I wouldn't be surprised to see them capitalize on any opportunity that they could get for selling all kinds of data to others:Quote from: Google translated from http://www.digitaltoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=458234An official said, \"The city of Busan cannot operate the digital asset exchange directly under its management, and it has to designate a consignment institution to operate it on its behalf, but in the process, controversy over preferential treatment is inevitable. Also, it is difficult to see that it is differentiated from existing virtual asset exchanges by looking at the current business structure alone. \", he pointed out.",

I would love to see more of the above and less about the same let's build a city coin and exchange and hope for the best.Quote from: NeuroticFish on August 31, 2022, 05:49:41 PMQuote from: SFR10 on August 31, 2022, 05:23:35 PMSo 5 years and a lot of money ($55M ?) for... basically a subsidiary of FTX in Busan?!It looks to me more a \"business\" of leeching money than doing something productive...As I said I don't get why doing this when they already had other plans in motion with the support of the government:https://www.busan.go.kr/eng/bsnews01/1390496QuoteThe City of Busan expects blockchain applications in tourism, finance, logistics and public safety, with projects led by companies ranging from a bank to FinTech startups. The city is planning to inject 29.9 billion won through 2021 into the 11 specialized districts (110.65 km2) such as Munhyeon Innovation District, Centum Innovation District, and Dongsam Innovation District. Eleven regulations have been lifted for this project.Maybe those have failed and they must show something after 3 years and the only choice was rapidly setting up and exchange?",
