      "body": "Most times is not the cause of the bounty managers but the cause of their clients because when they promised to allocate a huge amount of their tokens to the campaign with some certain amount. Let say project owners decided to give out $50k worth of their tokens using their listing price and when they list lower than it should be then the price will surely drop 50k to either 10k or 15k meanwhile participants already hoped to be paid about 50k worth in dollars.What do you do at this point, they distributes peanuts to the hunters which at the beginning was said to paid some certain amount but leaving them with just $5 after having to spend 4 weeks or 8 weeks of their consistent hard works., That's why you are as a participant you must learn to chose some part of the campaign you wished to enroll instead of wasting your time to participate all. Let say you can get involved with their signature and content creation I think these allocations are mostly higher than the rest.Between, there are some sets of rules given by bounty managers which you have to decide within yourself before joining the campaign, by abiding to those rules you have agreed to accept any changes be it low budget and low payment, the bounty manager doesn't have the Will power to increase allocation in their description all less they write to their clients for increase in allocation due to the significant dropped in their token prices (this is only possible if the rewards are not yet distributed to participants), any rewards that is already sent out can not be requested for increase at any point.However, why not build yourself to participate in btc paid signature campaign and leave bounty since they are not reliable. I won't encourage you to keep doing bounty hunter rather put more efforts in your contribution to enable you enough merits to apply in btc paid signature campaign.I think this question has been before, so if you don't mind I would want you to lock this thread because there are series of topics that relates to bounty hunting and low payment etc.",

      "body": "I would say it's not the fault of a bounty manager it depends on the bounty hunter whether to take on a bounty or not. As we all know, there's no obligation to do so, and nowadays, bounties tend to offer relatively low rewards. In some bounties, they may advertise a substantial amount for distribution, but when the coin is listed, it becomes evident that only a small amount has been received. The budgets mentioned for bounties are often deceptive because, in reality, they don't hold that much value until the listing occurs. However, if you actively participate in activities like article writing, creating YouTube videos, or engaging in signature campaigns, you can hope for a more substantial reward. Otherwise, there's no point in pursuing them and lastly, we can not compare ourselves with the bounty manager as we know our role is different from the BM.",

Another point is important: Bounty hunters read only the first lines. \"Earn a bounty.\" Many people still believe in it. But don't call what hunters do work. And also, do not expect that today there are people participating in such bounties with a single account. Imagine what kind of millionaires the hunters would be if they were paid the promised amounts.What can be said in summary? Many hunters are not sure that they will be paid what they were promised; nevertheless, they participate in groups almost everywhere. Hope for quantity without quality lives to this day.Why blame managers for getting their money because no one forces people to advertise different shitcoins? Give them freedom of choice, and do not defend or pity them. If there are no brains in the head, then they will not appear. Some people just need these lessons.",

Then sometimes they are valuating the bounty in terms of token sale price, yet the presale price is -90%, or fraction that's given away to dump is just too large for markets to handle.And always check how high they are valuating the tokensale in terms of marketcap. It doesn't make any sense to work with something that already has too high marketcap from the start. Value can only drop.Learn what sustainable tokenomics have been in the past and always check tokenomics.Sometimes they are even saying that they pay in ETH, BUSD or USDT, but only if after the sale after they collect the money. Which is a blatant obvious lie to anyone who has been here before.Because:A: bounty managers don't have the escrow money that token sale hasn't raised yet. And we should trust that team would pay if they raised enough money.B: By doing this, team is treating you as a gullible fool. That doesn't give a good sign about the company values or future in general.C: They most likely don't raise enough and you end up working for nothing.And obviously, always choose a reputable bounty manager.",

They have done their job well and provided the best campaign that they have researched. There are many other bounty campaigns that are held by their own project managers. Most of them are social media bounties, videos and articles. But I prefer to write articles because the allocation is bigger and the task is done only once. Compared to having to do social media bounty work that has to be done every day and has a small allocation. Moreover, it will affect the reputation of our account because there is a lot of spam being carried out. The higher the reputation and account level, there will be more decent jobs with commensurate pay, so increase the quality of the account to get work that is worth it.",

I've actually earned good money during the ICO days and that's because that was the hype at that time. I made like let's say $4000 or somewhere higher than that number. But, out of like 20-30 projects that I joined in, only 3 or 4 paid well enough to say bounty hunting is profitable. True, that's there's less work but when you have the feeling that they might not pay makes it stressful and gives you the idea to quit it. The only problem is, that they won't pay unless you finish the soft cap or the hard cap timeline. As of today, I don't join such projects anymore because of that inconsistency in paying up. The good thing is I earned money from my last bounty job which I think was years ago.",

Well its not easy to be a bounty manager even for altcoins or paid in weekly. By doing so, you need some skills and patience and also knowledge herr on forum. For example in signature campaign, how would you check if the participants are well versed or not spamming. Or on social media if they are real or legit users. Many things are needed in order to be at that position. So Im sure they well deserved those.

Heck, even a single person can do so by managing multiple accounts if they really want to. The budget as well depends on the client, but I do agree with most of them giving out low pays since, well, most of them are sht projects, not to mention that a lot of bounties have a sht ton of participants, so even if say a project has an allocation of $1k for bounty hunters, they're mostly paid pennies due to the sheer amount of workforce they hire. Quantity over quality so to speak. There are also instances where they give out tokens as payment, and value it at X price when in reality, it's like half of that, maybe even lower. By the time they reward the token (which is usually at the end of the bounty), the tokens value is close to nothing.",

They'll just post there without any reading whatsoever. How stupid they are.Like you said, these bounty hunters are earning a few bucks only, and they're weeks or even months promoting that project.

Yes participating in bounty campaigns can give you some few bucks, but the question is, is it worth it for them? The amount of time they spent just for a few bucks. One more is that, there's no guarantee that they'll get paid in advertising that project.Make yourself experts, eh? Well, I agree with that.
