  "content": "Hi,As far as i know Unstoppable Wallet is open source. How would it compare to an open source cold wallet like for example Onekey Classic?I know hot wallet, cold wallet. But...in case i would use the hot wallet on an iPhone that has installed only the wallet and have internet connection...would it be possible to get hacked in a way if only that would be the use for it?Or use Onekey on computer or any phone, although it had some vulnerabilities in the past that were fixed, but none the less anything might happen.Which variant would be safer?Thoughts?P.S Thank you!",

Why not sell the iphone and use the money gained from it to buy a hardware wallet? Like Passport which is an airgapped hardware wallet with the use of QR code for making transactions.If you do not use the online device but just for wallet purpose, and you disable all apps not to install anything, and you disabled the app store not to download anything other apps or update anything, and you are not using the online device for file transfer and the likes, this will increase the device security, but it is still online and you can make a little mistake that can lead to loss of your coins.Unstoppable wallet is a bitcoin wallet that supports altcoins, probably you need a bitcoin wallet that is supporting altcoins, Keystone would be the best that I can recommend.",

A vulnerability was found with the wallet this year: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=b8OrakRJmHEhttps://dailyhodl.com/2023/02/12/popular-hardware-crypto-wallet-onekey-hacked-by-security-firm-proving-critical-vulnerability/amp/It  was said to behave been patched: https://cointelegraph.com/news/onekey-says-it-s-fixed-the-flaw-that-got-its-hardware-wallet-hacked-in-1-second/ampAlthough, well known Trezor and the unrecommended Ledger have vulnerabilities and patches in the past, but I am still discouraged about Onekey.Dkbit98 posted that the developers add bugs connected with the hardware's secure element. Quote from: dkbit98 on October 23, 2023, 09:26:17 PMOneKey is biggest hardware wallet manufacturer from China and they are very popular there, but they mostly cloned code from Trezor.From my own experience after talking with them about working together on one project, I can say they are semi-amateurs and liars.I can't seak much about quality of Onekey wallets, but I know they had serious bug connected with secure element, and I wouldn't really use any Onekey device as a main hardware wallet.There are good options available.For bitcoin-only wallet, Passport is still the best, but let us see when upcoming Coldcard and Keystone hardware wallets would be released and see the features they come with.",

Although Unstoppable Wallet is a recommended wallet for storing your coins and it is open source too but this does not mean that it can replace the hardware or cold storage wallet.I haven't use Onekey Classic but I would have never used it only because it has vulnerabilities in the past, although fixed, but why i should be buying a wallet with past vulnerabilities?

You may make an air-gapped Bitcoin wallet on the iPhone that never touched the internet. It can act as a cold storage and believe me it is better than to use Onekey Classic, which has doubts in mind about past vulnerabilities.",

It sounds like you want to make crypto transactions regularly but you don't need mobility, so using a phone is probably not necessary. On the other hand, you mentioned a cold wallet, which doesn't sound like what you described above.AFAIK, just opening and using a wallet on your phone is not going to lose you money. Most hacking cases happen from storing your seeds online, phishing, etc. A wallet hack due to software/server issues like what happened with Atomic is rare iirc, and you should be able to avoid it most of the time as long as you don't use closed-source software.

OneKey Classic can be compared to Trezor or Ledger hardware wallets.Anyways, as I understand this OP seems to have OneKey Classic hardware wallet with him already and he is confused about whether he should continue using it even though the vulnerabilities detected in it in the past or quit OneKey Classic and use only an Unstoppable wallet.",

There will be minor inconveniences, but I'm confident that THAT will save you from doing anything impulsive with your coins.",
