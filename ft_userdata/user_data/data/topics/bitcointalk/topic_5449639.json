  "content": "Did you know that you can purchase almost anything from Japan, pay with Bitcoin, and receive ordered items worldwide?I am not advertising website called Zenmarket but I recently found out they are using CoinGate service that accepts Bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum and other altcoins for payment.They accept fiat payments with cards, wire transfer, paypal, and they have very reasonable fees that looks much cheaper than other alternative proxy buying websites that ship stuff from Japan.I see services working with Zenmarket are Rakuten, Amazon, Y! Auctions, Y! Shopping, Rakuma and Mercari.Bitcoin is deposited to your account and then converted to Japanese Yen - ¥  (¥ 1 =  $0.0075)QuoteIn April 2020, we started accepting Cryptocurrency payments via the CoinGate payment gateway. At this time Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and 45 more virtual and blockchain currencies are available for depositing funds.https://zenmarket.jp/en/payment.aspx#Payment%20methods%20and%20feesAnyone used Zenmarket website with Bitcoin so far and what was your experience? Or there are some better alternative?Code:https://zenmarket.jpSecond website from Japan accepting Bitcoin I found is Shoppinginjapan and they are offering 2% discount for purchasing with Bitcoin:Code:https://www.shoppinginjapan.net/Note that topic is self moderated to avoid spam.",

Many of them are the kind of things other users would sell on AliExpress. For example, I searched for Nintendo Switch and I got results for various switch parts/titles but dubious results for the console itself.",

In fact they are accepting alipay payments as well.I checked some action figures there since its one of my hobbies and known as japan is the main manufacturer of it and looks like they are more expensive than what is selling in my place, maybe of demand in their area vs here. But more cheaper shipping fee than what is sold in amiami website, where i purchase more often.",

Aliexpress junk is available everywhere.Alipay exist because people from China also want high quality stuff Quote from: Rikafip on April 23, 2023, 07:09:11 AMAmazon + any of the crypto debit cards seems like a more elegant solution than this.

There is Amazon Japan included in Zenmarket, but that is just tiny percent of stuff available.You can also bid on Yahoo Japan auctions, and buy anything for much lower prices than on Ebay or Amazon Japan, I can vouch for this.Quote from: Rikafip on April 25, 2023, 07:13:59 AMSince they are using payment processor, they don't even deal with bitcoin and instead CoinGate does that part for them so in the end you pay with bitcoin and Zenmarket gets fiat.

Correct, invoice and prices are listed in Japanese Yens, but there is option to remove all of that and send without any price tags.Anyone who ever worked with people from Japan knows how precise and accurate they are.",

Maybe I'll try to buy it in the future.but first of all, if you already have a buying experience, can you give me some information about shipping cost and delivery time? How long does it take to receive the item you want?Sure I can.There are multiple shipping options available for different regions, and exact fees depend on size of the item/s you ordered.Great thing that you can order several items, they will pack it all in one box, measure size, weight and tell you exact fees you should pay.You can also calculate estimated shipping fees manually using their Shipping Calculator, but don't forget to include Zenmarket fees also. Shiping can be very cheap using AVIA Airmail (Small) if your package weight is less than 2 kg (4.4 lb) with total dimensions are maximum 90 cm (35.4 inch) Length(a) + height(b) + depth(c), and if you don't need express delivery.Slowest delivery is Surface but it's not always the cheapest option, and there is also UPS, FedEx, DHL, EMS and Zen Express.Delivery time depends on your location and can be from few days to few weeks.PSNote that now is Golden Week holiday time in Japan, so many services don't work as usual.",

Aliexpress junk is available everywhere.Alipay exist because people from China also want high quality stuff That's what my first thought was. Alipay often gives me total garbage, while japan regulations and consumer protection make this an interesting choice if i want to buy something exotic and weird clothes and food (all japanese things are weird to me)..Also i love the fact that i can pay ALV in advance. I got trouble when i bought something expensive from etsy and got a message from a delivery company that i need to pay amount that was so high i wasn't prepared for just to get my package to eu or they won't deliver.Thanks for sharing.",
