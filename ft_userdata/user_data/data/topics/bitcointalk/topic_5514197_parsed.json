      "body": "We really can't accurately tell if what they are saying is true. All these may just be regular speculations and blogs that stir up on the internet and I really don't believe most of it since I haven't done my research. Anyways Open source projects are way too important to be forfeited. Infact the true supporters of bitcoin and decentralisation are actually those that donate to open source projects.Take Electrum for example, they literally carry out maintenance and all necessary things that require funds off donations and we discuss every now and then about how important open source projects are especially as wallet softwares. Donating to projects like that is a huge contribution to both bitcoin and decentralisation. Saylor my be against open source projects but I believe there are still core supporters out there keeping these projects running.",

      "body": "Pure BS. I love the image in the upper right about having a client that can sync in under an hour.Any of us can do that. Get a fast enough PC, a fast enough connection, and have access to other nodes that can spit out the data fast enough. Due to the fact that I use it as a bandwidth throttle all the nodes I use are on an older 100mb switch. When I use them to sync other nodes it takes ~13 hours.Which is as fast as a 100mb switch (with some overhead) can spit out 500GB of data. Putting 2 of them on a 1 GB switch gets a new node synced in about 2 hours. It's just people who didn't get in when BTC was cheap and are now upset. OR want some stupid feature added into BTC and nobody has any intention of doing it because what they want is pointless.-Dave",

      "body": "Core can't work with Michael Saylor alone he is not that big. The video MeGold666 shared is awesome I learned new facts but what's bad? if these actors are trying to support Core Devs into creating solutions that are nothing but more centralized and what if the admins were trying to censor the information they can't do that with BTC blockchain and if L2 will work just fine when it will be more centralized then don't use it. Use the BTC blockchain and use this blockchain to inscribe information on it if you guys want to avoid censorship. Create a way of chatting with each other on Blockchain just like we are talking here on this forum so we don't get banned from the admins but sometimes control and monitoring are necessary because there are bad actors want to post bad stuff really bad stuff which can cause extreme bans and restrictions on networks so that will really fail BTC blockchain. PS: I don't care for now if Core works with MS or BR they can't control BTC blockchain but will create solutions that will be more centralized and that's okay we are not losing the option of decentralization.",
