So everyone can easily understand that it was April Fool. So the fun is a little less then last year.QuoteRoyse777: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5447104.0Royse777 The strategy was excellent and very realistic.  Especially the previous topic of Sinbad Mixer was locked and MOVE was written and then the link of the new topic was posted on the old thread it was totally realistic. Seeing this, most of the users got fooled and applied in a hurry. even i am also  QuoteTryNinja: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5248878.0I had no qualms about it.  And I didn't see much user fuss about it.

This year's was not as convincing, but it was one of the most fun.I believe that all users who posted during the day made a good number of attempts. Even though I knew it was all just a joke.Of course, probably a good number of users actually believed it to be true.It was certainly another good bet for Theymos.Quote from: T3PR00T on April 02, 2023, 07:06:41 AMRoyse777: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5447104.0Of the three mentioned, this one was really well crafted.I think all current campaign participants, for a few minutes, wondered if it was true or not. Because the topic was very well constructed, and the \"true\" topic is locked.Many, who understand less how the forum works to this day, certainly fell for this lie, and signed up convinced that it was a legitimate campaign.Without a doubt, Royse777 has outdone itself this year. Will he be able to do better next time?Quote from: T3PR00T on April 02, 2023, 07:06:41 AMTryNinja: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5248878.0I believe that everyone who uses the bot, looked at the notification twice, to understand what was going on.Although it was probably the lie that was most quickly caught, the surprise it generated in the first 30 seconds was interesting.TryNinja was caught because of the HTML code, but this was certainly preparation for future situations, which may come as a surprise.I think that's all three congratulations, it's been a fun day here on the forum.",

Every year theymos came up with a new idea, and it was apparent that he would come up with another thing on the 1st of April. So, it was expected from him. TryNinja tried to fool his bot users in his way. But he messed up with the HTML. I tried to add a little bit by selling Coins. None of them looks successful enough. But, Here, Royse777 Nailed it. Almost everyone got fooled by this prank. Some of us had doubts but did not want to miss the opportunity. So yeah. He got us all. @Royse777, Well Done, my Man!",

It will require me a lot of extra work if you keep posting off topic.I hope you understand.Royse's attempt was actually great but when he didn't respond whether it was April Fool or not and when he mentioned that he held 5 bitcoin in his wallet for campaign and when I checked the rates of Pay Per Post, I was like, definitely it's an April Fool party, on top, on time, so why not to follow party and make it look like a real?Overall, great attempt!Theymos's - This is my first time to see these jokes on this forum, so, I wasn't expecting such surprise from admins. When I wanted to submit post, I was like, wtf is this? Then I checked Meta board and when I read that owner added AI-enhanced CAPTCHA that would identify low-IQ people and it was actually flappy bird game, I was like, oh, gotcha, today is April 1.TryNinja's - Thanks him again for this!

It only shows how I am desperate to join campaigns  , but in terms of effort? He really pulled that off. He's the man, imagine risking his thread and reputation just to pull off pranks like that.

I do not care if he throws me out of his campaign after my reply on this thread as it will only prove his unprofessional attitude.  In reality, you only had to read enough of the applications in the thread referencing April 1st, April Fools and otherwise hoping it's not a joke, to realise there was a good chance it was a joke... All that Hhampuz said was that \"in his opinion\" some things shouldn't be joked about, but the emphasis to me is \"each to their own\".  You could roughly translate this to Hhampuz wouldn't joke about these things, but obviously what other bounty managers do is their own business. Overall this is probably what made it by far the best April Fools joke, as not only did it fool people, it also upset/angered some people  I otherwise don't think you'd be removed from a campaign from Royse777 for expressing your opinion. Furthermore, after all the criticism, Royse has since apologised:Quote from: Royse777 on April 02, 2023, 03:48:06 PMIf anyone felt hurt then please accept my apology.Not even sure an apology is necessary imo. You can't trust anything on this forum on April 1st, it's how it's always been as far as I remember.",
