Note that you can help by going to the page that has the actual lists of companies, and reporting to them if you find any company that is not on their list - https://www.kingdomclaritylabel.com/news/a-comprehensive-list-of-food-companies-and-products-that-use-senomyx.Looks like we are going to have to start growing all our own food in our own back yards to get away from eating dead babies. I wonder if they put Senomyx in chemtrails. Then we'd have to go off planet.Note that the list may be very incomplete. Why? Because companies outside the US have different rules about labeling food.
