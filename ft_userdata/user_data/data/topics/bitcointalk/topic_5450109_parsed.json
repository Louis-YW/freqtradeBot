If a casino can write it boldly on their site that they are not requesting for KYC, but KYC is compulsory according to their terms and conditions, we need to be very careful and know about a casino very well. It is even possible now that a centralized casino can come up and tell people that they are web3 but not web3. Any casino that do not allow his users to connect to personal wallet are not web3. But many casinos nowadays are not web3 but centralized, yet what people are looking for.",

      "body": "A web3 casino must include the most important feature of player's maintaining custody of their bankroll. Meaning, the web3 casino has to connect to a player's wallet rather than settling deposits and withdraws. All bets have to be settled instantly. This provides some challenges for Web3 casinos because of a few reasons. Any blockchain that I consider secure enough to trust writing casino game smart contracts on also have scalability issues. There are some very promising ways to get around this by implementing layer two solutions but that is still in the early phases. The goal is to make Web3 gaming as seamless and user friendly as a traditional online gambling experience with the extra benefits, fairness and security of decentralization, imo.",

Many so-called web3 casino is not really using even the part that they doesn't required user to deposit on their designated address but there are some web3 casino that use the proper web3 that use smart contracts on each bet so that user can play using their wallet.",

I doubt it will happen, unless the dev or owner decides to approach the same step that Satoshi Nakamoto took. I actually percieved it as a more diversed web than what we are used to. It involves different chains and platforms which works under 3.0. So it is indeed like a typical gambling website just covering different chains when it comes on payment and transactions, which on the other hand, makes it modern. No other trait would require an existing online platform to be a web 3.0, other than being a wider network, I guess. Quite self- explanatory but since it involves decentralization and blockchains, its biggest advantage is avoiding taxes on each transaction which could be more beneficial for players especially those who bet huge amount and are winning big time as well. Whether sec and other orgs would allow it or not, for sure there will be this bases for them to balance things out fair for consumers, the law itself, and capitalists or owners of these platforms.",
