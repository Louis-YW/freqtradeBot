You can see the address appear up tp in \"pay to\" in the wallet. But then when I click on \"pay\", down bellow a message box appears saying \"Question\"   \"You can not pay that invoice using Lightning.\" / Then it gives me the option of opening a new channel.     I don't understand what's going on. I thought I was sending Bitcoin, not Lightning. In fact, I can't find (today) even where Lightning functions are located in Cash App. I saw a few weeks ago but can't locate today.",
