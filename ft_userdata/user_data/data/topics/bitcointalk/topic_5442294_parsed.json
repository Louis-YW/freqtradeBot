I can not imagine how the effecfs are big and how long will it last as well as how many tech-companies will be affected by this collapse. It is a second biggest bank collapse in history of the USA.A more serious issue is Janet Yelen told that there are some other banks are under observation now. Nightmare has yet ended and now it is not safely to store your fiat currencies at central banks. Similar to it is very risky to store your cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges after collapse of FTX.",

It is said that various powerful exchangers like coinbase, binance have already withdrawn most of the money from Silvergate accounts and using other banks to keep their business stable. (Why wouldn’t they!)Coming back to the USDC thing, it has got to do nothing with the bust scenario. You can say it will get hampered if the exchangers are hampered in terms of their fiat liquidity. I see no direct relationship between Silvergate and USDC.",

From what I have read was that this depeg issue was because of the unrealized loss. I got confused already with such a term. But that is exactly what I have read on some reliable sites.IIRC, it only accounts for <3% of insured holders and the insured funds' amount could be returned up to $250,000.A few reasons why it got depegged is because there is FUD of Circles reserve area still on Silvergate, and their withdrawal from SVB is stuck. So the market reacts by selling USDC to another token which makes the price reducing. Note that Binance and Coinbase are also pausing the USDC trade to prevent it from going down way deeper.Since FDIC already make it way, there are two possible options that Circle could hope/relies on:Quote from: https://www.circle.com/blog/an-update-on-usdc-and-silicon-valley-bankWhat do we expect with SVB and the FDIC?We have reason to believe that under applicable FDIC policy, transfers initiated prior to a bank entering receivership would have otherwise been processed normally. In other words, the FDIC should allow transactions to settle in the ordinary course through the end of a bank’s standard daily processing cycle until the FDIC takes control of the failed institution. We understand that the FDIC is currently determining the status of transactions initiated prior to the applicable receivership cutoff times, and it is possible that the transfers initiated on Thursday will be processed on Monday.Moreover, SVB has a strong franchise that is at the center of American entrepreneurship and technology industry growth. We are hopeful that the FDIC as receiver will seek a rapid purchase and assumption of a franchise as strong as SVB's to ensure all depositors are made whole.However, it is also possible that SVB may not return 100% and that any return might take some time, as the FDIC issues IOUs (i.e., receivership certificates) and advanced dividends to deposit holders.In such a case, Circle, as required by law under stored-value money transmission regulation, will stand behind USDC and cover any shortfall using corporate resources, involving external capital if necessary.",

But let's see if this mess will be fixed by Circle as it seems that the market is recovering somehow despite how it had made some issues this weekend. I'm remembering that whenever we're on a weekend, something like this should happen and then when the weekend is about to be done, something good is about to happen. Currently, DAI and USDC are at the same price of $0.97. So, a little more cent in decimals, and it'll be tallied and tied again with the price of a US dollar. Basically, when there are depegging that happens, as long as there's a solution from the involved companies, the market is also reacting so fast up to the point that bitcoin can gain a $1k within less than a day or two.",
