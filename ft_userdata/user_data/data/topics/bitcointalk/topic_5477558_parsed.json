It is called review campaign. With it, more people will know more about your gambling site. Campaign manager can also propose to you to begin a signature campaign.",

And how much real money are you expecting to pay for each review and how do you intend to make this payments l? These and many more other questions are what any intending user would want to know.I’m willing to test your platform if we can maintain communication on the thread and I also understand that you’re a newbie and might be limited to the numbers of messages you might want to send that’s why I wanted it been on the thread atleast for now and I think an escrow wouldn’t be a bad idea.Good luck.",

Your account is quite new and I believe it would be foolish step to trust someone new like you. It would be better if you have someone as Escrow as that would be helpful. But, I'm highly interested in doing that job if you get someone reputed as escrow for the thing.",

Well, for me, there is no problem at all to contact you through that but much better to disclose all the links or whatsoever that's needed to go onto the work that you're offering.And the suggestion of oshosondy is also a better way to get those reviews that you need of what you're working with. Also, kindly indicate if this is going to be a paid gig or not because if it's not, you'll probably get few to no interested people in giving feed back to that casino that you're working with.",

Telegram is not a good place to refer people in this forum to, it looks suspicious. If you want to deal with gamblers on telegram, you could advertise your service on various gambling platforms in telegram. The ideal way to attract members from this forum is to present your proposal in an organized manner. Members need to know the crypto casinos they are testing and what are the terms and conditions and the rewards for participants. You could also hire a campaign manager that coordinate these testing services.",

However I think this is just a scheme by OP because I see no reason why the terms of the offer is not properly stated on the OP but rather chose to engage with on telegram which is not appropriate and safe here. We all know that telegram as a platform is very porous and have been the platform for scammers and other nefarious act going on there. Just like others have said, this would have been in a review campaign pattern if OP really wants to be sincere here with the offer because I see no reason why we should contact OP on telegram for such offer when the floor is open for OP to contact a manager or to do a review campaign for openness and transparency.Possibly, there is a hidden agenda to this offer.",
