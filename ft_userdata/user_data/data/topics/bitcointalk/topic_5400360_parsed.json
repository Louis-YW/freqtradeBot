  "content": "When someone has an experienced in something they become aware of it and learn their mistakes, experience is a first attempt which puts you on track for succesful repeat of an action ,experience comes with positive sucess and negative failure at first instance.If you are succesful at the first experience, it becomes a part of you,when taking more attempt ,if you fail at the first experience it makes you learn while you become careful when taking another step noting your mistakes. Experience is the teacher of all, experience gives you edge over all situations. A failed investment in crypto will make you learn and make research & finding before investing in next,you will check how trust worthy the investment his when next.A kid who puts hand in hot water or fire knows it pain and learns his lessons ,when next he sees hot water or fire he flees from it .Failure in first attempt gives you lessons,you become careful when attempting the next.",

Ponzi schemes are destined to fail. Alt coins are very unlikely to make you rich like early adopters of btc got rich, so don't chase them because you will probably lose.  I guess that's enough for now",
