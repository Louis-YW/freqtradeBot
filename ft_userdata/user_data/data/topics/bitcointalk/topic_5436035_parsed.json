      "body": "In my country, maybe it is a country that has a fairly cheap price of staples or daily necessities. because the price of chicken meat here is only 2.5 dollars per Kg. and the price of rice is only 0.7 dollars per Kg. and for vehicle fuel only 0.89 dollars per liter. actually the current price is the price that has increased quite a lot. because last year the prices were even cheaper than this. But still, this is not a matter of whether the price is considered cheap or not. But what should be the benchmark is the purchasing power of the people themselves. Even though prices in a country have experienced a large increase, if it turns out that people's purchasing power remains strong or has not decreased, then it can be said that the country's economy is still on the right track. But in my country now I see that people's purchasing power has decreased. although inflation is not very high. But the effect is that many industries continue to lay off employees or continue to reduce employees. so this year there may be more people who experience job loss.",

      "body": "Cost of living here in the Philippines is pretty cheap compared to other countries, but the salary and wages isn't on par with the price of goods. I live alone, have two jobs and live near the city. What I earn is more than enough for me and some other hobbies that I have. Total budget every month never exceeds $600, and that includes rent, bills, food, and gas for my car. However, the quality of the food I eat is a little compromised; I seldom have any greens on my food because of how crazy expensive they are here. Meat is somewhat cheap, and that is what's usually on the menu. Any other comforts in life, I can afford but choose not to because I'm trying to save and invest in order to retire early.",

      "body": "This place is rough. Essentials like food and utilities have risen in price the most. Many people, especially those in lower socioeconomic brackets (farmers, industrial employees), are finding it difficult to make ends meet. The price of products and services is only part of the problem; many people have lost their jobs or had their hours reduced, so they have less disposable income overall. Do you recall when World Big Company laid off workers and reduced contracts? The worst is being done to our country. Thousands of workers have been banned from the factory. Many, according to the publication, have even tried the water hyacinths growing in the river.  There are a ton of folks who can get plane tickets home for New Year's Eve. They can't leave the city because that's where their jobs are.Not even the government is making an effort to help. They aren't giving out enough money or making enough new employment. The number of terminated workers is not even kept in records. It's as though they have no interest in helping regular people.We count our blessings that we can still feed our families and have the love and support of our friends. It's frustrating to watch so many people in need, but feel helpless to aid them. I've resolved to get involved in community service this year. Many people have it far worse than I do. I'm going to have to extend a hand.",

      "body": "Cost of leaving in my country depends on location and lifestyle. Food items are relatively cheap in rural areas because most farms are located there. Also the cost of housing and other basic needs are relatively cheap in rural areas. The urban area of my country is very expensive due to overpopulation and inadequate basic amenities. But the rural area lacks employment opportunities that might be available in urban areas.Currently our currency have lost so much value and there is a massive rise in the price of goods. Now people have to seek for alternative source of income because a single job might not be able to pay ones bills. The price of fuel have skyrocketed which has led to an increase in the price of other commodities. Mot businesses have closed down leading to high rate of unemployment which has also increased crime. Most families now eat twice or once a day just because our currency have lost so much purchasing power thereby making salaries and wages worthless. But I think with $700 per month, a family of 5 can be able to survive.",

In case it's so, please be more specific about currency because $ mark alone may mislead people.Well, 50 Australia Dollar is 32 Euro. Don't know the price of drumsticks but 1kg chicken breast in Germany costs 10 Euro, drumsticks are usually cheaper, am I right? A loaf of good bread would cost 2.5 Euro probably but it still depends on the bread, usually all of them are very good and it's very cheap here, hard to write down exact price but it would be between 1 euro and 3. Good quality milk costs 1.5-2 Euro and yeah, it's not as cheap as it used to be 3-4 years ago but that's all.And the price of fresh fruit is very hard to say from my side, it's really complicated here, depends on the location, season, market brand, etc.",

But what should be the benchmark is the purchasing power of the people themselves. Yeah but for the purchasing power there is more thing, let's compare the average wage in Australia and Indonesia and see how many kilos of chicken meat or gallons of gas each can afford! Even at 7$ (usd/ not aus) per  per kilo for meat, do you think the average wage is just 1/3 to compensate? It's closer to 10!",

You must have been born with a silver spoon, unless your country has been doing well and making many provisions for its citizens. In my country, the price of goods and gasoline rises on a daily basis, and you can never get a previous price for goods, even if it is not expected to. There is no increase in salary, but there is an increase in goods and basic necessities that man requires for survival.

Target and other retailers offering home delivery appear to aggressively be pushing the option with generous sales.Amazon with its free shipping plan was a good alternative for food shopping, before rising shipping costs were factored into unit pricing. Amazon is still a decent option under some circumstances where local supplies are limited. Although I have noticed that it is now cheaper to buy many food products in stores than on amazon, which bucks the previous trend of amazon being the more affordable seller. Amazon also carries a good supply of freeze dried and dehydrated rations which are suitable for emergency long term storage. It is good to remember dehydrating and freeze drying food products eliminates vitamin C. Good supplementary sources of vitamin c are a necessity for planning purposes.Alternatives to rising fossil fuel prices are more difficult to come by. I would guess more people are resorting to EVs, bicycles, electric scooters, mopeds and alternative travel options which offer better MPG.",

Yes, the cost of living here isn't that much expensive but due to inflation, the cost of goods and services has increased tremendously. So, if a local worker has to earn 571 pesos minimum wage ($10.4/day) that will be not that much for a family man. But for a single person, that would be bare enough that transportation cost has increased too and this is in the metro(center/NCR). But the good thing many companies now are offering a work-from-home setup and most likely from being temporary, they'll implement it as a permanent setup. So, that saves a lot from the transportation and effort and time of a normal worker.I've believed in the way of living that we should be frugal in life and even how hard I do that, you'll still notice how things have changed a lot when in the past few years (pre-covid) things were quite cheap, unlike today. As a family man, you really have to hustle and grind with anything that you can and do as many side hustles as you can, well this is for most countries I guess.",
