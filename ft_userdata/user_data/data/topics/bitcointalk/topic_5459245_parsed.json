And if you keep refreshing the number of posts will only increase as you already have a few posts.May be this is the problem for everyone, I also encountered this problem while doing a few posts. If you post now, then this 1st click post will be done. If you click on the post again and again, many new posts will be made.",

I did observed the glitch but I had to handle with utmost attention in other not to double post  although I am no more experiencing it. For the deleted post or topic, I think OP was not aware of that because the way it happened, no one could detect such error until it is posted before you could spot the glitch. That was the reason many posts, comments and replies duplicated itself. I also noticed that topic was moved, locked and deleted. Maybe that post is against forum policies because I tried opening it it shows It exceeds my limit or topic no longer exists meaning it has been deleted. Maybe the post was reported or something else must have happened.",

The thing na to dey patient and go back to recheck for your message whether you go see am for there, make we dey patient in certain things make we no bring our throat out by ourselves.And incase we see duplicate messages there, na to delete them and leave one instead of leaving everything there. As a full member we should know these things at least. For example self, when you send email, you go fit still check if e don go or not if you are in doubt.",

I checked many other boards, there were no problem. I saw the duplicate posting just on our local board. Did you check any other board at all to confirm if you are right that it happened on some other boards? Never mind my posts, I only thought it is needed because you went against what I posted that 'why is it happening on only Nigeria board'. And yes, the forum got issue which has been the reason. I think everything is working fine now.This also made me to check neighbour boards and I see dat na only our board nai get that issue. And I also noticed one thing be sae, our board e dey active pass almost all di boards I checked. Dat day why do thing happened well well for our board more be sae, people dey post and di website go come dey verify cloudflare and upon dat verification process im now e don submit and u, u know know come dey submit am again di same thing again so the post now come dey duplicate. E happen to me a brother pm to delete am and did sharply.",

Did you check any other board at all to confirm if you are right that it happened on some other boards? The forum have been having network challenge for the past 3 days now, and I think that's what might have resulted to that duplicate posting, as the O.P of those thread may have think his thread hasn't been published, and kept on trying again & again, not knowing actually it's been published, because it happened to me within that period & I'm sure lots of persons experience that same issue. So what I think the O.P of those thread should have done is report it to be deleted and not moved to a different board, as it wasn't intentional but a mistake that happen most times, because if you could check the time difference between that thread, you will notice it's not much.",

Could it be the problem he was encountering was different from the one others were facing? Although everything has been moving perfectly again.It was the same problem, but he kept repeating it. I mean he did not know the posts are submitted successfully already but keep pressing on 'post', thinking that it did not submit. The main issue is that he moved the topic to archival. If the topics were not moved to archival, all would have been deleted. Even this thread's topic was created like four times too, but it was easy to report it and deleted, making it to remain just one. I do not think a moderator moved the topics, but likely the the OP.",
