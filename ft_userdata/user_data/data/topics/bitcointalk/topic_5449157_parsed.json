  "content": "Here is a collection of anti-Circcash comments that I have received. Since I do not want to rehash any old comments, I will stick to new anti-Circcash comments. I will be giving a response to many of these comments. Circcash is the only cryptocurrency with a mining algorithm that is designed to advance science. Circcash mining accelerates the development of reversible computing technologies. And reversible computers are the computers of the future. They will be much more powerful than any irreversible computers. The only way to improve our computational hardware is with reversible computation.Unfortunately, people do not use Circcash because they would rather waste energy and resources than make an effort at solving the most important scientific problem because people are generally completely senseless. People would rather hate Circcash and make themselves look like complete and total fools! People also hate Circcash because they are exceedingly nasty and relentlessly sociopathic.marracc â€” 03/12/2023 5:52 AM Is anyone having any connections with the network, or it is dead?-No. Circcash is not dead. You are just too inept to understand that Circcash mining solves the most important scientific problem. And you are too arrogant to admit that you do not understand this. With your arrogance, you will remain unable to learn anything!digaran-\"Definitely AI overlords should keep you around, otherwise who is gonna make them some dead coins? Oh I almost forgot, do these AI overlords need any blockchain to keep records of biolabs? I guess if there are no humans around, there will be no need for a certain dead coin to be used as a recording/ solving problems, right?ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¤£\"-The real reason why people do not invest in Circcash is because they are too fucking stupid to understand it because they are worthless pieces of shit. That is the only reason. Oh. And you hate bio-safety and bio-security because you yourself are a worthless piece of shit who simply wants people to die. Fuck you. You are trash!",
