It's feel-good nonsense that we all like hearing and repeating to each other, but it's an objectively bad theory of human capability.",

There is no limit for human achievement but there is limit in human life. You can achieve every thing you want in the world but when you die, everything is gone. That is why the Holy book (Bible) says, vanity upon vanity, all is vanity. And also human beings in sometime limit themselves because of the fear of the unknown. They don't know what will happen to them if they took the action or the journey, so with that fear, they give up their mind to embark on the action or life journey.",

We can achieve or get to greater height in whatever we are doing we must think positively in wherever we are doing, we need to be hardworking,stay focus,have confidence in ourselves,consistence and self determination.  Without knowing all these we will be giving limits to ourselves thinking we can not achieve or get to a great height in achieving our goals. Sometimes we have negative thoughts about our goal these affects and discourage  our victory in life.",

Not everyone set limit for themselves. Therefore, your opening paragraph or clause should be paraphrase. It is only fear making people to make such statement that they can not go to the place. But those who are brave enough and have courageous mind always face the challenges ahead. I still oppose your phrase \"us\", you can not use us when we have different character and nature of thinking and doing things. In life, you can only change your life when face challenges and the only person that can change your life God. Because even your are brave and courageous without God you won't achieve anything. That is your life is useless. Your victory can also free some people that are in bondage to achieve their goals. Therefore, you have to work yourself out from myopic thinking of the mind. Miracle? According to the Holy Bible, faith without work is dead. What does that mean. It means when you faith on something to come to pass, you have to work for it because if you stay in one place, that change you are talking Wil not come to pass. Yes everyone has thought. That is, what you think in life that is how you become in life. That is why when you think about it put it into action.",

This is the ultimate self-victory.I agree with you that when you're freed from desire is the ultimate self-victory but that would mean nobody can attain self victory. My reason been that no matter the level one has attained in life he/she would always have desire(s). It doesn't matter if you are a president, billionaire, monk, preacher, father, mother, business tycoon etc. The desires don't have to be material desires. It could be a desire to grow old, find love, serve your country, help the poor. I believe every human being on earth would always have desires as far as they're alive.",

I am older then many here. 65 to be exact.Years ago I pushed hard to improve and be better.So I stopped gambling. 1990I quit all illegal drugs. 1991I quit tabbaco.1996I found out doing all of the above was good but in 2018 I found out I have diabetes so I now need to eat keto from now on.Dropped my A1c from 12.1 to 6.5Reallity is as a human you have been presented with a time game. Ie your life.whether you will get 1 day or 125 years you simply do not know.You get to make choices about what to do with your time.Self victory is not a big goal for me. Making my life with my wife and my friends nicer is more important to me.",
