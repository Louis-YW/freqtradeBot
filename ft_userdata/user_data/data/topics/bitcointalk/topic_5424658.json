I believe as the CEO there are lots of information he is privy of so therefore, as a cooperate organization he can not be the only one who has access to such details. Maybe he co-executive would definitely be aware of the safe where those details are kept so they could have access to them. In a situation where the chief executive officer is not available or in the case of death, the next inline of hierarchy should be able to know where valuable information as regards the organization are stored for safe keeping. It is a coperate body so his demise should not affect the running of the organization. What I will just say is that there is no way he could have stored information belonging to the organization without any body having being authorised to get the details or access it upon any occurrence of death or otherwise. Investors and traders should not be worried till there's an official statement from the organization. The statement would determine the next line of action.",

There are CEOs, COOs, Financial managers, and more. So this is not a one-man show; don't worry, their clients will stay safe.That is right. No one in a organisation should try or must keep an information to oneself, especially if such data is crucial to the whole company and to its customers. Given this case, the death of the CEO of Amber group would not really cause inaccessibility of storage or halt operations since there are members of the company that are very much equipped and reliable to keep things continue flowing.",

He should have a treasury wallet to store the capital for their customers.Years ago, a CEO of one exchange suddenly passed away and it made a lot of noise about risk of centralized control of all capital of one company. After that, we see more changes from single-sign wallet to multi-sign wallet. With multi-sign wallets, there is less risk that capital will be compromised if one signer lost access to his wallet. There is less risk to completely lose access to capital because if there are enough co-signers, they will be able to sign transactions and move capital.Of course it again reminds us that \"Not your keys, not your coins\"",

This is a problem which could very well be avoided. But since we have the penchant to have what is supposed to be a solution to third parties kept by third parties, we're now wondering about the certainty of our money because somebody else died while asleep.",

But if they're a company, for sure there's always the back up and most likely it's a multi-sig. The CEO and his other company executives have talked the importance of having a back up and how they shall keep the private keys stored in a safe vault.This makes me remember the quadrigacx's ceo presumed death.",

Quote from: Darker45 on December 01, 2022, 03:52:33 AMI don't think the structure of the company is such that the private keys of their funds in cold storage is solely under the control of their CEO. The company probably has a multisig wallet for their funds. It's basic safety and security protocol for those who are holding big amounts on behalf of a company.It might be but recent events have shown us that almost all of those investment, financial advice, and so on crypto companies have literally zero funds in their won custody and all their clients funds are stuck either with big exchanges or other crypto lenders of CeFi platforms, as history has shown us.And from their main page:QuoteDo more with your portfolioBuilt with features including daily interest payout, clients can easily trade in over 100 assets at competitive prices. Clients also enjoy collateral flexibility, allowing margin trading strategies with custom loan tenors.Where have I seen this before? At this point, I really don't get why some still choose to risk 1005 of their coins for some 3-5% returns in a year with companies that have no physical presence in their country, that have no real assets, no insurance, just a 100sqm office which tomorrow is on the renting market and everyone and everything is gone.https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/startups/crypto-trading-firm-amber-seeks-us100m-fresh-funding-flat-valuationQuoteDigital asset trading platform Amber Group is in the process of raising a little over US$100 million in fresh funding at a US$3 billion valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Singapore-based startup had the same valuation in its most recent US$200 million fundraise in February, which included Temasek Holdings and Tiger Global Management as investors. The new raise is being completed in multiple parts, with around half of the US$100 million already secured, according to the person. The company plans to have either one or two more additional closings by the end of this year or in early 2023.Like other crypto and tech companies, Amber Group has conducted major layoffs. The company cut as much as 10 per cent of its staff, Bloomberg News reported in September. During last year's crypto bull run, the company grew rapidly to around 900 employees, from a team of 200 to 300.3 billion company, cutting jobs, seeking 100 million in funds, and not managing to get more than half, what could possible go wrong?",

You imagine CZ holds ALL coins of binance? Of course not.
