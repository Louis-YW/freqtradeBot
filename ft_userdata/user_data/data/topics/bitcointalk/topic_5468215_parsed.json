This is what crypto does to you kids.Somebody still joking on the twitter community that he's making twitter fun again and I think this will expose what was really the truth or it's just Ben making some drama again. I hope he goes to his senses, he's already a father and he shouldn't shame his kids like this. Well, he knows he will be arrested considering he pre-announce it before he goes on that area afaik.",

This is what crypto does to you kids.It looks like the charges for his arrest were not so serious since he's apparently out and tweeted about the incident on Twitter. I have seen a tweet a week ago where he claimed to be broke but CZ refuted those claims that he still had assets on Binance which they can confirm he still has access to.I personally believe he is doing all of these to chase clout which is why he may be artificially creating incidents that could get on the media.  He hasn't hit his low yet, until then, he is liquid. A more serious case would be a charge against him for the BEN tokens that were sold to community users recently.",
