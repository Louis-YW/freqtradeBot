Drivechain 5. Statechains 6. Omni Layer 7. Stacks ProtocolYou need to check their own websites to know which wallets are compatible with the network, for Rootstock you can it here https://dev.rootstock.io/develop/wallet/use/Quote from: _act_ on December 30, 2023, 10:18:42 AMI also want to ask if those pegged coins are side chains or not?You meant like rBTC in Rootstock, L-BTC in Liquid Network? yeah each network has it's own dedicated pegged token.",

What are bitcoin sidechain like Rootstock and what wallet can I used to store them?I also want to ask if those pegged coins are side chains or not?Sidechains are blockchains being connected to another blockchain which is the main blockchain to relate information and data for the benefit of users using their various networks, there's a further reference to this where you can read more and learn about them https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/what-are-sidechains/ them, their functions and what they constitute, i think there's something indeed more interesting about the use of some of these sidechains than we know already, which may help ease the challenge in transaction fee using the bitcoin network.",

      "body": "bitcoin never leave the bitcoin network.. you instead lock value up (in most cases with a custodian/subnetwork middleman) and then play with their balance/token at cheaper rates, with the hope that you can move out of their system and reclaim the locked fundsin many cases it takes atleast 2 bitcoin fee's (to enter and leave) the other systems. so they are not useful to just lock, use once, and exit.. their propositions is to lock funds up and stay within their systems long term with less likelihood of exiting before you have spent your value towards them.. in short they will most likely only want to close their account/channel once you have spent all your value within their system, so they can collect on all the IOU you owe them",

So that just in case they have an emergency, they will not be affected by the transaction fee. Right now, it's really not funny.",

Right now, it's really not funny.asic miners do not select transactions.. they make no demands. they just get given whatever share of rewards a POOL decidespools also dont have unanimous control of fee's it is infact some default relay/increment, bump and dust fee settings for core (99.9% of network) that make it a hostile environment for competing transactions to even get into nodes mempools before a pool then collates transactionsthings have changed in core settings where by fee-bumps are not incrementing at 100sat/kb(0.1sat per byte) nor 1000sat/kb(1sat per byte).. but instead 5000sat per kb(5sat per byte)other things like the cludgy miscounting of bytes where legacy pays more then segwit which pays more than taproot even if all 3 had similar REAL bytes",
