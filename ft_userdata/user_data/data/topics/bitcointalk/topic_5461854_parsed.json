  "content": "What is gun control, really? Well, it isn't making more laws against guns. Rather, it is teaching people how to use guns better so that they have more gun control! McConaughey doesn't seem to realize that better than 95% of the people don't want to be attacked by people using guns. How do you stop the bad ones? Teach the good ones gun control so that they can stop the bad ones... or make the bad ones so fearful that they don't use their guns to do bad.McConaughey gets it. He understands that if you want to be popular with the Deep State, you have to do the things they do and say the things they say.Matthew McConaughey Wants To Change The Term 'Gun Control' To Pass More Gun Controlhttps://www.dailywire.com/news/matthew-mcconaughey-wants-to-change-the-term-gun-control-to-pass-more-gun-controlMcConaughey, who was vocal in advocating for change after the Uvalde, Texas, shooting, made the remarks during an interview on ABC News' \"This Week\" with Jonathan Karl.McConaughey announced his new Green Lights Grant Initiative that he founded with his wife Camilla to help schools access federal grant money for safety and security.He said that despite Congress passing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) last year, which approved funding for mental health services and school security in response to the Uvalde shooting, the money has not gone out to the schools.He said that 12 schools in the area had applied for the funding but none had received it.\"What are we doing?\" McConaughey said. \"That's a zero percent success rate.

You got 14,000 something schools,\" he continued. \"This grant initiative is going to connect those districts to those billions of dollars that's there, available, and wants to be used to make our kids safe.\"McConaughey said that the reason that more gun control has not been implemented after tragedies was because of the way that the debate was being framed....",

I recall as a kid seeing celebrities being hired to push agendas like water conservation or helping the homeless. Iâ€™m not sure when it got to be so partisan with them hiring celebrities to push the political agendas of a single party.",

Still, real gun control is teaching average people how to use guns properly so they can be better shooters. More gun control is more people using guns the right way.",
