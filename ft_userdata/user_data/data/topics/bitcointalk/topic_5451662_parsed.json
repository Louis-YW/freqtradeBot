Indicator tend to be help with your trade but some it cannot guarantee that the indicator is 100% always right there is always false alarm on indicator and it happen all the time I mean you can try it and backtest it first and see how it goes. and if this really blew your mind do trade it and good luck",

You know there is no such thing as perfect trading whether it is crypto or stocks market. Everything always depends on our understanding that whether we will make money or not in trading. In addition to that, most of the content creators who do such things are not accurate in what they say, as long as they only have one goal that's why they made that kind of content and that's just for the views to get profit.That's why it's better for us to understand what we're doing in actual trading here in cryptocurrency than to rely on what others say that we think that's what will happen if we follow what they say then in the end we'll just fail.",

The first is small-sample error and the second is confusing correlation with causality. in every noise you can see some patterns, but this does not mean that they are permanent,and will be repeated in the future and mean something more than fortune-telling from tea leaves or fingerprints and that's what we see here. In my opinion, there is no regularity here, only a temporary correlation, if at all.CME volumens are too low compared to large crypto exchanges to matter.",

I watched the whole video and I must say that the indicator promises some good winning trades. But, still I would definitely say that this indicator is not 100% a workable charm for Bitcoin if that is the case than anyone who may use this indicator will become rich in a year.It certainly is a good video about a promising indicator but it has flaws and one of them is constant bull market. This indicator might only work when the market is stable but when bull market has high intensity than no indicator can promise winning trades all the time.I also found that the guy is claiming that he's the one who discovered this indicator and that might be true but still I can't trust such claims as no one can prove that he/she is the only one who knows the working state of the indicator and not others.",

If it was really that effective and really that precise, do you really think that you could confidently be telling the public about it? You should really be baring up into your mind that there's no such thing about precise strategies or ways on taking advantage or making yourself that constant or sure profits on dealing up with this market. You are the ones who would really be making some mix up for you to be able to find outon what kind of strategy would really fit you in. Trading strategies could really differ considering that there are lots of tools and other ways which you could really make use to.If the thing or strategy that you have seen on youtube does work or you do find it really that precise then why not use it? Sooner or later you would be able to realize thatthis isnt how the reality works. It might blew up your mind but it would really be just temporary because once do reality do kicks in and extremevolatile and total random movement then for sure no strategies would really be able to give out good predictions or patterns.",

Are you trying to get views from the forum by giving a clickbait title? I see this as advertising. While you wrote you found a trading strategy that blew your mind, You are supposed to explain the pStrategyocss and why you think it will work for everyone. Moreover, you are supposed to explain why it blew your mind. I don't trade every day, but the title of your topic attracted me to click on the topic link. However, I am disappointed. This is like a marketing strategy. That's how news portals get traffic from social media. About Strategy, I don't think a single strategy can work for everyone. Also, A Strategy doesn't work every time. It depends on the market situation and the amount too. So, I won't suggest anyone apply any strategy shown by someone. Make your own Strategy and make a trade with responsibility. Don't be overconfident, thinking this strategy will work 100% for you. This is how many new traders liquidate their money on trading platforms. They think this strategy worked for someone and might also work for me. But this is not how it works.",

If you believe that the strategy you acquired through the mentorship program is always effective, you are mistaken. Because if it worked, all traders would be profitable. Market-makers are constantly pursuing our stop loss in order to make money, thus we can assume that if they knew how our approach worked, our stop loss would be hit most of the time. You must adjust that strat by simply waiting for manipulation to occur before entering a trade, which is not easy because the manipulation is not always obvious.",

There are so trading strategies that would be working fine with better accuracy but with time it will fade out especially when there are lots of traders that is using that same strategy. It is better for us to develop our own strategy from other people's strategy and amend it in a ways that will work for us very fine. This is why is it good for us to have prior understanding another the market and also on different strategies so we can work out our own strategy from the various ones we have used. Trading is more of understanding and experienced than just acquiring only the knowledge. We need to explore the market as a trader so we can get the best from the market.",

No accurate strategy will use since not every strategies made will last long since market drastically change. Maybe it blow up your mind because this new to your knowledge but soon once you use it and find out that it will never work in long term you will find another strategy that might possibly work again. But also at least you do a good job their researching on those things since for sure you can learn a lot more once you are consistent on your trades.",

One of the biggest mistakes by many trader is to rely on a lagging or repainting indicator to determine price direction from the content in the video it look like a smooth ride to making profits due to the fact the price was trending bullishly while the CME premium seem to comply with the trend and adjusted to a minor retracement of the price, which will definitely work in any price trending condition, however when the price begin to range that is when the indicator tend to fail, of course live trading will reveal alots about the inaccuracy or inadequacy of the indicator, however I think traders should rely more with their brain i.e mental decision with lesser reliance on indicators when taking a trading decision.",

That can be a good one but due to the volatility of the market, you cannot fully rely on that strategy and you must know how to change it and adopt the current trend because in trading, you must know when to use your strategy. There are times that your strategy is not fit for a specific crypto, and that is the time for you to analyze again and use necessary indicators so you can know when to buy and sell.",
