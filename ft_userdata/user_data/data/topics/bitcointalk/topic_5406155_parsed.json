From the link, I saw these useful information that will point more to the question you asked:QuoteChoice matters. Bettors expect a wide range of options for making deposits and withdrawals. Some of the options bettors want aren’t even available in the US today. Experience is everything. Slow deposits and withdrawals are hurting the player experience. The research indicated that the withdrawal process was 10% more painful than depositing. This is probably not surprising given the checks and balances that go into the withdrawal process. However, the research showed that with minor improvements, this process can be sped up significantly. The biggest issue for players was the length of withdrawal time.Information privacy. This is an area where the difference between frequent and casual really stood out. Casual bettors in particular were wary of sharing additional financial information to sign up. There’s an expectation around privacy and anonymity, to protect personal information.Preferences. Different bettors have different preferences, particularly frequent vs casual bettors. There is a need for operators to meet the expectations of both early adopters and casual bettors as the industry matures. It’s imperative for operators to retain players they work hard to attract to the site, given the incredible cost of acquisition per player operators spend. Many operators in the US are finding current acquisition costs unsustainable, $1,000+ per player. About choice, cryptocurrency can be of importance because it is easy and faster to deposit and withdraw with bitcoin, tether or any other cryptocurrency.What I experienced was slow withdrawal. When I was using fiat to gamble, I use bet365, which I think is not a US company, on the site, deposit is within few seconds but withdrawal takes 7 days or more for wire transfer or so, the only withdrawal option for me.About privacy, I always think that gambling sites which are centralized will still not have any option than to request for KYC as they are becoming common and known to the government of the country that they are.",

      "body": "A wide range of payment options is always important to any business that relies on money spending. It's the same with online stores and food delivery companies. They must have the variety of options to pay as sometimes there will be a problem with one so they must have an alternative. Last month I experienced this kind of problem in a MMO game where I am trying to buy something using my debit card but it won't be accepted by their system even when I tried 10 times. I tried another card which belongs to my wife and it all went smoothly. A player/gambler must always have his option to pick not just for their privacy but also for convenience.",

It would make sense that the freedom of having more options where their money goes does seem to give people a certain reassurance that their money will not be stuck in some endless loop of broken systems and maintenance on said broken systems.But that does really make you question the very point of having a crypto gambling casino in the first place. And furthermore with more choices for withdrawal and or deposits, the casinos have more regulations that they have to watch out for. Especially since it moves away from crypto towards fiat. (Which is a step backwards if you ask me)People need the feeling of reassurance. I wonder if that can be achieved some other way.",

I read the topic for more than 3 times before I understand the subject. Then coming to the content of the article. As for me it is very bad for the company not to reorganize new signed up users in the site until they made a deposit. That is bad. Although it might be good for some people with their personal reasons. As for me. As a system they have to reorganize all registered users both active and inactive. With that they would sort out the once that are active that are causing the traffic on the site, then the once that are not active, then encourage them to participate in their games, because as a casino the total number of users needed are unlimited. Because it is a business firm. Like I am not participating in some of the gambling sites I registered but they still reorganize me as their customer and they send me messages to participate. There was casino company that even sent me $1 bonus to participate and I did and won $4.",

On the one hand, flexible options for withdrawing funds are a plus (for obvious reasons), on the other hand, this may have disadvantages. For example, I am completely satisfied with one option - cryptocurrencies. If I see such options as PayPal, bank transfer and so on, then I am 100% sure that this casino will have a tougher KYC (which I am not completely satisfied with). Everything is very simple here - if the casino has so many options and does not have a hard KYC, then a lot of abusers will appear who will use the platform as a mixer for laundering dirty money. Therefore, we see another confirmation of the fact that the pluses inevitably entail certain minuses.",

But we also have to look at another big disadvantage that when the casino only accepts cryptocurrencies as a deposit it will hardly be able to find the owners of the casino if one day they disappear with all people's money, while if the casino accepts bank deposits then it will be easy to trace the owner of the casino if one day he runs off with people's money",

So whenever there is something free, or even small bonuses, there are always a lot of people who want to take advantage of freebies. That's why almost all betting sites or online casinos offer freebets or deposit bonuses. I think this is the best marketing to attract new users. And what currency a gambler uses probably doesn't matter when there is a wide choice of currencies and it's easy to convert.",

No Paypal or similar services aren't an option for me, because they have abusive taxes in counterpart. But what will really encourage me to deposit are the promotions and benefits the platform offer to customers.An interesting feature I've seen at a local popular online fiat casino that could be adopted by crypto casinos as well, is to reward gamblers with free spins at slots machine every new level they reach with their accounts. It's similar to VIP program, but with more levels, so the more you bet, more levels you increase and more free spins you collect.",

Super important, that is the first thing to be considered, More withdrawal options sends the message that a gambling site is willing and committed to paying, should a user win. Users need and consider having options very important and would easily trust a site with multiple withdrawal options better than a site with just one or two withdrawal options. IMO, I think it is normal for a gambling company with more withdrawal option to have more users, considering that not all payment options work everywhere, and more payment options means you can accommodate users from different regions with different withdrawal systems.",

One really useful piece of psychology that many casinos research and try to improve is reducing the amount of clicks it takes for a player to be able to place a bet. All the way through from depositing to placing an actual amount into play, if they can reduce any friction along the way it helps the player \"get into the action\" and potentially forget about slowing down. Ease of use, feeling confident that the bookmaker is secure in all aspects and that winning bets will be paid out promptly can also contribute greatly to the user feeling comfortable. Familiarity is another key one, people tend to stick with one casino or sportbook if they find it gives consistently good odds.",

Some form of crypto pegged to gold and precious metals could also be a good format.
