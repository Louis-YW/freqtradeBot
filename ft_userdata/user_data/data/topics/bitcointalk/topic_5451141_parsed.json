Even the local currency of some countries in this world has existed for decades now, does that mean that those pieces of paper money have not been used to commit a lot of crime in the past and even now? , Of course it has, so basically, Bitcoin is not limited to being used for such acts. I'm not saying Bitcoin should be used to carry out any illegal acts, but some people claim that the reason those activities are steadily going on through the Bitcoin technology is because the system is thoroughly decentralized, and my question still remains: has money that is centralized been managed by the government to the extent that it's no longer being used to hide criminal funds? Whether with Bitcoin or no Bitcoin, crypto or no crypto, all these illegal activities with money will still continue.",

Aren't those activities incomparable to what's always been said to bitcoin as it's always crucified with those negative associations that we're always hearing of?",

Why do you care?Just as you have said, Bitcoin has a big impact on internet users, and as such, it's contributing positively to the lives of people who have a positive mindset regarding how it's being used, but it also has a negative impact on those who have a negative mindset towards it.People talk about Bitcoin as if it's the origin of some sort of criminal activity out there; they always want to blame Bitcoin for every bad thing that happens when Bitcoin is being used as a means of payment, forgetting the fact that before the existence and general acceptance of Bitcoin, all these crimes had already existed, including criminal activities of any kind where payment was being made using either an untraceable bank wire transfer or cash, or in whatever way was made possible.My take on the issue is that Bitcoin is not the problem; the people who are using Bitcoin to finance their terrorist activities, and all kinds of illegal activities are, should be the ones to be tackled because even if Bitcoin transactions are stopped today (impossible), those crimes won't stop; they will still continue. Those criminals are not being sponsored by Bitcoin. Anything that can be accepted as a medium of payment can be used to finance any sort of criminal activity.",

This question is just ridiculous and biased.Just like USD or any other currency are used to fund illegal activities. The problem is not with the currency, but with the people which decide to support illegal activities. Go punish those people, no matter which currency they are using.This is not a bitcoin problem.",

I don't care how old is bitcoin or what activity it was used for but I believe the impact alone to the world is something unquantifiable compared to what they are using it for.Illegal activities are also involved with fiat, have you thought of when there was no bitcoin what were those criminal or kidnappers do demand as a ransom?Was it not same fiat money or is there anything else they demand? Even people loots physical cash and embissled funds yet you didn't mentioned those ones all you could do is to outline the bad effects of bitcoin.",

I bet if we compare BTC to FIAT, we'll find out that BTC is only responsible for a tiny part of all crimes. So what now? Ban FIAT? Drug dealers, hookers, child p*rn lovers, arms trade tycoons - all of them are using FIAT and I bet most of them don't even know how to use Bitcoin. The issue is not the technology, people are the real issue. As long as there will be criminals, BTC will be used along with other currencies.",

No matter how bitcoin criticism will be with all this that are mention, it will not pull bitcoin down because if bitcoin is not existing all the vices still exist and how is the funding for them? Or how is drug barron that existed hundred years ago paying workers to traffic drugs for the them and cartels? they are doing that payment with fiat and local cash when bitcoin never created. You don't need to curb anything.This is only what they say to attack bitcoin using because of mixer but bitcoin is decentralized digital currency that is unstoppable.",

It's your body, your health, and there should be no state intervening and enforcing what is seemingly good for you. I'm against them as substances, but I'm in favor of having the right to consume them. Now as for the bad activity. I don't want criminals, but I want that less than I want a completely freedom preserving, privacy respecting, peer-to-peer monetary network. It's really that simple. If you leave it free, it will be used by anyone, including criminals. There's no way to exclude criminals without excluding the freedom part which is what makes it valuable in the first place.",

Education. But the lack of it makes the same with fiat. Actually, the same problem is multiple times bigger in fiat than in Bitcoin.There are billions and billions of fiat circulating in the sahddy business of rugs, weaponry, and even worse in economic and financial world, where all kinds of people, mostly business men and polititians are ruling the schemes /scams. So, that concern in Bitcoin is a minor problem when compared to what is happening in fiat world, my friend.And another point in favour of Bitcoin is that if the whole world would adopt Bitcoin, many of those shaddy fuckers wouldn't be able to scam the other 99% of the people!",

I also agree with part of what you said. But at some point, my feelings are quite mixed.What you say is true, about the freedom and about the right to do with your own body and health.Problem is when the bad things happens to people you love because of those criminals. I have childs and I'm not confortable to simply let the Evolution Theory take them from me just like that. So, yeah, it's a mixed feeling I have about this! Because in the end, criminals will take over people that don't have weapons or are not agressive and cannot cope with the decaying society, if it comes down to that!",

These issues are not new and it is not because of bitcoins that these illegal activities have thrived. The people behind these will always seek ways to make sure that they keep their business going away from the government. With or without bitcoins, they will find a way. Abuse of the privileges of bitcoin is not something that can be controlled considering that abuse is something that is inevitable. As there are people who seek for the positive sides and usage of things, there are people who are always seeking for ways to exploit and use new technology or innovations negatively.",

This entire subject is moot and pointless.Bitcoin is way more traceable than normal paper money. Cash aka fiat is the ultimate way to keep your illegal activities hidden from public sight. On the other hand, Bitcoin is based on a public ledger that anyone can take a look at. The transactions of Bitcoin can be followed to their origin, and if that origin has a exchange account with KYC or even his real IP, then the government can easily find the person behind those illegal transactions. If the government wanted to curb criminal activity, they would implement Bitcoin in the place of fiat.",
