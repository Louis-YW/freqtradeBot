  "content": "“On the planet known as Nowhere, all creatures are chained under the centralized society. The people lived under slavery; no freedom of speech, and no individualism. Everyone gradually loses their will, living their lives like the walking dead. But on a completely ordinary day, an “uninvited guest” suddenly arrives and Nowhere ushered its historic reform. KNOWKNOW, male, age unknown, lives in the Web 3.0 dimension. He is always full of energy, playful, and enthusiastic. Often shuttles around different dimensions and universes as adventures through the wormhole. After this bizarre creature’s arrival, people soon notice his uniqueness and are attracted to his characteristics and quirky behaviors, they start to wake up and fight for their own good, and Knowbody becomes the given name for all of these people, with the lead of KNOWKNOW, the forgotten liberty arouses…”To build the complete KNOWHERE ecosystem, KNOWHERE Labs created the first original NFT Collection — Knowbody. In short, Knowbody is an image Knowhere Labs created to represent the young generation with a rebellious spirit and independent thinking ability. The team hopes to use this image to attract more talented creators and artists, and to build an iconic web3.0 community in the future.Knowbody is the genesis NFT collection design by Knowhere Labs, and users can use it in the Knowhere metaverse as a second identity. Knowbody plays a key role in the whole ecosystem, and each Knowbody will be a unique, quality-focused, high-end avatar for our community. There are a total of 4 phases of Knowbody NFT sale. It will launch the first round of NFT 400 Human avatars (KNOWBODYs will be stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.)NFT Details：PHASE 1Launch Date： November 16th, 2022Number: 400Network: EthereumPrice: Free MintNFT series: HumansCollateral value: It comes along with the chance to free mint an exceed 5-digit KNOWHERE domain name.

On Knowhere, you can customize your avatar as you wish with unique wearables by using bricks or tokens.More importantly, every wearable is NFT based on ERC-721, so you can easily trade it in Metaverse, not just on Knowhere.

Building a metaverse brand on Knowhere sounds like a good idea.By owning the first original NFT collection released by KNOWHERE Labs, you are not only holding the value of the NFT avatar itself, but also a premium membership in the KNOWHERE metaverse. You can earn extra points and tokens by simply owning an avatar as well, the future benefits are open for discussion, and anyone in this community could be the next key decision-maker.After the first release of the 400 human avatars, other collections with different races will be released periodically, including the Robot series, and the Demon series and limited collections will be arranged soon. Different levels of benefits and equities will be applied in the upcoming collections, including premium KNOWHERE domain names and higher priority associated with KNOWHERE Video APP.About KNOWHEREKnowhere is a name everyone should have on their radars as the product is scheduled to become available to users towards the end of September 2022.
