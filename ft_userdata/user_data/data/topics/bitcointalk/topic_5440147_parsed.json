His opponent has three losses, but is a very active boxer, having won all three fights last year.I believe most of the posters here will be rooting for Donaire, but it would still be nice to put up a poll to determine who has the majority of the votes.If Donaire is listed as the favorite, I doubt he will be a heavy favorite. He's coming off a big loss against Inoue, so he doesn't have much momentum, unlike Santiago, who is currently on a winning streak.",

He will be a champion again, which will make the Philippines proud of him, as we are already losing champions.However, if he fails, I think he should consider retiring from boxing and declare his retirement. He is not getting any younger, and his age is likely a big factor in how he can win.",

The preparation is usually for a specific fighter because the strategy should always match the opponent's strategy. A good example is Manny Pacquiao preparing for Spence, but the fight did not happen, so Ugas was sent as a replacement. In that fight, Manny Pacquiao lost because he was not preparing for Ugas.",

So, this tells Jason Moloney will be fighting against Reymart Gaballo if Vincent Astrolabio picks to go for the IBF title. Well then, that puts away all the trends about Donaire and Moloney's fight, they can now stay in silence and focus on their own fights. But I am sure they will still meet if Donaire plans to continue and want to fight more after this. Unify the titles himself and get a good retiring record. I bet Donaire was already preparing for Moloney but this is great, set it as early as possible so he can change his strategy.How much do you guys think the odds will be against Santiago?",

He's coming off a big loss against Inoue, so he doesn't have much momentum, unlike Santiago, who is currently on a winning streak.Yeah, he will obviously the favorite based on the WBC ranking alone, Donaire is second if I'm not mistaken behind Moloney.True, majority love Donaire, although we said that he should retire after the beating he got from the hands of Inoue, a worst knockout in his career. But if he can still pull the trigger against Santiago and given the window of opportunity to become a champion again, so why not take it.Doesn't matter if he will be the heavy or slight favorite, he will get our bets for sure or which round he is going to score a knockout.",
