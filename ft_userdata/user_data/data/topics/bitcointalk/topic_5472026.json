Pre fork Satori usually sell a little bit higher due to whatever reason I don’t since shitcoins it contain is almost worthless.BTW they have same face value since fork coins included on prefork is just a peanuts while both tokens have same appearance and loaded with same amount of Bitcoin.",

Thats great news LC, ill be watching for any satori's  you sell. Sounds like your the person to buy them from. I agree that there wouldnt be much of a price difference from a coin numbered 30000 to coin numbered 34000. Significant premiums kick in when you start talking 17000, 12000, 9000. I remember seeing a 7000 coin sell pretty high off ebay.",
