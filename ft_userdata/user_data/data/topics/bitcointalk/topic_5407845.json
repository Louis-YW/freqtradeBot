A website that's mining cannot mine bitcoin, since Bitcoin can be mined only with special hardware (which you most probably don't have).So it may be mining altcoins and sell it for bitcoin, in the best case (I'll come back to this). If that happens, you'll be earning coins that worth some pennies, but your computer will consume electricity that'll cost much more than those pennies, so you lose money.And I'm back to \"it's mining altcoins, in the best case\". Since it's very few pennies you'd be \"earning\" (that's if you ignore the electricity cost) like this, there are (at least) 2 directions for this kind of websites:* if you're lucky, some will show a lot of advertising and will act like faucets, letting you withdraw .. pennies (after a big threshold is reached)* if you're not too lucky (and this is what I expect to be the most widely spread case) the website will show some nice numbers there, may even steal all the information it can from your computer or at least browser, but you'll never be able to withdraw (and if you insist, you may be lied to deposit money there - under whatever reasons).TL;DR: you better avoid that kind of websites.",

      "body": "Think about it for a while. Mining bitcoin while browsing? For free? Sounds great, right? Then you do some research and find out that mining any popular coin with your PC is impossible because even if you were to dedicate 100% of its power to mining you'd still not have enough to generate income. Now, let's say this works and your browser takes 50% of your available resources and really mines something. Your browsing is going to be a painful experience - slow loading, PC overheating, high power consumption, possible freezes... How much are you going to generate even if it does work?",

Anyway, it's a good idea to ask before use.I'm new to the world of bitcoin and i found a website that has 21,100 visitors per month. even with all the information as you say, it is natural that for those who still don't understand the subject start to think twice. And about everytime you think \"we've reached the point where users can learn about mining from the information that's abundantly available\" as you know we just have to google to understand about what happens between Russia and Ukraine, and yet thousands are supporting this war, we just have to google to understand men and women are equal and yet many men still think women are less smart, we just have to google to understand, black, white, yellow, red etc doesn't matter there is only one race that is human anything else is B****  and still the world is full of racists, we jut have to google to understand muslim religion, Catholic, etc etc, and yet people still kill in the name of religions, and so on ... as you can see almost any subject we can think we´ve reached the point where ... but as you can see people don´t have the same understanding about the subjects, ppl are not even in the same level of knowledge in all subjects, and that's the reason i´m here to learn with people that know more than me.",

Just to add, if you want to earn some crypto precisely like Basic Attention Token, use Brave Browser. Some ads appear that you're free to click or not and will make you a small amount. Actually, I haven't claimed those free BAT and sometimes I click those ads, and sometimes I don't, and I just like using the browser but maybe that will help you have an idea about them.",
