  "content": "Here are the results of the June Stacks Bowers Auction: https://auctions.stacksbowers.com/auctions/3-WWAV2/the-june-2022-auction-session-2-us-coins-part-2-lots-2001-2328?limit=36&parent_category=3-U5GPQCheck out the Satoris?! Whoh----------------------------------------------------------------------Here's another auction featuring physical Bitcoins (link below):I think the interesting development with this auction is that the previous two have been exclusive to PCGS graded Casascius and Lealana coins. This auction does have plenty of PCGS Cas and Lealanas, but also includes Satoris and a BTCC chip. They also have a few item graded by ANACS and IGC. The trend (small sample size obviously) shows an expanding appetite to test the sales water for physical bitcoins. https://www.greysheet.com/news/story/bitcoins-and-physical-cryptocurrency-featured-in-the-stack-s-bowers-galleries-june-2022-auctionSteeley",
