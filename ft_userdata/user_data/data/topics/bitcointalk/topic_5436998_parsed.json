They generally quote how big organizations like MicroStrategy, whales, and big investment houses (banks, investment funds and etc) have been continuously buying Bitcoin and depleting the general public or new investors of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto was very smart and that is why he created 2.1 quadrillion satoshis. After the inception of LN, we can divide that same amount of sathosis by thousand smaller units that can be called microsats. If you question the number of Bitcoin lost or unclaimed then still we would have a sufficient amount for the whole population of earth. We all know such a situation would take a lot of years till then those who question the amount of Bitcoin can be silenced with this topic.",

The smallest unit is still satoshi. 21 million BTC is perfect because it is not limitless, it will make it scarce and help in its valuation and adoption.Even if it comes to a time (but that I do not think would be possible) that smaller unit is needed , I do not think that would divide the bitcoin community if truly there is a need for a unit smaller than a satoshi.We should know that a satoshi is a very small unit, bitcoin do not need a smaller unit than a satoshi.",

Satoshi Nakamoto was very smart and that is why he created 2.1 quadrillion satoshis. Yes. You do actually have a point in this very statement of yours, because on the contrary, 1 Bitcoin = 100,000,000 Satoshis, and Satoshi is the smaller divisible unit of Bitcoin, which means that the price increase of Bitcoin is directly proportional to increase in demand (I.e if the demand of Bitcoin start increasing, it's price value increases too) so as to enable it's limited supply go round.",

From 2009 to today, there was enough time for a lot more people to decide to use Bitcoin, but less than 5% of the world's population did it, so I don't believe that in the next 10 years that percentage will be more than 15% in the best case.If the price rises to some six-figures, then even 1 million BTC on exchanges will be quite enough for all those who want to invest.",

Many of the people who have invested in it are holding the small units while some whales are holding thousands of coins so we are not into that time when everyone will have it right.We still have time and can adopt it now but if we say how all will have it then it's wrong perception according to me.Full 21M supply to be unlocked is in 2140 so still it's more then a century and in coming time the prices will be too high that you can't get full bitcoin with big amounts also so that's why smallest unit satoshi will be more traded and more people can have access to it.The people are also losing the coins but in reality the actual coins lost are those send to OP_Return command which burns the coin and those who have lost access to wallets can get it back if they remember the seeds or passwords.But remember the less supply the more value it will give to the existing coins and we all know that so instead of thinking these things we should be more focused on investing and safely holding our coins in our custody.",

So, at the protocol level, bitcoin is measured in satoshi and that's the base unit of bitcoin. Currently, we use BTC more than sat, just because it's much more easier. If bitcoin value reaches 10 million dollars one day, then we will probably use sat more than BTC.",

There are many bitcoins lost in time, and many more bitcoins will come on that list. Owners don't pass their wallets, lost their wallets, and soo many more reasons. It cannot be recovered by anyone or bitcoin is created that way. 21 million will not be the same number after a certain number of years.",

First of all, with lightning and current protocol, it must take years for all the people to have their opening channel transactions confirmed. Secondly, micro-sats should not ever become the standard, unless they're introduced in the protocol. And even with the entire world invested into Bitcoin, micro-sats will have little value.",
