  "content": "Just wondering if there is an appetite for running a raffle for a copy of the \"Bitcoin Day\" Diario el Salvador newspaper?This has been stored with zero exposure to light, which is the number 1 enemy of newsprint paper.It has been covered with 160gsm black acid free paper in a grip sealed bag.I'm thinking 12 slots at BTC0.0005 per slot which includes registered delivery.If you are interested you can claim your slot, no need to send payment until all slotsare filled.After slots are filled a block will be chosen, the last digit of that block will determinethe winner.",

I have seen a few for sale on ebay like this one https://www.ebay.com/itm/384449222302but no expert on these lol yes, or like this one below which I suppose can be referred to as #2 > https://scarce.city/auctions/La-Ley-Bitcoin-2There are 4 \"collectible\" editions:1 - El Salvador announces its plans to make Bitcoin legal 6th June 20212 - The El Salvador assembly approves Bitcoin to be legal tender ¬†9th June 20213 - The Day Bitcoin \"went live\" in El Salvador 7th September 20214 - Plans to make a dedicated Bitcoin City 21st November 2021Mopar had a full set for auction not too long ago which didnt sell > https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5443667.msg61864123#msg61864123So I dont think a lot of people realise the collectability of these and how hard they areto assemble all 4 editions, I think edition #2 is the rarest the one I dont have!",
