  "content": "Store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account.Â  Bitcoin is a medium (not widely used, I know that you know), store of value(sure) it has proved in Latin America. Now, unit of account, I do not understand Btc as I understand $, 20USD would give me a pretty good idea of what I can buy around the world, but BTC, the symbol is like a language, we have to learn etc.. I am lazy so I would like to propose a way more faster, that even a Chinese and an American totally understand the symbol which I would like to share with all of you. The metric system was born like Bitcoin was born, both of them as full frustration from the system, a revolution. This system of measure was accessible to anyone who would like to access as a system of exchange easily understandable. The meter was born then the kilogram came. And both of them have created many types of scientific units etc... Which in other words, m(meter) and kg(kilogram) would stay as long as you can imagine.I would like to buy your mom (oh God, what did I just say, please do not hack me), lets stay serious, What could we put in a mathematical equation to attribute a price to your mom. Standard + subjective value = Price .Standard would be something that can attributed to every type of variables such as computers, humans, animals etc.. all of them are composed of E(energy) which also made of mass. E=mc(square)BTC is only subjective value, fiat system is only subjective value which we attribute prices depending on our irrational, emotional stupid behavior, like a painting of Modiliagni, or Leonardo Davinci for MBS bought for 415 Millions of dollars. This painting mass is about lets say, 15 kg + subjective value (99%) of the price he bought. A cryptocurrency which implements a standard (m) mass could easily asserts us a way of thinking to give a price of something, even something never thought before.Want to discuss more, do not waste my time as I did not waste yours, Telegram @TellAsmar",

Really?Maybe he means Bitcoin transactions will become faster than the speed of lightPeople will probably mention the Bitcoin price volatility as a factor but I'll mention that Bitcoin is by no means finished growing. It's still in evolution and it will continue to be like that until the block subsidies stop and 21M supply cap is reached.",

I was looking or an explanation on why Bitcoin would never be a unit of account and found a bunch of nonsense. E=mc2? Really?I thought as much that all the write ups will eventually be a waste of time and i got that impression right from the topic to the thread, i don't know maybe it's over i too know or inability to discern from the right to left affects most little experienced learnerds, as long as they can read and write makes them feel superior that whatever they say is right since they have probably the highest standard of education or have attained alot of degrees to be giving them such impression, there's no vexation for the day other than reading his article to the end and eventually one discover nothing to gain from it, just a combination of alphabets having no meaning attached.",

I was looking or an explanation on why Bitcoin would never be a unit of account and found a bunch of nonsense. I was thinking the same as OP's thoughts on bitcoin but with fiat a while ago.I was thinking how a group near me that offers extra curricular activities to children of school age (things they wouldn't get to do in school) now pay a fee of $300 for a yearly membership and I was pondering if the club would survive into the coming years if they don't raise fees and costs go up and then I remembered inflation was a thing because 20 years ago the same membership would cost you $100 for the year (prices converted based on today's exchange rates).",

      "body": "Why Bitcoin would never be a unit of account? Where have you been all these days? It is already being used as a unit of account. Many goods and services are already priced in Bitcoin, although you will probably encounter more of them priced in Sats because BTC is a huge amount already. That's just like pricing goods and services in USD but having many of them priced in cents because they're way cheaper than a full USD.Also, what's particularly so complicated about Bitcoin as a unit of account that you have to compare it with learning a language? I can't find any.",
