  "content": "Hello World!It's been 146 days! I was banned. But Bitcointalk Moderators gave me another chance.Thank you to everyone who supported/opposed me. Thank you for your healthy criticism. It helped me to learn a good lesson.It took around four hours to share my first post. I was busy checking my old posts, so I don't get banned again for the same reason.Quote from: shahzadafzal on October 12, 2022, 10:07:48 AMCongratulation naim027 these things are rare but happens Thank you, Bhai. I appreciate your support. Quote from: Ratimov on October 12, 2022, 10:18:00 AMA fair decision on the unbanned naim027, although somewhat delayed in time. My congratulations to naim027, he did not lose hope of being unbanned and continued all this time to constantly fight for the right to be a full user of the forum.Now it remains to deal with the negative tag, which should be removed, since it does not correspond to reality.Thank you, Ratimov. The support you guys have shown for an unknown internet guy is appreciatable.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on October 12, 2022, 10:51:02 AMnaim027, I also join in the congratulations. I removed the neutral review because I think that having survived the time of the ban, you will never step on the old rake again. Being in your position a few years ago, I, like no one else, can understand your joy. You have not given up for a long time. It is worthy of recognition.Thank you, dear. I have learned a good lesson. Thanks for pointing out my mistakes, and also, thanks for removing the feedback.Quote from: indah rezqi on October 12, 2022, 01:15:45 PMI didn't engage in a single conversation in this thread, but I know finally now the ban on naim027 has unbanned. Obviously this should be good news for naim027 after a long struggle to appeal againt his account. Congratulations naim027, your appeal was successful and now everyone wishes you not to make the same mistake again in the future.Welcome back naim027.Thank you, indah. I appreciate your support and warm welcome.Quote from: Royse777 on October 12, 2022, 01:17:56 PMCongratulations Naim027 for this deserved 2nd chance. I hope you are going to use it and make an example to inspire others with a great comeback by being a good asset to the community. You patience and integrity was excellent thought out the process.Thanks, Royse, I made a no or a little contribution to the forum. But, Luckily moderators considered my contributions as good and given me another chance.

I appreciate that the moderators gave me a second chance. Yes, I think I am one of the lucky ones. Honestly, I thought I might get a signature ban if they unban me. But, Moderators show me some mercy. I appreciate everyone's support. I want to thank everyone who ever supported/opposed my appeal. The support gave me hope, and the opposition taught me a lesson and determined my vulnerability.",

Guy has been around long enough to know how a ban works, but decided he could make a new account and still participate on the forum. Not cool. If ya cannot follow the simple rules and wait out a decision, how trustworthy or reputable will you ever be?If I am casinocritique I would also seriously consider severing any relationship with this user if the accusation is found to be true.",

Follow the speech. I Revealed my account many times from my other account which is ALT. The funny thing is, This is my main account which was created back in 2020. But, I was unable to post due to an IP ban. A few months ago I got whitelisted. You can check neutral feedback on my account.Now I'm confused, is it really possible to dodge like that?Someone once asked naim027 why his alternate account has such a weird nickname like Dic3L0v3rQuote from: AnotherAlt on July 10, 2022, 03:54:46 PMI had created several accounts before paying the evil fees for this account. Unfortunately, I have forgotten the usernames. This was the last one and I was running out of ideas for usernames. So I choose AnotherAlt. The reason I paid the evil fees for this account: it was a small amount than other accounts which I also stated in LoyceV's Thread.
