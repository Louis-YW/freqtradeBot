What’s you suggestion and advices.First, you have to choose a reputable casino to gamble on and only register on them after you have carefully read their terms and conditions of service and agree to their terms as suitable for you,  in selecting a reputable casino,  you can easily notice that through the various ANN threads that we have here in the forum and also checking various forum reviews this way you can discover a lot of things about the casino even before you started playing on them. On the issue of possible addictions,  you have to know that you can only become addicted if you approach gambling with the wrong motive and mindset,  this is because you have to make up your mind not to take gambling as a means of making income,  and only gamble for fun and nothing more than that because doing otherwise will increase your chances of possible addictions.",

I want to believe that you are somehow familiar with the forum rules and ready to abide by them. Going back to your discussion, If you're a beginner in gambling, I would like to recommend starting with a game that is relatively simple and doesn't require a lot of strategy, like slots. But you know that we have many different kinds of slots, so you can choose the one that interests you. However, since you said that you are new, you need to understand that gambling is a form of entertainment and not a way to solve your problems or make easy money. If you start gambling now, you should also to aware of the risks and take steps to protect yourself from addiction because gambling addiction is real.",

What’s you suggestion and advices.You should assess yourself first on how you can handle risk since not all people can gamble without affecting their daily life. If you are already worried that your real life might be affected even before gambling means you are an overthinker and scared.You can use the demo mode of the casino first to try the games then start to deposit the minimum amount until you get comfortable. The secret on a good gambling experience is to play only what you can afford to lose. Don’t use over budget and just have fun.I recommend slot games from Pragmatic and Play’nGo since they are not high volatile while you can use very low amount for each bet instead of usging live games which typically allow 1$ min bet on card games.",

But if you are that worried, it will only stress you out and it's best not to try further. It defeats the purpose of gambling as entertainment. Most beginners I think first try that dice game and roulette and after a few days of losing, I'm sure they are also trying out strategies to win as what others are doing.",

Live casino for a beginner.Do you think Me starting gambling would effect me in my real life or make me addicted to gambling. What’s you suggestion and advices.About the being addicted part, it's all up to you. If you think you are a responsible gambler then I don't think you should worry about that. I usually just play in two different casinos. Stake.com and Sportsbet.io. I have not yet tried other gambling sites but I do check on them especially if I see a good UI. About the best games, if you are starting slow and just want to feel the games then try the Originals first. You can bet for as long as 1 satoshi on those games and you can test your seed too if you think it is giving you good results. Original games are Dice, Keno, Plinko, and more. Now if you think you are ready for slots like Pragmatic, Play N' Go, Microgaming, etc.. then you will need to increase your budget since the minimum that I see is $0.01 or $0.1 for other slot providers. Both gambling sites also offer live casinos so I think you will be satisfied with it. They have a broad of games that they offer and the withdrawal fees are also low enough that you can get in and out if you want as long as you are not doing it like a money launderer. You still need to play and wager.",

As soon as you are not desperate to win, you cannot be addicted to gambling. So, ensure you work on your finances first so you don't gamble under pressure.

Plus, gambling is one of those habits that is difficult to stop. While I personally don't bet on gambling games, but I can leave my house to watch a live game because I truly enjoy doing so. In fact, as a man, you can't be a complete person if you don't watch a ball. However, I don't play gambling; that's something I have friends who do. Every day there are matches and they feel like they are missing something because they didn't bet.Gambling is a common activity among young people because it benefits them. You can bet with a small amount of money and, with luck, win much more than you initially invested. However, as a man, you must be aware of the maximum amount you would bet on a game. It's quite risky to gamble a large sum of money that you can't afford to lose on a game because that kind of loss could push you towards other things. Instead, you should only bet with money that you can afford to lose.",

What’s you suggestion and advices.For a new gambler, betting is the most risky and most likely to lose money. Since you are a new person, you should first gain good knowledge about gambling and then decide to gamble. If you find a trusted casino platform then good but I will tell you all the trusted casino platforms on this forum are the best. You can register there if you want and get high bonus, especially Stake.com is currently the best gambling platform. First of all if you play live casino then you can start by betting on different games first if it can be more wrong for you. And if you gamble regularly then you will definitely get addicted to it, so gamble three to four days a week. I think gambling twice a week can keep a person from becoming an addict, and especially when it comes to gambling, everyone gets addicted at some point.",

This habit will always help you in the long run.Secondly, you need to decide for yourself that which gambling game suits you best. The best way is to play every game and also try out sports betting and see which game you feel is more entertaining and fun. I hope you already know the purpose of your gambling.

So I think it's too early to say that small capital will make you addicted, because usually addiction will occur when you already feel a big win, although I can't make sure it's entirely true but of course you are quite right because indeed addiction can occur anywhere and with any capital budget, but because you just tried it then maybe your addiction will not be too significant especially if the final result is losing.Exactly, those gamblers should really pay attention about their budget allocation for betting, do not overdo it, because there is no guarantee, do not make gambling opportunities as your main reason why bring large capital because the final result is always uncertain. Putting money that you can be responsible for is better, don't put money for other needs on gambling because it will only cause problems if the final result is not to your liking, because you will never know when you will be lucky, so it's better to always minimize it.",
