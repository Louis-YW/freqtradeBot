E fit be chance for pipo wey wan enter Bitcoin levels, no dull yourself. Na time wey beta to buy Bitcoin we dey, no be time to shake like fowl wey see hawk.e fit fall today, jinja tomorrow. No allow FOMO make you sell based on fear. Experts still talk say e go ginger again. E better make you hold steady, buy now as e dey low, sell when edon ripe. Long-term gains dey if you get patience. So, no rush sell, better times still dey come. My brother, Omo allowÂ  anybody way wan sell him coin, make him sell am, na person way dey new to the system go begin panick. As an investor, you suppose don know say market dey fluctuate based on market forces. The way the market be,Â  be say, if them way wan sell their coin, no sell, buyers no go see market buy, so na 2 way thing.Because as the market dey currently on down trend, some traders way predict am, dey cash out watin no good, so na so when bull run happen too, some people dey happy. So the life normally na generally market.",
