Without basic knowledge about Bitcoin, no one can strongly belief in Bitcoin, can not mentally prepared for their investment in Bitcoin.",

Of course you can advise and recommend holding to a favorable market but not definitely stop them or call them fool when they intend to sell at whatever price.

I seriously doubt that. The forum activity is dropping and we aren't getting many new interesting faces who are interested in staying long term. Many who come are previously banned bounty hunters or spammers that return to resume such activities. So you aren't going to get quality information from them and they are not interested in investing in BTC.  Quote from: Hyphen(-) on September 18, 2022, 05:32:17 AMBeing patient is key since, no matter the market situation, 1 BTC is still 1 BTC. In terms of numbers, sure, 1 equals 1. 1 BTC = 1 BTC, but 1 USD is also 1 USD. It's the purchasing power of the units that changes. The purchasing power of the USD is historically decreasing, while that of bitcoin is increasing. Still, you can't make the claim that the 1 BTC from 2012 is equal to the one of today, or that the one we have today equals the one that was worth $69.000 per unit a few months ago.",

They have little or no knowledge about bitcoin and end up falling victim of great loss and regretful of their actions at the end. Being mentally prepared to invest in cryptocurrency is one of the basic knowledge all newbies should learn, without that it leads to mental collapse as such newbies even use the money they can’t afford to lose, which can eventually leads to committing suicide by such persons.
