  "content": "Can another pool attack a FPPS pool by simulating high fees by paying themselves high fee txs? Or does the FPPS pool software algo know that those attacking fees are not to be counted? My understanding is a FPPS pool uses last 24 hour timeframe of total network fees to calculate their fee payouts, why can't a large pool fake their fees to trick the FPPS pool into overpaying what they are actually expected to receive themselves for block rewards.",

      "body": "If a pool paid themselves with higher tx fees they'd probably be redistributing most of them to their miners anyway so I doubt it would ever be profitible for them to do. Also, pools are in demand if they're established and have a lot of power behind them and they aren't that expensive to run afaik so they'd just be opening themselves up to more competition. I do wonder what happened to these pools when a user accidentally paid 15btc in transaction fees a while ago though, would that be enough to.make their payout increase?",
