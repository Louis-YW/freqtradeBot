The game will be open from 10am PT to 6pm PT each day through Sunday, July 31.Crypto at ChipotleChipotle now accepts digital currency, including cryptocurrency, nationwide through a partnership with Flexa, the global leader in pure-digital payments. Guests can use 98 different digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, and Dogecoin, to pay for their real food at Chipotle with a Flexa-enabled app. Chipotle first immersed itself in the crypto space in April of 2021 when it became the first U.S. restaurant brand to launch a cryptocurrency giveaway through its \"Burritos or Bitcoin\" promotion, which dished out $100,000 in Bitcoin to celebrate National Burrito Day.A bit pointless, but once again anything that puts crypto out there in front of people is a good thing IMO.And if you can get a burrito too then even better. Considering the size of Chipolte $200k over a week is a rounding error in their advertising budget but it's still better then nothing.-Dave",
