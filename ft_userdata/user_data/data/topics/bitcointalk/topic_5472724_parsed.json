  "content": "The crypto market has a high level of volatility. Anyone who is about to make an investment needs to have a good understanding of the volatile market. Now the question is, even with volatility, will you still choose to make your investment in fiat through bank savings with regular monthly interests or rather make your investments in crypto where you hold your asset and still have the opportunity to save and make monthly interest?",

Like are you comparing between Usd and BTC or USD and Doge? Because this section is only concerns about BTC not about doge or any other token.Besides this, I will prefer to invest in BTC instead of investing in fiat. Because my friend earned $1500 and I earned $1500 few months back, he kept them in fiat I kept them in the form of BTC and now I made around $250 plus on my $1500 amount and he is not. I hope you got the answer.",

      "body": "Well, seems like a rhetorical question, there are many things there that in themselves should not necessarily go at the same pace, first of all I think you are mentioning that you prefer to save in Fiat, that is not viable currently, inflation is a recurring in many countries and returns do not go beyond 3% at best, and inflation on average is close to 2 percentage points.  It's useful? On the other hand, volatility is the formula that investors look for, so welcome to bitcoin, but, you must understand and gain experience, so, being an investor is a very different thing from buying bitcoin to hold.(e.g.)",

Now the question is even with the volatility will you still choose crypto over fiat when it comes to making investments?If by crypto you mean Bitcoin then YES but if you mean altcoins then NO. I'll rather stick with fiats as they have more security then altcoins. Atleast I know my investment (with fiats) won't just vanish one day. You can be rich in altcoins this very moment and the next thing you know, you're broke again due to the project founder performing an exit scam on we (the investors) or the market crashing and the project loses all the hype and momentum that the price can't recover again. Altcoin Investment aren't recommended as they're pure gamble and not investments. On the other hand my investment will be preferred in Bitcoin than fiats because fiats investment get devalued over time that even when you make profits, you are still at lost due to the inflation of your local fiats. My country currency (Naira) is one of the worst out there that it's nightmare investing with it. As you're investing in Bitcoin, you don't need to bother about the volatile nature of the market as it doesn't concern you, you aren't trading so you have nothing to do with the market until you have gotten to your investment target and you need to exit the market then you sell. Irrespective of the direction that the market takes, when you don't sell, you don't lose so just keep holding through all the volatility and you'll be fine at the end.",

With long-term investments, volatility at the “intermediate” stages doesn't matter at all, but only the “entry point” and “exit point” are important.Quote from: Bitcoinpoly on November 03, 2023, 02:48:12 PMNow the question is even with the volatility will you still choose crypto over fiat when it comes to making investments?Investing in fiat? What are you talking about? What idiot would invest in fiat? Investments will destroy these investments to zero or even worse, to a loss. Fiat has never been and never will be an investment tool. Remember this.Now the answer to your question is easy to find. Of course, investments are only possible in cryptocurrencies, but not all of them. Because most of cryptocurrencies are even worse than fiat. These cryptocurrencies are getting cheaper and depreciate faster than inflation hits fiat. Worst of all, in the end begin to cost nothing at all. And here the opposite effect appears, that fiat turns out to be better than many cryptocurrencies. Although many such cryptocurrencies are simply called shitcoins.",

Now the question is even with the volatility will you still choose crypto over fiat when it comes to making investments?Without understanding that the volatility of the BTC market can cause us huge losses, it will be equal to gambling. We have to do proper analysis, both technical and fundamental. We have to keep an eye on the the economy because the the BTC market is mainly driven by demand and supply and positive news like some improvements or adoption by some companies or governments. An example can be taken from ETFs.I will suggest keeping funds in cryptocurrency, but the choice of cryptocurrency also matters. That's another question: which cryptocurrency should be selected for investments? But at first, we don't have to make investments in fiat because fiat in itself is working money—physical money that we use to buy and sell things—and cannot be used to store our asset's value.While there are many cryptocurrencies that we can use to store our assets' value, like BTC, Because if we store our money in some fiat, it will be reduced due to inflation, while if we keep our funds in the form of BTC, they will not be reduced due to inflation because BTC is a hedge against inflation.",

Because we know that we could maximize our gains with swings of the market and from the season of the market unlike stocks or any tangible investments that needs a lot of time to appreciate its value. Bitcoin could actually soar up to $100,000 if someone, a billionaire, named Elon Musk calls long to bitcoin. Just a simple news could actually make some crypto investors a millionaire, and they, I mean we love that volatility.",

Crypto in general could be questioned, because there are thousands of altcoins that you should stay away from and you would be rightfully doing so, but bitcoin is different, its the best, its the top ranked, and its the first. Investing into bitcoin is definitely a smart decision that everyone should consider and could be done very well and could beat out any fiat investment that you could make.",

Many of the fiat currencies today are losing value daily because of high rate of inflation. Would you rather have an investment in a currency that will make you be at a loss when your profit is valued with initial capital or you’ll invest in bitcoin that will always bounce back to regain its form after being hit by the so many volatilities of the market? It is now your chive to decide on what currency to invest in during investment.",

Bitcoin price shows a very good growth for over 13 years of existence which means this kind of volatility is already not gonna matter if your investment is long term. This volatility concern are only for those who purchase Bitcoin and aim to have a small profit in short term.",

It's always a mix of different kind of investments that includes, cryptocurrency, stocks, bonds, band deposits, precious metals etc. A mix of assets is always better than any single asset. That's very basic of investment. So even with this volatility, I do invest in cryptos as well as other assets. I do not choose only cryptocurrency for investment or only fiat.",

Yes bitcoin is volatile online money which only interested people use it but even at they it is for all. And those who understand bitcoin is not after the volatile nature of bitcoin but all what they after the the bear and the bull market. They use the bear market to accumulate more bitcoin in their portfolio and use the bull to sell so what is risk in bitcoin is not even in their dictionary, and what I  mean is that volatile is not in the mind. They only follow the down and up.And to your question and it will be a straight answer. And that should be yes. I will always invest in bitcoin over fiat in 100% times. Why must I even invest in fiat when there  is no store of value. And the bankers will be using it to do business without your permission and the day when you want to use your money and you went to bank that is the day your account network is bad or there is no money to give you but in bitcoin your money is always there for you to withdraw.",

You can invest in fiat if your goal is to put that fiat money against your own. As an example we can use someone who uses Turkish Lira and owns a bunch of it. That currency's inflation is high, so many other currencies will go up against it. If you decide to buy dollar that appreciates greatly against your currency and sell it after a few months, you'll have a lot more lira. Doing that makes you bet on the lira's ability to eventually curb inflation and stabilizing, so it can be an investment. For me bitcoin is the best investment. I wouldn't buy any other fiat money over it and I wouldn't choose real estate or gold. Real estate is great to own, but as long as you don't have too many properties that give you a headache. You can own 100m in bitcoin, but try owning 100 apartments worth 1m each... You'll have to hire a company to manage it for you, register a business and all that.",

A: Honestly, I would choose FIAT, which is why I'm not a diamond hand for most of the Altcoins I hold. When I get good profits, I will do TP .Q: Would you rather make your investments in FIAT or Bitcoin?A: Bitcoin all the way , your understanding of the financial sector will make you choose Bitcoin over FIAT, especially if you are discussing investments that are actually long term.",

Everyone is aware of the fact that cryptocurrency is the only thing that can be guaranteed for investment. And all those people are engaged on the forum because of this; they get full satisfaction that investment is necessary, whether in fiat or in cryptocurrency. However, the purpose of investment should be to get profit, and for profit, it is necessary that he stabilize his assets or gain profit instead of investing. While currencies are losing value day by day,Therefore, it is also the purpose of saying, and it is also a requirement of wisdom that a person does the work that benefits him and does not neglect the work that harms him. So let us consider the example of fiat currency: if it cannot maintain the stability of its invested value or positive gain, then it cannot become the subject of investment unless these qualities are found at the top of them.",

If you invest or hold fiat, since it's a stable currency, you can't profit more if you convert it to your local currency. Well, volatile currency has huge risk compare to stable currency, that's why we should really need enough knowledge about it before we invest.
