  "content": "Hi and thanks for reading this,My ledger nano s is broken and so I decided to import the wallet into Electrum (4.4.5). With all addresses, this went well, except for the taproot address (bc1pxxxxxxxxxxxxx).During setup, the following addresses were detected:Standard BIP49 compatibility segwit (Account 0)Standard BIP84 native segwit (Account 0)Now I understood that for a taproot you have to choose native segwit, but that doesn't work. The taproot address does not show in the list of addresses.So I think I need to change the derivation path (m/44h/0h/0h), but I don't know how. Can anyone help me with this?Thanks in advance!",

Can anyone help me with this?Changing it into the standard TapRoot derivation path will only generate the associated prvKeys/pubKeys of your TapRoot addresses and derive the selected script type,not the actual TapRoot addresses themselves since Electrum currently doesn't support it.For example, if you've selected \"Legacy\" then changed m/44h/0h/0h into m/86h/0h/0h, the addresses will still be legacy.Your option is to use another client that supports taproot like Sparrow.",

Importing single private keys is horrible for privacy, that might be why they haven't added the option.",

      "body": "The OP should keep in mind that he compromised the security of his wallet by recovering it into a software (likely) hot wallet. I'm assuming a hot wallet situation on an online computer, but OP didn't give details of his setup. Due to the fact that his hardware wallet broke, it's understandable to recover for needed usage.I would recommend to look for a suitable replacement (personally I don't recommend closed-source crap like Ledger) hardware wallet (e.g. Foundation Passport or BitBox02), create a new wallet and transfer funds as soon as you have made yourself familiar with your new device.Don't forget to verify that you're able to execute a full recovery with your new device properly before you send your funds to it. Testing full recovery is recommended e.g. with worthless Testnet Bitcoin.",
