There will be no guarantee that these will be listed, so i hope you are well aware of the risk you are accepting here. Especially this PI token which has a big hype, I smell a big scam in this project, but nothing can be said with guarantee.Do you only buy these tokens listed here or other bounty tokens too?",

Also, buy the looks of it, he's reselling it too. So, it's like OP serves as a middleman which means he's not actually going to hold the coins.",

Is he from bitcointalk who is buying these tokens from the OP.Also, if the OP is acting as a middleman, this means he is keeping his profit while selling them to the buyer. This inclusion of the middleman makes the token purchase even more expensive",

Especially this PI token which has a big hype, I smell a big scam in this project, but nothing can be said with guarantee. actually risk is not big as i am not holding it for long time i am selling to third person with very small commission. The risk with these coins is these coin coins price can be dropped any time hard because they are not listed in any official exchange and unofficial buyers are not in great numbers. if these limited buyers stopped to buy coins then i cannot sell.PI token is very amazing. Their team playing with users. most of users KYC option is not available yet while some user who successfully done their kyc , their token not recieved yet. i am also waiting for token for twi months (Kyc task completed 2 months ago). anyways people are still expecting 1$ price atleast just like SuI.

This inclusion of the middleman makes the token purchase even more expensive   Main buyer are buying to hold and waiting for mainnet launch. This is high risk but can be profitable also. If you remember TWT(trust wallet token) token was sold unofficially in this way when it was not listed and people sold very cheap. when it's listed, gives buyer 100x profit and buyer are expecting same with PI and other coin so .My commission is very small and perhaps i am giving higher rate than any other people i know. The real buyer will be offering more but don't know who is buying in bulk.",
