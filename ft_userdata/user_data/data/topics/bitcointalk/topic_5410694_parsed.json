This date is drifting it was as early as 9/6/2022 it is now 9/13/2022 The drifting to a later date is because miners are leaving ETH and switching to ETC and other pools.The diff for eth has dropped and this slows the bomb date.I have started to move my 10.2 gh on eth to etc",

Yeah I pulled 1.3 gh off my eth and moved it to etc  did I really move the diff a lot all by myself? answer is nope, but lets look at eth hashrate last week",

I want the bomb or merge to happen but it seems like miners are scared of what to come because I don't understand why they want this delayed.Because you make more money as a miner if you push it out a month to oct.I earned a bit less eth so far.I earn etc which does not quite make up for the eth lost.but by doing a delay to Oct 10 vs Sept 10I earn more eth for those 30 daysthe diff bomb hits 30 days later.If I earn240 usd  daily in eth from now to sept 10   0 usd  daily in eth from now to sept 10 it is about 4800 usd in ethif I slowly shift to etcI earn say 200 usd a day  in eth  from now to sept 10 . so 20 x 200 = 4000I earn say  20 usd a day in etc from now to sept 10.  so 20 x 20 = 400net is 4400 which is worse than 4800. people see this and think wtf am I talking about.but the bomb does not hit sept 10 this way maybe it hits sept 20 or sept 30if it hits sept 30. this is 20 more days of earning 200 + 20 = 4400vs a bomb and maybe very little earnings at all.I will study the math more I simply think it is a better method than eth eth eth eth bomb etccost is not a lot 20 usd  a day for me  and I have 10.2gh involved.",

So, I bought some ETC after selling some ETH.This way is more profitable.WHY do you switching to ETC now ?I have already switched my mining rigs to ETC as I believe when the ETH mining will end,we can see an artificial increase in price of ETC in the beginning and soon after some time have passed not again artificial but natural of price increase of ETC if a lot of ETH hash rate is moved to ETC so that is a good move.I have done so,switched from ETH to ETC since when they announced for real the merge and the moving to PoS in early August,there is nothing to do in Ethereum mining now,I do not care for like 35 dollars less monthly I will get by mining ETC,those 35 dollars less maybe much more when ETC increases in price,that is why it can be considered a good move to switch to ETC mining,beside easing somewhat the Ethereum network which can delay a bit the difficulty bomb.Another good reason is that people who have already 4 GB cards can attach them to their powerful rigs thus providing more hash rate (of course at a bit more energy consumption as a cost).",

You have 29ghMove to25gh eth  4gh etcIf every one does this we shift the difficulty bomb by 1 week or 2 weeks or 3 weeks.lets analzye this in your case29gh is 29000 mh or 290 x 2.51 = $729.00 usd  a day for 20 days = $14558  if do nothingor 25gh is 25000 mh or 250 x 2.51 = $627.50 usd a day for 20 days = $12550 and  4gh is 4000 mh or  40 x 1.40 =.   $  56.00 usd a day for 20 days = $  1120                                                                                     total = $13670 so you see 14558 vs 13670 you say I lose $888 usd.But your case bomb hits brings us a total unknownmy case bomb has not hit brings us more status quoI know damn full well that with 29gh you want more status quo.So you would risk $888 and keep status quo for 1 ,2 ,3 maybe 4 weeks.It also shows that miners can fully affect eth and delay the diff bomb.If timed correctly a big shift from eth to etc prior to the bomb stalls the eth chainTo me its worth a shot talking about. we are on epoch 512 epoch 513 comes in 15 hours so in 16 hours a large shift in eth hash will stall the eth chain. We should look into doing this.Mr V has epoch every 30000 blocksSo epoch 513 comes in about 15 hours on block number 15,390,000 so say that is aug 22 at 7am ESTnormally it takes about 100 hours to get to epoch 514 block number 15,420,000 and this would be Aug 26 at 11am EST but a good drop in hash between aug 22 and aug 26 may stretch the 100 hours to 110 hours. or 120 hours.Very simple way to do it is shift some of your ETH to ETCDo it for 2 epochs about 200 hours time  or 8 days or do it for more.I will post my next change tommorrow. around 9 am",

Unless I am making a mistake somewhere. You're spot on. Difficulty & hashrate are corelated maintaining a fairly constant average block time.Moving hash from ETH to ETC will affect both, ETH rewards will increase, ETC will decrease.The tail is tryng to wag the dog, it won't work. Only the contrarians, those who exploit the reduced ETH difficulty, will benefit.",

However unlike Bitcoins difficulty retarget, it didn't take that long for the difficulty to adjust and for the chain to survive and was at first only mined by a handful of miners. So the way they coded the difficulty retarget was so the network can still function if a huge portion of the hashrate is decreased. So looking at https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktimeit seems that the block times are fairly close to the average even with the hashrate that is leaving the network.",

Unless I am making a mistake somewhere. you don't want to move all your hash from eth to etc.I and now 8.4gh eth and 2.3 gh etcthe bomb is coming in sept say 13-15 look at wenmerge.comthey have a countdownI am merely suggesting we can shift the bomb out 7-14 days.I also am setting grounds for etc to be more prepped hash wise Ie 600th for eth and 400th for etc on the diff  bomb day is better and would create less of a shockright now it is not close to 600-300it is more like 870-35.Eth does quick diff adjustments to speed blocks and really try to get 100 hours and 30000 blocksthere are many adjustments in that 100 hours. but it still slows network down.Standing pat 100% eth dies on sept 13-15then switch all to etc.I get that idea and frankly think it is so short sighted it's sad.It show desperation on the part of miners.Deliberately leaving ETH before ETH leaves us shows support for etc and creates more  value in etc.Most eth pos supporters don't understand that 25 million a day in earning will vanish and the replacement is 3 million a day in delayed interest.A sane miner would leave ship somewhat ahead of the rush.But hey reality is they will drop the bomb whether it is sept 13 or sept 30But I am already earning etc and supporting the network.if we slow up the bomb by slowly pulling our hash to etc it will only be a week tops.see what was done in june.we did 15 second blocksI want us to go from current 12.5 cents closer to the 15 second ones. like we did in june.",

This allows the node operators to on-the-fly update the TTD value to a new number to account for hashrate fluctuations such that the merge still occurs around a desired date (i.e. Sep 15 or thereabouts).The idea is that the core devs are continuously monitoring the hashrate and if it fluctuates to a point were it will affect the merge date to an undesired degree, the devs will publish a TTD override value which node operators will then use to update their nodes and thus adjust the merge timing to account for the hashrate fluctuation.",
