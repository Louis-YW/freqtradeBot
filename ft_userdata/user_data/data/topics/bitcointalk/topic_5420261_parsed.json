We are now experiencing so much decline in price that this is the fear of Sam bailing out the other competitors he has before. Now that he is the one who needs help. No one can certainly help him unless it is Binance. It's sad what is happening now in the crypto world.",

I'm sure Binance didn't just decide to take over FTX with all the problems it brings, and then post it all on Twitter, before thinking it through. at the same time, they themselves contributed to the further decline of FTX. why would they risk his own potential future investment? Or, is this \"giving up\" just another trick to reduce the value and make it easier cheapest to take over?",
