Make we brainstorm on the kind of Bitcoin-related courses we fit get. E suppose be standalone program, or we fit integrate am for existing departments like Computer Science, Economics, or Finance? Some people go dey fear for the risks wey dey involve with cryptocurrencies, like scams and price wahala.

Bitcoin courses fit increase innovation and inspire new startups for the crypto space? Wetin about research opportunities? E dey specific areas wey Nigerian scholars and researchers fit explore within the realm of cryptocurrencies? We no fit ignore the potential impact for the financial landscape. How knowledge of Bitcoin and blockchain technology fit contribute to financial  and economic development for Nigeria?",

If you tell me say, some schools for the obodo abroad don adopt blockchain technology put for there curriculum as blockchain no dey subjected to cryptocurrency alone, that one I go agree with you but to say, them dey teach am as a course, e go be say na watin I never really check on or put eye to see but, be rest assured say if you put references or source way I fit verify this thing, I go look am up.I no know how you imagine am but, e go dey very hard as e be now say any school within we naija or around the world cef go wan put bitcoin directly for there curriculum. That na because, government no really support am as e be and how you wan carry watin government no back go dey teach for there schools, dey teach them supposedly leaders of tomorrow… na wahala be that o.On the inclusion matter way you dey yan, how that one wan for happen.",

      "body": "Nigeria academic curriculum is not rap for such advance studies yet because even the ovofo oyibo that you said already offered this courses,  they are still limited to only blockchain alone since blockchain also encompass a lot of other aspects aside from cryptography. Nigeria environment enables to accommodate such advanced technology as teaching since the materials for such educational pursuit won't be available in most Nigeria schools,  and also to think that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not legal in Nigeria also paused a big limitation to such development. So my brother,  your best bet is to just stop thinking it and do your best by educating yourself in whatever ways you feels in relation to Bitcoin,  blockchain and cryptography as a field since you have access to the materials online such as bitcointalk serving as a library for such studies.",

      "body": "Of a truth, Nigerian educational curriculum is not suitable for this digital century... so many concepts and approaches still retained are obsolete and unproductive. This is the reason many Nigerian graduates are confused. The Nigerian education truly stress the students to the extent of living them to resort to self help. Consequently,  the effort that Nigerian students put is unparalleled in the world... that is why you see Nigerians topping the class abroad when they go for post graduate degree. As an Engineering student, I remembered learning FORTRAN 77 in the university when there was already MatLab and Excel, QBasic when we have C++, Visual Studios and other better softwares. They have refused to update the curriculum to reflect the reality of our time. If Nigerian educational system can incorporate Blockchain technology, and other specialised innovations, you will see people creating businesses and companies even before graduation. This will reduce the burden on government. Financial literacy will improve and this have direct impact on our economy. Unfortunately,  the ruling elites are not thinking in this direction. I just pray we wake up soon.",

Op u know sae, our government e no like bitcoin so how you wan include bitcoin to the school curriculum. In the whole world, bitcoin has not been adopted as a course but it can only be study under either computer or economics and not on its own. If government wan to add bitcoin to di curriculum, the first thing they have to do is to adopt bitcoin in the nation and include it in the curriculum and make it in general studies and also a course on it own. OP you would have included the Universities that have taken bitcoin has a course in Europe so that we would have make the comments from that angle. Those universities should be mentioned.",

An enabling environment is the greatest limitations to Bitcoin studies and development in Nigeria and just like you and others including myself have stated in out comments,  for Bitcoin to become an acceptable course of study in the University of Polytechnic the central bank of Nigeria will have to change its stances and opinion about Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrencies market in general,  and let say for sure there may be attempts to introduce this curses or even push for special training in that direction from individuals but the popularity of this still depends on governmental support for the studies. These kinds of courses are very necessary because aside from studying Bitcoin or other coins in the universities,  blockchain is what is the most important as a course/faculty or special program since blockchain encompasses other actors that are far from only Bitcoin/crypto but it usage still cut across more sectors such as health,  agriculture and the financial sectors,  this is all the sector is that could use blockchain technologies.",

Even our mama, papa and youths don sabi how bitcoin go fit change their financial situation and that of their families. Nobody d even reason how bitcoin take be ponzi scheme again, and its illegality for the country. Everyone just d invest with the amount they can afford to lose. But as bitcoin matter d currently, Nigerians still d get the double mindset towards the adoption of bitcoin due to how our government take project bitcoin give em citizens. Our government never come out open sae d support bitcoin but rather them they tell us to trade bitcoin with caution. When we don get the mind of our government first and people utilize am for their daily as another means of payment, we go now begin reason how our educational system go fit include bitcoin for University curriculum(All these steps gonna take a very long time to get actualize even when bitcoin is made legal for our country). Now, em supposed dey very far from our reasoning, until we settle the issue at hand make government grant the permission of using bank account to trade bitcoin openly as it were before.",
