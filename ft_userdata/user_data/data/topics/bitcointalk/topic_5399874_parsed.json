      "body": "It all smell scam.First, why would someone wanna buy a binance account that is fully verified in someone else's name and documents?Secondly, why would you want to sell it? So that once the buy makes a deposit in the account, you start claiming the account was stolen from you, they block the other user's funds, and you recover the account using your documents and claim the other person's funds too?",

I think this is necessary if you want to end a trade like this.Quote from: pagcryp on May 24, 2022, 09:05:54 AMalso i give the possibility for the buyer to give me an email to make it the primarly email in the account. But you can't change KYC verification documents, right? Plus it is very likely that Binance will require additional verification when withdrawing a larger amount of money.",

Post it here, so everyone can be convinced of your words. note: that you own a Binance account is no proof that you are not a scammer.Quote from: pagcryp on May 24, 2022, 12:25:26 PMand for big amount of money if you binance is full verified there is no problem in that you say that now, while you are still looking for a buyer. what will happen in two or three months, and you become unavailable?Of course, a big amount is no problem for you, it's not your money.",

There are too many risks involved here and it is better for someone to make his own account, verify it with his/her own KYC and don't take the risk of buying accounts.",
