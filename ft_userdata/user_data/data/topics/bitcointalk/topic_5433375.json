Iran first saw a huge surge of miners (roughly 2018 to 2021), many of which weren't Iranian and they were illegally mining bitcoin (without licence, not paying any taxes, and worst of all some were stealing electricity so they weren't even paying for that). The video is also from the same period.Then for the first time Iran experienced an electricity supply crisis that caused blackouts across the country. It had many reasons but one of them were the hashrate surge which forced the government to crackdown and shut down lots and lots of illegal miners.Slowly things started to change and we had another election as previous government term ended and the mining regulations were solidified too, specially after the new Energy Minister managed to solve the electricity supply issue so they started issuing more licenses to crypto miners, but this time they are trying hard to avoid the same unregulated mess that could lead to unpredictable pressure on national grid.Finally I should add that although there may be cases I don't know of (like actual Chinese owned mining farms inside Iran) but the most reliable news I can find is from the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade that clearly states \"no license were given to foreign companies so other countries don't have any direct involvement in mining, but indirectly they can invest in Iranian companies that accept foreign investment\". This is a bit old but I haven't seen any changes in the regulations.",
