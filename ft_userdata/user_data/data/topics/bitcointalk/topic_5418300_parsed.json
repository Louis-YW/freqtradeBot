  "content": "Hey Guys, I have an article about how to set your stop losses. Here is a quick summary:Full Article is here:What is a Stop Loss (SL)?Stop Loss is an order designed to limit an investor’s loss on a trading position.Why is SL important?Every time you enter a trade, you expose yourself to the risk of losing your capital. If you don’t use a stop loss order, you are exposing your entire portfolio to a loss every time you trade.Stop loss defines the risk you are taking for that particular trading opportunity.Determining where to set a stop loss:You are looking for an area, where your trade will be invalidated = where your trading idea is wrong.Popular options are:Price invalidation based on Support or Resistance levels – Identifying a price invalidation based on Support or Resistance levelsStop Loss based on ATR or another volatility indicator – It shows the average volatility for the past 14 bars. The idea behind using it: “I better put my Stop Loss outside the zone of normal volatility to avoid getting stopped by normal market moves”.Stop Loss based on the trend - There are many ways traders try to identify a trend and its strength. The easiest way to analyze them using Technical Analysis would be through moving averages (MAs). Whether you are looking at the slope of the moving average, its relationship to the price (being above or below the MA), price, or another moving average with different settings crossing it (fast and slow MA cross combinations) – all of these options can help you determine the trend direction.Fixed PnL Stop Loss - This is generally not a very efficient way to place a Stop Loss, because the market doesn’t care what % of your account you are willing to lose. If you’re for example always opening a position with the same size and using the same, say 2% stop loss, it will get placed on price levels with no regard to the previous market movements, volatility, or anything else but your balance. This can lead to you getting stopped out a lot, even though the underlying signal might be good.Trailing Stop Loss - This dynamic way of setting stop losses follows price. If you set a 5% trailing stop loss and the price keeps going up, the stop loss moves up with the price. It can be useful in trending markets or when the asset enters price discovery and traders don’t have known price levels to work with.Stop loss order types:Limit orders - set a specific price and can be executed only at that price.PROS:In crypto: Limit orders tend to cost less than market orders as they are considered “market-making” (Maker Fee)It guarantees the execution priceCONS:This stop loss can be set off only if there’s an equal or bigger buyer at that price. You risk not getting your full position closed.Market orders: set to trigger when a certain price is reached, but will execute until full position is closed – even if it means slippage (“eating through the order book”).PROS:It will close your full positionCONS:The actual execution price may vary (due to slippage = defined by volume and how thin is the order book).In crypto: Tend to cost more (Taker Fees)Stop Limit orders - There can be even more niche categorization of limit orders.Executing your Stop LossManually: Watching the price and manually clicking when the level is reached. Good if you are an intraday trader, and don’t leave open positions overnight. It is not good when price moves violently, especially in crypto, often you will not have time to react.Automatic stop loss:This is the more conventional way these safeties are implemented. In trading platforms cleo.finance you can set several simultaneous take profit orders and stop loss orders, close positions based on indicators or price movements, and set position sizes with a lot of flexibility.Closing thoughtsStop Loss defines your risk. The use of stop loss will ensure their longevity in the markets.Hope you find this helpful.",

However if you want something better, let's try stop limit orders. The stop limit order gives you more time and opportunity to close your position before any kind of terrible liquidation like Cascade effect on the market appears.These orders are useful even you only use Spot trading. It helps you to exit when price breaks a trend downwards and if you still really want to buy that coin, you will have chance to buy it at lower price.",

Well I have observed it that it is better to start on the next day so exit the current running trade is more professional for a daily trader except to take the risk of losing even when you can avoid it and do a set up for the next trading day. This advise is fine for daily trader, not for swinging. The good thing about leaving the running trade to next day is you can be lucky and take profit on it.",

These are the kind of traders that trade with even less than 1x leverage, or not more than 1x. For a trader that trade with high amount of money, starting to trade with 0.25x and not going more than 1x, but increased the money to 1x when he noticed the market would favour him. This would bring the entry price closer to the mark price four times more and a slight correction towards its position might lead to profit or reduced loss. I do not know why people do not talk about this before they should think of using stop loss. Maybe because most traders uses low amount of money to trade and starting trading with over 1x or higher leverage. But the truth is, those that profit more about trading have no option than to increase their trading fund, open position with very low amount first and average from less than 1x to 1x or not more than 2x before thinking about stop loss.

These features may be useful to other markets like forex or stock but in crypto, it could be your worst tool ever. So how do we manage our funds if we do not use a stop loss? Pretty simple my friend. Do not invest your full funds in a single trade instead do DCA slowly and gradually.

A spill over running trade is preferred for swing trading but not scalping or day trading. The reason that it is preferred for swing is because of the long time that it is expected to last and within that time, a losing trade can revert to profit before it hit on the stop loss. But using low leverage is also good for every trade except for high risk traders and they should be ready for any liquidation any time trade go wrong.",

My tradition is to plan my trades cleverly with the use of stop loss, this is the best to protect my account according to my experience. Also, I am still trading an account without the use of stop loss, the account has lasted 7 months, so I have experience with both.Once your trading strategy is good, the use of stop loss is the best.

But stop loss are for high risk traders is all that I know, low risk traders are still perfectly fine with high volatility to some extent after making use of averaging and increasing leveraging.

Only a good strategy is the strategy that makes you have a net profit, nothing else. As people say newbies should use the amount of money they can afford to lose to trade, so is stop loss recommended for newbies, just newbie. As they further trading, they may decide to use it or not after developing different strategies to see if it works for them or not.I am not against the topic though, I am only against that stop loss is not for every trader which is 100% correct.",

Good if you are an intraday trader, and don’t leave open positions overnight. It is not good when price moves violently, especially in crypto, often you will not have time to react.I find this interesting and it looks like an advise never to leave running market over to the next trading day, this is dangerous. Every trading day has it own challenges so never expect total continuation of the previous day. So close your running trade if on profit or you put stop loss if you are losing before the night falls.Every day is new, prepare a fresh set up and see direction of the market because if you leave a running to the next day, you will be emotionally confused to take accurate trading decision.I do plan my trade before pulling the trigger, I have zones for virtual Stop Loss usually at the last swing of the price while sitting down to monitor my trades, if the price reverses and move against my intended direction and once it reached my predetermined zone for placing a Stop Loss I manually close the trade and take profits as well manually if profitable, I have enough time to monitor my trades, I don't use Stop or Buy limit and Sell or Buy Stop, I always consider the high volatility of the price and wouldn't take things for granted like if the broker or exchange couldn't trigger off an automatically placed Stop Loss which will consequently lead to liquidation or wipe off my account.",
