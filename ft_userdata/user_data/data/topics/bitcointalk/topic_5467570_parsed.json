  "content": "According to the cointelegraph, the trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi has changed the repayment date by 1 year. I mean directly from  Oct 31, 2023, to Oct 31, 2024. That was so unpredictable and honestly I don't know on what basis they are delaying the repayment. Even though they have funds in their hands. It would be good if they had repaid the amount to the creditors so that they would use them according to the market's current condition. I mean according to the upcoming halving event. sourceTo be honest, I almost thought that, they would increase the repayment date. But did not think that they would put an increment of 1 year. That's so long for the waiters. But if they have waited this long then I think they can wait for another year too. Plus I have a question, is this a good factor for the market or not? I do know that, if they would pay the amount then we will see some selling of BTC, BCH and Yuan, etc. Which would cause a dump in the market. But what else I am missing other than this?",

Again, it happens again. Delay again and again, years already.Will Mt.Gox victims receive their coins back after all those delays?I doubt it but even those victims receive their bitcoins, Bitcoin market will be big enough to absorb those bitcoins if they are all sold on the market. Assume victims will receive coins in October 2024, there will be more FUD about it around that month. Assume distribution will be made, you must bookmark that article and that date to avoid likely fud attacks around that time, next year.It's important for you to cash out before that date or to prepare capital to buy dips.",

There are 24000 creditors who have been patiently waiting and now again they have to wait. I do not think this news would influence the existing market. The market is still going sideways and I do not think we will think any changes would happen. We cannot ascertain now how the market would react when they will pay what they promised. Bitcoin halving will happen next year, at the moment it is likely to happen by March. There would be a six-month gap in between to complete it, the bull market should start by that time.",

I’m not sure what games are going on here but maybe people in higher places have ordered this delay due to the halving & potential ETF approval. Maybe the expected dump following the release of coins is better served for the powers that be later on, down the road. The trustee has had plenty of time to get everything sorted for pay out at the original date. The reasoning given for delay is not good enough.",

I guess many of these victims will immediately sell off their coins when they receive the repayment. And this would have flooded the market which might lead to a drop in price. But if payment to the victims will be done in batches, then it is a welcome development. At least the sales of this bitcoin will spread within one year which will not affect the market so much. Repaying these funds in batches will also reduce errors and other complications. It is also a green light to investors I keep buying and hodling. I just hope that everybody who has lost money in MT Gox gets back their funds. It is also possible that Rehabilitation trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi and his advisers are targeting next years having and huge investment in the bitcoin sector. Maybe they want to make more money for these claimants.",

Even if they repay all the victims money today, they've already tarnished their reputation and I don't think anyone with a thinking cap would want to use the exchange.

Afaik, Their refund process is by batch so this 1 year extension is understandable since they are planning long term distribution also they might use the Bitcoin halving hype to increase their Bitcoin holding value before they liquidate it slowly to benefit on price spike.",

I guess many of these victims will immediately sell off their coins when they receive the repayment. And this would have flooded the market which might lead to a drop in price.~snip~One of the payment options is directly to a bank account, so I wonder why someone who just wants to get cash as soon as possible would choose a payment in Bitcoin at all? All these stories and speculations about how the price will fall because people will start selling en masse when they get all the coins is one of the biggest FUD that has been going around for years.If we were somewhat realistic and divided those 140 000 BTC in the following way, then we could end this story once and for all.- 40 000 BTC will be paid directly to clients in their wallets and they will mostly keep it.- 40 000 BTC will be sold by the bankruptcy trustee via OTC (over a period of time) and the money will be paid into the clients' bank accounts.- 60 000 BTC will be paid out in BTC and (there is also a BCH option), and the majority will be sold through various CEXs over a period of several months to perhaps a year.If you take this scenario into account, then it is completely stupid to think that a few tens of thousands of BTC that will be sold gradually could have any impact on the price. Of course, all this would make sense in a world where people behave rationally, but given the obsession with this topic, I have no doubt that it will be very easy to sow panic when the time comes.",

I will definitely add this thread or simply add this information on a sheet of delaying dates. To be honest, I doubt if they will repay the amount even on 2024. Because in the letter the trustee has declared that, they can still change the date according to the conditions. This raises concerns too. But fingers are crossed and let's see what will happen next. But for the time being, I feel sad for those who have their funds stuck in it but at the same time I am happy too. Because the sword of dip due to mt gox's payment, that was hanging on our heads is not removed. This means we might not see fuds related to this issue for some time now.",

Buddy, I don't think it will have much effect on the market, as per the decision it even confused the market sentiments, currently they could have a holder if the day won't be changed, or according to the market price maybe most of them took an exit. But for now, there will be no such scene as funds are not in users' hands, so any unexpected event may not occur.",

If this happens, it will cause a temporary increase in the price, and then the news will be normal. The effect of MT Gox has ended and all that will happen is a temporary pump.I just hope that the process ends quickly, otherwise when the price rises, we will start hearing that some people have sold thousands of Bitcoins, and this will be a reason to scare the price and break the ATH away from 150K.",
