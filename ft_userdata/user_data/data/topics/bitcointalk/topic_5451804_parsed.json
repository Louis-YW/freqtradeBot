Let's make predictions for next season's Serie A results!Let me start first: 1 vote for AS Roma!I'm not a big fan of Serie A (as a good Spaniard I focus more on La Liga, you know), so I'm not able to predict a winner for the Italian league.But I would advice you to create a poll linked to this thread so people can vote and see the results at a glance, like in this thread. To do that, I don't know whether you need a certain rank, or newbie is ok.Anyway, I don't know to what extent this thread duplicates this other one. Although they're talking about the same there, maybe the scope of your question is so narrow that it justifies the creation of this specific topic.",

No shade to The Special One, Mourinho, but let's keep it a hundred: Roma ain't exactly packing the most robust lineup in the league.Now, if you're jonesing for my hot take on next season's Serie A outcomes, it's Napoli or bust, fam. They've been straight fire lately, and I don't see 'em pumping the brakes anytime soon. Apologies for raining on your parade, Roma die-hards, but you might have to make do with a lower rung on that leaderboard.",

      "body": "I would say it's way too early to start making predictions on next season with this season barely over. Yeah, Napoli might have just won the league but, we've got games to go and about 4 of those.Also, the teams as we see it now is bound for some changes soon before and while the season kicks off as, there would be transfers and some of the qualities we have in some teams might be dropped or updated. It would also be a worth notation to have them play few games at the start of the season or even pre -season games to get anything on prediction. This season stats really ends with it as well.",

So Juventus was good in those days but young teams have taken over. Can you imagine what is happening to Chelsea?

This was a team that was known for it wonderful talented skillful players but today, Chelsea is no where to be found .Change is constant, that's the notion that every thing on earth has to pass through and its through that juventus was all powerful before and like you said players and coaches come and go and this is a very vital key into maintaining a high profile in football and for the past three season most clubs in the serie A are found of buying quality player and to add this football is also changing drastically as no team is no longer a small because they all feel they can compete and win the big teams as they now know that every team can be defeated. As for Chelsea same problem because a big change took place on the club and this has lead to the deep damage they are currently experiencing.",

Let's make predictions for next season's Serie A results!Let me start first: 1 vote for AS Roma!We are not celebrating Napoli who won the league, and making hurry predictions for new season. Seria A clubs are rewriting the league's history, and these great clubs are competing in other top divisions. I intend to vote for AC Milan primarily because the club is one of the best in Seria A and is always willing to compete with the best. In previous seasons, Juventus was unable to match its opponents' strengths. They were dropped when Cristiano Ronaldo and other key players left the club. Juventus suffered a significant setback. I often wonder if they'll ever be able to contend for the scudetto again.",

Juventus will not see top level European football this season and all they have to worry about is the domestic league. Inter had a relatively good season, but they had a few big name departures.I was happy to see Napoli win, I can't help but to root for underdogs. But I imagine this will be a season for the top dogs to win again.",

      "body": "looking at the signings that were made by each big team I would say that it is very difficult to predict who could win the series A, for example inter simply lost good players and I did not see them correctly compensate for all the departures of their good players, so i see inter being weak next season, but there could still be room for improvement, as for milan, although they have good players they still have serious problems in defense, so i see milan also making the same mistakes last season, as for Roma, well despite having good players and a good coach they have little orcso i see roma being a very limited team with no chance of being champions, as for napoli they lost their coach so their past performance will not be the same this season, i doubt very much they can win serie A again, so why Lastly, we have Juventus who have a bad form of playing but their coach's methods manage to bring victories, so I see that all the main teams are not doing well and therefore any of them can be lucky to win Serie A, this season they will win the team that is very lucky",
