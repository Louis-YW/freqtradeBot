  "content": "Hello! Today I have several S19 Pros hashing at about 70 Th/s, all throwing up hash board errors. I am looking to consolidate the ones that are working and have a few fully functional miners vs seven almost-fully functional miners. The problem I am running into is I am not sure which hash boards are the broken ones - how does physically identify the malfunctioning hash board? The top exhaust fan is blowing cold if that helps.",

To be slightly more specific, if you look at the manual (linked above) in section VII #4 You will find examples of the few lines of code Which youâ€™ll find in your log which tell you exactly which hashboard has gone bad.",

      "body": "Pretty simple, by checking the status page or the kernel log you will see which board is bad, regadless of the numbering be it 0,1 and 2 or 4,5 and 6.Then look at the control board where the ribbon cable plugs, there will be some labeling that corrposned to the hash boards numbers, in fact, even if the labeling on the control board was different it does not matter if says 0,1,2 or even a,b,c you just need to figure out the sequence for one miner and apply the same logic to the rest.",
