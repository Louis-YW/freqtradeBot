Please send the link to buy the wallet.dat file.Lol, why are you interested in buying the wallet.dat of someone else's wallet ? Why would they give it to you? And even if the file is hacked by someone, they would try to bruteforce and get those coins for themselves and not sell it to you for few bucks. Whats your incentive here? Instead, Im sure if someone provides you a wallet.dat file here, its going to be a new malware straight into your PC, be warned!",

Someone else (a person who deals lost bitcoin files on darknet marketplaces) needs the file and they are willing to pay up to 50 bitcoins for it. They need the link to buy it and asked me to search for the file for payment. Even if it is a scam, I would not lose anything, they are.",
