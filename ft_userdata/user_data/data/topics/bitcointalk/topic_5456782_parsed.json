  "content": "Universities are evil. This means that most people with wretched degrees from these wretched institutions have a completely worthless education. I have been trying very hard to get universities to f@#$ing apologize for promoting violence against me, and they refuse to do so. This is because universities love it when students make violent threats against their professors because universities are filled with sickos.I was a professor. As a professor, I have been threatened by students. And I was punished for cancelling class because I did not want to get f$#&ing murdered. Yes. Universities punish professors for not accepting threats against their lives because universities want to be known as the most evil and despicable of all places.I will continue to shame all of these institutions and everyone with a degree from these institutions (except for myself) because they refuse to acknowledge that violence against me is very bad.All you college graduates are ****** *** **** ** ** ****** ** ******* *** *** * ****** ** *******.!@#%% $$@&*** ***** @#$. @#$ @$& *&^%$ $% ^*#(. %^ ^*#(, 523 6439 ****** **** **** ******* *** ** ******* *** ****** **** **** *** *** *** ********.You sickos will probably side with the universities because you are full of evil and hatred.

Academics are the custodian of the knowledge of all sectors of the universe. You have been complaining that universities promote violence for a long time and you have not brought any proof to back your claim. You have told us that they threaten you with violence and we don't know how. You have also complained again that they have refused to acknowledge their wrong doing and apologize to you. This complaint has lingered for a very long time, so I think it's time to let the past go. Maybe one day, they might recognize their mistakes and apologize for their errors. But for now, I suggest that you move on.",

I can deal with insults better than I can deal with flattery because insults are sincere while flattery is gross. Unless you are using my products and services, you should not flatter me at all about anything. I am not going to spill all the details about everything. If I gave you a ton of evidence that my claims are true, you will deny that evidence anyways and you will not even look at it. Universities do not deserve to be trusted with knowledge and with the experiments that they do. I will consider letting this go. Or maybe I won't. The main thing is that universities will continue to refuse to apologize mainly because universities are full of the most bloodthirsty evil entities imaginable. And the only sensible response to this madness is for me to s@#$ on every person with a college degree that I can find.",

But they certainly do not want me to get any help. This is because they are full of murderous rage. They are truly evil people. They worship every man named Ted, Jeffrey, and Bill.My problem is that I have not been harsh enough. I need to hate people who have college degrees even more because they are from institutions that truly promote violence.If you tell me that I need to pay for f^%$ing therapy from a f@#$er who got a degree from a violence promoting university, then you should GIVE ME THE MONEY YOU B@#$% #$% F@#$FACE!!! If you are unwilling to do this, then SHUT THE F@#$ UP YOU F@#$FACE!!! YOU ARE NOT HELPING AT ALL!!! YOU ARE JUST INSULTING ME AND PROMOTING EVEN MORE VIOLENCE AGAINST ME BECAUSE YOU ARE F@#$ING EVIL AND YOU WORSHIP HITLER!!! YOU JUST WANT ME TO GIVE MY MONEY TO THOSE WHO HATE ME BECAUSE YOU ARE EVIL!!! YOU ARE A NAZI!!!I f@#$ing hate interacting with people who are completely unwilling to use my products and services. They are the worst of the worst! Do you think it is alright to go into a place of business and harass the owners without buying stuff too? But you are willing to do it to me? No. I want nothing to do with you at all. I consider you as good as a dead alligator. But you interact with me in this way because you f*$%ing hate me.The next time you demand me to prove my s@#$ to you, you should at least be kind enough to use my products and services. But you would not do that because you are an @#$hole. If you want me to provide more evidence, then you will need to PAY ME to produce that evidence. If you are not willing to do this, then SHUT UP!!!P.S. In addition to paying for the cost of therapy, you should also pay me to listen to the therapist and pretend to agree with the therapist. Anything less than this will not convince me to go to f^&*ing therapy. In fact, I will consider it a threat since you would rather report me to the mafia so that people with guns can take me away than pay me to go to therapy voluntarily. You just want people to f@#$ing murder me, don't you?",

      "body": "Sorry for everything you have gone through because of how your university treated you but you can't judge the world from a single view. In my own country students suffers from the lecturers (still yet not all are bad), Lecturals skip classes for no reasonable reasons, intentionally failing students just for them (the students) to come and pay for an upgrade of their grade (acting righteous) or just because of their lustful desires which may lead them to later sleeping or raping the student, setting topics they didn't teach in exams, more concerned on selling their books or materials than teaching, sending more materials of a course few days or a day to exam while some just drop materials within the semester and then the next time they probably come again is during exam and others.Those I listed above are some of the things students suffers from the lecturers but in everything Students here still survive but the most painful is during final year, when some students will be shocked to see that they had missing scripts or failed some course in their previous years which they never did before and then they spillover. This has made some students to come to the notion that, its during final clearance that they know their actual grades hoping they can graduate.Â With this can I say all Lecturals (even professors) are evil ? Or can I say all Universities are evil ?Â I won't say you fighting for Justice is bad, but the way you are acting makes it seems like you are delusional.

I am standing against academic institutions in my country since they refuse to acknowledge any wrongdoing. I am also standing against the chlurmcks with degrees and questioning their 'education'. Yes. You can say that universities in your country are evil. And yes you can say that most professors are evil. I will call every professor in my country who refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem evil too.I never said that I wanted therapy. But if people here want me to go to therapy, they have to pay for it and pay me to go to therapy. Anyone who tells me that I need therapy but who is unwilling to pay for the therapy is simply a piece of @#$% who needs to be flushed away. If you want me to change and to listen to @#$%shit from a therapist, then please pay me. The link is github.com/sponsors/jvanname. Or if you want me to meditate, please pay me to meditate.Responding to everyone-Everyone who refuses to stand against academic institutions that have and continue to throw violence at them is simply a b@#$% who simply does not care about its own life nor of the life of others. These b@#$%es would rather just take it than stand up against evil. No. I am not going to elaborate on how these institutions do this and what we can do about it because I already have elsewhere and because you do not deserve progress.",

In such case, the larger group would try to capture or destroy the minority through hate. It's important to stay strong as if nothing happened and try to be empathetic by understanding that the group is just fighting to survive... And your sadness makes them feel better. You could show them love at this point to assure them you aren't a danger. One of the easiest ways the majority would try to capture the minority is to continue to hate them until the minority bubble/defense is destroyed, it then becomes subject to the majority.. and begins to behave like the group. The solution is to have a stronger defense by constantly feeding and refreshing one's self with Christian Holy Bible (Book Of Psalms, Mathew, etc) and staying healthy. The Words in the books will fight for the victim and arrest the trouble makers.",
