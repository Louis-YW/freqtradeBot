In my opinion. I am not against innovation but this does not look very good.",

Lets all forget there is such technology to protect artists job. No matter what we do to defend them, there will always be an honest artist who will work 10 hours a day and sell 1 peace of art ... and his competition who will work 5 minutes a day and sell 2 claiming that it is also a handmade.",

It's another thing to complain that generative ai steals artwork or pictures online and uses it as its own. Because that's a real issue.But just the issue that something geneates art or music and steals their jobs i say tough luck. I am a musician and i totally get that some of us will be replaced by ai. Future will most likely still needs hand crafted art and actual humans. Not just for everything.Every sector of jobs were affected by industrial revolution and machines back in time, just like every sector will be affected by ai next.",

I saw that some of my friends were also minting it too. TBH the NFT generated by binance NFT generator potentially has no value as well. Those people minted it at a really cheap price.

Most of the tokens I monitored rolling out with AI has directly rugged people with their hard earned money. Now it's Binance rolling out 100's of Nfts with AI within 2.5 hours. People are still going to buy the pictures because it is from Binance and at the end the worst will happen. I have Never believed in NFT for once since inception and I have lost to it.

Well anyone can built such powerful tech for this situation but the question is, are those method will keep nft industry alive? Or just make it worse instead?",

Not just for everything.Every sector of jobs were affected by industrial revolution and machines back in time, just like every sector will be affected by ai next.I understand that in the future we will likely need less people who do manual work, music composition, art, ect.I am worried as well about the definition of \"art\" and \"artist\". So in a few years an artist will be someone who is simply able to type down some prompt and generate art through an Artificial Intelligence? It sounds kind of wrong if you asked me. If this is indeed the future then, perhaps universities should get rid of their programs for graphic designers and artists in the next years, so those people can specialize on other areas, since the AI could indeed get rid of a huge percentage of the market of handmade pieces.Â  World's getting more dystopian as time passes.",

I can't believe how crypto people hunt for such freebies, even though there is no value yet but the thought of what it could cost in near future drove people to mint it all so quickly.
