  "content": "So, I am some how pained, though I very much understand that there is nothing I could have done about this back, but assuming I am still working with this company, I probably would have approached the manager and asked that all my pensions be paid in bitcoin, and make my bitcoin wallet available to them, and also teach them how to do it just incase they don't know.Â  Why this?, I was going through my text messages today, and came across an sms alert I received on the 30th of September, 2023, from Stanbic IBTC pension managers, the pension company that my previous company was paying my pension to when I was still working with them, and indeed, my pension balance saddened, upon the realization that if my pension balance was in bitcoin, by now, I will be a millionaire. Short History I started working with this company in June of 2014, and started receiving full salary from the end up July same year, the company opened a pension account for me with Stanbic IBTC pension managers in the same July, and by July ending when salaries were being paid, pension was deducted from my salary and was paid into my pension account.I worked for this company for from July, 2014 to October 2017 when I left the company to start up my won business, so, I worked with this company for 3 years plus. When I left the company, my pension balance was around 99,000 Nigerian naira (which is equivalent to approximately $99 using today's NGN/USD exchange rate).It will be worthy to note that back then in 2014 through 2017, a dollar to naira was between 150 Nigeria naira to 300 Nigerian naira, but today, a dollar to naira is a little above 1000 Nigerian naira.So, I had the said above balance in my pension account when I left the company in 2017 and started my own small business, so, I stopped getting pension credit alert since I was no longer working wit the company, and amazingly, I never did gave attention to my pension balance or alerts until today when I was just scanning through my text messages and saw several text messages from Stanbic IBTC pension manager, I opened and the last text was sent on the 18th of October 2023, and I contained information of my pension account balance as of 30th of October, 2023, and behold, my balance was just a mere 114,000 Nigerian naira (approximately $114 using today's NGN/USD exchange rate).That is, after 6 whole years I stopped paying money into my pension account, the only interest this has yielded is just approximately 15,000 Nigerian naira (approximately $15) after six year..Absolutely unbelievable and I am really sad ðŸ˜”, I just can't help but imagine that this money at the time was being paid to me in bitcoin, by now, I will be a millionaire, if not in dollars, in fiat atleast. This is another good example and confirmation that saving fiat money in banks is the worst way for anyone to lose money, the interest is not just small, naira in itself have lost a lot of value, this 114,000 naira can literally not feed me and my family for 3 months, let alone the 15,000 naira the bank added as an interest after 6 f*king years. If I knew then, what I know now about bitcoin, I would have approached this company, and demand that they pay me my pension in bitcoin, or don't pay me pension at all, but pay me my salary in full, and from my salary, I will create a bitcoin pension for myself.",

I thought pension is the retirement money paid to those who were working in a firm, organizations and institution. It is the money giving to those who could not work again bear of old age. But from the way you explain, I am really confused. They (the company) stop paying you because you are no longer working. Please tell me more on that part, I want to know something from that sentence. I thought it is the money giving to to someone after work and not when the person is still active in the company. When you are still active in the company then it is salary that you supposed received and not pension.",

Regarding the amount of money you've saved in your pension account. I've experienced that first hand in the case of my parents. They've been saving up on their pension account for more than 20 years and the generated amount wasn't anything if they had saved the money in bitcoin. Although, it's all on a different dimension of thoughts. Not every company would want to do that for their workers. In the terms that the worker saves the money themselves, they would have done that in bitcoin. One good thing about the banks or pension companies they'll hold the money until the specific time has reached before disbursing it. But, if you did that in bitcoin, how sure are you that the funds would be there till 3 years without being spent by you. That's in the case where you're in-charge of saving the funds. It's all good having such thoughts in mind, yet if we didn't take such choice. Then, nothing else can be done about it. Especially, when we are aware of spending the money. We all wants to be millionaires, that's why we tend to feel sad when we miss such an opportunity.",

If you received the pension in bitcoins, it will be worth more by now. The Nigerian economy is in a terrible state, the value that N114,000naira would have had before in 2014, is not the same value now, It has greatly reduced. It would have been difficult to convince the company you worked for to pay you the pension in bitcoins especially when they have no knowledge of it, but it was worth trying so you even could have had the option of full salary and no pension, and then would have had more to DCA with.As an employee, the habit of investing a percent of your fiat income to purchasing bitcoins is very encouraged, so if your employers do not accept to pay you pension in bitcoins, you will not be so worried because you are already DCA-ing.",

A dollar as at October 2017 then was around 360 Naira. Converting the pension 99000 Naira as at then will be equivalent to $275 and a purchase as at that time will be equivalent to 0.06875 which would amount to $2,392 and would today be equivalent to more 2 million naira in the Nigeria currency. Although this isnâ€™t a super rich person but OP will be a millionaire in his local currency wealthy today. Following up your calculations it could also be $142,353 and not $47,451 if he had done it base on your calculationsAlso another area to consider again is the bitcoin wouldnâ€™t have actually been bought that 2017 but would have be bought gradually if the salary deducted was converted to bitcoin straight away from that 2014. With bitcoin relatively low then and the dollar to Naira exchange been around 150 naira we could have a very higher numbers up there. But the question we should be asking is would OP be able to hold on to that amount until now without selling it off?",
