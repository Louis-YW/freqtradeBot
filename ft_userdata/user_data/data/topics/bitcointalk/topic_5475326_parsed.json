In previous days we saw a memecoins on the Binance launchpad too. But it is not the sign that the market will suddenly rise. If you think that so you should also think about the other side that if it can suddenly rise so it can suddenly fall too.For you @Memebet if you are the team member so I will recommend that you should higher a manager in the services board and you should promote your website with signature campaign. By this people will make a research on your coin and if they will think that your coin has worth so they will join the presale. I think this is the best way to promote your coin if your coin is real and if you are scammer so keep away from this forum here is no space for you.Here is the Services board link. You should visit.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0",

Then he/she comes up with another feature. Quote from: Memebet on November 24, 2023, 12:05:40 PMPresenting Memebet!

As I am to much confused with what is being offered.",

So there are a lot of meme coins, not because the market is improving, but it always opens up opportunities to find new investors and manipulate prices later and lead to fraud like before.",

If you're looking for signs that the market will probably appreciate then look back on the market's reaction to the previous bitcoin halving events while keeping in mind that the next bitcoin bull run is coming in T-6 months.",

There are already some popular gambling platforms out there like Roobet, stake and a few others, that have evolved around crypto. The initiative to create a decentralized gambling platform can be profitable as this has demands in the industry but the real problem will be the trust issue. There were some gambling platforms that scammed with user funds even when they ran signature campaigns in the forum. So users need to do frequent transactions for betting and decentralized operations can solve the trust issue.",

We don't need to underestimate any cryptocurrency project because the power of it skyrocketing lies on the shoulders of the team and effort to take it to the moon. Having a good community that has real members not bots can also help and interest the community investors to invest more on it. The bull is coming and if the game is well played, we might be surprised of seeing it getting listed on so many exchanges.",
