  "content": "So with the new regulations regarding exchanges[1] in Canada, it looks like many platforms are shutting down their services in the country. To mention a few:- DyDx[1] (DEX)- OKX[2] (CEX)- Paxos[3] I've also seen mentions of Deribit and Blockchain.com in some other articles.What are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is actually necessary to avoid another FTX-scenario?

I checked the website just now and it seems they do offer stablecoin, but only USDC[1]. Does this mean the Canadian government allows exchanges to use USDC if they want to, or will this change too? At the very least I can see how they don't want to make exposure to BUSD or similar tokens as easily as before if they can't control it at all.[1] https://bitbuy.ca/how-to-buy-in-canada/usd-coin",

      "body": "While this may not necessarily prevent another FTX-scenario, at least measures are taken or enhanced to further protect Canadian customers. I don't see any problem with this. As a matter of fact, I'm highly in favor of this, of tightly regulating centralized exchanges.This is simply about compliance. If you want to operate in Canada, make the most of the market there, toe the line, comply with the enhanced pre-registration undertaking. If you won't comply, leave. It's as simple as that. The problem, however, is the prohibition of leverage trading and the use of stablecoins. If an exchange offers these two, no amount of compliance will keep them there. Either they make the necessary adjustments or they will have to pack up and leave. Anyway, for the guidance of everybody, here are the exchanges that are allowed to operate, exchanges that are banned, and exchanges that have already filed the enhanced pre-registration undertaking.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on May 12, 2023, 07:47:44 PMI'm wondering how can smaller local exchanges like Bitbuy continue to run when these big companies are shutting down one after the other.If the cats are away, the mice will play. The playground is theirs. So if I were a small exchange, I will make sure that I complied and passed the enhanced requirements. The wide Canadian market will be ours. Bitbuy is \"authorized to do business with Canadians.\" This enhanced pre-registration undertaking is actually a blessing in disguise for these smaller exchanges. Popular competitors like KuCoin and Poloniex are already banned. And with the long list of those that are about to shut down their operations, the smaller players must be happy.",

It was about the stablecoin where the regulations require exchanges' approval from Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) in order to operate and allow users to trade stablecoins. For them, I guess necessary to avoid FTX all over again. But I think it's more likely they are cracking down first and then ironing out the regulation before allowing those exchanges back to operate again.",
