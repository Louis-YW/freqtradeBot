But then for a yield farming platform like Solana Cardinal to close business despite raising 5 million dollars plus in different fund raisins shows that the trust on centralized platforms should be reduced anyways I don't know what the impact of these actions will be on investors but in general it bad news.",

      "body": "This is possibly going to happen from supporting NFT projects, they are not sustainable long term and they'll be losing more and more until it drains their finances. As Solana's Cardinal announces it Shut down, we can expect more NFT projects will turn down and vanish. I feel bad about these projects during their time and I was been anticipating such situation. This seems will lead to more panic and I wasn't sure if NFT holders still have the chance to sell their coins when most exchanges are not listing them anymore.",

NFTs were only temporarily successful for this reason: people thought they’d earn a ton of money off them. If there were no NFT apes and pepes and all of that, nobody would’ve really cared. Tell everyone you can make a lot of money off Lightning and it’ll be the next hype and trend - that’s pretty much what people only care about. Especially when euphoria’s at ATH.",

Moreover, the recent launch of Creator Studios by Metaplex seems to be the final blow. It's going to be extremely challenging (without any incentives) to keep pace with the advancements happening on Metaplex.",

There was so much hype with this project and the influencers was all for it .But just so many problems have now taken place. I do not think this token is going to be dead like other projects. But I will still hodl my SOL because it is possible we make some of our lost profits back on this project with $7.5 Billion marketcap.",
