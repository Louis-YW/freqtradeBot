  "content": "While I was a student, my roommate each time he saw me smoking was always disturbing me that he wanted to smoke with me. At first, I rejected his plea but when he persisted we started smoking together. His urge for smoking within a few months grew more than mine. He began to come home with packs of cigarettes and some bottles of beer. I don't drink alcohol but I was sure that it was the introduction to smoking that also attracted him to alcohol.Recently I met him in a motor park,  he is now a chained smoker and drunkard. He was practically wearing rags and misbehaving. I called him and we started talking, I discovered that he dropped out of school and was now unemployed. When I tried to advise him to quit this destructive character, he began to shout telling everyone that cared to hear that I was the one that introduced him to smoking. He told them that I was responsible for his problems. People on my bus began to ask me if it was true and I shamefully told them; yes!I have quit smoking a long time ago because of its health consequences. But since I met him, I have felt guilty that I am responsible for my friend's downfall. I have decided never to introduce anybody to any behavior that can be addictive no matter how mature the person might claim to be. Introducing people to smoking, drinking, sex, gambling or other counterproductive activities might be funny or interesting but it could be destructive. I am considering apologizing to him and taking him to a rehabilitation center if I ever set my eyes on him again.",

      "body": "I’m kinda loss on the introduction. Your friend badgering you to smoke with because he saw you smoking while he is still not smoking at that time right? The intro seems like he is the one teaching you how to smoke though.Don’t feel guilty because he has responsibility for himself on handling smoke. He is the one become curious on experimenting smoke when he see you that means he can still do this even to other people that doing smoke because he has urge to explore smoking. He will turn on that state eventually even if you didn’t smoke with back then. The person itself don’t blame you so you should do the same. I have a father who’s a heavy smoker too but me and my brother doesn’t turn to become a smoker even though we try it before when we are a kid.",

      "body": "At OP.Sounds like the roommate's original problem wasn't smoking. Sounds like he was too much of a psychotic introvert or something. After all, he could smoke on his own any time he wanted. But he was too chicken to be alone. He could have gone out and made other friends to smoke with, but he was too chicken to make other friends.Your problem was that you didn't recognize his problem. Your second problem was that you didn't recognize that you didn't force him to do anything... or did you jump him, and force a lit cigarette into his mouth and make him breathe by pushing on his chest.Your third problem is that you admitted to something on the bus. There are other ways to avoid questions than by outright admitting to them.Now, don't tell us you graduated with flying colors as a psychologist.",

But since I met him, I have felt guilty that I am responsible for my friend's downfall. When it comes to the incident you described, you shouldn't feel bad because you aren't the main reason for his problems. He wanted to fit in, and you gave him that opportunity even though you didn't want him to. It was a school situation, and after school you withdrew, leaving him to carry on, which led to his wayward life. Don't blame yourself; it's not your fault. The lesson I took away from this is to never be the cause of someone starting to smoke, drink, or become addicted to sex because they will point the finger at you when they ask.",

I also think tempting others to have outside of marriage sex is equally wrong.Maybe try and advise people to do the good instead of the bad, telling people to do and be good has no negative consequence, contrary to telling them or teaching them to do the bad and unholy. Make sure not to make the same or similar mistake, no one can force us how to live and what to do, he chose that path all by himself, your action might have pushed him to go on that path sooner rather later, no matter what this is his own doing.God will forgive you, don't beat yourself up and move on with your life, if you could help him to get out of that life, much better, but if he refused the help, then you have no responsibility.",

Your friend have every right not to smoke or drink because he's not a toddler, he knows what's good for him and what's not good for him.You feeling guilty is normal, at least you have conscience to look for a way to correct your mistakes if I should say.Is very bad to allow something that you suppose to control, control you as a person. If you can't withstand the urge is better to quit, so don't hit yourself that much it was meant to happen.",

Don't overbeat yourself, If you had been the one to lure and convince him to join you in smoking, the guilt you carry would have been justifiable, but the case is different. You can still go ahead with your plan to try to help him, but don't base it on because you feel guilty that you are the cause for his situation.",

I'm happy you had restrictions and this should also serve as an example for people to learn from and don't let leer pressure have so much impact on them but rather do what is right even if it means standing out of the crowd.I will advise that since you're feeling guilty for him and you now found him, you shouldn't let the incidence at the bus stop binder you from helping him,You can pay for a possible rehab for him a d place him on treatment and when his back to normal, you can get him introduced to crypto and Bitcointalk forum, that should be the best favour for him from my opinion.",

That is why we shouldn't copy some addictive habit from people because we like them,this is because it is easy for them to stop but we the copy cat might get trapped in it and will not be able to come out from it.When next you see him counsel him and tell him that there is still hope in life,use yourself as a case study,let him know that smoking is not good for him,tell him why you stopped,what helped you to stop. After all these let him know about bitcoin,explain to him how bitcoin has helped you then if he is interested,you can introduce him to this forum so that he can get busy with forum activities. Lastly always pray for him to change this bad habit that has ruined him.Merry Xmas",
