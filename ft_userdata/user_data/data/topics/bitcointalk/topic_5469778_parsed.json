  "content": "I don de reason dis matter for some time now, na im I come say make I troway am for here make una follow chuk mouth. I know say wetin bitcoin investment and real estate investment get in common be say na long term assets dem be, so dem purpose na to sell on di long run and make profit. But na which one get advantage pass? I go list some similarities and differences bellow.1: Investment capital, person fit to personally decide di amount wey im wan take start bitcoin investment, but na anoda person go de decide di amount wey im wan sell property for you. So e de easier to enter bitcoin investment pass real estate investment. Most times real estate require plenty money, while you fit start bitcoin investment with small money and latter de grow am.2: Risk, because of bitcoin volatility, im investment de risky and e no easy to accurately predict di  Price, meanwhile e de certain say as time de pass real estate go de appreciate for value. So all things being equal, real estate no get risk like bitcoin. Except in rare cases wey natural or man made disaster happen, or dispute de di property. 3: Dual purpose, bitcoin for inside wallet be fixed asset for investment level, na also working asset e because na currency im also be, so dat one mean say you fit to spend am directly take make payments. But real estate, na only fixed asset im be, so you need to sell or exchange am first before you go fit use am purchase anoda thing.4: Scam, dem fit play person wayo for both of dem. Scam de for bitcoin P2P weda na directly or through exchanges.  Also scammers fit present fake documents take sale property for you. Di lesser evil of di two na real estate, because for dat one possibilities de to trace di scammers either through electronic means or through di authority, but e no de possible like dat to trace scanners for decentralized bitcoin.5: Profitability, real estate investment de guarantee peace of mind, except for disasters as earlier mentioned, and di probability of di asset to de increase in value without depreciating de very high. On di oda hand if person fit diligently learn about di technicalities wey de inside bitcoin investment and de apply am, despite di risk involved im still de very profitable.In conclusion me I feel say real estate get more advantage pass bitcoin, because im get lesser risks and you no too need special skills to enter di investment. So I also feel say e de better to use di profit of real estate investment to start bitcoin investment, because as di saying goes wey I don learn for dis forum \" invest what you can afford to loose in bitcoin\". Abeg na wetin una think?",

      "body": "Real Estate na him we don know say be long term investment ever since before bitcoin come show him face. Wetin I see be say bitcoin volatile nature make am more superior than any investment currently, because bitcoin just came in 2009 and it is only 14 years and the price has reached 27k. Which bitcoin price has hit 65k before, if bitcoin reaches 2050, it means that no asset will be compared with it. Real estate needs a lot of money before one can invest in it and it is not for the poor. Real estate location will also determines how flourish the business will be and also it need steady maintenance. Bitcoin is for both poor and reach and all you need to do is to learn how to keep your wallet safe from hackers and hodli with regular DCA, before you know it your bitcoin portfolio will increase significantly. Bitcoin is stress free and don't need much attention like real estate. Both of them are good, if you can buy bitcoin with the same amount of you want to put into real estate, in four years time bitcoin will give your higher profit than real estate. Both of them are still the best investment one can think of.",

      "body": "With the rumors of war or fighting and unrest going on in the world currently, do you think one should invest in real estate that might be swept away by bombs or war deformity? BTC or cryptocurrency can be saved up and used in situations where the legal tender or means of doing business or trade has failed.BTC advantage is just that it can be transacted from anywhere there is access to internet as compared to real estate that might be abandoned, left to rot and  may not yield seasonal or daily profit.",

      "body": "Omo, if you go through comments for which one better pass you go confuse guy. Everybody go just come with hin different opinion... Lol.Sha, we all can't make the same choices, and I think it all depends on personal goals and likes.I really love real estate, so I can't pick BTC over it. We all know there are lots of gains from owning a land, house, or estate. It's the only asset that doesn't diminish. And as for Bitcoin, buying and hodling is less risky and has lots of gains. If you're tempted to touch or use it, there are actual fixed wallets that can be use like a fixed deposit account to help you keep it for long, and with speculations about Bitcoin price rising after 2023 till 2050, one wouldn't be worried about losing their capital.So, basically I'd say none has an advantage over the other, if you can, do both. If you can't, do what suits you best !",

We all know there are lots of gains from owning a land, house, or estate. It's the only asset that doesn't diminish. No doubt that buying land and properties have long lasting value pass btc but land too dey diminish base on certain circumstances. Those circumstances na the things wey go affect that land particularly in question. If you go buy land wey dey inside gbege, hmmm na im be say you don enter.If you buy land wey dey swampy area, that one too go make the price of the land go depreciate. I sabi say person go say how you go buy such land when dey no close your eyes but people still dey intentionally buy them hoping say government go do something on the area base on wetin dem hear for radio or television regarding construction for the place. Also sometimes buying land for dry season no too good because you no go really know about the topography of the place and during rainy season every where go open mouth. Land for places wey no get accessibility no dey increase in price as such but all these said, if government enter the area, omo those land value go shoot up. I still prefer property far above btc investment. Me I believe say btc bull na temporary and if you no sabi when the bull don expire, omo na next 4 years you go expect your profit, depending on how much price you take buy or you sell in lose.",

About the two factors wey you dey consider on property above bitcoin investment, all businesses get their challenge. That property own too, sometimes people dey pay land or house wey dey inside fight and court case. So if you dey unluck or deceived into buying the land na problem be that. Although I agree say property dey give you more time because you know need to check or recheck like as the internet business be but if you get better phone with strong network reception you go still see say to navigate the internet still easy, na passion be the thing. So we need to invest for the area wey we get passion.The other point wey you drop, yes everybody know the price of bitcoin but e still get people wey dey negotiate their own price for back like P2P or those wey dey do arbitrage buying and selling.",

I don't know about that the north, but for southern part of Nigeria the least amount wey you go get land for urban settlement na like N400k, but e no be like dat with Bitcoin because with N10k, you fit buy Bitcoin and dey use DCA dey accumulate small small. Scam or security aspect nkoor, when you buy bitcoin, as long as na you dey in possession of the wallet seed phrase na you get the Bitcoin, except you loose guard scammers collect am from your hand. But e no be like that for real estate, you fit go buy land wey dem don sell for another person, come reseller to you. Sometimes self na you fit be the genuine owner and another person fit come dey drag land with you and las las e go end for court and you go spend a lot of money, sometimes more than de money wey you take buy the land. Real estate property na one investment wey the price dey appreciate over time. I no think say e get person wey don buy land for instance N200k come sell am for N100k, if e dey happen, e dey very hard to see. But because of de volatile nature of bitcoin, you fit buy Bitcoin at a particular price for the purpose of holding, come sell am at a lesser price because of serious problem wey you enter.",

Real estate na long term investment wey don de into existence for long and it has always been profitable even before the invention of Bitcoin in 2009, and Real Estate get high assurance of profit and it contain less risk than Bitcoin investment because it is a physical investment even though it also has certain disadvantages which include natural disaster like flood, fire outbreak and so on.On the other hand, bitcoin investment comes with good profit and assurance of profit if held for the long term. One advantage that bitcoin investment has over real estate is the ability to start your investment with a small amount, unlike real estate, where you need big capital to buy land or own a house. DCA can also be used to purchase Bitcoin if one does not have enough capital to invest once; it is also possible with real estate, but you will have to follow due process that involves too much stress of signing different documents.Bitcoin investment is an investment that did not require any paper work or lawyer to get started, and it can be kept private with you alone and no onw will know if you have it because you keep your Bitcoin in your wallet.QuoteAnoda advantage of  real estate investment be say you fit bargain price of your property and sell to di highest bidder, but you no fit to bargain price for bitcoin, na wetin di market price be at di time wey you wan sell, na im you go collect.Yes, you no fit bargain the price of Bitcoin, the market will determine the selling and buying price; in this aspect, Real Estate has a great advantage over Bitcoin.But the money you will be spending on maintenance of your house or land if you own one is another thing entirely; there are different documents that you will spend a huge sum of money to purchase, which include a Certificate of Occupancy (C of O), and other valuable documents, which include court documents, and so on. But Bitcoin does not need all these; all you need to do is download a wallet of your choice, buy your Bitcoin, and send it there. That's all. There is no maintenance fee or any documental payments.In general, I prefer Bitcoin investments over real estate because I know that the money I have will not be enough to own a better land and do all the necessary paperwork to be sure I own a land or house. Therefore, if my money is not enough to go through all this stress, I will rather invest it in Bitcoin now that the price is down for three to four years.",

      "body": "I will still prefer bitcoin and my reasons are :No capital hurdle: aside being able to start hodling bitcoin in small amounts, you can also earn bitcoin through Freelancing , getting paid for doing task and others Volatility: this volatility are being use by some bitcoin investors who are trading bitcoin. Though trading seems much harder to become successful than HODL but many are making a living out of it. While Bitcoin may drop but most times when there is a huge drop, it's something that affect the stock market, forex market and others. But the good thing about bitcoin is that when the price drops it will rise again with time and the chance of a landed property to increase its value after its depreciated is lower. dual purpose:  aside from the point stated by you, dual purpose is more preferable to the fixed here because in case of emergency you can easily sell your bitcoin while for the real estate it may not be possible to get a buyer ready to buy during such state of emergency while the ones available will offer a less fee. scam:  if you follow the proper ways for going into these two investments then you can escape scam, for the real estate by going to verified trusted real estate agents can help you overcome this while for bitcoin, going to a trusted and verified vendors or following the guide given by the exchange before using the p2p. Profitability: outside all the FUD, bitcoin do better in the long run than the real estate, we can see through the price movement from the pass decade.",
