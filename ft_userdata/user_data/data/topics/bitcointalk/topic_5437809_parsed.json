You also then need the resolve to buy a falling asset (and potentially watch it keep falling). If you were awake and online at $4/$5 when you bought, would you have coped with turning $5k to $3k over the course of an hour if you were monitoring it very diligently. We might not even see a crash on that level either unless the stock markets crash too (like they did last time). There's a lot of strategies you could use and there's probably a lot of people on the sidelines with a bit of money waiting to buy events like that to make a quick profit but I don't think that's money you'll then be able to continue holding in your investment either (and would probably sell most of it when you think you've made a good profit expecting the same event to happen again).",

If the pandemic of 2020 never happened we won't have seen a buying opportunity of 3500$ for 1 Bitcoin. What do you guys have to say about this? Are we going to keep side ways until 2024 BTC halving now?Oh I see you are a type of person that, after seeing first black swan, bet that every next swan will be black. Its not how it works. Black swans are not called black swans without a reason. Its because of the fact that its an extreme rare event that no one expect to happen. Its not an every bear market must have. It would not be a black swan if it would happen every time market expect it to happen.And stop thinking about halving as a 100% certain pump event, because a black swan event for you may be a dump instead of pump after halving. How about that? And why halving is not that important in my opinion?Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on January 31, 2023, 12:59:22 PM1st halving reduced monetary inflation from 25% to 12%. Second halving reduced monetary inflation from 9% to 4,5%. Now we are getting closer and closer to the 4th halving that will reduce bitcoin monetary inflation from 1.5% to 0.7%. Both numbers are negligible compared to 8% official CPI in US, 10% in EU or 80% in countries like Turkey. Halvings fundamental impact on bitcoin price is getting lower and lower with every next halving in oppose to macro data, FED decisions, interest rates, recessions and of course ADOPTION.",

I know it has nothing to do with bitcoin but it did affect the market in a bad way.Regarding the pandemic, probably, it's the biggest opportunity for us when the price goes down to $3500 in March 2020.But I don't think that we will see that kind of opportunity again, most likely a black swan even can affect the price in the $10k-$12k levels.",

It's by definition something unpredictable so we can agree that they will happen in the future or not. Most likely they will happen as they have in the past. I really am hoping for sideways movement for a while. Moving too high now would be unsustainable and crash would kill portfolios as it would be many times worse with alts. (Also i don't know where you got number $3500 for bitcoin dip, that doesn't seem to make any sense.)",

If you spend your money prepping for an apocalypse, you miss out an opportunity to enjoy life. If you don't buy Bitcoin because you are afraid of it crashing by 50% in a few hours, you miss out on opportunity to profit from a halvening cycle. If you are afraid of rapid economic collapse and hoard gold, you miss out on profits from stocks or real estate. In my view getting prepared for a black swan event is a premium option, since it's a lot probability event, you should dedicate only a small portion of your portfolio to it. And if your portfolio is small, it's kinda pointless to do it at all.",

People won't help it but to worry when it comes. The FTX collapse is not the first and it won't be the last, therefore a black swan event is always expected to happen but we shall only hope that the next one won't be severe as the FTX and the past black swan event's so that the growth of cryptos won't be disrupted again",

The lowest price on where the public or community is been aiming is on that 10-12k price pointwhich they are really that always saying up those levels of prices.We cant tell whether we would be heading down and reach out those points or would really be just experiencing these casual retest and pullbacks in towards it price but slowly having those gradual increasing pace that most people do fail on noticing it out.",

No one see Terra Luna or the FTX collapse, specially the later when it was being manage and even went into the second biggest exchange during the height of it's success.So I don't see the price going to $3500 this year or in this bear market. I think we have reach the lowest low already (this is just my opinion).Probably some sideways, but maybe a couple of months before the halving, the price might see some light and go on a upside.",
