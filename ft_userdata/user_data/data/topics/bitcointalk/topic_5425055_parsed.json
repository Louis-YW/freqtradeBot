  "content": "AVES coin restores the availability of the previous version of ETHEREUM to the mining market and in doing so stimulates and finances green energy projects. We designed a system in that our blockchain saves 5% of each block to a publicly announced address and from which funds will be distributed to innovators of alternative energy sources. This will be done through legal community voting and published through the media.https://avescoin.iohttps://ico.avescoin.io",

      "body": "Dear customer and mining enthusiast.Ico offers starting on Dec 15, 2022, which we will be presented to the public abroad across all available media. It's true we have a pool for mining and his purpose is to test the stability of the chain and etc. Also, any user who connects to a fresh unpublished pool with over 6ghs power is potential 51% attacker, so we are forced to act. I just politely ask you not to spread false information with a freshly created account. Our project is under a legal software company and you making business damage to our company and crew. So, I ask myself what is the motive for someone to spend mining power more than 6ghs in hours? maybe the intention is to break the project in beginning or to rewrite the whole chain. Regards and let decentralisation live!",
