Like play, I realized I hardly have $100 (conversion) as my total fiat balance in all my bank accounts, over 99.99% of my money is now in Bitcoin. I was slightly using Bitcoin before joining BTT, but this forum has made me a proudly addicted user of Bitcoin (payment, trading and investments). This is a good addition because I am making more money with them unlike the fiat in banks that will just be useless for me and useful for the bank.It is so annoying when I look back at the wire transfer transactions I had performed in the past, to the point of charging me as high as $71 for a single transfer if correspondent banks are involved.A big shame on the centralized fiat because of this extortion!",

      "body": "The first time I was very disappointed with fiat was when I wanted to withdraw from bet365, only wire transfer was available for my country, $40 minimum withdrawal and it took almost 2 weeks before the money got to my bank account. It changed when I saw many foreign gambling sites on this forum with low minimum withdrawal and the money do get to my wallet within 10 minutes most times or less. One of the ways fiat is not useful for me when bitcoin is existing which is cross border payment.But that is not only all, in my country, the fiat is highly devaluing and getting more worthless as usual, the inflation rate is increasing leading to reducing purchasing power. That has been the reason many people do not prefer fiat but prefer bitcoin, while also that if bitcoin is probably investment on, can give profit. No one can invest in fiat because it always devalues.",

Doesn’t really make sense to only buy at market highs and then complain that it takes too long, to become green again. Buying when most aren’t is what gets you in the green. Also considering the economic circumstances and moment we’re in before the next halving, a drop was expected. However you’re using this moment  for braindead trolling again.

For people that have a large family and spend more, I think they should have more money in fiat to cover up their daily expenses. If the government is friendly with bitcoin, it would be very easy to convert bitcoin easily to fiat, which might make one to have less fiat.

I would however not knock down the strategy at all, people learn to take more risks the more they get their feet wet in an investment and of course, when they profit from it.

We have examples of people on the forum who are in my opinion overexposed to Bitcoin, although it depends on each individual case. If your net worth is $100M, you can have 95% of it in Bitcoin. For laughable net worths, I would start by accumulating cash, 3-6 months reserve of expenses readily available, either in cash at home or in a bank account that you can spend or withdraw from an ATM. That's what people call an emergency fund. From there I would go on to build investments. Actually that's what I did in the past and nowadays I keep adding to my investments having financial peace.

I've been in the world of investment for a while now, I don't see any immediate issue for now. Having only $100 risks you having to sell at a loss if you have an unforeseen event that costs you money, and, besides, I do not know if you expect to have everything in Bitcoin to give you future returns like those of the first cycles. I doubt it, and what is happening in this cycle should make us think along those lines.Although everyone does what he wants with his money, so I end up giving you good luck.",
