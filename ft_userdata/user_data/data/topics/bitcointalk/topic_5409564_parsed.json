I have quite an experience with designers doing things look nice and lack usefulness. If not done with extreme care, a new nice UI done by somebody not \"dreaming\" all the functionalities of Electrum may actually harm the product.",

But if latest modern UI is used, it may attract newbies to use Electrum, but for people like me, a good design is not what I need to hold my money, the functionality and the ease of use is what I mostly needed, and Electrum offers that. Electrum UI is not even that bad, you may think it is not modern enough, but the UI is also not old type too, but I think Electrum developers are more after wallet functionality than the appearance. Functionality is more important.",

Features and fixes are more important.It's also, not like they have a product they are selling. It's all free and open source, there is nothing stopping you or anyone else from going out and making the UI changes and putting them out there. You don't need permission from anyone, that is the joy of open source. Then the developers have the option of merging it or not. Make it good enough and have enough people like it and support it and I can see it getting merged. -Dave",

I prefer to make bitcoin transaction on Sundays, because highest fee priority can come down to 1 sat/vbyte.I use 1 sat/vbyte mostly on Sundays recently, there are times I will just want to use mobile Electrum directly, but the low fee priority which is estimated to be confirmed within the next 25 blocks, is not estimated accurately, it was around 3 sat/vbyte the time before the last time I tried it, it was around 2 sat/vbyte (slightly higher but not up to 3 sat/vbyte) the last Sunday, I had to open my desktop Electrum to set the fee to 1 sat/vbyte this last Sunday. The fee was estimated to be little, but mempool was indicating it to be littler which was 1 sat/vbyte for high fee priority.Quote from: Delta_Freak on August 13, 2022, 09:43:46 AMI'm not suggesting making the app less secure or functional.I'm just offering to make the mobile version more beautiful.

      "body": "@Charles-Tim, it's true that you can't always rely on the algorithm that calculates the fee when it comes to Electrum, I think there was a discussion on that topic in the past. For this reason, I always use other sources to look at the actual state of the mempool and accordingly set the fee that suits me best at that moment.Currently, mempool.space has all fees at 1-4 sat/vB, and Electrum (mobile) shows different suggestions in relation to which method of determining the fees you choose. This can confuse some users, especially the way it changes between the 3 options (nowhere does it say \"click this to change fee setup option\").",

And the fee must have been bumped before you signed it and tried to send it to the server in question, so there would be no opportunity for the server to learn of your low fee and bump it prior to this. Electrum will quite happily let you create and sign a transaction with a fee below 1 sat/vbyte, simply showing you warning that you are below the default relay fee.What is more likely is that you have output value rounding enabled under Tools -> Preferences as Cricktor has said above, which resulted in your change output(s) being slightly reduced to match the precision of your other output(s), with the extra few sats being added to your fee.",
