  "content": "My people, I trowe salut give una o!E get one thing when don de worry me for mynd for a long time and I go really want us to yarn am togetherFor were I come from like this eh, we get fishing as our local occupation and growing up na through that means man take de survive. We no really reason the fishing like any big deal, all our mind na to enter town, speak good English like those children we de watch for tv, eat like city children and just enjoy the city life. We no really know the value of our resources or make I talk am say we know even know say the fish na our legit resource, all we've really been taught in school about Nigeria natural resource just tilt to oil! oil! oil!.Now as we begin de grow up, we come know wetin be minimum wage, come also know the fake life when city people de live, come also know say most of them no de even earn that much compared to wetin we de get from ourr fishing oh! But then, their lifestyle de obviously better than our own - at least from the way we de see am from far. them De drive good cars and there houses fine die, there children de live large and the truth be say we no even measure up in any way.I come get admission for school follow enter the city, come get first hand information about so many things, na then I discover say we still fit get all those luxurious things through fishing oh. If I no forget, when I de go some holidays, I go enter river cash some fish carry am come town come sell and I go make at least 10k everyday from my sales. The thing come burst my brain o! I come reason say if we really put eyes into this sector, we fit make something reasonable out of am o!But you mean say our leaders never see this sector? Or the oil money done blind there eyes to so many other ways we fit take make money as a nation?This one I de talk about na just the one when de peculiar to me o! I no say so many of us get mad local resource when de untapped and your people de the environment de suffer because them no understand wetin dem get. When the White man come invest into those sector, them go come employ us de pay us peanut and carry our resource go develop there country.The matter long sha but I think our leaders and elits are not doing enough to tap into our numerous local resources because God don too bless Nigeria with mad resources.",

Better truth be say we no know the value of wetin we get and the government dun do this one on purpose, dem refuse to invest for this other national resources so everybody no go get food chop. Dem prefer when we dey die for hunger so when them go come back say make we vote dem and dey go eradicate the poverty we go believe them but all na wash. All the different states get wetin dem fit work on and dem go dey take care of demselfs but the government no want any of dem to dey independent but want make dem dey depend on the federal power so dem go get control to push everybody go where dem want dem to go.

Wetin we for do as a country, refine am so we go dey get better choppings from am we refuses but prefer to sell am to oyinbo make dem for give us anything wey dem like and settle our ogas at the top wey dey incharge of the exchange and dem go close mouth and sometimes self dey sell the oil to other countries while we dey here dey produce oil still dey get fuel scarcity. Wetin dey there if the government make every state chop from their own national resources and they pay the government commission, e for us to utilized all the national resources wey we get well.",

      "body": "Forget, God really bless African countries not only Nigeria sha. If we begin to the talk about on how God endowed us with mineral resources and what have you in each of 36 States of the federation you go marvel about am or even call us stupid on top that, for neglecting it and being focus on petroleum product as the thing wey d generate wealth and in the same time control the cost of food stuff in the country. From the diagram provided by our boss \"CryptopreneurBrainboss'' you go see sae each of the states wey d for the country, get wetin d know them for(mineral resources). But based on sae all focus na to go school, be a graduate, drive and build house, and above all depend on government for job opportunities. Many of us no come even know how we go use our state provided mineral resources to create wealth for ourselves. Even our state government come make the matter worst, not to train the youths in enquiring new skills or fund those you have made one or two discovering in the states.",
