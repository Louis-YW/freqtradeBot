  "content": "Binance have opened their Proof Of Reserve(POR) system to the general public, and users of the exchange can now verify their amount of Bitcoins they hold in the exchange via a Merkle Tree.Since the FTX fiasco, alot of cryptocurrency investors have lost confidence and trust in the centralized system of holding and trading coins, many now calling for a quick adoption of decentralization since its the only way investors can truly own their crypto assets..CZ, being the CEO of the (supposedly) world largest centralized crypto currency exchange, in the place of Binance, has been doing all he possibly can to see that trust returns to the centralized crypto holding/trading firms, he as been on the forefront advocating for a new system where centralized platforms can proof the the public that customers funds are indeed, in their custody, to give users the assurance that anytime they request for their money, they would get it.. This system is termed Proof Of Reserve(POR).Binance, on the 25th of November, 2022 announced the launch of their proof of reserve system where users can now be able to verify the amount of Bitcoins they hold on binance via a Merkle tree.From the root Merkle tree, it is shown that the exchange currently has BTC582,485.9302 BTC in its on-chain reserve while BTC575,742.4228 BTC belongs to customers of the exchange.What do you guys think about this?Do you think that if all other centralized platforms launch their POR, trust can really return to the centralized system of cryptocurrencies?Personally, I think CZ/Binance Is doing all they can to bring transparency and trust to centralized exchanges again, but in all, this still does not change the fact that decentralization is needed at this stage, though the effort is really commendable, but by now, decentralization ought to be on everyones mind.Let's discuss.",

We may not see it for now since it's just new but wait until several months or years and we'll see another fiasco.Maybe it will be made by other competitor of Binance or it will be Binance itself.CZ is stepping up the game for the exchanges and asking to follow him by doing such through merkle tree. On the otherhand, those that want to see their reserve funds, it's a good thing.",

Personally as non techy, I don’t know exactly how can I guarantee the data I’m viewing will help me to trust my money on holding on exchange despite this proofs using the charts provided by them.I just remember too the Kraken CEO made a comment about this few hours ago.According to Powell, a complete proof-of-reserve audit must include the sum of client liabilities, user-verifiable cryptographic proof that each account was included in the sum and signatures proving the custodian’s control over the wallets.[1]I know Binance want there users to trust them but they are doing all audit part on there own and telling people to just believe them. CZ too is very good any PR since his twitter account is followed by almost crypto user while user that he didn’t follow can’t make a comment on his post that makes it a media manipulation. [1]https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-proof-of-reserves-is-pointless-without-liabilities-kraken-ceoWhat are you talking about? You can always verify actual balances on any block chain using any 3rd party to lookup any address, etc.That is the point of blockchain and its value, everything is public data. It is self audit system.You could never prove to the whole world you have x amount of gold in a vault. You can with crypto though.",

An exchange where your coins are sent directly to the wallet of the buyer. Maybe there could be a model where there is a refund issued by the exchange if the coins are not recived within an hour. Still there is the problem with fees and also that people may not send the coins at all if they see the price went up in the timeframe they have.",

They don’t currently allow people to trace all their assets though: Binance has implemented it only for bitcoin so far, OKX has it for bitcoin, ethereum and usdt, and Phemex does it for bitcoin, ethereum, usd, usdt and usdc.They do differ is the actual verification process, some requiring downloading CSV with the whole snapshot of <CustomerId hash, asset amount>, others requiring executing some python code, some list a set of addresses that hold the coins, others additionally provide a files with a signed message to prove those addresses are theirs. Formal audits-to-be mentioned here and there too.The overall idea is that the sum of all balances for a given asset, of all customer account hashed ids, is to be less than or equal to the balance for that asset in the published list of addresses for that asset in control of the given Exchange.Of course we have to believe that all customers (probably with a non-cero balance, I’m not sure here) are actually included within the data structure that ties the CustomerId hash to its balance for the asset, and that none are left out. But since each customer can verify his inclusion in the data structure, any left out customers could call the whole thing a bluff were it to happen.Note: Proof of reserves is not proof of unhackable reserves.",

Every customer can check they are included and see that their balances are \"fully backed up\", even though they are actually running at a 50% deficit. Or even more trivially than that, they simply create a fake account on Binance and credit it with negative 500,000 BTC. Include that in the Merkle tree and oh look! Everything checks out just fine. Not only is it completely trivial for them to do this, but it is also impossible to prove they are not doing this and impossible for anyone to verify anything at all.This proves nothing.

According to the announcement, the tracker details the total assets of the company, and its affiliated public wallet addresses, along with the balances, current price and values of the wallets.CoinMarketCap reports the PoR trackers will update data every five minutes. On Nov. 22, the company tweeted a guide for users on how to navigate the tool.As recent unfavorable events in the cryptocurrency market in the past few days-weeks get more tough, with cryptocurrency businesses crashing and funds getting locked up on exchanges, coin market capitalization one of the leading cryptocurrency researchers and databases watch have introduced a new feature on the site, we're cryptocurrency users can see exchanges reserve and public wallet balance.This development was announced on the platform tweeter handle.this development from the coin market cap is a welcome development since recent events show that the CEO of exchanges is taking funds that are available for the running of the exchanges and putting it into other ventures or financing their personal lifestyle. E.G FTX exchange situation.With this feature, the current financial conditions of exchanges are made public even though this can not solve the problem of exchange crashes and hacks in totality it will help to monitor their current balance to see what their reserve hold.",

Have you ever read comments on twitter under most viewed tweets? Its 99% a spam of \"send me 1 BTC i'll send you 2 BTC back\". Its not media manipulation. Its the only way to avoid spam and scams.I’m aware on this but choosing only who will reply on his topic is a form of media manipulation too as far as I know. That spam post is just a minimal reason to turn the comment off from his post for those he didn’t choose to comment.The way I view it, He only wants to see positive response on all the opinion he is trying to post on his social media account. CZ is not an ordinary crypto influencers and newbie that reads his post same as the reply will easily believes since no one giving a criticism on his post that he limits through censorship that I mention above.Vitalik Twitter and other influential person in crypto doesn’t have this feature on the comment section of there post because they are often to criticism.I don't think it's media manipulation, today's information is not only concentrated on twitter, twitter is not the only or most popular social network. Nowadays market issues are discussed everywhere and as soon as there is a question people quickly find out and spread it on all social media channels. I don't know what the exact reason is but I think it's not media manipulation.
