Yes, you will be able to understand the basics so you will be able invest in bitcoin making an educated guess. What you will probably not understand is the algorithmic nature of block mining, but you don't need to understand that to invest.Start by understanding that bitcoin is decentralised, autonomous and limited in nature, and what each of these three characteristics means.",

Yes, I would not recommend bitcoin trading either, especially not to a person who expresses such a lack of knowledge. Better for him to understand in depth and decide, if necessary, to invest for the long term. Let him understand the meaning of the word HODL.",

But to understand the technical stuffs behind bitcoin, yeah you need to invest your time to learn it. I mean, it's better to know more about something you gonna invest in, right? At least you need basic info of it.",

Like others have said, investing in Bitcoin and Bitcoin trading are not the same thing. Like for the investment even without having experience you can just buy some Bitcoin either from an exchange or through physical means if you know of anyone that wants to sell close to you, and hold till the price is good enough for you although that's not just going to happen overnight you have to wait and during this period the price may drop significantly to the point that your coin might not worth anything of value. But as for the trading part, you have to acquire some knowledge and as long as the person is willing to learn and is committed in learning then there's hope that such a person might turn out to be very good in trading. It's going to take a lot of home studying and practicing with some simulators before you know they'll have enough knowledge to help them start up the real trading.",

Investing is rather easy and, as long as one has money he can lose (or keep locked for long time) he can invest. Historically, if one kept his investment untouched for long enough, ended up in profit.Trading is difficult and even high education may not cover it. Certain skills (coolness) are also required. So, like some others, I'll also advise you be careful and think twice before you go with trading - or just simply avoid it. To be clear: for short periods of time one can easily get lucky and end up on profit; on long term, if not skilled enough, will lose.",

Being well educated in itself is subjective, you could be low on academics but be good at something else. I don't know what you mean by statistics of Bitcoin investment but I think trading can be learnt by experience and it doesn't need you to be that pure of a genius to learn it. If it's you asking the question then that curiosity is a huge part that you'll learn in the process, just expand your research skills.",

My question is can someone who is not well educated (secondary school graduate) understand the statistics of bitcoin investment or Bitcoin trading? It's serious you question!, I don't know, I mean, you have to explain these things nowadays...there is have to explaining to young person, who was perhaps born in the 21st century, what the process is like to spend your money...Surely you play  CS (or any game), Well, not getting killed in that game is more difficult than buying or spend $10 in bitcoin.(and) With the matter of investing-trading, although it is different, is not as difficult either, no more than any activity that is intended to be developed.You are living it, e.g. just to go to university you go through the stage of high school, well, here it is no different learn the basics.Let's run an example (1st), but always is very important for everything that involves money, small amounts. So, How you start your experience in this game?, you are advancing little by little, what do you use? strategies!.Anyway, let's continue, the kids today are playing Roblox (2nd e.g.) In this game there are two processes; 1st, to buy Roblox with real Fiat money, 2nd, then trade on the platform, buy and/or sell.Nobody who was born before the 21st century had those advantages, you have had them.Now, surely it is possible that you tell me I never accessed those Internet games, etc.Well, at least they had to give you money for the allowance, food, etc.This is OK!, that is right?So, buying is in that case, (do we have to explain this?) a Coca-Cola, (3rd, e.g.) and trading is, taking that coke and selling it in glasses with ice to your friends at school, or in your neighborhood.Then, if you bussines grow and it goes well, you sell them by the liter, and buy more, and the business grows, or! quite the contrary, you don't sell anything and you go bankrupt.But if you lose everything, it was your venture, at least it in the third case, in the previous two it was time and money, but in all cases it is your time and the most important thing is money that you had available for those things and the best thing was your money.Let's go!  today's young people were born for bitcoin.It is time for young people to make Bitcoin viral, talk to your friends, learn about bitcoin!Disclaimer:Damn!, this is not an investment recommendation.Neither, that with the above, you are going to throw yourself into the void of investments, but! having that experience as information, leaves you with a bit of ability and advantage, by that I mean, if someone has some prior experience it helps and \"it may be\" that the way to start processing all the information to be on a level acceptable to understand the trade and its statistics, that is, it is more accessible to its understanding, because honestly, there are people who in their life have never had TDC, or pay bills or even had a job.
