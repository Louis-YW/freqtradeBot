  "content": "MY EXPERIENCE WITH CRYPTO FUND TRADER- WHAT IS CRYPTO FUND TRADER?Searching the net I found a platform that finances traders to operate financial markets including cryptocurrencies, at first I didn’t take it very seriously, because who would give you money just for the sake of it?Then I understood the business model, you must pay to access some trials with some rules and conditions that you must pass, and if you pass them they finance you with a capital from which you can later withdraw your profits.- WHAT ARE THE RULES AND CONDITIONS OF CRYPTO FUND TRADER?The rules are quite simple to understand and consist of two phases:- You must not lose 10% of your total account balance. - You must not lose 5% of your total account balance in a single day.- You must trade a minimum of 5 days- In phase 1 you must make 8% profit on your account.- In phase 2 you must make 4% profit on your account- They offer up to 1:100 leverage- Spreads from 15 cents in BTC (this is crazy)- No commissions per trade - They have their own platform- No time limit to pass the tests- Market open 24/7- You can hold trades even on the weekendsIf you meet the risk requirements and successfully pass the profit conditions required by the company you will get the selected capital from your account.- WHAT PLANS ARE THERE?There are currently 5 plans available, here is a breakdown of each of them with the price to be paid to access the trial:Trial to access $10,000 - $85Trial to access $25,000 - $199Trial to access $50,000 - $299Trial to access $100,000 - $499Trial to access $200,000 - $998- MY EXPERIENCE WITH CRYPTO FUND TRADERIn my experience, I bought 2 trials that I failed in a short time because I didn't understand how it works. Once I understood it, I passed a $100,000 trial where I have $116,000. I made a withdrawal of $3,500 and it arrived without any problems in 3 days.Truly if you are traders of cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, indicies, commodities... and you don’t have enough money to start trading on your own, this is an option that can certainly be a boost to your career.If you are interested, here is the link: https://cryptofundtrader.com",

Plan 1 does have that 85bucks as fee on having that 10k capital access? Who are on their right minds would be believing on such bullshit?If they are really that funding traders then it would be a bit convincing if these things would be done on known exchange then it would be that good and considerable but if it doneon their own platform? then its 101% scam attempt and should be avoided on all cost. OP are you part of the team?",

However, after seeing that you are making profits and you want to withdraw some profits, you could be asked again to send another funds to be able to withdraw such amount so that you could given a chance to unlocked the next plan. At this point they would keep toiling with you asking for another payment.This is purely scam.",

      "body": "By paying $85, I can avail $10k capital to trade and I am allowed to lose up to 10% of capital which means I can lose up to $1000 for my $85. How a company can sustain when their business model is prone for 10x losses for every subscriber.You mentioned about your withdraw arrived in 3 days but all the places I am trading are honouring all my withdraw requests within minutes.Overall this looks like a phishing attempt for those fees from $85 to $998 and probably you will be allowed to trade in demo environment and if you make 10% losses then they will not have any headache but if you manage to reach a position to request a withdraw then you may wait for infinite days to see your funds arriving at your wallet.",
