Is it too much to ask for a solution to the crippling economy and a way out for the next generation, seeing that Bitcoin investment is sure and the future if money?Let's discuss!",

I think if another person can take it upon themselves to write a proposal for this will make more sense. Though we have no problem with Bitcoin now but it will favourable once it is entrenched in the law.",

Is it too much to ask for a solution to the crippling economy and a way out for the next generation, seeing that Bitcoin investment is sure and the future if money?Let's discuss!You need to clear some differences.Bitcoin is a new take Tech and phone was also a new Tech innovation as cell phone that spread to all over countries  that year. Phone is generally accepted and use everywhere across the globe but bitcoin isn't generally accept and by acceptance, I mean the legal status. I have not seen anywhere in any country that a phone is ban or people should never use their cellphone, it's everywhere but bitcoin is not acceptable in all the countries due to individual misconception about it and Nigeria government is not different.I don't think there is going to be any difference if government should embrace bitcoin or not but Nigerians are using bitcoin everyday, they buy and sell and nobody will question your actions why you have btc or why you use it, the only place you have problem is when you are sending amount of money to another person and you include BTC OR BITCOIN in the transaction reference, that's when they block your account because it's an order from the central Bank to do so, they have warned several times that they don't want to see people involved crypto and banking but even with this rule, people use it for crypto.P2P dy gidigba for anything wey my you wan do, you can buy and sell without having any problem, nobody will stop you from investing in crypto, let's the Nigerian government face other things of the country, Nigeria is already in a mess.",
