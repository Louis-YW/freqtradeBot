  "content": "Hello! Seeing here a topic about bonuses and rewards. Decided to create a topic. It seems to me very important for players who do not understand how RTP works in a casino and why they give deposit bonuses with a large wager (x10+). Also, those who did not understand how it works before will be able to calculate EV (Expected value) by themselves. And yes, you can still find bonuses with +EV, I personally know one such casino.The best bonus is not to take the bonus if it has a big wager, because it will be -EV (-Expected value). Any casino game is -EV, if you play by the rules of the casino. I will give an example of why you should not take deposit bonuses with a high wager. The casino gives a 100% bonus on the first deposit and wager x40 (D+B) = 200 x40 = 8k, we make a deposit of $100 and they give us another $100 = $200 (wager 200*40=8k). The casino has an average RTP of 96% (percent is different everywhere, depends on slots or house games and so on). For every $100 wagered we get back $96 according to the mathematical expectation (100-96=4), $960 for 1k wager (1000-960=40), $7680 for 8k wager (8000-7680=320). And after the full wagering, we will lose $320 (D+B and also we need more $120), which gives a very large -EV. Who thinks about this and the casinos began to raise the wager.",

And after the full wagering, we will lose 400 dollars, which gives a very large -EV. I do not advise you to take any bonuses more than x10 wager (depending on RTP). These bonuses are rare. Who thinks about this and the casinos began to raise the wager.I don't understand why you say first we need to wager 50x times the deposit \"x25 (D+B) = x50\" and then you say we need to wager 50x times the deposit+the bonus \"(wager 200*50=10k)\" You've made a mistake I think. If the customer deposits $100 he will need to wager 50 x 100 = 5000$ or  (100 + 100) x 25 = 200 x 25 = 5000$",

But from what I have seen here different games may have different RTPs, so it is important to consider the specific rules and payout percentages for the games you play not the bonus. It would be good for anyone to carefully review the terms and conditions associated with the bonus offer. Look for factors such as game restrictions, maximum bet limits, and withdrawal limitations because these details can significantly impact your overall experience and whether the bonus is beneficial for you. Because every casino bonus is unique, and not all bonuses have high wagering requirements. So it is important to shop around, compare different offers, and consider your personal goals and playing style before making a decision.",

That's why this topic should be on the forum. I have been familiar with the casino for many years, more than 15 years, online and offline. The casinos are very tricky, the money does not smell and they are ready to do anything so that you leave them your money. The deposit bonus is the most important trick for newbies or those who do not want to count EV.",

But from what I have seen here different games may have different RTPs, so it is important to consider the specific rules and payout percentages for the games you play.I agree with you because casinos are businesses and they are profits oriented and at that it is very important to adhere to the strict operational conditions that helped both the gamblers and the casino but most importantly the casino is favoured when it comes to giving out free money in form of bonuses and since the casino doesn't want to give out free money the accompanied their bonuses with high wager requirements. So also we have to be smart enough to know how to apply ourselves to all the conditions that the casino may put up when we are chasing bonuses.",

You don't expect anything to come that free, you know, in as much as I still really don't understand your calculation very well, but in a normal sense, it all shows that the casino is trying to give you a harder time trying to use their bonus to win huge.If the casino wants to make things really easy for bonus players, they will quickly run out of business. Everyone will use their bonus to win big and kick them out of business.I don't think the bonus is a must, as the user can still use their normal deposited amount to wager as usual and win or lose their game without having to apply the bonus amount to their game.If we don't like the bonus, we just have to ignore it. Why are we doing that? Because other people are also using it and meeting the casino's requirements on those bonuses, and at the end of the day, they still have some winnings to take back home.",

Sooner or later on the time that you are already on your gambling sessions, then you would really be able to find out that it is really that hard to get that wagering requirement which is most playing on 35-45x or depending on some casinos but the difference isnt that much.On the time that you would really be able to realize that those multipliers are really that pain in the ass then this is where those common thoughts would kick in.Even when wagering on 10x is not that simple and you would be finding yourself been busting up along the way.",
