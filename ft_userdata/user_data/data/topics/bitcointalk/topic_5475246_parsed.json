      "body": "I guess the TDS of 1% applies for every single trade you make, whenever you buy, sell or swap. There is no way of escaping the government of you continue to use Indian Crypto exchanges likes Kuber Coinswitch, CoinDCX, WaxirZ, Etc as here when you trade the amount you get is post deduction of 1% TDS. I would suggest to go ahead with renowned international exchange like Binance as I don't think they share your data with government. But you need to be cautious while withdrawing the amount, I was in such situations and preferred OTC.",

      "body": "If you trade on International exchanges like Kucoin and Binance you could avoid the 1% TDS. The government can ask for data of Indian users from them but it won't be easy for them to procure from International exchange. The best option for traders is to use DEX like UNISWAP, Pancakeswap, and 1Inch. Almost every Indian trader is now using these dexes for trading. The DEX does not gather user data as you need to only connect your wallet while making a trade. Now every time you convert your cryptocurrency to INR you are bound to pay taxes on your profit. If you convert your cryptocurrency on a P2P exchange to INR then the government won't be able to find it out unless you make a big trade of 1 lac or more in a month. Still, the risk is very high and if you want to take that risk then do not pay any taxes but if you want to lead a simple life then pay the 30 percent tax if applicable.",

      "body": "You can avoid paying that 30% of tax by keeping your income less than 5 lacs per annum and that is the only way to avoid paying the taxes legally in India but if you use p2p exchange then you no need to report the income under crypto profits but you need to have some other sources to cover up that amount like business or something and its not possible for salaried person via corporates.Using international exchange seems like a good option but still its centralized regulated platform so we never know when they will share the data with our government so I will not take that risk.",

      "body": "Why avoid tax? Why take unnecessary risks? Pay tax and be safe from the law. The only problem with trading is the unjustified 1% TDS, avoid it by using DEX as they cannot have your identity. I personally won't recommend anyone evading the tax, it only helps the government in carrying out development projects. I know some of you would say it is like squeezing the middle class, I agree it is but that is what every country does to make the life of every citizen good. If you want to evade tax on Indian exchanges then sell your crypto on the same day for INR. They cannot trace the source if you are using your personal wallet to send crypto to an Indian exchange. There is a loophole, wherein if you do not get any gains with your cryptocurrency then you do not fall into that tax slab. If you are KYC verified and do not trade on Indian exchange but use it for converting crypto to INR then you won't get taxed.What you need to do is to sell your crypto for INR on the same day. You would need to use your personal wallet in order to do it. If you transfer funds from an exchange wallet to another exchange wallet then you would get caught. If possible use coins that are meant for privacy.",

Avoiding the tax is not an actual violation of laws but evading is, almost every rich person in India knows how to avoid the taxes and that is how they can preserve their earnings/profits to themselves.But in crypto avoiding tax is legally not possible unless we come under the 5 lakh per annum slab even for that we need to report the income and get the 12,500 claim back.",

I understand the consequence of avoiding tax but If you are in India and pay 30% tax and 1% TDS on every single trade thenÂ  no one would be able to make even a single penny but rather end up paying taxes without any income.

Use an International exchange which do not require KYC for trading, you do not need to pay TDS.

Indian government has just killed crypto industry in India and Indian exchanges as well. That is correct! That's exactly what the Indian government wants. They honestly want to kill the crypto ecosystem in India. But instead of cracking down like US, they are simply taking a wiser route where they will effectively discourage people to invest in cryptos and fill their own coffers at the same time! A typical Indian brain. But I would not suggest you to avoid taxes at any point of time. You really do not want to get in to legal troubles in India.",
