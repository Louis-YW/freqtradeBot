BONUS: There is also a SURPRISE AIRDROP happening during the promotion, so make sure that you have at least 10 USDT worth of DECODE COINS within the day. This kind of strategy is shouting a dump after the distribution of the airdrop token.  The increase of 182% is generated by the project itself by increasing the price of the token after some time of pre-selling and is not generated by the market itself.  Besides, I can't find the people behind this project so I am not sure whether the project is legit or created to scam people.",

      "body": "it sounds like an illusion but for only 10$ i think you can also try it because this is not a big amount if you are not lucky to lose, i think they do not affect you. spending 10 bucks for a session is well worth it but if you don't believe it, it's best to skip them. as for me, these types of investments i tend to ignore, i don't want to waste time looking at themQuote from: serjent05 on October 08, 2022, 10:26:05 PM Besides, I can't find the people behind this project so I am not sure whether the project is legit or created to scam people. projects like this often have anonymous teams, they don't dare to reveal their identities, not only is it dangerous for them, but if this project dies, they won't be able to do another project. this is common with junk projects, shitcoins",

But if i look at the way they offer their tokens that you described above, it seems that this project is not a good and promising project. They claim to be a Cryptocurrency and NFT exchange, even I myself have never heard of the name Decode for the crypto and NFT market, LOL. I advise you to ignore this token offer to keep your money safe.",

To good to be true, it's actually scam. It seems like your friend may try to mislead you. Scammer will be stealing your Identity and he will use it for the criminal purpose. You shall not follow your friend's order to follow him. He wants you to join in the shitty scam airdrop like that. Never try to invest your money in that shit. You will be just wasting your money to get nothing. The worst thing when you give your identity to the scammersMaybe his friend is not aware that this is most likely a scam, but without a doubt this merits at least to investigate, as why one person which you consider a friend is recommending you to invest in something which is so obvious that it is a scam, now things will be bad enough if you were just asked to invest some money in something that there is no guarantee they will pay you back, but they also want people to go through KYC, which means those people can steal your identity, and once that data is online you can never recover it.",

If it's really a good project, it will get on the list of major exchanges and that's when we can buy it and make it an investment. Too many projects like that ended up being a scam, but I'm not saying that the project will be a scam in the end. I just remind you to be more careful with such offers so that you can invest in the right project.",

Your money and your choice. It's not your money and your friend's choice. Think about that. Making money is not so easy like that. You need a very hard effort to make it happen. Don't buy such token.
