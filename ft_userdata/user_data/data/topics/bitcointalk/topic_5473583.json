  "content": "The underlying technology of bitcoin is the Nodes, they serve or play very crucial role in the maintaining the security and integrity of the bitcoin blockchain, so defining Nodes in Bitcoin context, we can say that they are very important and essential computers that work together to form the Bitcoin network.Many of us are investing and hodling bitcoin, but do not understand what Bitcoin nodes are, or how they operate or work.In this thread, we will be looking at the types of Bitcoin Nodes, and their functions/nuances.TYPES OF NODES1. FULL NODES.This is said or referred to as the bulwark of the Bitcoin network. Full nodes is responsible for the downloading of the entire history of all Bitcoin transactions and checks all Bitcoin transactions in each new block against the Bitcoin consensus rule.These rules are the pillar and fundamental principles that ensure that every single transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is valid, and also ensure that, and prevents bitcoin double-spend; that is, it makes sure that bitcoins are spent twice.We can refer to full nodes as the gold standard for bitcoin network security and verification.2. LIGHTWEIGHT OR SPV NODES. SPV means - Simplified payment verification.SPV nodes only download the block headers, and rely on full nodes for transaction verification.This is the node that strike the balance between efficiency and security, it is the SPV nodes that makes Bitcoin accessible without the heavyweight requirements of running a full node.3. THE NINING NODES. These are also full nodes, or part of it, that also work to add new blocks to the bitcoin blockchain.Mining nodes engage in the proof-of-work process which competes for the chance to add the next block, and thereby, receive the block reward.It will be interesting to know that, while all mining nodes are full nodes, not all full nodes are mining nodes as well.4. PRUNED NODES. A pruned node engages in storing only part of the blockchain.Pruned nodes download the full blockchain like a full node does, but then deletes older blockchain data that is no longer relevant or needed.This node helps in efficiently supporting the network without having to store the entire bitcoin blockchain data.FUNCTIONS OF NODES1. TRANSACTION VERIFICATION. Nodes are responsible for checking transactions for validity. As already said before, a transaction must follow certain rules, and one of such rules is, having a proper data structure and signatures, and also not exceeding the required size.2. BLOCK VERIFICATION. Nodes are responsible for verifying new blocks through solving a cryptographic puzzle, which we all, or some of us know as proof-of-work, to ensure that they haven't been tampered with.Once a block is verified, it's added to the blockchain.3. NETWORK CONSENSUS. Nodes are responsible for enforcing the network consensus rules, if for any reason, a block doesn't comply with the rules, such block is utterly rejected by the network.This consensus mechanism or rules is very fundamental and essential for the decentralization or decentralized nature of bitcoin, this ensures that no single entity has control over the currency.4. RELAY TRANSACTIONS. Nodes are also responsible for passing information along or across the network. Whenever a new transaction or block is created, nodes send this to nearby nodes, which then propagate or spread it across the network.WHY NODES REALLY MATTER1. DECENTRALIZATION. Nodes are the major contributor to the entire decentralization of the bitcoin network. With nodes spread across the globe, it's virtually impossible for a single entity to gain control over the bitcoin network.2. SECURITY. Nodes contribute significantly to the security of the bitcoin network, the more the nodes are, the more secure the network is.Like i believe some of us know, if we talk about 51% attack, the more or larger the number of nodes, the higher the difficulty for an attacker to successfully carry out a 51% attack on the network, which we can in short term, define as an entity controlling the majority of the mining power, which they can also use to influence the blockchain.3. TRUSTLESSNESS. By running a node, you don't have to trust a third party to verify transactions for you, you can independently verify the entire blockchain.RUNNING A NODE.For you to run a full node, you will have to download the Bitcoin software, and also download the entire history of all bitcoin transactions.Doing this can be resource-intensive, very expensive as it requires substantial storage space and bandwidth.Running a node contributes to the trustless nature of bitcoin, allowing users to independently verify transactions without relying on any central authority.For true believers in Bitcoin, running a full node is the epitome of commitment to the ideology of decentralization, and also the principles set forth by Satoshi Nakamoto himself.Most part of the information shared above, is born out of personal research, which lead me to this Article, where most of the information here is from.Please feel free to chip in your contribution, let's learn together.",

Can we say then that nodes are at the heart and center of Bitcoin and makes the whole thing decentralized? Yeah, you are right, from what I've leant so far, and still learning, nodes are indeed the heart and center of the bitcoin network, and the idea of decentralization is very much centered on it.I wasn't so familiar with all this too, Infact, nothing bores me like studying the technical side of bitcoin, but honestly, this is something we all that are here must try to learn how they work, if we must be true pioneers, and as well be able to teach the generation coming through us  .Quote from: pooya87 on November 10, 2023, 12:27:44 PMThe image looks misleading to me because if it is supposed to represent the Bitcoin network it has to have no kind of hierarchy since it is a Peer to Peer network and Peers are all equal.

The best is to run your own full node which is explained in the link I included. Or you run a prune node if you do not have enough disk space to store the entire blockchain. The prune node will download entire blockchain first and then store blocks base on the space of disk specified. You can run a prune node by following this guide by LoyceV",
