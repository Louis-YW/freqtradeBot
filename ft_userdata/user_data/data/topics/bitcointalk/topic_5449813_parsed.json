How is illegal if anyone can actually search for someone else on insta? No senseI agree on the picture part i wont share that initially, someone with skill should be able to find someone else only with name, birth date and location i think",

Besides how sure are you she used the exact details when signing up?What you're trying to do is a little creepy, and you will make it worse by sharing her personal details with a stranger on the internet. If she used to be your friend, then there is a probability that you had some mutual friends. Start by getting in touch with them.",

It is really not worth to share her picture with someone you don't know. Trusting someone on forums by sharing personal pictures or pictures of oa friend is not a sign of intelligence. I wonder if you guys are projecting your own experiences into this. There are many tame reasons why one person can be searching for another person on social media. It could be stalking    (creepy if the person doesn't want to be found and that profile is private.) But coming on social media to ask for it is cheap and not particularly smart. There are professional PIs that will do this in the normal course of business.",

Here is a crypto-based forum where the identity of everyone is anonymous, and they are after the knowledge of crypto and its importance to their well-being and the world at large. Not for anyone to start scrutinizing social media platforms to find a specific friend for you just because you asked for it here. If you needed to locate this your friend, I believe you should use the dark web as owlcatz suggested, rather than bringing up the subject here. This is not an Instagram page where you can find someone to assist you find a friend, just so you know.",

(Most of the people willing to help here are Newbies).  On the other hand, if he insists he would pay after he got the contact, then he may still scam and not pay because OP is also a Newbie and won't care for this account.Finding an escrow for this type of service may be difficult too.",
