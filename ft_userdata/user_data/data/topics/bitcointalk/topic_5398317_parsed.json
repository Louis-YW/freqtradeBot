  "content": "Perhaps someone can enlighten me about this... Richard Heart talks about \"delayed gratification\" where people buying into the project are \"rewarded\" for not selling and \"punished\" for selling too soon... yet projects like SAFUU and Sphere seem to offer a similar deal in that the sooner you sell, the more the 20 % Tax will affect you. Both Sphere and SAFUU are perfectly capable of matching whatever gains HEX is offering... be it 2X or 10X or whatever... you just gonna hold on to them long enough for the token to enter a bull run. During a bear market ? Much harder, and perhaps impossible because altcoin prices are always going down. By the way, I am invested in both of these ( 1K and 2K in each at current prices ) and I can tell you I have not made any money while everything is crashing. So even if I stay for 6 more months, quite likely I may not even break even after taxes with either of them. But give me a bull rally, even one lasting for only one month, and the picture changes completely. What I see with HEX is ( from what I can guess ) that you have to \"lock up\" your investment for years, so that is where I see the difference. I only need a 1 month rally for me to make money with SAFUU or SPHERE, not 3 to 6 years.",

I think the major difference between tokenized CD platforms is how they generate staking rewards. Simpler protocols just pay rewards based on inflation and withdrawal fees. More advanced contracts, like the MAXX Finance one, generate revenue from a suite of DApps, token transaction taxes, and multiple validator node rewards.",

Hope your prediction will be right about these tokens. I will hodl them until it reach 5$ per sphere token.",

SAFUU does not even have clear data about its capitalization and circulation, it is not traded anywhere except PancakeSwap. SPHERE is also a completely illiquid coin that trades somewhere on the little-known DEX MM Finance, in a little-popular WCRO/SPHERE trading pair that has trading volume under $3,500. It's hard for me to speculate on what exactly is good about these projects.",

The token like safuu and darth offered very very big APY which make the project must have faced the inflation as the main enemy caused by this can make people think only to dump their staking reward for money. You can get a good token wtih more possibility to recover. Safuu already dumped by the team after it reached 3 digits and it was going down to the 2 digits. Possible to go 1 digit as well.",

I checked how they ruined the sphere project. The team has increased the supply to about ten billion and now introduced a burning system to reduce it. When I checked, only 0.024% of Sphere tokens were burned in several weeks through over 3,000 transactions. And the last transaction was three days ago, it seems that this experiment will also fail.https://sphere.wiki/bbb",

I will hodl them until it reach 5$ per sphere token.These two coins Hex and Saffu are very much popular where sphere is just entering the market. Two years ago during the last bull market that Hex pumped to its all-time high. which went to 50 cents, killing the first two 0. In bearish market all cryptocurrencies have lost their value massively. But in the next two years, Hex will move to a unique place. Safu, on the other hand got the attention of their APY. It can be said that they haven't had a long bull market which has caused them to come down with a bearish streak. However, it is in the best position among all the projects that currently offer more APY. Sphere Finance has not received much recognition. Hope their position will be strong in the bull market.",
