Using an exchange to store your funds is a bad idea even if they claim to offer insurance etc. Even those lending platforms are facing trouble and change their ToS regularly so they don't have to pay back the user funds. Use them to trade with the money you are willing to lose, move your funds asap after you make a decent profit.",

Coinbase because they've probably got the most robust licensing (and are a principal partner for the debit cards they issue, which is something you don't get unless you open your books to them). Binance because of their reserve fund (but I can't say I've ever verified for myself this proof of reserve).I would say one day we'll see an exchange or at least a financial institution with a crypto exchange arm that'll get a true banking license along with the deposit guarantee schemes that all national banks get from their respective countries. Then I might say that's as safe as it gets (since with that guarantee it also means you open yr books to the central bank, though we all know that's not much in way of safety these days).",

      "body": "Hmm it actually depends on the definition of \"safe\" when it comes to transactions. Generally, there are exchanges which have been existing for years now (e.g. binance, etc.) and they have proven their integrity and honesty all throughout. Despite this, they are still prone to hackers given the amount of transactions that happen on their exchange.No matter how \"safe\" an exchange may be, always expect that they are still prone to hackers. That is why the golden rule is to never keep your coins inside an exchange as you will never know when or how they will be hacked (e.g. binance was hacked and ~$570 million worth of coins were stolen).",

You do not \"vouch\" for the reliability of a 3rd party platform. One common quote here is 'not to trust, but to verify\", and this applies to not trusting an exchange (be it centralized or decentralized) with the safeguarding of your assets.There are so many risks that exists besides that of a hack or a breach.Quote from: CryptSafe on November 22, 2022, 04:28:38 PMAt first identifying the problem is a basic course for rendering solutions.

You are safe to trade there and buy anything there as long as you agree to KYC, but you have to withdraw all your assets from the exchange if you want to hold them long term.Quote from: CryptSafe on November 22, 2022, 04:28:38 PMHow do you explain these things to the people whom have entrusted their funds and assets to you for safe keeping hoping that what they gave to you is under safe care only to wake up to a sad news of their assets being stolen by hackers. How do you explain all these.It is not the responsibility of bitcointalk users, but every exchange owner has a way of ensuring that your funds will be safe with them whether you trust them or not. CZ said that many times on twitter, but you have to have principles and really accurate reasons why you should believe about that. In the end, don't keep your investment in centralized exchange whatever your reasons. Your security is your responsibility, and not your keys and not your coins, it's that simple.",

How do you explain all these.Exchanges will never be safe for two reasons, the first one is that since they concentrate so much wealth they will always be the target of hackers, and even if their security is the best they can always be hit by a zero-day exploit and be hacked anyway, the second reason is that they are a business and businesses disappear, I do not have the data but how many businesses do you think survive more than 100 years? Probably that number is less than 1%, so if there is a bad management the exchange can disappear just like what we saw with FTX.",

Their level of financial recklessness and unintelligence is very disappointing. Yes it is possible to keep advancing in cybersecurity to minimize cyberattacks but as long as these exchanges are headed by individuals and are registered in a country they cannot be trusted. These CEOs can make certain financial blunders that might affect the company negatively. Unfavorable government policy also have the potential to destabilize or even cripple the operations of these centralized exchange firms.",
