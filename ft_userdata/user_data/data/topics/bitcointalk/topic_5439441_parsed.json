Are you asking the risk involved in accepting bitcoin as payment in one’s business? If so, then I would say in my experience, it just gives your customers different payment options whether they choose to use bitcoin to pay for your service is completely up to them. It won’t increase your profit margin or increase your number of customers IMO.",
