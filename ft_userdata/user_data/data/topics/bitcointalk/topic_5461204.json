I'm not sure how (even partially) signing PSBTs with only the descriptors is supposed to be possible.2- I own the private key to \"02ec372c4b6d6a6fc0964e07dd48448bc84921469fbfdc4c522da90f3a6b954fe9\", so I need to be able to partially sign at least that. Given that you can't export private keys from descriptor wallets yet, is there any way I can sign the PSBT outside of Bitcoin Core or at least fetch the private key somehow?",

If you have the private key corresponding to the public key \"02ec372c4b6d6a6fc0964e07dd48448bc84921469fbfdc4c522da90f3a6b954fe9\" you can sign PSBT outside of bitcoin core that supports PSBT feature I am sure that there are HW wallets that supports it and also it is available on Electrum too.",

Given that you can't export private keys from descriptor wallets yet, is there any way I can sign the PSBT outside of Bitcoin Core or at least fetch the private key somehow?Answer for the latter option:Given that your descriptor with secrets has derivation path, you can use your favorite tool to derive a specific private key from the master private key.Use the command listdescriptors true (need to unlock wallet) to view all of your wallet's private descriptors.Select the one that corresponds to the correct private key.Your hints would be the address type of the original address derived from that public key [pkh, wpkh, sh(wpkh), tr, etc.] and if it's a change or receiving address (internal: true or false)With the descriptor's derivation path, try to derive the private key from the xprv using tools that can do so like IanColeman's BIP39 tool.",

      "body": "SOLVED: After I updated Bitcoin Core to 25.0, walletprocesspsbt signed the PSBT and made the correct transaction requested by the service.I am not sure exactly what happened between 24.0.1 and 25.0 that changed how walletprocesspsbt (partially) signs transactions, but if I find anything while analyzing the commits, then I will report it back here.EDIT: This is caused by two commits in Bitcoin Core code:The first one is \"decodescript may now infer a Miniscript descriptor under P2WSH context if it is not lacking information. (#27037)\" - this basically means there is now a \"desc\" field inside the \"segwit\" field when you import a Mixin Safe script, which is P2WSH. Although it's not very important in this case as I manged to reconstruct the Miniscript myself.The second one is \"Descriptor wallets can now spend coins sent to P2WSH Miniscript descriptors. (#24149)\" - this is the important commit which allows walletprocesspsbt to sign transactions with keys used in Mixin Safe P2WSH scripts.Therefore, it follows that if you are using a Bitcoin Core with this commit, it must be able to process the Safe PSBT.",
