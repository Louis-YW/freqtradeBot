You just need to think realistically in dealing with this, just for one reason doesn't make it all bad in the eyes of everyone.",

You can also do a check on your network or network provider maybe you can see something wrong. Google is most reliable and you have to verify from more users before spitting on Google. How many people within you have you run check on ? I advise you do a survey of confirmation first to see the fault not from you before you come on air for that.",

The conversational artificial intelligence is capable of engaging in natural-sounding, open-ended conversations. Google has said the technology could be used in tools like search and Google Assistant, but research and testing is ongoing.",
