Most probably with USDT.The price for exchanging bitcoin from USDT and USDC would still have some difference and that still doesn't include the fee.When you are swapping (not exchanging), it would look for a price that would completely and instantly matching your request so the price would be on expensive side.And when you are buying with cards or payment processor, you are swapping with added binance fees and added payment processor fees, that would make the price higher.",

There's a possibility that the reason why you're paying so much for 1 bitcoin is probably because of the transaction fees or something, that's the only explanation that I can think of as to why they charge that much. You can put a customer support question if you want answer directly from them.Quote from: krynockhti on December 09, 2023, 12:44:40 AMIs even funny how they show $26K on the front page of the site when you are logout: https://i.imgur.com/iFdYRzD.pngWhen I login, the price is $2K more than the current BTC price $44KAll this is via the web site, not the app, the iOS app is not available in my country, only Binance.US not work in my country.It's probably something got to do with their UI/UX design, that's the only way that I can think why they're having that problem, maybe they haven't updated it yet. Did it affect your trading or something? If it didn't then you can just brush it off or report it to the Binance support, they might be able to help you. Since it's probably the website then, it's probably as I've suspected.",

From two screenshots, difference between two prices are 20k, not 2k like you described in OP.Two screenshots are like from the same pair, same trading page as I see you can enter the amount of money and see a conversion to amount of BTC you can get with that money if you initiate the buy order. None of screenshots is from their landing page.Even at their landing page, price is real-time updated like the above user said.Could you give us more details about your issue, please?Meanwhile you can log in, log out your account and see will the issue be solved?You can try to clear your browser cookies and log in your account again.",

Notwithstanding, in my experience with exchanges, I think I understand what you are trying to allege and what has happened to me with Bybit before, which explains why I stopped using the exchange. To make matters worse, my brother who also uses Bybit didn't have a similar problem when we compared it with his account.This means that they route us through different servers and perpetrate their evils in some of these servers but not all, so that it will not cause a general issue or make their bad deeds obvious. This could be very painful and it's the reason why I am now being smarter before I press the \"convert button\" in any exchange. I make sure I compare the Bid and Ask prices carefully before confirming the transaction. They could use that to raise the spread to steal from their customers under the guise of technical error and market conditions/situations at that time.",

      "body": "What method do you use to buy Bitcoin? You do not buy at the price of USDT, but rather you buy from a bank account or credit card, which requires fees in addition to the cost of purchasing Bitcoin. So the price of 46,000 is the price of Bitcoin in addition to fees. I also see below that you have exceeded the limit, so you may need to provide more documents to increase your deposit limit.Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on December 09, 2023, 04:21:48 AMI can not understand your issue. From two screenshots, difference between two prices are 20k, not 2k like you described in OP.No, the difference is that the first screenshot is $2,000 and the second is to buy half a Bitcoin, as the half is supposed to be $22,000, not $26,000.",

Contact their support to correct the errorThe price difference when logged in could be due to a number of factors, from spread, to other purchasing fees. Obviously, Binance will have to charge you a premium for the \"convenience\". Several exchanges do this if you are making an express trade.If you can a more reasonable price, try looking at offers on their c2c platform (or what they call p2p on the app)",

I want to buy.Binance put the price higher than the current market price? it seems.My buy flow is this: Buy on Binance with P2P, using my local currency (not usd dollars) to USDT, once I have the USDTs, I go to convert to bitcoin, so is there when I see the bitcoin price a little higher that even! the price that they show on the front of his page.But again! that flow is cheaper that buying direct on binance with the my credit card.",
