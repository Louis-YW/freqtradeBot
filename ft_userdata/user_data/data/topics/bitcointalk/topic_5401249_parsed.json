  "content": "How to cash USDT (preferable) or other crypto currency (stablecoin preferable) in fiat (EURO preferable) to withdraw fiat from ATM in Ireland finally (with reasonable commission)?Debit card issued by some Irish bank will be used(highly preferable). Exchange without KYC is highly preferable (Dex or centralized). The emphasis of this question is difficulty of transaction with Irish bank – I need case when such transactions will not be blocked definitely by Irish bank (or other authorities). Maybe they differentiate sources, blacklist some of sources. That It’s better to avoid. In my country(Ukraine) crypto is only started to be regulated therefore crypto owner can use any existent instrument freely. And I’m familiar with these instruments. But different countries have different adoption (regulation) of crypto and Ireland likely has its specifics.",

I never heard there is any centralized exchange that is able to make FIAT withdrawal without KYC. Since you preferred the no-KYC the most, your last option might be to use a P2P exchange, but I neither aware of one that accepts USDT or any stable coin, most of them only provide BTC or Monero. Take a look at https://kycnot.me/?cash=on for references.",

      "body": "Thank you.I agree with you. I tried to keep it simple. But I think it’s worth to clarify and differentiate 2 kinds of “exchange” meaning.1.   Exchanges that are mentioned on coinmarketcap for particular crypto currency: Binance, Kukoin, etc.2.   So called “crypto exchangers”. They name itself with different names. “crypto exchangers” is most frequently used. Usually they are enumerated in some well known web site (say, hub). In Slavic countries there is one (biggest one) – I will not provide it’s name because unlikely it’s known in western countries (and may be considered as ads here). Better to describe what these “crypto exchangers” do to explain.So, crypto owner (to sell say USDT) visit this hub. 1)   Selects what currency he wants to sell (USDT)2)   Selects type of destination payment method – say Visa debit card.3)   Hub generates list of “crypto exchangers” with rates ordered in descending order, with reputation of each.4)   Seller selects “crypto exchanger” and hub redirects him to the site of this “crypto exchanger”. (with independent domain in URL)5)   Here Seller fills data of his visa debit card. Seller specifies how much (USDT) he wants to sell. Then obtains blockchain valet address for transferring his USDT.6)   Seller transfer specified amount and waits for fiat on his debit card (5-30 minutes).In Ukraine this is the predominant way to cash crypto. It works fine. These “crypto exchangers” are relatively small firms (in comparison with say Kukoin)I just wonder - whether western countries have something similar? If yes how to properly name such “crypto exchangers”?Of course – there is no anonymity here – any transaction with visa card requires name of card holder. This “crypto exchangers” may collect such history and send it to some authorities. As soon as crypto is not forbidden in Ukraine this is not an issue. It’s not possible to avoid this evil.When I said exchange without KYC I meant exchange of 1-st type (like Kukoin) – owner can exchange his bitcoins/ETH/etc to USDT when he is happy with rate. Then he can transfer USDT to “crypto exchangers” to convert USDT to fiat on his debit card.Some months ago I would use debit card issued by Ukrainian bank to obtain fiat from \"crypto exchanger\". Then it's possible to withdraw EUR from ATM in Ireland. But comission will be not small (bad currency rate). But nowadays stability of Ukr banks is the main issue... Therefore it's better to go with Irish card. Or some EU bank card. At least it will be easier to come to Irish bank to unblock card when bank will decide to \"secure\" me.P2P.To use P2P to cash crypto one private person (B) should be able to transfer fiat to another private person’s (S) banking card. Visa/Mastercard systems do not provide easy way to do this. In different countries this is solved in different ways: in the USA I was using Zelle to send USD to my friends, in Ukraine there is its own system that allows transferring fiat between Visa cards of individuals (person B sends fiat to person S using mobile app). What system is used in Ireland for transferring EURO between private card holders during P2P process?",

But for an example, decentralized exchanges like Bisq offer various methods of payment, especially on EURO.You can see the payment method with its limitation that are available on Bisq here: https://bisq.wiki/Payment_methods. The available method may vary since it depends on the buyer itself.",
