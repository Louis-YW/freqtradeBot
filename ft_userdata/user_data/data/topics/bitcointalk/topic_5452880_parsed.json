However, the strange thing I noticed is that you're claiming that people are asking the question that how to withdraw money from crypto.com, and I'm not sure who are those people that are asking such questions?However, if you posted this in order to guide others about the usage of the activity then nothing is wrong in posting such guides, but instead of presenting it in that way, you could easily name it as a tutorial to withdraw money from crypto.com, that way people who might get trouble in withdrawing their money from the site would find it valuable.It's your first post and still you're trying to help the users. That's a really good thing, welcome to the forum! In this forum you'll find the experts of Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts. You should visit different board of the forum to learn more about it. Best of luck!",

      "body": "Just as you searched and found out the process to withdraw funds from that platform any one else that actually wants to withdraw from the platform can just also do a simple search like that and get the answers they seek it's that easy. Maybe people are questioning how they can withdraw their funds from that platform but as far as this forum is concerned I haven't seen any of such question so far, you can actually link a place you have seen it previously, I have nothing against the guide but you should first wait for such question then reply the post or comment with such guide.",

      "body": "Is there even any platform that still needs special explanations for people on how to withdraw their funds? So far as I know, platforms and exchanges these days are built in such a way that an average person who knows how to read and understand any language could be able to use any exchange. If they don't understand the difficult language, they can manually change it to any language they will understand. Never the less, thanks for the tips on how to withdraw; we never know if anyone might actually need this some day, and when they do, they might actually come across this post and solve their problem.",

Maybe he was paid to do this publicity. If this post was just OP's contribution to the forum, then it shows that he needs to read more and post less. I know that some newbies are well-grounded in the crypto space but I expect every newbie in the industry to take time and learn about the forum before making any post. I have seen many threads where newbies complain of not having merits and this kind of post is one of the reasons for such an experience. Almost everyone in this forum is aware of the dangers of CEX, especially after the fall of many perceived reputable ones last year.",

However, I suspect that this account is primarily meant for creating backlinks from the Bitcointalk forum to the owner's personal website, accountiod.com, as indicated in their posts. The account was established at 5:52 UTC, followed by the creation of this post at 5:53 UTC, and eventually going offline at 06:03 UTC. Yes, they created the account solely to post something beneficial for their website, and then abandoned it.This strategy is highly advantageous for the targeted website, as it obtains free forum backlinks. In the realm of SEO (Search Engine Optimization), this approach is often employed by spamming various forums within the same niche and embedding links to their money-making site to boost their Domain Authority.It is evident that the quality of the content on the website surpasses that of the forum posts. Typically, at this stage, writers tend to take shortcuts in producing substantial material to expedite the backlinking process. I am well acquainted with this method, as I have studied several SEO techniques to strengthen websites or articles created on personal websites.QuoteA backlink is a hyperlink from a website or forum to a target website. Its purpose is to enhance the target website's authority in the eyes of Google, enabling it to achieve a higher ranking on search engine result pages.",
