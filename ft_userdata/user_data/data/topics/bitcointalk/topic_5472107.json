  "content": "A few days ago I found an article that stated the number of bitcoin node has dropped from some high value, something like 40,000 nodes (but I did not take careful note), down to something like 10,000 nodes.  Then again, this site:  Bitcoin network node count sets new all-time high (cointelegraph.com), dated JUL 15, 2021,  states that for the first time the node count has exceeded 13,000.  Maybe that 40,000 count was something I misread.Side thought, found this site:  Tor-enabled Bitcoin nodes are back after bug on network (cointelegraph.com) that mentioned as many as 25% of the Bitcoin nodes run on TOR.  Why use TOR for a Bitcoin node?Back to the main topic.I have a basic, only very basic, concept of the need to run a node.  This includes the need to make the entire Bitcoin system resilient and prevent a 51% attack.  That attack would be rather difficult to do right now, but if the node count drops, might become a problem.This site presents some advantages of running a full note:  Why should I run a bitcoin node? — 7 reasons - Unchainedhttps://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/#:~:text=7%20reasons%20to%20run%20your%20own%20bitcoin%20node,...%207%207.%20Increase%20your%20bitcoin%20knowledge%20Edit, when first posted, the link did not work out well.  Just edited to add that link and test it.But there are no direct advantages.  No minor amount of Satoshis seem gained, meaning no financial gain.  The disadvantage is the cost of the computer and storage space, and the cost of electricity and cost to cool my house.Still, I am considering it.  The tentative plan is to buy a five year old (about) computer, install about 8 or 16 Gig of memory, Maybe a Terra byte drive for the OS and the node code, then a raid of SSD Terra byte drives for the block chain.  (I presume the block chain changes little so SSDs will last quite a while and use less power.  Make it a RAID-5 (not positive) in the event that when one drive fails it can easily be replaced with no loss of data.)  This will not be my daily use computer and will be dedicated to the node.To the question:  Have you considered running a Bitcoin node?  Why did you or why did you not start a node?  If you are running a node, private or working for a company, have you any important thoughts to share?",

I have set TOR, so I connect to it via TOR.You should be running a node for privacy. You will never be private if every interaction you have with the Bitcoin network happens through another person's electrum server. You should be running a node to help the network too. One more node setting the rules of the network and have a clear picture of the blockchain is a good thing.",

Verifying and adhering to the consensus rules set aside to guide transactions and blocks is the main or primary duty of a bitcoin node. In line with what he said, your node will participate in going through all transactions and block to determine if they'll be accepted to join the block with the most chain work; honest block. You're not required any task. It's left for miners to add new transactions to the blockchain. While the node verify if the transactions are eligible to be included to the block; before agreeing to add them in the blockchain. Nodes follow the block with the most work, which creates a possibility for 51% attack. But, it's almost impossible for a single individual or institution to possess a computing power that is more than all the computers used by miners across the globe, that can validate a block's difficulty; the number of hash-rate required to mine a block. Even possessing 39% of the computing power can perform a 51% attack thereby enforcing double spending. When a node sees such a block from a suspicious miner it'll involuntarily accept it to the block as the block with the most work and the miner can take the advantage of reversing his funds or double spend.",
