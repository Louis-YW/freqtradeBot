  "content": "Update: MuskyDoge has gone to solana through pump.fun things are feeling bullish like the rise to 3 million marketcap. It's worth looking into. https://pump.fun/DMP4om35PFGVpmbs2TsGGBUDAUDCHFDhiodGVwZ8pumpMuskyDoge is 3 years old and operates like a business. Check out muskydoge.net for more information. People always wishing they get in on the projects before they explode well should AT LEAST look into this one. Look into everything about it. They have a mobile game called \"Backyard Paintball\" which is bringing in money. Yesterday was a $700 buy which for low cap is great.The dev donated $1,050 to NAMI a mental health charity out of pocket!",

It's not much but through the ups and downs he continues to fight for a project he wants to succeed. I respect and understand your opinion attention maybe you've been at this longer than I have but if you talk to the people involved you'll see that they didn't let this die easily.

If you making a profit by investing a shit token, good for you but advising everyone to invest on shit project are wrong. If you like investing in shit token, then keep it for your self.Especially a project is gonna die without any single information team, while they can easily abandon and leave. In CMC there has so much more safe risk with over 100-200 tops project rather than a project/token who are not even in \"CMC\" and Centralized Exchange (Even not a shit exchange).MY 2 CENT out.",

This one is over a year and half old. 32K marketcap lol but they just launched a mobile game called \"MuskyDoge\" on the app store. It's like a mario brothers game. The ad revenue is used to buy and burn tokens. Bringing back the buy and hold. There's a 3% tax on transactions and rewards holders in Dogecoin. Another game is about to launch a hyper casual game to target kids. Same concept with ads buying and burning tokens.  https://bscscan.com/token/0x9c5b32b9c2196617cc874aebd63b6055864f4c69The dev donated $1,050 to NAMI a mental health charity out of pocket! This is a project dying out that the developer is trying his best to keep it on life support, after one and half years, $12k mcap, just look at the chart below, for me it will take a miracle for this project to survive. You need to work out socks off to revive the state of this project but I won't be touching this. Good luck to you and your team",
