I saw this coming. Just a few days or weeks ago, there was a post here on the forum about Google updating their policy to start allowing ads that are crypto-related, and we were all happy for such a development as Google has been blocking ads that have something to do with cryptocurrency over the years. The move for the updated ad policies was for these bitcoin ETF ads coming to them. They need to update their policies so that they can start accepting offers that relate to that. Just imagine how much this large firm is going to put in for their advertisements, making sure it's part of the first list of them that will always appear when you run a search relating to ETF. This is a both-side benefit to them.",

The major things that can make one miss the opportunity is lack of funds, procrastination, and impatience. Some people don't have funds to invest so they will miss out on this opportunity.

There are 11 Bitcoin Spot ETFs and they have to compete each other to attract capital from customers. First they need to convince people to use their Bitcoin Spot ETFs. Second they must convince them to spend money after seeing their Bitcoin Spot ETFs are better than other competitors' ETFs.People will consider ETF service fees first because it will be their paid fee for a Spot ETF. To reach to as many people as potential customers as possible, those companies must run advertisements.In a summary, there are two races among 11 Bitcoin Spot ETFs: service fee, and advertisement.Bitcoin Spot ETF fees.",

So this is why they try and promote their etfs. Because most people don’t know the difference between the various companies so if they can get you to see their ad and you go to their product info page you might decide this is the fund for you.That’s why some are saying they will donate some of their profits for bitcoin development and other blockchain uses. They are doing this to compete so you will use their fund instead of others.",

I guess when you've got a lot of investment on something and you can influence how it will move then you'll do whatever you can to promote it right and it just so happens that Google probably got some investments in those ETFs and they like increase the range of people that will see these ETFs. I think that's how it will all boil down, with more people that's exposed to these ads about ETF, they would most likely think about bitcoin first and being a normal human, it's likely that they'll forget the ETF part and think that bitcoin and bitcoin ETFs are the same, I just hope that by the time that ETF is so widespread and the talk of the town, that a lot of us are going to be able to make the most out of the potential effect of bitcoin ETF.",

We hope that this type of advertising campaign will increase investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin. In addition, the market cap of Bitcoin will also increase rapidly. Institutions managing ETFs can easily influnce investors to invest there, which can have a big impact on Bitcoin prices.Recently when the Bitcoin price fell to 38500, the news of the start of advertising campaign on Google has pushed the Bitcoin price upwards again. The increase in investment by Blackrock, Ark Invest, Fidelity also caused the Bitcoin price to reach high.",

This makes more than 8.5 billion searches a day (Internet Live Stats, 2022). Yes this statistics was on 2022, and I believe that the amount of searches that have been made on Google in 2023 was higher than 8.5 Billion per day in 2022. Let's assume that per day, there are more than 10 Billion searches. Just imagine if only 1% of those searches are regarding Bitcoin ETF's. That calculates to 1,000,000 searches per day, and all of the companies wants to expose themselves in one of the most used searched engine in the world thus, they are spending tons of money just to be at the top.As for Google, I guess they knew already from the start that Spot Bitcoin ETFs will get accepted that's why they allowed Bitcoin ETF ads on their website. Of course money is the reason why they accepted it, but aside from that, it also increases awareness to us Google users that there's thing called Bitcoin ETF. That's 3 out of 11 companies, and I expect that the other 8 companies will do the same as well.",

These firms need more exposure to different platforms to attract investors. Even if Fidelity and Grayscale have a massive clientele, they still need more customers. Google is one of the best platforms to advertise because of its large viewership. Another benefit of using Google is that it is an effective personalized advertisement platform. These firms can easily reach out to Google users who have an interest in the ETF.",

A JPEG image and being full-sized as you posted overloads the server. I too times forget to convert JPEG images to PNG, but I ensure that the image size always remains small.After seeing the above ads, I feel we are seeing free marketing of Bitcoin rather than Bitcoin ETFs.
