Transaction can stay in mempool as long as 2 weeks, but also depends on what the node runner set.But by default, mempool is 300MB, high fee transactions will replace low fee transactions when the mempool is is congested which will make the low fee transactions to be dropped out of mempool. But the fee you used is not low to the extent your transaction will be dropped if compared to how mempool is for now.",

You are currently about 22 MvB from the tip, which ordinarily isn't a huge amount and you would expect this kind of backlog to clear out within a day or so, but who knows with the constant ordinal spam all over the network. Going the other way, you'll either be waiting 14 days for the transaction to hit the time limit and be dropped, or it could possible be pushed out of the bottom of the mempool before then.Having said all that, your transaction is opted in to RBF, so you can easily bump the fee if you are desperate for a confirmation.",

      "body": "According to title of your topic, I feel you have misunderstood something about how RBF works. Note that miners prioritize transactions based on their fee rate and it doesn't matter whether your transaction is RBF enabled or not. If you flag your transaction as RFB, you will be able to replace it with a new one paying higher fee and get confirmation faster. It's not that you can get confirmation faster just because your transaction has been flagged as RBF.I just submitted your transaction to ViaBTC free accelerator. It will be likely confirmed in the next block by them. Edit:Acceleration was successful. ViaBTC included the transaction in block number 788,790.",

I was thinking if a transaction exceeds 24hrs without been confirmed on the block it will be reversed automaticallyHow long will it take to get this transaction confirmed or reversed?If the transaction fee is too low, miners may prioritize other transactions with higher fees, resulting in a delay in confirmation. If a transaction remains unconfirmed for an extended period, it is unlikely tobe reversed automatically. In most cases, the transaction will eventually be dropped from the network, and the fumds will be returned to the sender's wallet. However, this process can take up to two weeks, depending onthe specific blockchain network.If you have not received confirmation of your transaction after 24 hours, you may want to chec the status of your transaction on a blockchain explorer like what you did or contact the wallet or exchange where you sent the funds. They may be able to provide more information about the status of your transaction and offer assisstance if needed.",

I was thinking RBF works in both ways either paying higher for faster transaction or paying lesser if the tx fee is too high. And i reduced the tx fee the reason my transaction was delayed for more than 24hrs. It has been confirmed already.I still stand to be corrected!!",

There are very high minimum fees everywhere except this block where this transaction is included",
