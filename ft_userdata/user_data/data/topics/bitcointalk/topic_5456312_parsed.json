NFT and all other coins has same procedure that its price depend upon last price open trade by seller. The only difference between nfts and other coin is supply. Altcoins has huge supply while NFTS supply is less which is the reason the price of nft is changing more than alts . Other coins starting price can be determined by public sale price and now most of NFTS price can be determined by miniting price. Some projects are worthy and Its NFt price spike up huge when trade open in any big market like Opensea.",

You think an exchange for nft would be feasible or the process would be stay as is?I believe that the process of buying and selling NFTs will remain as it is today, we cannot equate NFTs with coins/tokens that have real value that can be easily traded on CEX or DEX. coins and tokens are of equal value, for example, there is a project that issues 1M tokens, all of those tokens have the same value.But what about NFTs? they are completely different, I'm not talking about the aesthetics of the NFT here, but about the scarcity of each image. But wait, did you know that in 1 NFT project there are various categories of scarcity? we can't continue this discussion if you don't even understand about it.",

I am not sure about auction facility. But in Opensea you can make an offer to the NFT owner. Regardless of the price they are listed in, you can make your own offer. So that's a good start if you are looking to get into NFT market. Now, I would like to warn you that NFT is a dead game. It has already died a painful death. So if you are looking to invest, choose bitcoin or ETH. Don't waste your money in NFT.",

NFTs have book-order however is cannot be same like coin/token because is always have low liquidity for someone who put an order.If coin, have the same low-volume they are gonna to get same situation like NFT. However, why coin/token have many order book because is filled by bot automatically change the price meanwhile NFTs don't have it because is cost a fee for the action.",

Because nft's without shape schemes on the market were sold for enormous money and I don't know exactly for what purpose they were sold. But I also think that the nft market will remain stable and will continue in this way.Recently, I have heard that people who want to bring money from other countries tell their friends to create nft, put it at high prices and buy it themselves and transfer money. It was mentioned that there is a better way than to transfer crypto money directly.",

Where they allow NFTs to be sold on their platform.Though the problem is the liquidity since the demand is not that high but if you remember most of the NFT games have their own market place where you can see the but and sell transactions, Iâ€™m not sure what you are looking for exactly, but if its about the tokens then most of the exchanges already have it.",

With the development of NFT technology and market, it can be seen that an exchange for NFT will be possible and the transaction process will remain the same.It is true that when entering the harsh phase of the market, what was considered a new mainstream before has also revealed all the previous hype. Simply because before we thought of it as a potential future, but now things are very different from the way users place interest, as well as use it.",

According to experts, trading volumes decreased from 40-70 percent for TOP collections. But that doesn't mean the NFT theme should end. No, only less to invest at this stage. The risk of not returning funds is very increased. Although on such a decline you can acquire any collection that will bring super profits. As always, a game of luck and perspective.

The only difference between nfts and other coin is supply. Im talking about the liquidity. Let say you have an nft im your wallet can you sell it right away on the current market price? Definitely youll put an order to the lowest buying bid but you need to wait first unless someone bid for your nft. But the demand for that is depend on your nft, it could be skip by someone even the price is lower. What Im saying is the capability to make your nft liquid right away which is clearly can be done by tokens.Quote from: avikz on June 14, 2023, 05:05:19 PMI am not sure about auction facility.

Yes Im aware of that been using three to four marketplace for nft. Im asking is the exchange if theres an exchange foe instant liquidity when you can sold your nft right away. Though on bluemove sui market theres a feature of instant sell even though there is no bid offer but the price is like low.",

This is what I always think. NFTs have never had real value. They have crazy prices simply because there are crazy people willing to pay big bucks for them.I'm not sure if NFTs will be successful in the exchange market. Because NFTs are a collection of digital images that have no real value in my eyes.",
