Yeah, now it's dark mode all the time and I can't override to light mode, regardless of the position of the switch. I tried on different browsers (chrome, firefox...). I figured out earlier that it may have something to do with the system settings, so I switched the system to dark mode (Windows 10), and it's dark outside too, so I guess that's how it should be.Quote from: illegally on September 02, 2022, 03:11:08 PMIt's easy to add support for other currencies, but I want to keep it simple with just Bitcoin, there are a lot of other sites for checking multiple currency prices.  Considering the new domain you have acquired, it might be interesting if you add the price of gold, purely for comparison. For example, 1 BTC is roughly worth 1 troy pound of gold right now, but when we get to $55k again it will be roughly worth one kg of gold...",

The other day I was reading  [ANN] Preev is down, Im happy to announce the official launch of Pnnv.com.I would suggest you add some more features to the site, like more currencies to convert etc. Also, it will be good if you do decide to promote your site through campaigns on bitcointalk.",
