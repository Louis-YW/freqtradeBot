  "content": "The topic of Russian aggression against Ukraine has been discussed for more than 3 months. Discussed by supporters of both sides, with different goals (of course, I am no exception)). But if at first I was mainly interested in the destruction of the terrorist invaders on my land (and this is only a matter of time), now I have begun to be interested in other issues that have emerged during these 100+ days of the terrorist attack on Ukraine. And those events that were the result of an attempt by a significant part of the world to put an unbridled terrorist country in its place (not Putin destroys Ukrainian cities and kills defenseless civilians, but ordinary Russians).So, a few introductions.1. The international system of stabilization or order turned out to be ... It turned out to be absolutely ineffective. More precisely, it turned out that on paper it is, but in reality - it is not!The UN cannot bring in peacekeeping forces, or even take any decision against the aggressor country, because ... the criminal is against, and he has the right to veto such a decision! So let's give all criminals the right to veto police action (no arrest) and court decisions against him or his friends?The Red Cross generally plays on the side of the aggressor and refuses to fulfill its functions.The OSCE - half consists of representatives of the aggressor country, and they stupidly refuse to record the crimes of their country, and sabotage the work of others.NATO, a military bloc created for defense, is AFRAID of a confrontation with an inadequate neighbor.Why do we all pay constant fees, why do our taxes go to the maintenance of these useless structures. Moreover, these huge funds could give more effect if they were invested in really useful projects, and not for the maintenance of a herd of shiny people who are not responsible for anything and constantly conferring. Oh no, the maximum you can expect is \"they will express concern\" ...No, I have no complaints, it's just that now the meaning of these structures is not at all clear.In 1939 the world was the same, behaved the same way. History teaches nothing, it's a fact!2. Another problem that is no less difficult is the world economy. Deep integration of all participants in the international market. It turns out they are not ready for a situation where one of the participants \"breaks the roof\", and he starts to do whatever he wants. And with such a participant, some believe it is necessary to \"negotiate\". Explanations - because \"there are no other options\", \"he is the only supplier\", and even agree to the legalization of his crimes (\"just give them your land, they will calm down\"). Here and the monopolization of markets, and corruption at the level of heads of state, and the lack of a well-thought-out plan of action for such cases. In a word, the world economy is not ready for such situations. Neither physically, nor financially, nor legally, in any way! And here the problem is not only in economic problems, but in the possibility of the flourishing of a new type of terrorism - economic. And the consequences of such terror can be worse than classic terrorist attacks.3. A very bad precedent has appeared - contracts and obligations can be not fulfilled. Any ! Generally ! And there will be no consequences for this! The main thing is to lie a lot and constantly, for example, to pass off murders as salvation, seizure of territory for help, to constantly speak to the facts proving the commission of a crime by you - \"it's not me!\", etc. And the rest of the world has no leverage over such \"partners\".4. Sanctions. On the one hand, a very good tool. And even efficient. But ! Returning to point 2, we see that some are simply not interested because of personal interests, someone hides behind the interests of the state and sabotages sanctions covertly or openly, someone accepts them \"under pressure.\"On the other hand, the sanctions are indeed a \"double-edged sword\" - and again, paragraph 2 showed that the market is not protected from stressful situations when one of the suppliers was given monopoly rights. And in the case of sanctions, many others begin to suffer.5. In general, it turned out that the world is not ready for such situations. Not ready to defend the accepted norms and laws. Not ready to defend the suffering, not ready to repulse the aggressor. Not ready to play by the rules and build balanced markets where there are no monopolists and there are regulatory rules that everyone follows. They are not ready to fulfill their obligations at all. This applies to both individual politicians and countries, and international organizations, and even international unions of various types!6. From the point of view of international security, and the security of individual countries, the current situation is the best gift for international terrorism! Yes Yes exactly ! The world has untied the hands of terrorists of any level with their own hands! Now they are well aware that the international community will turn its cowardly tail and whine and run into a corner if they are threatened with nuclear weapons, dirty bombs, terrorist attacks, etc. The modern world has relaxed and reacts to threats with cowardice, and not with actions.It seems that the time has come for new alliances, with those who are ready to decisively, and not just in words, fight against international crime, take on obligations and fulfill them, even if it is not very convenient or profitable. Do not follow the lead of criminals, and do not be afraid to strike back, defending the honor of yourself and the one to whom you promised help.Now I understand why Britain left the EU and why it will never return there.The worst thing is that the world decided not to fight terror, but lowered its eyes, kneel before the aggressor, try to negotiate with him, indulging the aggressor in every possible way! Let me remind you once again - there has already been such a case in history, in 1939. And then the world lost 100 million lives!I suppose that soon we will see a sluggish, but the collapse of many international institutions, and their replacement with local counterparts, but working. The world will no longer be the same as it was recently, most likely there will be several new, independent unions, decision-making centers and regional organizations of various orientations (political, economic, military).How, in your opinion, will the current situation develop, what changes await us, what can we expect in the near future?",

Russia has become a country that cannot be stopped and stands with its back to NATO countries that have submitted to the interests of their respective countries.Thanks for your reply. Agree with virtually everything!I don't quite agree with the last sentence. More precisely, it simply states the fact of what happened.And let's imagine that tomorrow North Korea, with the help of a well-known sponsor of terrorism, will create full-fledged ballistic nuclear missiles, aim them at Europe, the USA, Japan and your country!And after that, it will declare that South Korea is its territory, and it will protect Korean-speaking citizens from the \"decaying West\" and because South Korea is clearly about to attack North Korea, because the whole world is jealous of North Korea's resources. And after the invasion, all of the above will begin to threaten with a nuclear strike, in case of interference in its \"special operation to save South Korea.\"Or the terrorist organization HEZBALLAH will get their hands on nuclear weapons or dirty bombs. Will he place them in your country, in the neighboring one and many others, and will demand to recognize it, to give it half of Europe, for example, and also that everyone pays tribute to them, and that every second born boy from your country is given to them to form terrorist troops?I am sure you are categorically against such a scenario! This is logical! But now Russia was allowed to reach such a level, and now everyone is, to put it mildly, in shock. And the saddest thing is, some say it's okay, just accept their terms and they'll calm down.I believe that this is absolutely impossible to allow, and when trying to implement such scenarios described above, the whole world must, with a united front (economically, politically, military force), destroy the source of such threats. The point is not even that my country is now being destroyed, the point is that now, in fact, all international agreements, values, rights, obligations have collapsed, and if the situation is not changed, it will end very badly.",

One thing you must understand is that Ukraine is not a member of NATO, so other member countries of the organization under the NATO treaty do not recognize Ukraine as one of its members, and as a result, they are not bound to defend the territory of a non-member. UN on the other hand has as its duty peace and security, but it is achieved through mediation and settlement of dispute, and hardly through aggression, and you know every attempt to make Putin withdraw has not worked so far.I understand everything you wrote, but if we are to be objective and take away our emotions, every independent nation has the sovereign right to defend its territory, which Ukraine is doing valiantly and courageously, and should any other external nation interfere, it means they are also ready to bring the war into their own country, and endanger their own citizens, it is as simple as that, and that is what every other country seems to be avoiding. If America for example gets involved physically, be rest assured that Russia would also respond, and other countries supporting Russia behind the scenes will too, and in less than a week it could be 4 or even 5 countries involved now. Of America do that it will obviously lead to death of Americans and the war will escalate, i am sure that no American citizen will support their country getting involved physically for fear of reprisal attacks, and it is very much understandable.Sanctions was the best action they could take, that way they systematically and without any physical aggression cripple Russia to relent, it has been helpful to a good extent, but Russia is also important to Europe, so it will be difficult for every country to stick together in the demand for sanctions, some have to look at how it will affect their country economically, and for how long they can survive without Russian gas, it is a difficult situation they all are in, not that they enjoy what is going on in Ukraine, but for the sake of their own individual countries, both politically, economically, the safety and security of their citizens, their own interest etc, they have to be very careful before they act, and that is what they are doing.",

      "body": "You are absolutely right. The current collective security system turned out to be completely unprepared to adequately respond to such frankly gangster actions that Russia is now doing in relation to Ukraine, openly violating all previous international agreements and relying only on the strength of its weapons. Many states believed that this was no longer possible in the twenty-first century, so they were confused and did not know how to respond to this.The President of Ukraine and other official representatives of this state have repeatedly stated that the UN Charter is already very outdated and if it is not radically changed, then such an organization as the UN should be dissolved as incapable of making any decisions, not to mention their adequacy, timeliness and equal response .I believe that under such an international organization as the UN, there should be quite significant rapid reaction forces, similar to the \"blue helmets\", but with much greater powers to directly attack and destroy the aggressor by military means. And for this, it is necessary to radically change the decision-making system to information about such aggression, and the response should be calculated in hours, not months, as it is now. Of course, it is absolutely stupid to give the side accused of aggression the right to veto the decision of the entire body. The Charter should stipulate that all such decisions should be made without representatives of such a country, and the decision should be made by a majority or, say, two-thirds of those who voted.If Russia is not stopped hard now, it will be a very bad example for other potential aggressors. We already see that China is now waiting, and if the Kremlin is not stopped, then China will continue to take control of Taiwan militarily. And this may be just the beginning.",

I think they have already learned.Secondly, the old alliances, which have shown their inefficiency, will be replaced by new ones. I mean the role of BRICS and the CSTO will increase significantly.Thirdly, the fate of the European Union looks unenviable. I don't know what format Europe is transforming into, but it will definitely have to change a lot - just to survive.Fourth, US hegemony is over. If the US is unable to accept the new reality and learn to live within its means, stop plundering the rest of the world and inciting conflicts on all continents, there will be a nuclear war and the US will physically cease to exist. Since the Cuban Missile Crisis, the world has never been as close to nuclear war as it is now. It's good for everyone to consider this in their plans for the next couple of years - including when you choose a color to paint your house or where to go on vacation this summer.Fifthly, Russia does not need the extra burden of a new world leader, it does not need your wealth and lands (there are plenty of its own), Russia is ready to conduct a dialogue with everyone on an equal footing and honestly cooperate on mutually beneficial terms. I do not hope that you will believe me in this, but I consider it necessary to formulate it explicitly.ps I almost forgot to say a few words about Ukraine. Ukraine is in big trouble as a result of its anti-Russian policies and will be \"denazified\", \"demilitarized\" and possibly even \"decommunized\" (the latter means returning Ukraine to its pre-1917 borders).

A whole lots more countries actually.I don't know which low-level troll you are (or just a shitposter?) but as someone from Germany, I can tell you that your take is 100% bullshit and untrue. World War II happened until 1945, now we have 2022. After World War II, there was a western (capitalist) and an eastern (communist) part of Germany. Both parts were re-united in 1990. The only de-militarisation was directly when Hitler was finished and from 1949 on there was no \"sanctions against Germany military\" and Germany could build an independent military. The USA was also in favor of a military capable (west) Germany because Germany was a frontline in the cold war. But Germany didn't want to build a strong military because of its history (and also Poland was against it). I can assure you that there was no \"opression\" against Germany.  So, you claims are completely wrong. You might do a bit more research. I've looked up your posting history and I'm not surpised that your posting quality is extremely low and also completely braindead. Example: Quote from: cabron on April 25, 2022, 01:56:32 AMWe couldn't really say how much are dead on Ukraine's side. Only the Russians has the time to count their dead mean since they have this war in control. Just why? Makes no sense at all? If there's any, I would say the Russians don't have any time counting their dead soldiers, at least it makes sense from what I heard. They don't seem to care much about dead and wounded soldiers suffering from bad communication and rushed actions (some solders didn't even know they were invading Ukraine). Quote from: cabron on April 25, 2022, 01:56:32 AMUkrainian dead were even left on the roadside to rot. Quote from: cabron on April 25, 2022, 01:56:32 AMAnd the infrastructures that are destroyed are in Ukraine. If they want their country to be still like remains as is which they can pick up the pieces and resume back to where they are before the war, they could just go on with the peacetalks. Putin still offer the peacetalks afaik.Are you a troll or a shitposter? So, Putin is invading Ukraine and you are saying, Ukraine should just do peace talks? Why is there even war? Because Putin invaded. Putin has no business in Ukraine, he should just stop bombing Ukraine and stop killing civillians. It's so easy! Quote from: cabron on April 25, 2022, 01:56:32 AMIf Zelensky has care for the country he should be accepting the peace talk that Putin is offering. Sure and then, Putin would capture a large part of Ukraine now + start a new war soon because obviously it works out for him - until all of Ukraine is captured by Russia. How brainwashed are you? Or are you just here to shitpost and earn a few lousy Sats for spamming the forum?",

The breakup of Ukraine is starting.Ally to Vladimir Putin says Poland getting ready to annex a portion of UkraineQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-06-12-putin-ally-says-poland-to-annex-portion-of-ukraine.html#A top ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed this week that Poland is preparing to move into a portion of neighboring Ukraine and annex it because it historically belonged to them.As reported by Newsweek, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, said during a press conference that he believes Poland is planning to annex parts of western Ukraine, according to Russian news agency Interfax.He added that he believes there are “already a number of states actively working on [Ukraine’s] dismemberment,” but he did not specify which countries were involved. Despite the fact that Ukraine is one of the most corrupt on the continent, most European nations are backing Kyiv in its fight against Russian invaders, with several providing humanitarian and military aid, including Poland.Newsweek adds:Amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Poland has emerged as a key supporter of Ukraine, as the two countries share a border. Since the invasion began in late February, Russian authorities have made several remarks against Poland, prompting concerns that Putin might have his sights set on Poland if he takes Ukraine.“The so-called Western partners of the Kyiv regime are also not opposed to taking advantage of the current situation for their own selfish interests and have special plans for Ukrainian lands,” Patrushev said. “Apparently, Poland is already moving to actions to seize western Ukrainian territories.”The Russian official pointed to comments from Polish President Andrzej Duda during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in May when both leaders signaled they were cooperating.“The Polish-Ukrainian border should unite not divide,” Duda noted in an address to Ukrainian members of parliament. Zelensky added that the meeting would help “speed up border procedures,” Reuters reported....",

Discussed by supporters of both sides, with different goals (of course, I am no exception)). But if at first I was mainly interested in the destruction of the terrorist invaders on my land (and this is only a matter of time), now I have begun to be interested in other issues that have emerged during these 100+ days of the terrorist attack on Ukraine. And those events that were the result of an attempt by a significant part of the world to put an unbridled terrorist country in its place (not Putin destroys Ukrainian cities and kills defenseless civilians, but ordinary Russians).How, in your opinion, will the current situation develop, what changes await us, what can we expect in the near future?Let's face it, Putin is an old man who is coming to the end of his life. Just in the last few days he has compared himself to Peter the Great and claims he wants to conquer more land for Russia. Every country deserves to be proud of parts of their history, but this war which has killed tens of thousands, is nothing but trying to build a legacy for Putin. He has achieved nothing for Russia in the last 22 years of power, so his last resort and act of distraction is to kill, rape and pillage other countries. It is a sick, sick ending and every Russian should be thoroughly ashamed of their government.Here, in fact, everything is simple, but because of this it is difficult ... The problem is that the world allowed a crazy maniac to seize nuclear weapons, monopolize energy resources from one of the most advanced unions - the EU, and threaten and demand with impunity.  At the same time, from his population, he made a herd of slaves, obedient and cowardly, assistants to a maniac, who, instead of improving life in their own country, break everything they can with their neighbors.  And the difficulty is that in addition to the USA and Britain, Poland and several other countries, all the rest are either afraid or tied to this maniac.  In fact, the West does not understand the reality of the threat and the fact that from this maniac, now Ukraine, at the cost of the lives of its citizens, destroyed cities, destroyed economy, is saving their calm, quite satisfying life.  At the same time, the West thinks that it will all end on its own, and there will be no need to resist the maniac, and in general, you can give part of Ukraine to the maniac, he will calm down .... And he just needs to be destroyed by joint efforts, but some suggest \"saving the face of a maniac\" or \"do not provoke a maniac\"Quote from: sovie on June 12, 2022, 06:54:21 PMThere is a rise and fall of the empires - and Russia is going to rise again. I am not sure why the whole EU has turned against the Russia knowing that they depend on Russia for fuel supply, Let's discuss such an example - there was a marginalized type, a thief.  At one fine moment, he was punished, and he was out of the community for many years.  When he was released again, he decided, firstly, to change his profile, and secondly, he harbored a grudge against everyone who did not support him.  Those.  at all, except for their own, the same cronies of thieves.  So, he became a drug dealer.  And now he is trying, and he is succeeding (by deceit, bribery, threats, etc.) to get the neighbors to take hard synthetic drugs.  After some time, some of the neighbors, for one reason or another, became drug addicts, and the drug dealer began to profit from these people.  Moreover, he decided that those who do not want to buy his drugs, but also tell the truth about him, he must be to kill and destroy his house.  In your post, this is presented as \"The former rascal thief has risen\"!  Yes exactly !  But I am sure that this time, this \"chick\" will receive capital punishment or life imprisonment, without the right to parole!  No \"next rise\" Quote from: BADecker on June 13, 2022, 03:49:18 PMThe world will be different, again.

And I'll explain. A reasonable person, or reasonable action, is usually aimed at achieving some goals that will bring about positive changes or achievements. Logical, right? Well, for example - harvesting is reasonable, but breaking your leg with a hammer is idiocy. So the top of the Kremlin does anything! But only not actions to IMPROVE in their own country, but only enough of them to break and spoil everything good for their neighbors, knowing that it will not be they themselves, the Kremlin criminals, who will suffer, but the ordinary people of Russia and those countries where they came to \"save and protect\" people from the good life. And this is just pure inadequacy! If you do not agree, I will be happy to hear your reasoned opinion.PS Yes, for information. Taken from Russian sources: 80% of Russians started saving in the spring of 2022. Most of the respondents said that they are trying to save on everything (44%), some even on food, follows from a survey by the Zarplata.ru service. The main reason for savings 61% of respondents named the increase in prices.",

There are loads of Ukrainians who live in Russia and vice-versa.The problems that made the war were interference by at least the US, but by some nations of Europe, as well. The US made the Ukraine's \"playful\" slapping of Russia, and Russia's playful slapping of the Ukraine - slapping that has been going on for many decades - into big, subtle slaps by what appears to be the Ukraine.It isn't really Ukraine, though. Rather, it's interference by outside countries... always for oil, but also (in this case) because of the at least 46 Wuhan-style labs the US has set up in Ukraine. Russia has simply decided that it wants no part of a \"playful\" civil war back-and-forth-tugging that is becoming serious rather than sort of playful. So, it is fighting back.If it wasn't for the fact that the Ukrainian people are all feeling the heat from Russia right now, you would find loads of Ukrainians who would be supporting Russia, just like there were for all these decades. And there are loads of Ukrainians and Russians in Russia who support the Ukraine - to the tune of feeling sorry for the Ukraine land and people - but want the US out of there... just like loads of Ukrainians and Russians in the Ukraine who want the same.I have no idea what Russia would do if the US and Europe backed out of the Ukraine altogether. Maybe at this stage they would go on fighting and take the Ukraine over. But if foreign nation removal was done just the right way, the whole thing might go back to the \"playful\" slaps that have been going on forever in the past.Wake up and see that this isn't Russian aggression against Ukraine, but that it is Russia defending itself against the US and Europe. The Ukraine just happened to get in the way... except for those of the Ukraine who are in favor of the aggressive-like interference by the US.",
