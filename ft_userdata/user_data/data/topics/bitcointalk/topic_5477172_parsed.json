I did not know about bitcoin, crypto and forum at the time. I went to my bank ATM to fund my betting account and I gambled that day. That was February 2nd, 2014.Quote from: Vaculin on December 09, 2023, 01:33:38 PM2 -What are your worst experience in sports betting?I used huge amount to gamble several times and I lost. I had seen gambling as a way to earn again. I used my MSc money to gamble at the time and I felt like killing myself after I lost all. Not on a single bet but several bets for several days.Quote from: Vaculin on December 09, 2023, 01:33:38 PM3-What are your best experience in sports betting?A day that I gambled that I did not lose but won throughout the day. It was unbelievable but it is the truth. I lost the money the following day.Quote from: Vaculin on December 09, 2023, 01:33:38 PM4-What can you advise on the new gamblers and those who struggles in sports betting?To have a gambling budget, which should be small, like 5% of weekly income and not going beyond it. They should gamble with the amount of money they can afford to lose.I want to make money from gambling. That was what got me addicted. Looking for strategies to win, but realizing I am losing more than winning. My experience that time was so awful. I remember that I sold my spoit laptop and home theater to gamble and lost the money. It would have been better if I repair the laptop.I remember I gambled with my school fee money but my dad gave me another one before I graduated. Gamblers should not see gambling as a way of making money. If they see it that way, they should not use more than the amount that they can afford to lose. Gambling should be for fun and nothing more.I had a bad past experiences about gambling which I will not wish anyone to experience. And that is why we are here to discuss about ways not to be addicted or lose huge amount on gambling.",

I have being in sportbet for more than five years now as that was the game that I used to start gambling for the first time.2. My worst experience was the day that I was suppose to win $1000 with just $3, because it was up to 20 games on my slip and 19 games came out as predicted, which I was called for cash out but I rejected the offer because I thought that I was a genius and I will win the cash. But to my greatest surprise, the last game played out differently and it cut my slip.3. My best experience with sportbet was the day that I used $2 to win $50 on just one single game due to I placed my bet on the underdog with high odds and it was like magic.4. They should only gamble with the amount that they can afford to lose because gambling is a luck base game.",

      "body": "Quote from: Vaculin on December 09, 2023, 01:33:38 PM1- How long have you been gambling in sports?I am an occasional sports gambler because sometimes ago I developed some sorts of love for a football team, it really caused me lot of damage such as the emotional breakdown when my clubs looses a match especially to a lower team that is almost a 99% sure of winning and also when my club looses against a strong oppositions (enemies) because I have some friends who are my opposite fans club so we just have disagreements within each other after games played. So just can't telling how long I have been betting on sports due to my instabilities and unseriousness about it.Quote from: Vaculin on December 09, 2023, 01:33:38 PM2 -What are your worst experience in sports betting?My worse experience is that I betted with my last fund from my gambling budgets portfolio and was at a point of 100% believe that I was going to double take(profits) from my stake because I predicted a bigger team to win the match.Along the lines I was on the safe winning side not til a minute (1mins) to end up the match so I can count my bet winning then the match was equalized which compromised my prediction and in not more than 10 seconds the match ended and I lost.I was very much upset about it because I had no more more for funding and believe me, I would had gone against my gambling budgets if I had more money with me then because I felt like... Oh no, the mistake can be corrected if I can bet again.Quote from: Vaculin on December 09, 2023, 01:33:38 PM3-What are your best experience in sports betting?And my best experience is contrarily to my worse experienced where I recovered my losts of the day with the last fund from my gambling budgets.And the sweetest part of it is that my prediction was for for either the small team to win due to a home playing advantage or the both teams are drawn in the match.It is my best sports bets experience because I was then going through some financial difficulties at that period and then, i was able to recover a full day of my gambling budgets on that match.Just so cool, I walked away and didn't bet in some period of time because I needed to fix my finances up.Quote from: Vaculin on December 09, 2023, 01:33:38 PM4-What can you advise on the new gamblers and those who struggles in sports betting? There is no specific advice for specifically for a sports bets unless one wants to to be enhanced with sports gambling skills.Otherwise in general terms of advise, you must learn to draft a gambling budget and must be dependent on your incomes so that you don't have most of your incomes spent on gambling like you are funding to an investment or trading or like you are investing on a carrier.Imagine at my worsen experience if I have got more money to stake after I ran out of funds from my gambling budgets, alternatively I am still liable to loose as loosed others.So I urged you to bet responsibly and must not be overwhelmed with emotional breakdown for loosing or cheering for winning.Learn to Walk away from the gambling board at when due.Since I lost impressions from sports gambling because I don't go watching live sports anymore, but since then, if I must bet on sports bets, I make sure of rallying a careful research to tracking of the teams records and also considering of the games odds so as it is also where the risks as lied.That is my best of advise Incase you are not one of the usual sportive events fan (gambler) like me. It basically helps to guide you at sport's bets predictions and also of your responsible gambling timelines.",

The ones that I can only advise I guess is to just bet on the most trusted casino. Nothing is worse than losing money through a scam casino.",

The moment I start my crypto journey, that’s also my start in sports betting and it’s almost 6 years now though I’m still an occasional gambler.2. Worst experience is to place a bet on a wrong team and having no analysis at all.3. Best experience of course is winning especially with your favorite team.4. My advice is to continue to learn, know how to read odds and don’t forget to analyze the teams before you place a bet, and of course don’t forget to have fun as well.",

I started small, just for kicks, but I've gradually gotten more into it.2 -What are your worst experience in sports betting?Oh, man, Ive definitely had some rough goes - this one time stands out when I lost a chunk of change on a game I just knew in my bones was a sure thing.  I was straight up devastated.  But hey, live and learn when it comes to bankroll management.  3-What are your best experience in sports betting?There was this one killer parlay hit that had me over the moon and  i'm talking a serious jackpot.  That rush is what keeps me coming back to lay down a few bets here and there. 4-What can you advise on the new gamblers and those who struggles in sports betting?The way I see it it's entertainment first and foremost.  You gotta ask yourself - am I having a good time? Cause if not, pack it in.  No shame in that.",
