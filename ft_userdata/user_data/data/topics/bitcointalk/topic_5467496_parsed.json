  "content": "It is very common sometimes when we trade on exchange p2p payment delays,  these delay can be from the buyer's bank or seller bank's.  Many people have lose their money due to this delay of bank network thinking that the problem of the delay is from the network of bank which they will later get their money when the network of their bank becomes good and they go ahead to release the payment because of  evidence of payment that the other trader have sent to show as proof. I had trade to sell bitcoin in an exchange and I was matched with a buyer, so after he did the bank transaction I was waiting to get bank alert and the amount of money in my account Balance.  We both complained to the exchange customer service to help how to go about the issue and the buyer was asked to submit his statement of account which he did,  he brought evidence of payment that made it looks as if the delay of payment that have not reached me was from me. With every I was still not ready to release the payment it reflect in my account,  this issue last about more than 30 hrs abd and the following day I sent him a message to contact his bank the delay which he said he did. It wasn't up to 10 minutes after he contacted his bank I received the payment in my account.  If I had release the payment because of the pressure of customer service in the exchange,  the money wouldn't have gotten to me, which the buyer will be nowhere to find to make complains to his bank . Beginners should never make mistakes to release no matter how long it takes for them to receive payment.  Hold on till everything is settled from both sides.",

Part of the core message is usually to ensure funds are received before crypto is released. Anything contrary to this sequence,  there is really little the exchange can do to help as it will be difficult to prove funds were not received.  Following instructions and being cautious is the sure way to survive in the digital world because where there is ease and comfortable is where risk creeps in.",

As a newbie using a p2p platform, it is advised you carefully read through to see the instructions and guidelines to enable you scale through the process of using the p2p platform without having any issues. When using the p2p for transaction, make sure you receive your credit alert before releasing anything otherwise if you dare release it without receiving your credit alert, your coin is gone. As OP has explained, things of that nature do occur so one must be extremely careful so as not to make such mistake.",

      "body": "Thanks OP for bringing this topic, I recently made a p2p transaction where the buyer was supposed to pay me a certain amount in naira, let’s say N562,000 and instead he sent N56,200 to my account. I wasn’t sure if it was planned or an error on his part, so I contacted him. He later made a balance payment through another bank account. This made me very suspicious, I believe this is a tactic scammers now use to trick OTC traders, they send an amount that looks like what they are suppose to pay, and tell the seller they have paid. Close inspection will show that the figures do not match, like OP said “don’t let the pressure get to you”, make sure you have the agreed amount in your account before releasing the coins.",

I have had this experience before where I  was trying to  sell a coin on a p2p platform. The buyer did not pay on time and it was 4 minutes to deadline that was when the buyer chatted me up that he or she has  made payment meanwhile buyer presence shows online for over 35 minutes and this buyer has executed reasonable numbers of sales record based on the trade history I checked. So I was wondering if the buyer did it intentionally to scam me or a network issues from buyer end. I did not release the coin until I  received the alert 1 hour after transaction time elapsed. What made me more alert was the fact that buyer had not uploaded evidence of payment all these while mounting pressure on me to release my coin but I stood my ground not allowing the pressure to control me. Ever since that experience, I decided not to give in to pressure of releasing coin when I have not received a credit alert for my trade and I do make transfer first for confirmation before releasing my assets.",

My hunch too, is there are scammers that don't pay a dime and there are stupid morons that pray on a possible 5% in price by delaying transactions over the weekend claiming bank's fault, if the exchange rate is favorable they pay if not they claim it's a problem and just cancel the deal.Quote from: NeuroticFish on September 21, 2023, 04:02:19 AMI can't argue with your math, it is correct  However, I still think that these p2p exchanges need a better chance simply because they don't get your ID just for trading your pocket money (I don't talk about whales and day traders here).Which would make a no kyc exchange better than p2p deals?  Or would mean that you're safer if you stop trading real bitcoins and just play with derivates with your own bank if they start offering it.Honestly, I don't know anymore, I was discussing at one point what's more dangerous, and well, I'm not convinced 100% that making p2p deals with somebody you don't know is way safer than dealing with a CEX, ad this is why?Quote from: stompix on July 03, 2023, 12:42:13 PMDon't get me wrong, I completely hate CEX, I hate the charade that is called bitcoin cards with a visa logo, and I hate Binance and CZ probably the most on this entire forum, but let's not ignore facts, CEX are more convenient, that's why they are used because I don't have to contact some stranger, I don't have to log in my bank accounts and make a payment to exactly Quassam Bon Loden of exactly 1446.6 Euros to this account AD1400080001001234567890 and not one wrong letter and number.",

Bitcoin is supposed to be for privacy and for being your own bank. You could get your payment via different payment methods. Why bank? Bitcoin is supposed to eliminate the need for banks, and we combine bank accounts with centralized exchanges. Even if you use centralized exchange, do not combine it with exchanges. User GazetaBitcoin has written a great article about it and I would like to quote a few lines;Quote from: GazetaBitcoin on January 18, 2021, 09:07:17 PM12 years passed already since the launch of Bitcoin. And yet, most of people have no idea how it should be used, nor what Bitcoin is good for. Most of the users make a combination against the nature, using Bitcoin together with banks and centralized exchanges, having no knowledge about its libertarian and crypto-anarchic grounds. Without understanding that Bitcoin is here for helping them evade the slavery that governs and banks coerces them to, people do all they can to enslaves themselves, making an easy job for the elites which oppress them for thousands of years.Full article: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5310500.0",

It's very important that you're sure with the transaction that you'll do and make it always black and white before releasing the crypto that you're about to sell. It's okay to delay it if there's no confirmation yet from your bank and the money isn't reflecting yet. For sure that the legitimate buyers will understand why you're delaying it and they will do the same thing if they are on your shoes. It's just for precautionary measures to avoid scammers that might just reverse the transaction since it's bank transaction and you're at loss with that as you're the one to release the crypto. Another red flag for those not genuine traders that you may encounter are the ones that are in a hurry when trying to push you to release it when there's no confirmation yet. When you encounter one of those, you know what to do.",

Ignore all things your trade partner chat with you, if you don't receive payment, don't release. You won't be marked as a bad trader because you refuse to release coin in such situation.Release coin first, before receiving your payment, means you will lose your coin forever.
