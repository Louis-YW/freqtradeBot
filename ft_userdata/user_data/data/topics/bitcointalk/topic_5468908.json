That error mostly happens when someone uploads images to Imgur.com and those images won't work on this forum. You can try another good website which is https://imgbb.com/ to upload images and the image uploaded on that site also work on the forum flawlessly. But, still I recommend you to use talkimg.com only as that's a project made by a reputed member of the forum and that one works best for Bitcointalk.org.",

And the most amazing thing is, that there is a fear of the BBImage platform that it could also ban BTT from hosting any type of image like Imgur did. But there is nothing to be afraid of in TalkImg because it is made by the members of this forum and dedicated to this forum. You must be using Imgur and it does not support BTT anymore. If you are not using Imgur then use the one that BTT supports, like the ones I have mentioned above.",

I have known of 'imgur' at the onset but couldn't find it useful till the issues they had. Talkimg.com is the best I have recently learnt of and am glad I knew about it before I read this post. Although am still lazy about embedding any images in my posts, I can assure you am in  the process of trying it out.",

TalkImg was created by joker_josue keeping in mind the issues faced by users of Bitcointalk.

The recommended image extension would be PNG and not JPG.  I haven't use talkimg yet and I am open to a correction if I am wrong. In that case, the BBcode I have shared will be an additional information for OP in case he doesn't know about that and how to resize. It never hurts to know about what code to use and it also won't work if it doesn't end in image format not that talkimg doesn't end with it. It is also helpful if you aren't using talkimg where you need to type it yourself before it will work or the image will display.",
