I am well aware of the dangers of gambling addiction because what is meant by that is gambling, which they do is no longer for pleasure but for the sake of victory and greed and for some people they cannot control their gambling.In this case is it possible for gambling platforms to provide stop gambling services to help gamblers reduce their desire to gamble, as in the context of cigarettes, every tobacco company always provides smoking cessation services either by telephone, clients who want to quit smoking can be given counseling and guidance, as well as referrals if you need follow up.I think how if the Platform/gambling company has a stop gambling service that is very good and helps gamblers who want to stop.I know this will backfire on the gambling platform, but in retrospect, if this is implemented, it is a so wise move.What do you think about this?",

Given that casinos are made for gamblers to play and play there's no rule that they have that limitations to the amount they are going to bet. I am not being a judgmental but they are only after the money,gamblers should be accountable for their own actions, we should limits ourselves I know it is very easy to say but hard to do but we badly needed it,in order for us not to fall for addictions.",

Casino preferred a long term normal customer rather than a one time big time problematic customer.",

In everything we do in life,it is our choice to determine if we want to stop gambling or not. We have the ability to control ourselves on any bad habit that has eaten us up.An addicted gambler needs to stay away from gambling or should go on rehab so that this habit can be gotten rid of. This best way is self exclusion, gambling should be seen as a entertainment in order for easy control. Casinos are after their business and might not want to have such service.",

We can limit your bets so you won't get addicted!Lmao.The casino owners don't really give a damn about the gambling addicts. Why would they? If a person is weak enough to get addicted to something, nobody can stop him/her. The world is full of addicts you just can't fix it and it is definitely not the casinos' responsibility to fix it. Even the governments can't really do anything about it other than banning gambling and as you know it is not really a solution neither. Long story short, weak people will get addicted and strong people will not and the life will go on as usual.",

Cigarette disclaimer is concerning health directly but gambling isn't even though a gambler can get depressed and cause another thing to happen to them but that is extraneous event not directly causing harm to health and I think that is why the tobacco companies are regulated by law to always informed smokers the danger of their products to their health.Having said the above, gambling is strictly for the purpose of business to both giver and receiver, in this extent the bettor and the owner of the casino respectively. So the owner is out to make profit likewise the bettor playing to outsmart the owner of the business for his own profit. Therefore I think making such kind of publicity on addiction may mean the owner shooting himself on the foot. Moreover, if that was to be done, it would have been easier to limit the number of times an account is allowed to bet in a particular casino at least to help bettors not to be an addict   Addiction is a personal responsibility and an addict should get help through people around.",

I strongly believe that whoever that is addicted to gambling and wishes to quit will definitely quit personally without his actions to quit affecting others. We all know that one man's food is another mans poison. Definitely it will affect gambling platform because a lot of persons will not see good reason to gamble. Self discipline is one major way to quit gambling. I disagree with this idea.",

In fact, the casino owners would probably protest such a service because it would ruin their profits. Like it or not, the truth is that a lot of a casinos profits are made from people who have a gambling problem. If you take those people away, the casino loses a lot of money. So I don't doubt they would lobby against it.So your idea is a bit unrealistic.But as far as the service itself is concerned, I think such a service would be a very good idea to help people get away from their gambling addictions.",

Even those who have been ruined by their gambling are still playing to the best of their ability, shouldn't they stop when they are broken? and they realize that all this time they have been playing with the emotion of victory not to fill in the empty time.I have friends who are very different about this, one plays for fun and the other plays to win. What happened? my friend who plays for fun wins more and my friend who plays to win he always loses, why? because there is emotion there.So whether there is an advertising service or not it comes back to themselves, and I'm sure their friends also often give advice to stop playing but they don't listen to it, because I saw this myself.",

To stop gambling is everyone's responsibility, not the responsibility of the casino platform. Casinos only provide places to gamble and they will get huge profits. This is different from cigarette advertisements about warnings given not to smoke, but in fact more and more are smoking. Implementing such a thing is not a good move for the development of the casino, Bandar needs more income. As long as you don't violate the rules and don't manipulate gambling, casinos are the right place for those who aren't greedy.",

People may say \"well it's only the addict who could recognize his wrongdoings and push himself to do better\" To that I say, some people never take the leap of faith because no one's pushing them.
