  "content": "HelloDespite being mainly a miner and Strictly a BTC Hodler for over 2-3 Years, I am trying to discover new opportunities in the crypto Space to increase my income...1) I am considering Staking some crypto with Kraken.2) My main purpose for this thread is asking what do you guys think of something like \"Sheesha Finance\" ?...Am pretty new when it comes to all those terms in the crypto space: Defi, Crypto Projects, etc... But it was always my thought spotting good coins/projects and investing in them EARLY and earn some coins and sell once they take off !Is Sheesha my only option or any other good options out there ?As you can tell am keeping my options pretty limited, and only go with the most reliable Crypto Service, so I strictly Use Kraken as my main Exchange, and hate to tolerate Huge losses in this emerging crypto technology !...advises regarding Sheesha truly appreciated...thanks,",

I also came across sheeshafinance.io, it seems to be a serious project but talking about its potential is difficult because projects like this will have to compete very strongly with older projects before it because the idea is not too new and not too groundbreaking.OP can invest but before thinking about profit should also consider the risk it brings, it's not like bitcoin will never crash.",

I personally cant even digest the concept of DeFi tbh and i have argued once that WEB3 doesn't seem to be taking off steadily or fast enough, I guess once legislations are set for the crypto space things will change...thanks,",
