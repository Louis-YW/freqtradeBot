One can purchase Dongle Cards, Space Creators, Space Gachas or Space Jokers with the Dongle Token. A Dongle Space is an online place where the owners of the Space Cards with the same tag can gather and interact. It is like a subreddit in the Reddit. A Space Card with the “Horror” tag gives membership to only the Horror Space. While anyone can see what's inside the Space, only members can write posts and comments, vote and receive profit distribution.Dongle Space does social activities such as Reddit and receives Dongle Token based on Upvote for your posts and advertising profits posted on your Spaces.If you put ads on your Space, all advertising revenue will be shared with your space users.Share your funny memes, interesting information and make a money.No one can track you, who you are, where you are.Our social network is planned in three stages.In first stage, everyone can write and anyone can easily mine the Dongle Token. We are currently at this stage.In second stage, It is like a subreddit in the Reddit. A Space Card with the “Horror” tag gives membership to only the Horror Space. While anyone can see what's inside the Space, only members can write posts and comments, vote and receive profit distribution.The third stage is to build a \"true Web3\". It will be built on a decentralized server, and no one will own our services exclusively.Also, no matter how many coins one person or VC owns, they cannot control all of our Spaces. This is because holding our coins does not directly represent the power or control over the Spaces. The Dongle Space is similar to the subreddit, but each space is owned and operated by the NFT corresponding to each space. Each space can be seen as being connected to each other as a dongle, but it is clearly an individual existence. The Spaces are all separate entities.Please check the image below.
