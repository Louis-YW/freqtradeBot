In my country, we are also facing similar situation whereby we sell electricity to other countries whereas we cannot boast of 15hrs of electricity supply in our country amidst high tariffs.  The only way to change the system is if you become the president. Thank way you can bring sanity into the polity but the question is, will you give it a thought?Quote from: KiaKia on July 24, 2024, 09:32:05 AMI don't want to argue with him so I decide to bring this on here, do you think it will work for a country to be transparent about how many Bitcoin they generate or do you think that corrupiotn will still take over this idea? While growing up, I was thinking that corruption was perculiar to my country but through social media like X, I have learnt that corruption is a global problem and even the self-righteos countries are not exempted; just that some country have acceptable level of corruption and still have institutions that can checkmate anyone who crosses those red lines. It is possible to stop corruption and instill transparency in public service but it will take someone with huge political will to do that. It must also be that the person is clean else he will be blackmailed and forced to adjust his stand to favor the unseen forces that runs the nations of the world.",

      "body": "No. Bitcoin mining isn't transparent and the citizens can't actually know how much you've mined vs how much is actually disbursed to the government. This data can easily be inflated if needed, since there isn't a good way for people to monitor, or for people to be techsavvy enough to be able to audit and take the government accountable. Besides, even with excess electricity, there are plenty of resource constraints that should be addressed.Corruption cannot be solved if there is no accountability. Having no mechanism to weed corruption out of your system means that it will always run rampant. In this sense, even if your country were to hypothetically, be able to get a Bitcoin mine going and have a stable flow of Bitcoin from mining, it doesn't mean there isn't avenues for corruption to take place. Setting up the farm costs money, generation of electricity costs money, ASICs costs money, etc. Whenever there's money, there's probably ways for corrupted officials to siphon money out of them.Rather than tackling this, I find that you should focus on increasing your GDP and weeding out corruption, if you've got a chance to make a difference. Bitcoin farms are hardly going to make a dent on your GDP.",

David Cameron once said two countries are fantastically corrupt and that's the truth. Even if you trace how much Bitcoin was mined, these corrupt government officials will still fraudulently manipulate how the money is spent. The amount used in buying and maintaining the ASIC will be inflated. Don't also forget that there are some privacy tools such as mixers that can make transaction tracing difficult. Even if it is clear that money from the investment has been siphoned those people indicted will be freed by the court if they can bribe the judge. Bitcoin will not stop corruption even if it is adopted as a legal tender of a nation. It's just a currency that can be used by both positive and negative actors.",

Nothing will happen if you still have the same set of politicians where their main priority is to feed their selves and try to corrupt your countries resources as many as they can. Bitcoin maybe their target that's why don't hope for any changes even if bitcoin is in discussions since for sure rampant corruption will still happen. Also you can't convert anything or influence people to do mining since this is hard to do especially if they don't know how to do it or maybe people will just not interested about it.But if people would unite together to find politician which have aim for progress and don't have any intention to do corruption then maybe this is the solution on your country. Its hard to see a corruption free country and I guess this activities made by those greedy people in government most likely won't stop.",

And really, why couldn’t governments long ago think of using this electricity (any excess) for bitcoin consumption? Firstly, this is due to bureaucracy, when bitcoin supporters are not allowed to implement such innovative ideas by other members of governments (who don't see the potential of bitcoin). And secondly, in countries with a shortage of electricity, problems will arise, because if it turns out to be more profitable to direct electrical resources to the extraction of electricity, then where will such countries get the missing electricity? This will affect (negative) the livelihoods of ordinary people from the neighboring country.

The idea of bitcoin implies transparency of all information related to this. Any rule of law state must certainly be transparent with information about bitcoins (government-controlled). But I guess it's because of this that most governments don't like bitcoin and its transparency.
