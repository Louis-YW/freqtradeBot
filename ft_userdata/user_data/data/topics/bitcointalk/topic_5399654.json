A miner with 50% mining power has a 100% probability of mining the next block, whereas a miner with 40% mining power has 74.5 %, and so on for the other miners and their mining power for the future blocks.In bitcoin's history, no miner has ever achieved a 51% attack on the mining power, but some miners have gotten close to achieving 50% or more. Due to the high expense of obtaining such hashing power, major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are unlikely to be affected by a 51% attempt. The 51% attack only affects smaller cryptocurrencies like Bitcoinsv and other bitcoin forks with substantially less mining network capacity.Source: https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/51-attackThe picture above illustrates the amount of mining power each miner possesses. As of June 2014, only one miner (GHash.io) came close to 50% with the mining power estimated to be 38.24%. With his mining power he has the high probability of mining the next block into the blockchain.",

There is a chance that all other miners combined will extend the chain by a few blocks that are not yours, but since you have more than half of the hashpower, you're guaranteed to produce a longer chain sooner or later where those blocks are reverted / orphaned.Therefore, 50% is exactly the tipping point where you go from 50/50 odds to guaranteed authority over the blockchain... If you do it smartly, it will also be hard to identify you do actually control such a large portion of hashrate, thus any attempts of detecting or banning your blocks will be futile.",

This is not about a miner to mine the next block alone. Two miners can mine a block, first, the two blocks are valid, but one will become invalid after chain reorg. The miner that finally mine the (valid) block is the one that mined the block that other blocks are building on after chain reorg to have the longest chain.Quote from: n0nce on May 22, 2022, 01:36:12 AMActually, if you have 50%, you have 50% chance, but if you have 51%, the probability of mining the next block goes straight to 100%.A block can be mined by two miners, let us assume by a miner A with 40% hashrates and miner B with low % of hashrates. In such a way if 2 blocks are mined at the same time, there would be a chain reorg in a way new blocks mined will build on the longest chain which will be valid while the other become no more valid.With a single miner having 40% of the hashrates, the miner would mine more blocks and have more chance to compete with other miners with low hashrates during chain reorg, so having more chance to be the miner that will finally mine the block, while chances that blocks mined by other miner become invalid is higher.But the longer the chain by uncentralized miners, the lesser the chance.You can check the table in the OP, having a hashrate of 40%, there is 73.6% chance that the miner can replace (finally be the valid block mined) blocks with 1 confirmation, 66.4% chance to replace block having 2 confirmations already...33.2% chance to replace block with 10 confirmations.Having 50% hashrates should be able to lead to an attack in a way the chance to reverse 10 blocks should be possible, but the more the centralized hashrate, the easier the chances of the attack.",

For example, removing all the transactions from the last block essentially reverses all of the transactions in the last block. Furthermore, an attacker can send coins that never belonged to him. If they replace blocks, they've essentially taken coins (block subsidy) that belonged to others. As for changing the number of coins, that's half true. They can't mine more than 6.25 BTC as that'd be considered an invalid coinbase transaction. However, there's nothing stopping them from rewarding themselves lower than that.

Like, if someone had authority over multiple mining pools that together have over 50% and they would be the only ones finding new blocks, it might not be very easy to spot. Especially since it appears as multiple different pools and there won't be like exclusively consecutive blocks by the same miner or mining pool.",
