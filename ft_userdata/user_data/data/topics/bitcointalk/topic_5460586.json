  "content": "I know the idea of Web5 is still brand new (I think maybe the first one or two Web5 apps came out recently or are about to come out), but being based on Bitcoin and other decentralized technology I think it seems like a much more firm basis to build a \"web 3.0\" crypto economy than the token/gambling focus of Web3.Anybody on here looked into the Web5 concept a bunch? What are your thoughts?I think Web3 is looking more and more like a failure. As it has ended up just focusing on silly useless NFT pictures and an endless creation of token gambling projects. The idea of Web5 seems to be more about actually building a decentralized app economy with Bitcoin as its currency, rather than the hodgepodge of endless fads and investment schemes that make up Web3. The idea of tokens I think is what will end up killing off the smart contract chains and Web3 - because instead of building useful things it just draws everyone (creators and consumers) into get-rich-quick money making schemes which ultimately fall apart because there is no substance to them. That's not how you build a sustainable economy. Crypto tokens makes the focus on money making schemes, rather than actual businesses. I'm not totally informed on Web5 but it seems to be the idea of making actual decentralized apps with decentralized identity and data storage with decentralized payments with Bitcoin.",

What are your thoughts?Let's see where this current web3 is heading into before we batch into web4 and so on, isn't it good taking a step at a time?",

As of now, I don't think it will bring benefits to the Bitcoin ecosystem in general if the technical requirement to use them is somewhat high. Some people don't level feel comfortable with a self-custody wallet, I doubt anything more decentralized and technical will attract them.[1] https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/",

      "body": "Web3 has been a fad ever since the early days of the infrastructure development and even the bright minds of crypto space such as Vitalik or Dorsey just had a negative reaction towards the development. Vitalik once pointed out that NFT has been just helpful for gamblers where they risk their money to make more money but there has never been any underlying use-case for the same. For example, NFTs can always be used as gaming items such as purchasing digital lands or having a monetary economy in a vibrant game such as GTA or as a way of rewarding the digital artists such as Beeple but anything more than that has been seen as an easy way to lure investors and make money and disappear along with the whole company  Similarly Defi has been helpful for building decentralized banking solutions such as Maker , AAVE or Uniswap but creating shitcoins and pumping or dumping our bags is more or less related to gambling which was never the reason they were initially developed for. Web5 TBH is more promising and many entrepreneurs such as Dorsey has been supportive towards the vision and goal. Internet is a decentralized social phenomenon and transacting fiat currencies in this place will obviously move the power again to the governments but developing solutions to use Bitcoin as a currency of the internet is more or less related to the vision of the decentralization.As you have said, 95% of the web3 applications are a pyramid manipulative scam paving way for get-rich-quick schemes and creation of real businesses or any kind of innovation has reached a saturation point. In the 2021 solana pump, almost every nft project which were created during the hype failed and majority ran out of businesses thereby running away with investors money   So tackle this situation and to trash this scam mania, web5 should be developed by builders asap.",

I mean it wasn't too long ago when they said Bitcoin was also a fad because it was focused on gambling and speculation. Or AI for gaming and marketing and content creation.Erroneous on both counts (the focus). The most visible activity, sure. The majority of utility, sure. But I'm pretty excited by web3 concepts of more user ownership of personal info, and removal of single points of failure for data storage or host -- these align with some Bitcoin foundational philosophies.I doubt that many NFT projects really are web3. Just as few DEXs were truly Web3 (exhibiting only self-custody features).",

      "body": "To the people commenting that they haven't heard of it. Yes it is a real thing. Just google \"Web5\" or go here: https://developer.tbd.website/It was proposed a year ago by Jack Dorsey and the infrastructure and the first apps for it have been worked on for the past year. But yeah its just starting. From what I understand Jack Dorsey launched a division of his Block company, called TBD, a year ago to start developing the protocols and work on the initial infrastructure and apps of Web5.And I assume it was called Web5 as opposed to Web4 just to separate it from the Web3 idea, because of Web3 turned into just a scammy altcoin fad mess so they don't want to have people think it is just an iteration or update to Web3. That would be my guess as to why it isn't named Web4.I don't know about it in technical detail but from what I understand it somehow uses Bitcoin (as well as other decentralized tech) as the backbone of its infrastructure. The primary features of Web5 are decentralized identity and personal ownership of your data and decentralized web nodes, with bitcoin and stablecoins being the payments rails for Web5.So, it's basically like what Web3 was supposed to be but turned out not to be, and uses Bitcoin rather than a bunch of random altcoins. Whereas Web3 basically devolved into being a bunch of centralized scammy and token-based gambling apps (the idea of DeFi basically turned into \"GambleFi\" and was never very decentralized in the first place), Web5's goal is to actually be a network of decentralized apps built on real decentralized tech like Bitcoin. Web3 turned into just centralized blockchain apps to mess around with mostly useless tokens, so it completely failed to be the \"decentalized app internet\" it was supposed to be. Web5 picks up this idea where Web3 failed.I believe I heard about the first Web5 app, a messaging app, being launched recently, or maybe about to launch, though I can't find it at the moment searching online for it.So yes it is very early right now and is in more the infrastructure building phase than actual apps being out for it yet.",

It's just filled with buzz words. Based on what I've seen so far, it doesn't have much difference compared to the web3 we have today other than the fact that it just adds another layer of complexity in a bit to decentralize more things like nodes. If it's true that only Bitcoin would be utilized, it would be interesting to know how they plan to keep decentralized nodes up and running without incentivizing node runners.At this point in crypto, our primary concern should be simplifying abstract concepts and reduce the barrier to entry to the barest minimum if we want to achieve mass adoption.",
