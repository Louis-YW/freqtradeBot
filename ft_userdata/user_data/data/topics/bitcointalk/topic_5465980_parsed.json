I mean that platforms or anything...Thanks,Possibly track them on their explorer you would see their most transfer to, then create account on that exchange you found most transfer to and send them there, just as other user did said you can track them on CMC or coingecko I think that is the only way possible if you asked me. This is another problems with token listing in only one exchange without being listed in multiple or at least 2 exchange, however this could be as a result of low trading volume or not meeting up the exchange requirements that could stir up this action.",

The instructions are pretty clear, but they are too lazy to even read through. I wounder why someone would even do crypto if they can not read or do some research. These are the kinds of people that end up getting scammed in these streets. Maybe they will learn from experience.",

But if can help us edit some coins and put completed name about your coins are delisting from LBANK exchange market to make us easy for tracking your coins delisted because many coins with the same label in Coingecko. For AXL coins is true or not with your coins is Axelar, you can check in Coingecko and there are many exchange available for this coins, actually if all your coins assets above delisting in LBANK with BSC platform don't worry because many dapp exchange ara available for selling it, you can track with smart contract address and check in dextool website see there which one dapp exchange have liquidity or transaction volume for selling in dapp exchange market.",
