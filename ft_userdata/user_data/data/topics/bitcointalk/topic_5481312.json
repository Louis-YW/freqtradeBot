Share your thoughts on whether diving into the Bitcoin sea is a savvy move or a shipwreck waiting to happen. This is a much different question from the one in your topic title. Bitcoin can be the future but is not right as a means of payment for your business.15 years down the road, I'll say fiat is more of the shipwreck waiting to happen, but it's still better for SMEs as a means of payment than BTC.Quote from: Ravichnadra on January 12, 2024, 09:43:16 AMPersonally, I'm torn between embracing the digital gold rush and sticking to the good ol' cash. Do your personal analysis for your business;â€¢ Is it an online or offline business?â€¢ Is there a demand for an alternative means of payment?â€¢ Is there any limitation using your current payment method?â€¢ If you accept Bitcoin, do you plan to hodl it or convert to fiat immediately?",

It allows fast & cheap cross border transactions because there are no intermediaries involved. To accept Bitcoin can increase your brand's visibility & appeal. There are a few drawbacks. Bitcoin's volatility can pose a risk as its value can fluctuate a lot. It might require additional time & effort to set up and manage a Bitcoin payment system. The limited acceptance of Bitcoin as a payment method may restrict its usefulness for some customers.",

I will stick to the traditional way of payment. I know that it depends to a nature of the business but come to think if it, Not all person has a bitcoin or aware about it especiamly those elders so We should consider them especially that they are your costumers.",

We all know that Bitcoin is now the most strongest currency for now and give it a fair time it will show us the real potential after this bull run. After this event, many of other disbelievers starts believing in Bitcoin  Just give it time",

Do people in your area use bitcoin regularly?...You should learn, evaluate all relevant factors and make decisions for your business. If accepting bitcoin for businesses is beneficial, why would you ignore it?After all, bitcoin is a currency and can be a means of payment, and adding more payment methods to businesses will benefit us, not harm us. Why do we ignore them? There are some people complaining about accepting bitcoin for their business and it doesn't bring any benefits, but that doesn't mean it will happen to you, too. It's better to experience it yourself and don't listen to them. Just like many people lose money investing in bitcoin, but that doesn't mean everyone will fail like them, a lot of people are making a lot of money investing in bitcoin.",

Drop your two satoshis below and let's hash it out! âš“ðŸš€First, this depends on your country, whether your country legalizes bitcoin as a transaction currency or not, if your country legalizes it then you can try it. You can use bitcoin as an alternative payment currency. If you only use bitcoin, then it is a careless action because bitcoin is still taboo and not yet familiar as a payment currency.Second, it depends on what business you do. If your business provides cheap goods then using Bitcoin is less effective, transaction costs become expensive. Better business activities in the digital sector that allow your consumers to buy from across borders, using bitcoin will make transaction costs cheaper and more effective than other currencies.",

So what makes some people feel confused about accepting Bitcoin in their own lives or in their own business is because they are afraid of losses, even though that is only when they sell at low prices.Meanwhile, for those who are sure to save it well enough, they will never experience losses or sink like you said, because everyone can see the reality that exists through Bitcoin itself from the first ATH to the next ATH within a period of once every four years. And for the puzzle that is in your head, I don't think there is any need to debate the pros and cons as long as you can still use cash while holding Bitcoin indefinitely and being distracted by the presence of Bitcoin into your own life.",
