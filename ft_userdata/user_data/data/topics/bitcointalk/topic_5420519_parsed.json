  "content": "Greetings!So before I get into to much depth I would be hosting a node I can't afford 32 ETH but I can pitch in a couple and host this node and redistribute the earnings via a NFT. An would like to get any feedback here I did register a S corp LLC this year for a crypto mining company which would be including proof of stake. I also have 200 amp dedicated service with starlink business interenet and backup 5G internet so they should stay fairly stable. I also have 40 acres of land to build on if it was to expand to something larger then just a few nodes. Unfortunately getting bank loans for crypto based investments is still not feasible for me quite yet the LLC has currently made profits through freelancing specifically which will be my second choice if i'm not able to crowd fund this. Right now currently am seeking a few members who would be able to contribute toward the purchase of 1 single membership certificate the company is Decentralized Finance LLC in Akron Ohio. I'll be editing this post later on if I see some slight interest.",
