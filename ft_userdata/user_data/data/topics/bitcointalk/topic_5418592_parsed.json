  "content": "Just a random community question before I invest any of my time into my WPDA WordPress plugin.I will soon come to billing and woo commerce integration within my plugin to automate hosting packages etc, and as I have spent a lot of time for clients on building PHP integrations into altcoins and bitcoin nodes hosting btc, I wondered if there was any point in me putting these functions to use in my plugin, users could use the bitcoin/altcoin as a site currency to pay for DA services/packages, etc within our WPDA WordPress plugin.A bitcoin node has its own remote API interface so hooking into new transactions etc is very simple and could be integrated with DA through my plugin.Will people use this feature??",

      "body": "More options are always good if you can integrate them without a problem. However, don't lose your sleep over it as you should put more thought into the plugin itself. I, for example, will prefer crypto for payment, but if I can't find it, I'll use another option without problems as long as I intend to purchase it. Missing crypto payments won't stop me from purchasing as long as there's VISA etc.",
