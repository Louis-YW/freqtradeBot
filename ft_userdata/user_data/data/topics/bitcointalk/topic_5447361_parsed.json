Crypto companies have even complained to the government of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, as the situation worsened in the past weeks. The move goes in the opposite direction of Sunak’s plans to prioritize financial technology disruption and make the U.K. a global crypto hub.“The U.K. banking reaction has been more acute than the EU one,” Tom Duff-Gordon, vice president of international policy at Coinbase, told Bloomberg. According to Duff-Gordon, the European Union’s efforts to establish a framework for digital assets are making banks more receptive to crypto firms in other countries. The European parliamentary committee passed the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation in October, nearly two years after it was first introduced in September 2020. Its final vote is scheduled for this month.So far in 2023, venture capital investment in digital asset companies reportedly dropped 94% to $55 million in the U.K., according to data from PitchBook, against a 31% increase in other countries in Europe. Crypto companies are turning to payment service providers such as BCB Payments and Stripe to maintain business operations in the U.K.Earlier in March, the HSBC Holdings and Nationwide Building Society banned cryptocurrency purchases via credit cards for retail customers, joining a growing list of banks in the country to tighten restrictions on digital assets. Also in March, the self-regulatory trade association CryptoUK proposed the creation of a “white list” of registered firms in the country to address banks limiting or banning transactions with crypto companies. “Many of the major U.K. banks have now put in place bans or restrictions, and we are concerned that other banks and Payment Services Providers (PSP’s) may also soon follow suit,” said CryptoUK. “We believe that government action is now warranted.”Similar to the United States, authorities in the U.K. are tightening regulations on crypto companies. The Financial Conduct Authority proposed in February a set of rules that could subject executives of crypto firms to two years in prison if they don’t meet certain conditions related to promotion.UK banks are turning away crypto clients: Report",

Some banks are even freezing the accounts of current users and asking for more documentation. In my opinion this is making it difficult for crypto companies to do business in the UK. The situation is worse in the UK compared to other European countries where banks are becoming more receptive to cryptocurrencies. The UK's reaction is causing venture capital investment in digital assets to drop in the country. The self-regulatory trade association CryptoUK proposed creating a \"white list\" of registered firms in the country to address banks limiting or banning transactions with crypto companies.",

The continuation of this policy for several years will make the legislative regulation of digital currencies possible.Or at least this is my analysis of what is happening.",

But at the same time I do feel like there is this case of people caring more about crypto and regulations on that instead of regulations on fiat. I mean there are a trillion regulations on fiat as well and not many people know them all.Even \"burning fiat banknote\" is illegal in some nations as disrespecting the nation, it's true. So all in all I would say there is more care, not usage, people don't use it as much as fiat, but they do care more about it than fiat as well. I would rather have bitcoin than fiat too, but that's me personally.",

The news of Rishi Sunak a perceived crypto enthusiast becoming the Prime Minister of England received a lot of commendations from the crypto sector. Many people in the sector believed he will make friendly policies that will make the crypto space more acceptable in his country. But this dream is gradually fading away because from this news he is doing the contrary. The English economy is solely connected to her political sector. Most economic policies must be rectified and certified by the legislature and most of these politicians were sponsored by big banks during their elections so they must protect the interest of their financiers. The prime minister might have good intentions for the cryptocurrency industry but the structures and systems of the nation will always frustrate this good intention.",

You have to ask if the government's interest in financial technology is genuine or just lip service.Economist here, and I must say I have little faith in the government's ability to strike a fair balance between restrictions and new ideas. Too many rules have demonstrated in the past to stifle creativity and hamper economic development.The government's plan to compile a \"white list\" of registered businesses, while well-intentioned, appears like a band-aid solution to a deeper problem. Why are banks reluctant to or outright rejecting transactions with cryptocurrency businesses? Do they care about financial crime or are they just scared of the financial sector?Government financial technology regulation ultimately requires a deeper philosophical approach. They should consider what they hope to accomplish and whether or not doing so will stifle creative thinking. If they don't, they'll fall behind countries that are more open to the sector",

As we see with recent P2P exchanges being shut down due to pressure from US regulators, they are easy targets and scape goats for financial regulators right now, especially when their are jitters in the banking sector. Things like a Royal Mint NFT are simply gimmicks and distractions, it's worthless even mentioning them in this context. Any politician who claims to be friendly to cryptocurrency is often using it as a self marketing tool, to appeal to a certain crowd, but few seem to stick by it in the long run.",

So  it's not all bad, but crypto adoption does normally mean a friendly stance toward crypto businesses. But banks are those against doing business with crypto-related entities, and banks can restrict users based on their own policies, I believe. So it's not the government that's against cryptos; it's banks as rival businesses to crypto enterprises that are causing troubles.
