It is always the best practice for a developer or any service provider to have a dedicated portfolio to showcase their past work or at least some samples of what they can actually do so that those who may wish to hire them can see how capable they actually are. Having a portfolio can obviously boost the chances of getting hired more quickly.In OP's case, I believe that he is not like a professional developer, and he probably has just started working or maybe only did a couple or a few projects and that's why he doesn't have a portfolio set up yet.",
