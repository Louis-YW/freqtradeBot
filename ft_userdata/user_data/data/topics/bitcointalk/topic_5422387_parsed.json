  "content": "Hi all, I am currently final year computer science student and decided to code my own torrent client. I don't actually plan on developing and releasing the next big torrent client, I'm doing it solely for learning purposes. C++ is my language of choice. With that in mind I have a few questions for people who have already done this.1. What C++ library would you recommend for handling the networking part.2. What GUI framework would you recommend?3. Any advice you have for developing it?",
