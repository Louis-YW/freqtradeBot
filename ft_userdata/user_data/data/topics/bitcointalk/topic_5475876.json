  "content": "In a surprising turn of events, the U.S. SEC has advanced its decision-making process regarding Franklin Templetonâ€™s Bitcoin ETF application, which was not due until Jan. 1, 2024.The watchdog punted the previous Nov. 15 deadline to Jan. 1, 2024, to allow for a more comprehensive review of the proposalâ€™s alignment with regulatory standards, particularly concerning investor protection and market integrity.In essence, the SEC appears to have effectively extended the deadline a month prior to the original decision date. This move could indicate that the regulator is affording Franklin additional time to revise its filing before further deadlines. Notably, Franklin Templeton is the only applicant who has not updated its S-1 form or addressed the prevalent concerns regarding potential market manipulation. The asset manager joined the spot Bitcoin ETF race in September and intends to list the fund on CBOE.The early move has caught the attention of market observers, given that Franklin Templeton, an asset manager overseeing $1.5 trillion, has yet to submit an updated S-1 form.S-1 formThe lack of an updated S-1 form from Franklin Templeton has spurred speculation around its potential influence on the SECâ€™s final decision. Franklin is the only issuer in this round of applications that has not submitted revised documentation.James Seyffart, an industry analyst, suggested that the move could be a strategic step by the SEC to pave the way for a series of approvals in early January. The hypothesis aligns with the potential approval of Hashdexâ€™s application, which is also in the queue.While the crypto market eagerly anticipates the SECâ€™s decisions, the regulatory body continues to prioritize thorough evaluation to ensure investor protection and market stability.Market manipulation concernsCentral to the SECâ€™s proceedings are concerns over potential market manipulation and the ETFâ€™s ability to safeguard against fraudulent activities.The commission has highlighted the need for robust mechanisms to prevent manipulative practices in the Bitcoin market. The proposalâ€™s consistency with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which mandates securities exchange rules to prevent fraudulent acts and protect investors, is under scrutiny.The other ETF applicants â€” including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments â€” have already submitted updated S-1 forms with answers to many of these concerns.Almost all of the applicants argue that the existence of a futures market and ISG memberships of the listing exchanges provide adequate monitoring of a Bitcoin market of sufficient size.The main argument posited by exchanges and asset managers is that the SEC, having approved futures-based Bitcoin ETFs traded on the CME, should not reject a spot Bitcoin ETF as both futures and spot-based products depend on the same underlying markets for price determination.The post SEC advances decision process on Franklin Templetonâ€™s Bitcoin ETF application appeared first on CryptoSlate.ðŸ”—Source: Click here",

Now it seems they are all on track to all be approved or rejected in January.There is also some comment form that is opened and the public can view their opinions. Whether this will actually make a difference is another thing. But the SEC has to do it anyways as a formality.",

The SEC doesn't want to face the heat after another rejection of a serious company at the point of huge pressure upon it to rethink its position. So the easiest thing for them to do is to postpone a decision, which makes them look as if they are open to eventually accepting an application while also not committing them to doing so.It's wonderful if the pressure eventually leads to change, but I still have my doubts about it. Because for all the talk that an approval is around the corner, it hasn't happened yet.",

Expectations and assumptions can often be a very slippery slope, especially when it comes to something that basically did not result in any great interest in other countries where spot BTC ETF has been available for some time.

For the reason that they are already used to trading through ETFs, and because they do not have to directly buy, store and worry about the safety of their assets. When you look at all the ETFs that BlackRock has in one place, then all those who are their clients just want one more ETF in the series where they can trade with one click of their mouse.",

Since a day I knew about Bitcoin and this market in 2017, I heard about it many times, hope, disappointment and many market manipulations around ETF news.Good signal is SEC. has started to directly talk with those companies that apply for Bitcoin Spot ETFs to improve their applications. They did not simply refused those applications and did not say any word with those companies. It's positive signal but it is still not enough for any approval. People are only optimistic that SEC. will make approvals soon.I don't care about it because I believe Bitcoin will have its bull run without Bitcoin Spot ETFs.",

      "body": "Not surprising. I'm not sure why they delayed it again earlier than they needed to, but this is standard SEC practice when it comes to Bitcoin ETF applications: delay for as long as they can and then reject.Until the SEC, and specifically Gary Gensler, feels so much pressure that he feels he is being forced to act against his will, ETF applications will continue to get delayed and then rejected. Political and legal pressure is certainly building against Gensler, but that doesn't mean he'll break. He is very against the entire industry and concept of Bitcoin and Crypto. While people the past half year or so have been blindly hoping an ETF will happen soon, Gensler could easily still just refuse to give in and keep delaying and rejecting for his last 3 years in office. Hopefully he breaks and we get ETF applications approved at some point next year to coincide with the bull market, but that is by no means guaranteed as people for some reason assume it is.",

However, I think that regardless of his views, he is not the one who makes the decision, but it is still someone in a much higher position.Lobbying in the US has been brought to perfection, and it is more than obvious that someone else needs to be convinced, not just old Gary.",

The biggest of them is with Franklin, if this gets an approval, this shall make a FOMO on January and prior to halving, there's already a bull run if ever it gets approved.

That's why others fall victim to FOMO in reality. But what others don't want and what others want will continue.Then one more thing I just remembered is that the election is in the US next year 2024, so it is probably a Franklin that can be approved by the SEC as well as the ETF. Because it also provides support funds to politicians. It seems like it's just common sense that if officials want to support them via huge funds, they have to be approved. Now the question is whether the government officials are paid. The answer is yes; the fight is only for money in that way, in my opinion.",
