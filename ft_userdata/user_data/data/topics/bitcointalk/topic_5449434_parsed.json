The process is quite straightforward as long as you use a wallet that supports a hardware wallet connection and a phone with Android 8+ (that's what is stated on the Ledger website, never tried it to verify myself for a lower Android version). For example, here's the official guide to connect your HW to the Ledger Live app[1]. The steps should be similar if you use other wallets app. CMIIW.[1] https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021488913-Connect-Ledger-to-your-phone",

With the previous phone I used the same Ledger S with the same cable, just the adapter was USB (A) to microUSB.",
