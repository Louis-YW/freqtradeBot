  "content": "Launch - Thursday 1st September at 8pm UTC (after AMA)AMA WITH CAESAR'S CALLS FIRSTThe dev team will attend a 60 minute voice AMA with Caesar's Calls on Thursday 1st September at 7pm UTC time. The chat is able to ask questions of the dev and team at the end. The AMA is being hosted 1 hour before the token goes live. The token will be paired on Pancake Swap immediately after and this $BARFIGHT telegram here will be opened. See you all at the AMA!What is $BARFIGHT token?$BARFIGHT token is set to take the metaverse market by storm. This is virtual barfights! Design your patron’s attire whether it be a wife beater singlet or suit, select your weapon of choice from bottles to tasers, and get swinging — winner takes all!Future Marketing*All the usual stuff you'd expect from a new token you'll see we get done very quickly. BARFIGHT has some great contacts.*- CMC and CG listings - DEXT trending- CMC trending- Poocoins trending- Youtube, Tiktok, Twitch reviews- Twitter marketing with influencers who are big in the NFT and metaverse space- News releases about a new play to earn game to hit the metaverse- We will aim to get a big celebrity endorsement to help send it viral. Someone like Mike Tyson wearing VR goggles would be ideal.  - Host major tournaments and battle royals with BNB prize give aways. Funds in the marketing walletBARFIGHT has access to cash. We bought 100 BNB ourselves to start off the LP. We've allocated $30K to marketing for the first stage of token going live and have more sitting with CEX if needed. The token has a marketing tax which will also be added firepower. Future Product PlansThe whitepaper and roadmap is worth a read. The project is a VR Bar Fight game, but more. Patrons will be able to design their own character to use in game and mint them as an NFT. There will be 3 metaverse scenes to compete in, the bar, a carpark and smoking area. Each will be unique in its design and interactivity. Player modes will include- 1 v 1- 10 v 10 (team)- 1 v 10 (single player)- 100 v 100 (battle royal)Once the product passes testing we will introduce wagering. Let patrons bet on fights and enter cash events. A 10 person event costing $2 entry would reward the winner $20 in BNB for example. We will add in a weapons shop in the form of a web shop that let's patrons buy upgrades and armor.  BARFIGHT will generate revenue from in game micro-transactions. Past ProjectsWe have invested heavy into NFT metaverse and alts projects and made good money. But got tired of slow devs and crappy marketing. Decided to build our own token.Reflections and TaxesThe contract collects taxes in the form of BNB. We have allocated 5% of supply to rewards and staking. Going to ask the community how they'd like to see that claimed before we lock in any plans. Other items not mentioned- Audit with Solidity Finance is due Friday- First batch of NFTs out in under 2 weeks (people can use as profiles pics) 8 characters with different traits. Similar to the ones in the banner I'll post you after this.
