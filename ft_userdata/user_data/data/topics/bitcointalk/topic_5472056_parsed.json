  "content": "I saw this image below on one of my friend's WhatsApp statuses earlier today. I don't know if the game was played by him or if it was an image saved from somewhere, but the image got me thinking, and we got into a debate because of that. I was telling someone that if I'm the one to have such a slip and the game is already showing me to cash out such an amount of money, which is equal to $865 based on our local exchange rate, seeing such an amount as cash out available and leaving it will make me appear like someone who is too greedy, but the guy was telling me it's not being greedy but it's all about taking risks. The debate didn't end well, so I decided to bring this up here to see the responses from experienced gamblers. Lucky for anyone who ever has that bet slip, it seems like the game played in his favour.",

For me, I'll just cash it out and enjoy my win even before the casino takes it back.But some other will say that they can afford to take more risk and with that amount, they can grow more from what it is right now. That's why if it's just you and me, we know what's best for us and that's to take the profit.And for the rest of the actual risk takers, they wouldn't mind but to continue and if they lose, they lose no matter what happens and no regret on it.",

Well the matter of if it's actually greed or risk, depends solely on the particular type of gambler involved because I feel for someone who is financially sound, this bet won't be off any implication to him even if the game ended the opposite direction. Let's take drake the music artists for example, I mean the man splashes the kind of cash on different bets all the time and he doesn't do this cause he is greedy or something, cause  I believe there is something called the winning syndrome that come with gambling and that's what he is actually trying to feel so him and his type of gamblers this would be risk taken not greed but other set of gamblers i think the case would be different.",

What are you trying to achieve? Simply, if they want to push it until the end for a much higher reward, then let them be. You can't push your own preference to others as in the first place, it's not your money at stake.You were just able to choose that you want to cash out as you see the amount of money. But if you are the one who actually places that bet, you will feel the real pressure and you won't even be able to decide easily if you will push through or risk, after all you choose that bet thinking you will win it all with that odds. Now to answer that if it happened in my case,  I can't even tell you what should I do. I really need to watch the game live before deciding.",

There are really these times that these situations could really be giving out that kind of doubtespecially if you are seeing those early cash outs pop out. Such confidence comes from the inner conviction that the said team/club is going to win regardless of what comes but what gamblers fail to understand in most cases is the unpredictability and uncertainty of game outcomes and how everything plays out and what is untenable at the end of the playtime,  and in this regard the gambler that bet this game is not a greedy person but just a passive fan of the club he selected,  this is not the first time this will happen and at that, as he was in the draw region all through the first half and even some time in the 2nd half,  he may have indeed made a lot of profits from the bet,  but also since the March was in the draw region for long that also could have affected his decision to take the cash out because the casino also will hold back a lot of the cash-out option in this kind of game condition.",

Most times single bets are easily to win to than a multiple bets were you won't be sure of the rest games.

If this is really a bet placed, then the user gambled with the money he can afford to lose.

The assurance of Real Madrid winning the game was clear to him, so he betted. If such a person is not capable of having more than that amount in his account, he won't stake a bet of such amount. If he does place a bet when he don't have the capacity, then it may be considered as greed or risk.",

It is upto the gambler and here in my view the gambler could've made a wise decision as he had the opportunity to cashout In profit. He could've cashed out and further placed a bet which is kind of free bet, because his capital isn't lost.",

I don't know what his problem, even I didn't use his money, he was very insistent that he was opposite team with me. So, after the game was over and I won, he didn't reprimand anyone, he doesn't want to be friends with me anymore. This is a bad situation I think, we should not interfere in people's affairs.",

It might be a different thing if you were spending money from others like a madman, but if not, then really it's not anyone's business to care about it unless asked for. The other side didn't even need to entertain you ngl. Honestly, this only becomes an issue if and only if said gambler has problems with money. Say if the money came from debts, or from family, then admonishing him can be possible regardless of whatever reason you have, anyway it's good for him. If not and he's living rather well and balancing it? Just let him be.",
