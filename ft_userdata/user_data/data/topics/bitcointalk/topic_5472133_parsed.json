For business, I can wait and later establish a business for myself, but I may choose business if the ROI is high. I can not choose a house. I can not choose lottery win. I will choose bitcoin because of the coming 5x pump that will not take more than 2 years before it would have occured. Bitcoin may even go more than 5x. That is $2.4 million before the end of 2025. Some people may choose business.",

With $5,000 every month I could buy bitcoin using the dollar cost average. Option C is not my best choice because buying Bitcoin using lump sum at $24,000 is riskier than option A because the price of bitcoin cannot be predicted. Option A also gives more room for a better investment plan and reduces the risk of wasting money on luxury, losing all your funds to hacks or other uncertainties.",

So, why didn't I opt for BTC in this choice? In a nutshell, BTC is my ultimate destination, and any business or job that generates income is my means of reaching that goal. Isn't it boring when you suddenly achieve your goal without any struggle?Therefore, even though I chose the business first, I need to be able to save and manage to accumulate BTC in line with my target. To this day, I have a goal to possess 1 BTC, and if I were to go for BTC in the option you presented, what more would I need to do?Moreover, I have always been curious about the business world which can lead many of the richest people in the world to reach their highest position.",

That is huge investable money already which could be used to invest or buy a house.So the other options are good too but I prefer a lottery winning paid in installment over 96 months (8 years) of $5k each year. This is already looking like a loan and with a good plan you can gradually build the fund over the years in business rather than collecting the bulk sum of $480,000 at once that could be \"lavished\" back in gambling or lottery. So if you have $5,000 in installment per year, you can redirect your investment to another area of business by the next installment if the previous investment or business is failing.",

The third that can be choosen is house which can be considered as real estate. Not advisable to choose anything related to fiat, but some people may prefer fiat lumpsum payment of the total amount because they think they can build a house from it, buy bitcoin from it and have a business from it. But if paid in bitcoin, you can convert some to fiat to have all those.",

I can use half of the money to accumulate Bitcoin with a DCA strategy since am more passionate about holding more Bitcoins. And the other half of the money will be use to run and operate the suitable business ideas I have in mind. Not only that 30% of my profit every month will be added to my Bitcoin accumulation pattern. 45% back to the business and the remaining 20% for my personal use. Since if I have high interest in Bitcoin, accepting Option c would not benefit me because I love to hold for long. Also I have gained knowledge and had experiences that am sure with the $480k lumpsum I will have a very large amount of Bitcoin in a decade. Am certain of that.",
