I think it's not as easy as handling BTC keys.I remember with my XMR cards (where key handling was done by Moonbits) it seemed like more of a hassle than \"simple\" BTC key stuff. #5 has the \"CT\" hallmark hidden in the moon texture, but #1-4 is on the polished side. I have two different designs of XMR. Yeah, XMR is a little more extra Â . Just to verify Monero you need the Public key, Transaction ID and a Transaction key. So you need to supply that to the buyers. You have a Spend and View Key, I put both under the Holo for them.  I probably won't make any more Monero in the near future. Only custom pieces.Here is the latest Monero piece I put out. Mintage of only 15. I still have some available. I think I have them around $240 funded. The Silver Moon will have a funding of 1 XMR",
