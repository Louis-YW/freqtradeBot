  "content": "QuoteIndonesia is hoping to entice more remote workers to the country with a new digital nomad visa.The proposed visa seeks to incentivise digital nomads to work from popular destinations like the island of Bali.Indonesia’s tourism minister Sandiaga Uno said the new permit was part of a move away from sunseeker tourism towards a more sustainable model.What do we know about Indonesia’s new digital nomad visa?The planned digital nomad visa will be valid for five years. It will allow remote workers to live in the country tax-free, as long as their income derives from businesses based outside of Indonesia.The special permit is designed to be a simple solution for foreigners wanting to work in the Asian country. A more streamlined application process and a greater frequency of flights to the archipelago aim to lure employees with work from anywhere policies.The five-year visa would become the longest digital nomad visa available compared to other countries.As yet, guidelines on when and how you can apply for the visa have not been announced.Current visas for remote workers in BaliBali is already a favourite destination for remote workers with its warm climate and low living costs. But current visa rules don’t facilitate long-term stays.At the moment, digital nomads can apply for a temporary visa to work from Indonesia. Options include the Visa on Arrival (VoA), which is valid for 30 days, the tourist visa, which can be renewed to last a total of 60 days, or a business visa that can be extended to 180 days.Visitors staying longer become local tax residents requiring them to pay Indonesia’s tax rates on earnings from overseas.In 2021, an idea for a digital nomad visa was already in the works but plans were derailed when the pandemic forced the island to close borders and restrict visitors.Bringing sustainable tourism to BaliThe remote working visa comes as part of a push for a different kind of tourist in popular destinations like Bali.“In the past, the three S was: sun, sea and sand. We’re moving it to serenity, spirituality and sustainability. This way we’re getting better quality and better impact to the local economy,” Uno told Bloomberg.The minister said the country hopes to see 3.6 million overseas travellers returning to the country next year. The digital nomad visa along with a greater emphasis on eco-tourism and spiritual retreats aims to bring higher spenders who stay longer.https://www.euronews.com/travel/2022/06/24/balis-new-digital-nomad-visa-means-foreigners-can-live-and-work-in-indonesia-tax-free....This caters to remote workers. No word on whether crypto traders might also qualify for zero taxation status.The digital nomad lifestyle is becoming a legitimate trend recognized around the world as boosting local economies and creating jobs. Which in theory, trickles down to elevate local standards of living. Indonesia is not the 1st to offer these terms. Vanuatu, the philippines and others have offered zero taxation status for crypto investors and travellers who earn digital income. Zero taxation is an interesting concept to encourage the opposite of capital flight. Where encouraging big(ger) spenders to immigrate into the country and spend their wealth towards the local economy can be deemed of greater value than potential collected taxes.Perhaps what we see here is a glimpse of what the future will look like.",

It would be good for the matter to finally be finalized and for the authorities in that country to start behaving like professionals, and not for us to read every year about how there are plans - so this is not planning a mission to Mars with a human crew Indonesia's 0% Tax on foreigners and digital nomads",

But be careful and understand that it is developing, therefore you won't be able to find all the resources there but I think Indonesia might be having the next big metropolitan city in the charts even with the tourism that they attract I hope they don't go forth and spoil their natural resources its one of a kind.",

I'm not sure how easy those loopholes would be to plug and if you're a big company predominantly offering online services it surely encourages setting up your company in a country without corporation tax and employing people in Indonesia). Thst being said, there will still be restaurants and shops taking income and having to pay tax locally but I don't know if they'll fully agree with the tax bourdon placed on them (such as having to put their rates up to fund a higher tax bracket for them - since more people's money may be spent there instead of taxes).",

This news is 4 years ago.for sure they will change their approach towards bitcoin as a lot of these digital nomads may be into crypto already. they need to cater the needs of these tourists so it will be very attractive for their tourism businesses. maybe, 4 years ago their approach to crypto was different because they didn't have the good grasp about btc market. and now, if they are seeing top companies that are exploring crypto market, then, more then likely they will have a change of heart on this matter.",

Low earners would find this visa very unattractive because the intention of the government is to make money from indirect tax and not to provide employment. But Indonesia would be a very good location for Bitcoiners because although the Central Bank of Indonesia discourages banks from engaging in crypto transactions but the government have an open door policy on crypto currencies.",
