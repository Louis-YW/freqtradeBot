Bitcoin even increased above $31000.Even during the bull run days, you can see bitcoin fall and rise but rise more than the fall. I am not saying you should be expecting that for now. Bitcoin was below $17000 when this year started and yet $10000 more till now, it is still not bad.Quote from: CYBER_COWBOY on April 22, 2023, 04:21:42 PMDo you guys think it will turn the other way soon and go straight up again or will it keep going down?I thinked this year would be a good BTC year and i still think it will be! But I did not see this coming to be honest.Nobody knows if bitcoin will rise or fall, but if you are holding, you can continue to hold because all-time-high is coming probably before next 2 or 3 years. Like I said, bitcoin was below $17000 in the begging of this year, now still at $27000, it is still not negative.",

There are no good reasons for bitcoin to rise in that valuation, so people are cashing out before they suffer the losses. Bitcoin not being able to support itself. As it stands today, bitcoin still is pretty much bearish, with no clear indication of it going bull, a couple of pumps may come before we really hit a consistent value increase, but until then we can't be so sure of bitcoin. There are a couple more reasons why bitcoin couldn't get out of its 30k prison, but with the halving coming just around the corner, we can say for sure that we'd only have a couple months left to suffer before we get the big breads.",

So don't worry about the decreasing of bitcoin, and if you buy it for now and when the price goes up then you will make your profit. To buy bitcoin in this time is good, don't mind the price decrease that is normal, this will give us a large range to accumulate some people holdings and when the market start going up we can gradually generating profits from the market.",

Do you guys think it will turn the other way soon and go straight up again or will it keep going down?I think that's normal. The correction of BTC price is really normal and most people are aware of it. However, I don't believe that Bitcoin's price will decrease a lot, the lowest it may go down to is around 25k. Quote from: CYBER_COWBOY on April 22, 2023, 04:21:42 PMI thinked this year would be a good BTC year and i still think it will be! But I did not see this coming to be honest.Yeah, definitely. It would turn the other way soon probably in couple of week , and Bitcoin will reach 30k again. I believe that Bitcoin's price will continue to rise, and we may see a new peak by the end of the year, this year looks promising for Bitcoin imo.",

In my personal point of view (this is not financial advice, by the way), this is going to be a good year for Bitcoin, but the previous increases of price in the past month until reaching the 30k$ mark, were too sudden for the expectation most of the traders have on the price of Bitcoin by December. They may feel bullish in the long term but in the short term they felt Bitcoin was over-valued, so they started to sell their positions, hoping to pocket even more Satoshis and harden their bullish positions after they find a new strong support. This is the nature of the market OP, do not feel discouraged about it, we all know this is how volatility works. If you feel your holdings are changing more than you would like them to, then you may be over-invested.",

I could be wrong but this downtrend is like a small dip for the investor's window to come and buy more.Assuming the price will dip a bit deeper to $26k but it will also bounce back to more than $32k after it. The continuous rise of BTC is not a long green candle because this $30k is a resistance line.",

That 50/50 reminds me of the possible sideway movement of BTC in the range of $27k - $30k.  The current drop is too much for a correction,  I believe someone just dumps their stash to take profit and hopes for the Bitcoin price to drop more in order to reenter the market.  This also indicates that the market is yet to enter its bullish phase, probably we still need to wait some more months for that bullish market mode.",

The going down of bitcoin is a normal thing, for those who understand it have nothing to worry about the decline. Why do you even asked whether Bitcoin will still go up, or are you doubting bitcoin? To cap it all, Bitcoin will rise again even before the year will end.There was a prediction by bitcoin market price experts also here in the forum that bitcoin would climb to 30$ and we have seen it. As it is going down, it also helps the new buyers in the market.",
