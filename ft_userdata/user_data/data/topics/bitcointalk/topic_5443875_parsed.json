All of this costs a lot of money. But our crypto exchange engine is free.Of course, then the owner/company will manage the exchange with the help of their team, which involves costs. But this doesn’t apply to the initial cost of developing the exchange as an online platform.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on March 07, 2023, 01:49:36 PMWhat's the catch?You surely wouldn't spend your time and resources creating such a good platform only for you to provide it for people to use for free.

Donations from well-wishers?We believe that by developing as an open-source product we can achieve much more. We want to make OpenCEX an industry standard, just like Wordpress has become for building websites. There are many examples of large-cap opens-source companies, and this is our way.We want to give the crypto community an easy and simple solution, and then make money on complex implementations for institutional players (banks, brokerage firms, etc.).",

For a moment let's consider that OP is providing free crypto exchange business ideas to the Bussniess minded people in the industry who are thinking of lunch their own exchange but why would they even trust the free crypto exchange setup as it's not at all reliable for them even who is trying to make it in cheap won't prefer it.

Your coin, branded exchange - very synergistic! We receive a lot of requests from people who would like to issue their own token and make their own exchange.At CEX, everything is the same. For example, to launch a TOKEN-USDT trading pair, you will need a certain amount of TOKENS and a certain amount of USDT. However, in the case of CEX, you have many more tools for market making. In particular, you don't have to freeze all liquidity, you only need it when a user wants to make a withdrawal from your platform.",

If the deposit did not pass the verification (came from a bad source), it will not be collected and an alert will be sent. You can then contact the user and carry out the necessary additional checks and take the necessary actions.In order for KYT to work, you need to buy a service package from Scorechain and add the necessary keys.We also plan to add Crystal Blockchain for KYT verification (exchange owner also would need to buy the package) .",
