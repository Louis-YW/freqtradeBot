What did you think will be bitcoin highest price in May?I don't put my capital at risk with my guess, prediction or any uncertain thing.\"Sell in May and go away\", did you hear about it?If you have Bitcoin, you can hold it and ignore all price movement not only in the new month May 2023 but rest months of this year. Next year, it will have a next block reard halving and you will see a beauty of its parabolic price growth with its next big bull run.I don't see need to put myself into headache situation by guessing, predicting, gambling with leverage and facing with forced liquidations.Let's simply count down time till its next halving with about 362 days more to go.https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/Halving progress https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/stats/halving-progress/ and comparison of different bull market eras https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/stats/compare-bull-markets/",

Little by little there is less and less left for the halving, and although the big rise usually occurs a year after the halving, there is also a trend in previous months to the price rise. Moreover, it seems that the low point of the bear market has been reached and is now behind us. Therefore, I believe that there is going to be a moderate upward price trend.",

What did you think will be bitcoin highest price in May?In 2021 Bitcoin price came down again from the all time high to $16000 and about 1 year Bitcoin price was staying at $20k. From that position Bitcoin started to turn bullish again. Bitcoin behaved very positively in the month of March and April. Investors' confidence has also been increasing tremendously in recent times. As a result, we will gradually see the Bitcoin rumble, and I will consider this May as an important month Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin has the potential to gain 25 percent within this month from its current price. As such, I think Bitcoin price may rise to $35k by this month may.",

It was $29230 at the end of the month.With the panic on bitcoin price I believe this month of May will be very good than the past 4 months, which has been a lifter of price and I am still optimism about the price of Bitcoin still maintain 30k plus..So, here are two things very possible in price this month. If bitcoin cross the price of 35k then seeing 40k is possible but In a way we couldn't see 35k then it will only dangle around 26k to 35k till the month May runs out.",
