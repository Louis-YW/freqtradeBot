The dis website and mining pool browsers are all closed. no notice, no sound???The GitHub repository was also archived yesterday, which means it's no longer maintained. This is strange to happen just three days after the last update from Op. Although this was expected from the beginning as the concept is old-fashioned and the team aims to progress without a marketing strategy but to publish updates in bitcointalk and some other social media.And as there are no updates in all channels, i don't expect this to be a pause before the big update. Just wonder why they exit in this way if no issue was encountered. I really hope that this project didn't turn into a scam after failing to collect enough budget to lunch its mainnet.I expect OP to come back to this thread to lock it as well.",

      "body": "Important Announcement Regarding BlockyFile ProjectDear Community,After much deliberation and discussions within our team, we have come to a difficult decision regarding the future of the BlockyFile project. We have decided to close the project, as it has been acquired by another company. As a result, BlockyFile will be rebranded and operated under a different name by the new company.We understand that this news may come as a surprise, and we want to express our gratitude for your support and participation in the BlockyFile community. We are incredibly proud of what we have achieved together, and we believe that the project is in good hands with the acquiring company.As required by the sales contract, we have had to withdraw any website put online, and for the moment, we cannot communicate the name of the company that has bought the project. However, we encourage you to keep an eye on the forum, where you will soon see a new project with a similar technology emerging.Once again, we want to thank you for being a part of the BlockyFile community and for your enthusiasm and contributions to the project. We appreciate your understanding during this transition period.Best regards,BlockyFile Team",
