The market is a bit young, but it's already becoming competitive with ETH, not to mention Solan and other Cardano. Do you think there will be a boom for it like there was for NFTs in the previous bull market?Ordinals is a relatively new market that is competing with established cryptocurrencies such as ETH, Solana, and Cardano. It is difficult to predict whether there will be a boom for Ordinals similar to the one seen for NFTs in the previous bull market. Much will depend on the market's adoption and the unique features and benefits that it offers compared to other cryptocurrencies. Only time will tell how the Ordinals market will evolve and develop in the coming years.",

We have NFTs in multiple networks but not in the prime network that started it all, so it's about time something like it came around the corner. I could also understand people's statements regarding the \"scammy\" nature of Ordinals given the fact that apart from it being scribed to a Satoshi, there's not much really that is remarkable about bitcoin NFTs that sets it apart from regular NFTs per se, but that in my opinion is up for the projects that will be made in the Ordinal Protocol. We've seen cryptopunks, there's a possibility that in future renditions of bitcoin NFTs we see powerful features and benefits just like what we see now in Ethereum and other networks. I say we give it time and chance.",

I don't think this will be effective since it is easy to make and launch on other networks that offer much easier features.If someone is thinking of realizing these projects, then he is certainly a professional impostor or a beginner who wants to create innovations that he does not know that someone has thought of them before him.

Do you think there will be a boom for it like there was for NFTs in the previous bull market?I think ordinals is relatively new and still young project. Nft has become one of the best money maker last bull run so Im not sure whether this will trigger another bull effect. But for me, Ai application and possible integration into chain could be another option for that. But no one yet to applied a kicker for that and will definitely see it for sure in the coming days.",

Do you think there will be a boom for it like there was for NFTs in the previous bull market?As far as my observations of the market go, some signs of a new trend have been mentioned a lot, and I think NFT is just one area where the market has not yet been effectively applied beyond the hype. Although I have heard of Ordinals in various media, the impression from it is really nonexistent, and I think the next bull market will be less talk about the NFT sector.",

In 2021, the fees were super high, on the order of 200 satoshi per byte. Now add to this hype the NFT issue, the mempools will be overflowing and bitcoin transfer fees will fly into space and will be comparable in price to ETH smart contracts interaction fees.",

Ordinal is pretty new we only can see from nowThat is an interesting technological change but it seems of zero use. If they really want to develop something new and unique then they should be developing the network scalability, something that will help gain high speed transaction along with better service oriented projects. Rest of the alts and NFT projects are just those repeated stuff all the time. Game companies are making their own in game tokens then naming them some NFT and valued at xxx and just keeping hype of it all the time. Now this ordinal thing which seems to be just some sort of tag on it really doesn’t make any difference. That’s gonna be waste of time for sure.",

Yes, Somehow Layer 2 on bitcoin become popular We know the lightning network and OmniLayer that been used by Tether. Yesterday I found Stacks and today I found MintLayer.My point is Bitcoin is already full of transactions  and still popular and drives the company to make layer 2 on the network. If Layer like this keep coming the fee might be crazy",

While both are blockchain-based technologies, they serve different purposes. NFTs were a unique way to represent digital ownership and authenticity, while Ordinals is more focused on creating a decentralized identity platform.",
