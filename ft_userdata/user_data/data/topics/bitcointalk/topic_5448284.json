  "content": "https://i.ibb.co/tBx3C8C/logo-ffg.pnghttps://filefilego.com/Peer-to-peer, censorship-resistant, and a privacy-focused data sharing networkThe FileFileGo protocol is a peer-to-peer data-sharing network designed for the web3 era, with an incentive mechanism, full-text search, storage, and indexing/tracking. Its decentralized architecture enables users to share data without censorship or a single point of failure. By leveraging game-theory concepts, FileFileGo incentivizes participation and ensures data availability while achieving fault-tolerance and preserving privacy.As the internet has grown, it has become increasingly vulnerable to censorship and control by large corporations and ISPs. Governments have also attempted to regulate the flow of information online, making it challenging for informational platforms to operate without interruption. The FileFileGo protocol was developed to address these issues and enable users to access and share information freely.FileFileGo is an open-source community project, with no centralized control or ownership. Its coin distribution is designed to be fair, with an emission of 40 FFG per block that decreases by half every 24 months. The protocol is launched without ICO/STO/IEO or pre-mine, relying on a Proof of Authority consensus algorithm that will eventually transition to Proof of Stake to allow more stakeholders to participate.So what problem does it solve?We highly recommend reading the documentation (https://filefilego.com/documentation/docs/) which explains every piece of the system and the challenges it solves.A simple example would be, a \"channel\" that can be created and called \"BitcoinTalk\" and under this channel, the owner/posters/admins can create sub-channels, entries, folders, and files. Textual data will be on-chain and files will be off-chain using the storage engine. We have developed a novel algorithm that can verify if a file was successfully transferred from one node to another node mathematically and deterministically. These algorithms are Proof of Data Transfer and they are used as the main incentive mechanism for releasing funds to a file hoster. (data is downloaded by the downloader, applying a fee that the file hoster requires)What are we doing on bitcointalk?Filefilego is an open-source community project, we encourage and seek contributions and innovative ideas to ensure that the Internet remains an open and decentralized platform.Any user can join the network by running a full node and enabling the Storage Engine, which they can later use to upload data. File downloaders requesting your data, will be required to pay the fees the storage provider has specified (when running a full node its required to specify the fees_per_byte)Blockchain info:Blockchain Consensus Algorithm: currently PoA and later transition to PoS https://filefilego.com/documentation/docs/consensus.htmlFile Transfer Consensus Algorithm: Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) - Proof-of-Data Possession (PoDP)Block time: 10 secondsTotal Supply: 500 Million FFGValidation/Stake Reward: 40 FFG per BlockEmission: Divide by 2 every 24 monthsWebsite:https://filefilego.com/Developer Documentation:https://filefilego.com/documentation/docs/Github: https://github.com/filefilego/filefilego/Social:Telegram: https://t.me/filefilegoDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/qhKkKZ9filefilego v.1.1.8 (current release) implementation: https://github.com/filefilego/filefilego/releases/latestThe client is stable and running on main-netfilefilego UI https://github.com/filefilego/filefilego-uiThe wallet application will be used to interact with the blockchain/network with a UIPlease feel free to ask your questions about this project",

More info please. Hi,We are currently running a PoA consensus algorithm, which means we have a set of validators that \"Seal\" blocks. The decision for this choice was that new blockchains like FileFileGo could easily be attacked since there is already a huge amount of processing power out there. You can \"Mine\" coins by providing your storage node to people who would like to utilize your storage. This procedure is not exactly mining, but a reward system that allows you to get paid for the data users download from you. The consensus mechanism for transferring the data from one node to another node and verifying it properly is the main innovation of this project. We proof mathematically that a set of data (bytes) were transferred from one node to another with a little bit of signature generation and cryptography.I hope my answer helped you understand how the project works. You can always ready the documentation (https://filefilego.com/documentation/docs/) or if you want further clarification feel free to ask here",

The algorithm behind this is called Proof of Data Transfer, and uses cryptographic functions to perform the verification.I recommend that you wait for mid-May when we will have the GUI app and downloader, which will allow average users easily interact with the blockchain.Currently there is the cli implementation which offers all the functionalities ( https://github.com/filefilego/filefilego/ )If you want to buy coins, join us on discord and talk to us: https://discord.gg/qhKkKZ9",

Over the course of the past 8 weeks, we have successfully achieved the following milestones:1. We have developed a mobile wallet application for Android and iOS platforms, which is currently awaiting approval.2. Our FileFileGo user interface has been developed and is now compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.3. We have implemented a payment gateway on our website, enabling users to purchase FFG tokens conveniently.4. We are pleased to announce our collaboration with a reputable data center located in the Netherlands. This partnership allows us to offer dedicated servers for storage, ensuring high quality and optimal performance.Moving forward, we have outlined the following milestones for our project:1. Creation of comprehensive tutorials that will guide users through the entire process of utilizing FFG, from beginner to advanced levels.2. Development of a block explorer to enhance the functionality and transparency of our platform.3. Implementation of strategic marketing initiatives and pursuit of listing opportunities on prominent cryptocurrency exchanges.For regular updates, we encourage you to join our Discord channel.

Not one single piece of personal info is stored anywhere on the system including the website so you are wrong.Luckily for us everything is open-source and people can verify and see what the project does and how it does it!Show proof otherwise you are showing your lack of knowledge about the subject.For those who want to understand the algorithm with a simple example:1. Node 1 stores a 20GB file, and it asks for a fee as a storage fee+retrieval fee2. Node 2 wants to get that fileThere are 2 problems here:Node 1 sends the file, but node 2 denies it got the file to prevent paying the feesOrNode 1 actually doesn't send that file instead some random data which is not the file requested, and collects the fees.In this case both nodes can not be trusted, so in order to prove that the requested file was successfully transferred  we developed the proof of data transfer algorithm which can be found in our repo",

High fees might be against you since users might pick someone cheaper.About the payment, yes it's automated and part of the verification algorithm. When the downloader asks decryption key from the verifier, it sends a signature of the local file and by that time the verifier knows if the file is the requested file.The fees will be unlocked immediately and sent to storage providerPlease check: https://github.com/filefilego/filefilego/blob/master/node/protocols/data_verification/data_verification.go",

Hi, a file is divided into 1024 segments (or less sometimes) before it's sent to the data requester. Currently, the network encrypts 1% of those segments so it would be around 10 segments to be encrypted using AES or Chacha depending on the hardware support.The only overhead is the encryption of those 10 segments which is very small and normal these days considering most hardware of storage providers have AES instruction set on the CPU, so to conclude there is a very small overhead which is completely fine.We also randomize those segments, so the additional overhead is random seek for 1024 segments on the HDD/SSD which is again negligible.You can verify these at: https://github.com/filefilego/filefilego/blob/master/common/file_utils.goCode:func PrepareFileBlockRanges()func FileSegmentsInfo()func GenerateRandomIntSlice()",
