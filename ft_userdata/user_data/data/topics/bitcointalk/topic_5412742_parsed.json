So they have to divert attention and find culprits.So.. what entity or industry is consuming energy, and they can blame all this on and still make them look good? Bitcoin.Their banker friends will be happy, older existing energy-hungry industry owners will be happy, bitcoin needs some bashing to \"protect\" the fiat and the printing machine... it's really the closest to a win-win scenario.Ah, some geeks will be unhappy about all this? So what?...or you thought those politicians and media (owned or under contract with politicians) do care about you, or us?!",

It seems that the on-duty critics still haven't got hold of the new data, which will surely serve them for new attacks at a time when we have a real energy crisis anyway.Looking at the recent hashrate increase there's still a distortion due to the Jul 2021 hashrate drop though, ie. a lot of the growth of the last 365 days is presumably hardware coming back online after having been relocated. So compared to last year's peak of ~180.66 EH/s we are currently only up ~27% at ~230 EH/s [1]. Accounting for the improved hashrate and efficiency of current mining hardware [2] it actually looks more like there's been a decrease in deployed hardware, as old ASICs become deprecated and are replaced, leading to slightly less energy consumption overall (assuming miners are still trying to make a profit, which seems likely). This would also fit with current Bitcoin price declines and increased energy prices.[1] https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate[2] https://www.asicminervalue.com/efficiency/sha-256",

But still I think it can be tackled.The world always will be evolving and I think Crypto-currency and bitcoin should too, no that Crypto-currency is part of our future so it's impacts on us financially, and also environmentally.

I don't think people will waste so much energy because they know that their electric bills are also going to be expensive if they do and I think so many appliances or gadgets right now have an energy saving feature so there is only less to none energy that are going to be wasted.

We can't expect good news or positive information regarding it. And those that spread FUD, I think most of them are not part of government. But, they have that agenda because bitcoin is hitting their business and that's why they have to do what they have to do. The same goes for those that are spreading FUD, they have their own reasons like they just want to see bitcoin at a cheap rate so everything they can describe things at their comfort for bitcoin's negativity.There's always those biased people because they're not sincere of what they do but only tell things so that it will be at their advantage like these FUDs about bitcoin's electricity consumption.",

Not only because it's more of a valid energy use than a waste but also because the concern is more or less a FUD, which is mainly coming from solid anti-Bitcoin critics who are blind to objective data. Today, I guess it is not given significance anymore. However, it doesn't mean that the industry hasn't improved in terms of emission and the use of better energy source.But worry not about this.
