Many scammers show fake usdc screenshots (especially on bsc network) while dealing with newbies online. Ppl think they are the real whales (who got worthless usdc) and fall for it quite easily by exchanging their real btc for worthless token. One scammer even tried this trick on me before lol. Is it possible to warn ppl about a fake token transaction just based on tx id and without them putting in the contract address?I feel this should be moved to service discussion board.",

The developers of these scam coins are rushing to deceive investors with the imaginary high profits from their investments by promoting these coins, most of which are new projects on a large scale and are listed on Dexscreener, Birdeye, etc. Suppose the investor does not conduct his research and analyze the token contract and liquidity (locked), the number of holders, and so on and use the Honeypot Checker Tools and review the project in all its aspects. In that case, he will inevitably lose his capital in tokens he cannot sell. It is good that you have updated the topic now and added these valuable sources and some useful tools.",

If they are careful people, they will not interact with those tokens. Being scammed with tokens already appeared on Coinmarketcap, Coingecko or DEX is another level, and at least scam project teams actually spent more efforts for their scam.QuoteIt is good that you have updated the topic now and added these valuable sources and some useful tools.Just try to be helfpul and kindly share what I know.Even top altcoins are not safe, it's worth to raise a red flag that honeypot scam tokens are more risky than top altcoins.Don't buy altcoins because they are top altcoins",

Bitcoin is fully decentralised and should be left alone but not the same with altcoin, they are here to milk people and run away, I do wish that crypto has some certificate embedded to it, you can only create token if you have the pass.

Thank you for your opinion that is in my mind when I made this thread but honestly I did not go to many details like your thought.

If their teams don't plan to make scam exit, they can simply fail to develop their projects and a failed project means many people lose money invested in that token.In this topic, I focus on unverified tokens because they're at lowest scam level and people who are new in this market must have basic knowledge to avoid scams from these scammers who put very little resources for their scam attempts.",
