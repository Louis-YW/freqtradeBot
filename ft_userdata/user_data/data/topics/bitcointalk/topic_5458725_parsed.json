There are many spv wallets, prune nodes,  other full nodes implementations, etc...Why do you want to run libbitcoin? If you want to run a full node, you should run bitcoin core which is the most used one, unless you really need something else.https://bitcoincore.org/en/download bitcoin is the most decentralized cryptocurrency that exists and there are thousands of full nodes running 24/7",

That's probably why you don't see that many Bitcoin clients popping up everywhere. Unlike, say, Ethereum, where it is companies who are the ones maintaining all the different reference clients.But if you're still looking for an alternate full node client, you can use Bitcoin Knots (by luke dash-jr). I cannot vouch for it though, as I have never used it.",

Different implementations might indeed reject those blocks instantly, but if any of the implementations would have a share >50%, it still wouldn't stop it. One way or another, it would need to be fixed and trigger a chain reorganization for anyone who's on the faulty chain, and don't think it's an improvement if different people see different blocks as the most recent ones.",

See what happened with LND last year. Twitter user Burak did a 998-of-999 Tapscript multi-sig and crushed all LND nodes. The lightning network continued running, because other implementations (such as c-lightning) were existent. Sure, in terms of node connectivity, the network was damaged, but it didn't stop, and that's valuable if we're valuing decentralization.",

This is a good question.Yes, there are tens of thousands or more.According to bitstamp (which is the oldest exchange still in operation  quite reliable imo), there are even many nodes which are not reachedable  Quotehttps://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/what-are-bitcoin-blockchain-nodes/Keeping Bitcoin decentralizedThe Bitcoin network depends on the many random, unconnected users who run full nodes on their computers and thus keep Bitcoin decentralized. There are currently over 10,000 reachable full nodes distributed across the world. It is likely that the actual number of nodes is much higher. These are just those that can be reached by any node. Many nodes are inaccessible for several reasons. They might have gone offline or their owners might have chosen to disable incoming connections and, therefore, can’t be reached.",

I have always has the fear that the number of people running full node is reducing drastically. Roughly 16K, at least according to BitNodes though there isn't an accurate methodology to prove this; their crawler sends getaddr to nodes to get a list of IPs which are running a full node and the realtime number can vary drastically. Anyhow, the number shouldn't matter but the geographical distribution is by far more important. A vast majority of full nodes are Bitcoin Core and for a good reason as well. They are generally well tested and each commit is vetted fairly rigorously and the likelihood of a severe bug or an exploit is unlikely. Though that has happened in the past, most of it are not as severe or easy to execute as the development matures.",

Thanks for the information.  Both are pointing towards same direction. There is atleast 10k active full nodes.

I think the major concern should be if the government of that country rises against bitcoin mining Centralization and redundancy goes hand in hand. If for some reason, a certain country experiences a natural disaster or any form of attack that disrupts the internet connection, electricity, etc. You would see a pretty big drop in node count. It wouldn't pose as a critical threat but it is certainly not what we want.Bitcoin mining and running a Bitcoin node is quite different. Latter is harder to crackdown.",

IIRC, the numbers that we have today is much higher than when I first discovered Bitcoin (in the range of 7-9k) and Bitnodes was running a campaign to encourage people to run full nodes.
