Reminds me of the people a in 2019 and 2020 who were waiting for it to get back close to $20k to sell hahahaI think the S2F model just fails to take into account diminishing returns and the fact that most people are still confused/scared/reticent and above all else misinformed about Bitcoin and so market cycles will get much smaller than they were last decade as the general public is only going to slowly be educated on bitcoin and it will take many years for the general public to slowly wade into owning bitcoin. $500k+ will obviously get hit in the future, but it's not gonna be this market cycle, it miiiiight be the top of the 2032/2033 cycle but will definitely pass it in the 2036/37 cycle (if that is the 4 year cycle hasn't entirely faded away by that point as halvings get far less important to supply).",

Not because it's impossible, but because I just don’t believe that it is possible.  ~$500k is too much for the nearest halving. A more realistic value is something like $100k.Forecasts are always accurate only on paper, but in practice everything turns out completely differently.Quote from: zasad@ on January 10, 2024, 02:38:37 PMWhen I see posts like this, I understand that it’s time to sell Bitcoin. Otherwise, I don’t understand who will pay for this holiday of generosity.Now? Isn't it too early? But it seemed to me that ~$40 was not the limit for the current cycle.I assume that until the nearest halving there will probably be some drop in the bitcoin's price (unconfirmed forecasts), because growth is not linear, but occurs in waves.",

The pseudonymous bitcoin analyst and the creator of the bitcoin price model called stock-to-flow (S2F), Plan B, called the last three months of bitcoin prices correctly but the analyst’s “worst-case scenario” forecast missed the mark in November. Despite the recent bitcoin price drop, Plan B still seems confident bitcoin’s price is “on track towards $100K.” He has invested so much time and effort in his model, and has gained so much fame with it that instead of doing what a scientist would do, which would be to falsify the theory, what he does is to keep reformulating it even though it does not agree with the facts.",

It is wrong to sell early or sell at a low profit, but after selling at a good opportunity, you definitely have an opportunity to buy again at a lower price.It's good that you have seen the price of Bitcoin and realized that it is wrong to sell early. However, man learns from mistakes, still if you can hold Bitcoin for long term, it can give you a huge profit. People who think that bitcoin is dead or that bitcoin will disappear have absolutely no idea of the potential of bitcoin. So we should not pay any attention to such things of people.

It is wrong to sell early or sell at a low profit, but after selling at a good opportunity, you definitely have an opportunity to buy again at a lower price.The problem with those people in my opinion is that they don't have a lot of stuff to do besides watching their crypto grow in profit, if you actually don't think about it that much, you inevitably hodl too long than you've ever been when you're watching your crypto 24/7, getting a hobby that doesn't involve cryptocurrency can help you not make the mistake of selling early because you're watching it everytime. Totally agree, it should be at the right opportunity you should be selling and not at the price that many think is the right time to sell.Quote from: MFahad on January 10, 2024, 03:34:42 PMQuote from: blckhawk on January 10, 2024, 02:48:14 PM~It's good that you have seen the price of Bitcoin and realized that it is wrong to sell early.

The people you're talking about are split in a category, one is the people that will never get over it and think that it's going to be that way forever even if they're wrong so many times about the death of bitcoin and those that will get over it and go to the side that invests in bitcoin eventually and rants about regretting not getting in when bitcoin's price was much lower than the time that he got in.",

As long as we are still confident and our target is still not achieved for bitcoin then we still have to wait until the target we are aiming for can be achieved.",
