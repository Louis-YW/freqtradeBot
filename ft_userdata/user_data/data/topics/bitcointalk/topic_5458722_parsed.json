You were running Bitcoin-QT in 2011? And you don't remember how the wallet was created?What is the timestamp on the file?What folder did you find the wallet file in?How big is the wallet file (how many byes)?Do you know any of the bitcoin addresses from the wallet?Why do you think that a random file you found on your old Compaq is a Bitcoin wallet?Were there any other files in the same folder? If so, what were the file names?A hex value of 20 indicates a \"space\" from the spacebar on a standard keyboard.  If that image that you provided is from a hex dump of the file that you found, then it's just filled with nothing but blank spaces. No actual data. It's as if you opened up a text editor and just held down the spacebar for a while and then save the file and renamed it to \"wallet.dat\".Does that sound like something you might have done back in 2011?  If so, then this is not a Bitcoin wallet.Or, did you perhaps purchase this file from someone?  If so, you've been scammed.",

It's usually just a few kB or MB in size.If it doesn't contain a lot of transactions, it could be an altcoin wallet or just pure garbage/corrupted data (like seen in the screenshot).",
