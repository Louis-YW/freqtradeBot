Any help is greatly appreciated. OP you need to pas several process. If you had mention the version of Bitcoin Armory version then it will be more easy. You can check below1. Install the Bitcoin Armory in computer (if not yet)2. Connect your cold storage device with computer 3. Launch the bitcoin armory software on your computer.4. Use sweep function to send full balance from your cold storage to another Bitcoin address. It's quicker but charging a transaction fee.5. Now do all ordinary processes according to the software guidance. 6: Once your Bitcoins are accessible through Bitcoin Armory, you can send them to your Coinbase account. You'll need your Coinbase Bitcoin address for this and also your coinbase should KYC passed.7:Â  After the Bitcoins arrive in your Coinbase account, you can exchange them for USD within the Coinbase platform..I hope this will work. If any problem kindly send screenshots.",
