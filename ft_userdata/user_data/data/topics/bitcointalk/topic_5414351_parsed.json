  "content": "Hello Bitcointalk family.As you know I have been in the mining space since 2012, I have studied and researched hundreds of miners over thousands of hours. We have all experienced spiking difficulty and diminishing returns, these combined with a bear market are a recipe for disaster. I have something special to share with you that has proven profitable long term. The incredibly innovative, energy efficient M2 Pro Miner – By MatchXThis is not your traditional Proof-of-work miner but instead something very innovative. The M2 Pro Miner is an IoT Device  that can mine multiple cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Participation protocol. Currently MXC, BTC, DHX and soon to be added DOT.The M2 Pro miner is an extremely energy efficient miner, drawing less than 3.5 watts on average and 6 watts at full load making theM2 Pro is hundreds of times more efficient than traditional miners.  This miner uses less power than a low powered light bulb.Another great feature of this miner is how quickly it can be set up, no connecting to pools and setting up workers. This miner is truly plug’n’play. You download the app on your mobile, scan the miners QR code and you are ready to mine. The M2 Pro Miner makes no noise, it is SILENT. You can have this miner in the same room when you sleep and you would not even notice it. It is fantastic that IoT devices offer a new form of earnings without the annoying side effects of traditional PoW mining.                          My experience  and genuine thoughts on the M2 Pro Miner: (11 months)This has been one of my best experiences mining I have ever experienced, this miner is neat, sleek, quiet, low powered and more importantly profitable.The Miner costed around $2700 USD and I have mined a total of 54,100 MXC in the last 11 months. That is currently worth $3873 at the time of writing this. The miner has been consistently mining over $10 per day every day for 11 months straight (Mining MXC alone). You do not get that type of consistency in the PoW mining world.  The additional profit is from the capital gains from the MXC tokens.I forget this thing even exists because it’s so small and quiet. This has been one hell of a miner, I highly recommend the M2 Pro Miner.                  The Basics of the miner:You want to keep miner health at 100% to yield the maximum rewards.There are a few different factors that affect miner health:1. Uptime:How long your miner has been connected to the internet. After 7 days you have 100% uptime2. Fuel tank:This is how much MXC you have mined, if you withdraw your mined MXC your miner health will be affected. If you withdraw all of your fuel your miner health will reduce to 20%. You can trade the markets and sell MXC at a high price, then buy it back at a cheaper price and refuel.  Or you can do what I did and don’t withdraw any MXC until you are ready to take profits.3. Proximity:You can only have a maximum of 10 miners in a 2km hexagon. If you add more miners you will start to experience reduced miner health.  The more miners you add after that will have reduced miner health to the point where the 15th miner upwards will experience a 100% miner health reduction.             Bonding MXC:You can also bond MXC tokens to mine either DHX or BTC, you need to have a miner and bond at least 5000MXC in order to mine BTC (there is no threshold to mine DHX). I am not sure exactly how much Bitcoin can be mined but it should be around the $0.60 per day per 5000MXC. There is also no limit to the amount of MXC that can be bonded. Meaning if my calculations are correct then 50000 MXC will yield $6 per day.                 MXC Coinmarketcap:  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mxc/You can purchase these through the official website:   https://matchx.io/OR AlternativelyContact me on discord: Bittawm #7197 or PM me here. Please note:  I can help negotiate good discounts and will be frequently buying in volume.",

I think I have interested if the requirement is easy.Yeah that is with Helium.MXC is different.One miner in a remote location will pump out maximum rewards (up to 10 miners).When you have more than 10 the returns diminishDM me on DiscordBittawm#7197",

Maybe it is interesting for someone here.",

Honestly, I never knew this existed. Its pretty cool.With GPU down the drain it might get some sales. Miners are desperate for income right now. How long has this miner been out? Over 2 years now. Surprised i've never heard about it before.",
