It's important to be flexible and adapt to unexpected expenses as they arise. However, setting a budget can still be a helpful tool for managing expenses and ensuring that one's financial resources are being used effectively. It's good to hear that you have found a daily budget that works for you",

Tracking our expenses helps us ensure we are not overspending and enables us to make informed financial decisions.I spend about $40 a day on average. That includes my daily commute, meals, and other miscellaneous expenses. I use a budgeting app to track my expenses, and I try to stick to a daily spending limit. It is not always easy, but it helps me to avoid overspending.",

The numbers differ greatly on one's \"class\", country he lives in, family (some are helped by their families, some have smaller or bigger family to support) some have better jobs and afford this or that, some not, some are even affected by war(s). Even more.. no offense, but why would anybody give you this kind of .. rather personal information? I mean not only a number which alone doesn't mean much, instead the whole situation/story... no.About the daily expenses, I do keep an excel file, not only to get an idea on the expenses but also to keep an eye on errors or other \"surprises\" on the credit card too.",

You may use those saving and spending tracking apps if you're having a hard time managing it. Those apps will help you to manage everything that you want to related to finances, budgeting, and expenses. But for me, I know my spending habits and that's why I don't get to track all of it. It's like a typical day and the budget is set so whether it goes on full or not, that's already good enough for me and will look forward to the next day.",

Do you think is possible to program your daily expenses?Bitcoin prices are primarily presented to us relative to the dollar.  And the money of my country is very low compared to the dollar and a person in my country earns a maximum of $300. But it is possible to earn huge amount of money every month through Bitcoin.  I myself earn at least $800-$1000 per month which is about the salary of 4 top employees in my country. So in that case I have very little illusion of money.  From the person of an employee. Whereas a person earning $200-$300 a month would think twice to spend money anywhere but Bitcoin users would not think to spend money anywhere because they earn comparatively more money than them with less effort.  And I can say that those who use Bitcoin have a lot of unnecessary expenses. So I can't specify the daily spending amount of a bitcoin user.  But it sure is a lot more than a Bitcoin non-user",

Do you think is possible to program your daily expenses?Its important for one to have plans for daily to monthly expenses based on the person's income. This will help you to control your expenses that would have led to overspending. People that spends above their income become victims of the burden associated with loans and debts. Although you might not follow the plan judiciously because each day might come with unbudgeted expenses but a plan serves as a roadmap and control mechanism. While sometimes it is possible to program you expenses because you spend specifically what you budgeted for that day.My country is suffering from hyperinflation making it difficult to state categorically what I spend in a day. I am spending double of the amount I spent last year on the same products. But $20 will be enough for my daily need as an individual but when I add the needs of other dependants is will increase based on the number I have in the house per time.",

Quote from: Godlovesyou on March 26, 2023, 06:07:27 PMDo you think is possible to program your daily expenses?It is very possible to program and keep in check the amount you spend daily, the trick is to avoid buying things in small insufficient quantity. If you buy things in bulk, you will spend less than choosing to buy daily. You should also avoid buying things you did not plan for. Good financial discipline is an essential habit to building wealth.",

As for my daily expenses, TBH my daily expenses is kind of low, and the reason is that I'm living on a third world country. I guess my daily expenses is lower than 10$. That includes my breakfast, morning snack, lunch, dinner, and sometimes midnight snack. I don't know if 10$ per day is too high or too low, but I find it low because I can still invest a portion of my monthly income. I'm also not commuting so I excluded transportation expenses because I'm working from our home. There are times where I'm spending more than 10$ because of some unexpected expenses like going out with friends, or buying things that I need.Our daily expenses depends on the country we are living in. A first world country has a higher income, but a higher expenses as well and vice-versa.",

Daily budgeting is time-consuming, and you should always plan out first what you will do in half a month or a month, depending on your salary. When I get my monthly salary, I plan out how much I will spend for the entire month, including the budget for my daily expenses, which sets a daily limit. Also, don't forget to have extra money on hand in case you get sick and need to buy medicines, etc.",
