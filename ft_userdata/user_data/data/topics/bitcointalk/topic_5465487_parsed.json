  "content": "Hi, I sent a bitcoin transaction from my son's Armoury wallet on his PC, the bitcoin was redeemed from a cold wallet to his wallet & I sent it to my own personal Armoury wallet on my PC last night, both are Armoury (0.96). It still remains unconfirmed in my wallet after 95 confirmations now. I marked it as RBF when it was sent & it is flagged in the received transactions in my wallet as: ***RBF Flagged*... The maximum funds reads correct but the spendable funds reads zero & the balance is red & unconfirmed, my wallet is connected & I can right click on the transaction & view it on the blockchain.Did I do something wrong checking the RBF box on sending & how can I get the transaction to confirm?Thanks.",

      "body": "A transaction can't be confirmed and unconfirmed at the same time. I guess your transaction has been already confirmed and included in the blockchain, but your wallet doesn't show it as a confirmed transaction because it's not fully synced.What's the number of blocks shown at the bottom right corner of the window? Till now, 806032 blocks have been mined and if you see a smaller number, it means that your wallet is not fully synced. Can you share the transaction ID here? (Note that you may harm your privacy if you share the transaction ID. Don't do that, if you care about your privacy.)Quote from: Tigerbill on September 03, 2023, 10:02:05 AMDid I do something wrong checking the RBF box on sendingNo.",

      "body": "Not sure if it's the case but is there the possibility you have another unconfirmed transaction linked to this one (for example, a change transaction)? If so you can try to spend that unconfirmed output with a higher fee, and this might encourage miners to confirm both transactions (CPFP). But I'm more inclined to believe hosseinimr is correct and the issue could be related to your wallet synch.

You need to provide more details about your issue like adding armory logs here to analyze the issue and why it's stuck.This Armory wallet is not newbie-friendly if you want ease of use I suggest switch to Electrum it doesn't need to be fully synced and you can also make an offline or cold wallet.",

If you see a transaction from the address owned by your son to an address owned by you in block explorers, it means that the transaction has been made. A solution for you is to export your private key(s) from Armory and import it into a SPV wallet like electrum.In SPV wallets, you don't have to download the blockchain and you won't have such troubles. Take note that if you use a SPV wallet and you don't want to download the blockchain, you have to connect to servers provides by third parties and that may harm your privacy.",

Your best path forward is to empty your \"databases\" folder. You'll find it in the Armory datadir then start Armory.
