This should be the case for monthly users or stuff related to that. For the game's specific coin usage, adoption, growth, etc., I believe sites where the coin of the game is registered such as Coingecko or coinmarketcap should be enough as sources. Just, gotta stretch some of that muscle to summarize it all. If they were relatively new though then their coin might not even be registered at all, so you just have to wait for those instances. If you're THAT lazy, then hire someone who knows how to use the chatgpt plugins so the AI itself can access live public data, and return to you a summarized version of it.",

What's more, Illuvium is ranked outside of the top 1000 for games waybelow TownStar and Axie Infinity ( a game I thought was already dead ) Axie Infinity by the way is very near the top 10.Going by CoinGecko Stats ( rankings ) which is what I normally use for when I research a project, TownStar is the one ranked outside of thetop 1000, while Illuvium is near the top 100 ( cryptos , not games ) So what gives ? Am I reading this all wrong ?",

On Coingecko it's noted that $GODS is in 516th place, but if you look at Coinmarketcap, $GODS is currently ranked 462nd.Quote from: Len Saldua on June 04, 2023, 06:44:51 AMwhile Illuvium, a AAA game ranked near the top 100 has near zero transactions ?Those are in-dapp stats, not overall transaction performance, of course, if the data collected by Dappradar is not just in-dapp data, this token will have very high transaction performance considering the $ILV token is listed on several top-tier exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and also KuCoin.",

That means if taking the activity in the projects actually useless. It has not become one of metric to determine the rank of project. The illuvium game has not yet lived. you shall not always focus in the activity of platform to be used as reliable matrict to determine the rank of project because CK or CMC didn't use it. The rank based on the marketcap that owned by the project. that's why you have seen ILV ranked in top 100 while Gods unchained was outside from top 500",
