If you plan on staying here long, I will advise you to familiarize yourself with how the forum works, starting with the rules and a lot more. You can use the search button in the top left corner for that. If you are also here for research data, you will really get an idea of the information that you seek.Over to the main question: I just find this question similar to the one on my local board. In short, Bitcoin has changed the way I view the words \"finance, earning, and asset.\" It has also been of great help to me in numerous ways. And about the earning part of it, yeah, I'm currently being paid in bitcoin every week, as the case may be, and I also get a few items for which I make payment using bitcoin.",

With those people, blockchain technology, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency change their lifestyle in aspect of how they make spending.It is not mandatory that they already got richer with Bitcoin / cryptocurrency, just how they replace cash, bank transfers by cryptocurrency transactions.",

Thanks for being here at the forum!It’s true that there are those that came when the price of bitcoin was worth nothing and go good profit for believing in the future of bitcoin but you should also know that It’s never too late to get involved with bitcoin and still make good profit from it, that is if you’re willing to learn and also understand how it works and not have the get rich quick mindset. QuoteHas Bitcoin Helped Create Big Changes In Your Life?In terms of knowledge, managing my finances, privacy and security, conducting proper research and also how to handle my investments, all has exponentially increased since when I came to Bitcointalk and also got to know bitcoin properly for what it is and getting rid of my previous mindset towards bitcoin. Op, if you’re ready to learn then you’re going to get the best out of Bitcointalk but if you’re the type with a dogmatic mindset you won’t be able to get anything here.",

Lots also here in the forum say that is their main income right now, and they just established a business as their other source of income, but the capital comes from Bitcoin. On my end, it really helped me financially ever since I was able to experience those things that I couldn't experience before because we were just poor people. That is why I am thankful for it for the past few years and also for the upcoming future.",

But there is no denying that bitcoin has been helping a lot of people change their lives including me. Since investing in bitcoin, I have not only improved financially, but also helped me realize the downsides and harms of banking and fiat. Bitcoin tells me about our knowledge of financial freedom or the importance of privacy, which governments have sought to hide from us for hundreds of years. I actually admit bitcoin has given me a completely different perspective on my life.",

Before that year, I didn't know anything about Bitcoin but started collecting satoshi after satoshi playing faucet. And it means a lot to me because from there, I learned to trade, invest in Bitcoin and gamble For sure is that I can earn money trading etc by using crypto and it is still going on today. I'm still optimistic and excited to face the future but still looking for other sources of income. Many people have proven this until they can get money from what they do in crypto.You are not too late to start, especially now that the market is experiencing a decline. There are many predictions that in the next year or 2025, the price of Bitcoin will rise to a very high level. And if you start now, you have the opportunity to get big profits in the future.",

Since you are a latecomer to Bitcoin, still if you invest and hold for a long period of time, you can expect to make huge profits in the future. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is slightly lower, you can buy and hold Bitcoin now if you want. You have to keep in mind that investing in Bitcoin is risky. And success cannot be achieved easily without taking risks.  If you want to succeed in Bitcoin, you have to invest with risk.",

When I have wanted to buy something and use my satoshis it has usually been after converting to fiat money or buying gift cards. There have been a few times when the good or service I wanted to buy accepted payment in bitcoin and I paid with it. It hasn't caused any big changes in my life. It has caused me to be better off than if I had no bitcoin, yes, and I think I am gradually getting better as I accumulate more, but I don't feel like a big change, except sometimes in the bull market, but the last one was short-lived.",

I discovered a lot of new, broader knowledge because of bitcoin especially how money works and how I take advantage of market opportunities that I previously only knew on a small scale.Before getting to know the world of bitcoin, for me people who work in banks are great people who understand well how money works and people who keep money in banks are classified as elite people, apparently all of that is not.Since getting to know bitcoin, it turns out that there is a better system than a bank system that provides convenience and freedom in dealing with transactions. When I make a transaction, I don't have to queue like doing a queue at a bank.",

The most important investment lesson I learned from bitcoin is, \"dollar cost averaging\". Investing on a monthly or weekly basis is the most fool-proof method to make money on the markets. Bitcoin also helped me to buy/sell some stuff which is normally impossible for me to buy/sell because of the payment method limitations. Bitcoin removes borders.",
