Nowadays I don't think it is - it's likely a bunch of miners/pools get most of these requests. Also, from the UK my connection to Germany and Ireland is of similar round trip time to that of Singapore and Japan (~80ms). 2. It might do something if you enable location moving or autoconnect, but there's a good chance it'll do nothing too. There's also a chance you'll make yourself more traceable if you're not using tor (which generally selects \"random\" routes)3. Hardware wallets did well to teach me you don't need 10 different nmemonics for 10 different wallets you can either utilise different nmemonic extensions or different derivation paths to generate different wallets. Remembering what each are for might be hard (especially if there's 10 or more) but you can put a lot of hints in the wallet file name and potentially add descriptions (such as labelling the first address in electrum).4. Afaik coinjoin is meant to make it look like your coins haven't been mixed. The downside to using it is that the other person or people in the join might've mixed their funds before the transfer was done. There's ways to break the chain thoggh (such as by using bisq to convert to an altcoin and then convert it back later on on a different non kyc exchange). There are likely mixers out there that don't look like mixers too, bitmixer.io used to handle their withdrawals like an exchange did so they were really hard to track without having someone determined enough. 5. I have a trezor and connect trezor suite through tør and it works fine. I don't know about ledger but I assume it works the same - both of those hardware wallets can run through electrum too where they can also be used over tor. (I don't remember is electrum has onion nodes or if you're just meant to use the proxy settings for tor though - I used to run tor browser and proxy through that, it's easier to set up than it sounds).",

What might be mixed might not look mixed, and what might not be mixed might look mixed. A coinjoin is definitely going to look mixed, because there are like hundreds of inputs, which create hundreds of outputs. Reputable mixers are going to give you seemingly mixed coins as well.Why do you want that? The point of mixing coins is to have them looking mixed. It's not to look you're the owner of someone else's coins. It's to just obfuscate.",

For example; if you are always changing your IP through Tor or VPN, but always connect to the same server, that server operator knows it's the same wallet connecting every time despite the different IP addresses.  Connecting to different public SPV servers every time only distributes your transactions to more server operators, increasing the potential that someone will use the data to target you.  There's no method of connecting to a public server that will guaranty your privacy.Realistically, the only way to privately use a wallet that needs an SPV server connection is to run your own server.  Electrum Personal Server is easy to use, very light, and will provide you the privacy you seek.Quote from: OROBTC on December 01, 2022, 06:36:03 PM3)  If the above does NOT help my privacy much, perhaps storing BTC quietly in various wallets (seeds + passwords) help?  My issue here is that I want to be able to conveniently remember where all my BTC is without having to remember 10 wallets (w/ seeds and passwords).That could help, but it seems like a lot of trouble.  It would be much easier to just use Bitcoin Core as your main wallet, and effectively achieve the same results.  Core doesn't need to connect to SPV servers, and if you use each address only once then you're taking full advantage of Bitcoin's inherent privacy features.Quote from: OROBTC on December 01, 2022, 06:36:03 PM4)  Is there any way to coinjoin/mix/whatever so that the output does NOT LOOK tumbled?  Or run each UTXO afterwards through various further transactions (hops?) to hide the trail?  Does that term \"hop\" mean a transaction that just moves those BTC a bit further along?Not that I know of, but you could use a P2P exchange to trade your bitcoin for bitcoin with a different transaction history.  Personally, I use Bisq to do just that.  I trade my bitcoin for Monero, then trade that Monero for someone else's bitcoin, effectively breaking the traceability of my transactions by replacing them with someone else's transactions.Quote from: OROBTC on December 01, 2022, 06:36:03 PM5)  Do the desktop hardware wallet apps for Ledger, Trezor, BitBox, etc. (also the desktop hot wallet apps) run through TOR (if I am running TOR on my desktop, or even running Brave)?  I have not been able to dig up that info myself.  Is running TOR when using these apps even worthwhile, or is a VPN good enough?I can only speak about Electrum, Sparrow, and Trezor Suite since they're the only ones I've used extensively.  All will allow Tor connections, but you need Tor running as a service.  If you have the Tor Projects browser installed it'll run Tor as a service while the browser is running, but it shuts down the Tor background service as soon as you close all the browser windows.  Tor Project's website has instructions on how to run Tor as a background service for Windows and Linux.  It's a very light daemon, and uses very few resources, so there's no reason not to have it running by default as soon as the computer boots up.Good luck.",

Ledger Live doesn't have a TOR on/off switch integrated into the app, but there is a way to take advantage of TOR features with Ledger Live as well. You can run your own Bitcoin onion node and connect that with your Ledger Live client. To do that, you are going to need a software called SatStack. The idea is to not connect to Ledger servers and the explorers they use.

CoinJoin transactions and centralized mixing services have a certain fingerprint: it is sometimes very easy to tell common transactions from \"special\" ones aimed at obfuscation of transaction source and destination. Steganography is the opposite of that: it makes all transactions look similar; it is a great tool that helps you get lost in the crowd: among 'normal' people who don't care their privacy is being infringed. How do you hide the fact that you're interested in preserving your confidentiality? The answer is swaps. CoinSwaps, Monero swaps, different kinds of swaps, where you exchange your history with people you don't know. In the blockchain, a swap appears like a regular transaction, usually like a self-transfer, but it almost always involves changing ownership over particular coins.",

You don't have too worry about security so much, since everything on the network has to sort of conform to the security protocols put in place, however privacy on the other hand could potentially be compromised at several points in the process. However, whether it's worth running your own node really begs the question on who or what don't you want your personal identifiable information reaching? If it's the government, it's likely a wasted effort. If you just want to follow good practices, and reduce the chances of multiple parties gaining this information, then sure get your own node up. There's is an additional convenience compromise when you decide to run your own node, and only connect to that node though. That's including, and not limited too the maintenance of that. Sometimes you can run into problems with your own hardware, failing hard drives etc. Somewhat rare though, the other problem is you're then solely relying on the internet connection of where your node is connected, and the initial cost of setting it up. Since the Blockchain isn't small, and you'll likely want a full copy of it rather than a partial node; it'll be rather expensive to get that equipment if you haven't already got it.",

I've only really tinkered with Sparrow as opposed to using it as a proper wallet yet (mostly because I see no reason to mess with all my various cold storage wallets which have caused me no issue for many years), but I was pretty impressed with just how easy it was to link it to my node. I've not used Sparrow enough nor examined the code enough to start recommending it like I do with Electrum, but it certainly seems like a strong contender on the privacy front since, as you say, it does away with the need to configure and run an Electrum server.The only thing so far that I didn't like about Sparrow (or maybe I just couldn't figure out how to do it) was to create a watch only wallet involving individual addresses like you can do on Electrum. It seemed the only way to create a watch only wallet on Sparrow was via an xpub or similar, and therefore impossible to have addresses from different wallets in the same watch only wallet.",
