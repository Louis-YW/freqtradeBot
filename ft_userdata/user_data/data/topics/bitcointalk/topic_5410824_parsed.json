Hello, I hope that you heard that they have an ongoing battle with US SEC?Here is the official documents: https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338So this has been in the last 2 years and I would say that it has affected XRP prices although you can see some occasional pumps on it.But the good news is, it seems that the legal battle is doing good and others speculate that it might be in their favor and maybe this is the news that every holder wants to hear because of the potential returns they can get.",

It have got more real-time usage and have partnered with large number of banking and financial service renders. So, the growth continues for the long term.It is always said to be a centralized coin which can be manipulated. For this reason users make an entry at lower price and wait for the opportunity to exit when there is rise in price than sticking to long term. Also believing of price reaching $200+ don't go for it. According to me it might reach maximum of $10.",

That's just bullshit, don't bull. XRP did not even achieve a new All-time high in the recent bull run... If anything, I expect it to first hit $3 if it really performs well. Even $10 is not realistic, IMO.XRP has been involved in a lot of saga with SEC. You might wanna first read about it before you put all your heart into it. It's all over the web",

You can't make a good profit from this coin and I tell you what, it is because it moves too slow and the volatility of its price is quite low as well. Upon checking on its performance, you can't really say it is performing well. It just remained on the market not in a way the investors used this to hold but for the traders to use this as a saving cost due to very low fees. That only save this project but if we talk about holding, it was not ideal.",

Well, this is still a potential coin and a very cheap network, I just use this network for withdrawal purposes, I suggest not to get hyped by any news and better if you want to be more profitable, stay away from any hype.",

It's gonna be hard though, I mean the case by the SEC against them is still on infancy stage, lots of back and forth and we really don't know who is winning or not.So I would say that $200 is far fetch for now, even in the last bull run, it didn't enjoy what other coins have been experiencing because of the said case. Goodluck though, if in the next bull run, XRP didn't achieved that potential then maybe it's about time to move to others coins, don't waste your money and your time on something that it won't give you profits, just saying.",

The lawsuit against Ripple was a major obstacle to price gains during the last bull market. A possible positive outcome of the lawsuit could push XRP's price up to $2. If Ripple's actions lead to partnerships with more financial institutions, that too could push the price up. A coin price of $200 seems out of reach to me.",

In this day and age it is normal to educate ourselves based on what we read or watch on our own, however it is also important to contrast the opinions we listen to as it is incredibly easy for some guy to predict whatever they want on the Internet, but that does not mean that it will become true.The ATH of XRP was reached 4 years ago and it was only close to 4 dollars, so it would need to do a 50X from its ATH and this is not possible, also during the previous 4 years XRP has lost a lot of ground against its previous competitors which were BTC and ETH, so I find it difficult to believe XRP will even grow at the same rate than those two coins which will make it to lose even more positions in the market cap ranking, so if I were you I will never hold XRP for the long term.",

I wonder why you prefer to invest in XRP over bitcoin because we know that bitcoin can provide greater returns than altcoins. But you have already bought XRP, plan to have 5000 XRP and want to hold it until 2024. So it's better you keep trying to buy XRP using DCA but don't forget bitcoin besides you invest in XRP.Reaching $200 in 2030 sounds very attractive, but we don't know if it's going to happen or if it's just speculation. It's better that you don't hear such theories and stick to your plan if you believe XRP can go up in the long term.",

While it is true that it is no doubt a \"good\" currency, the status of what good is defined by needs more critical thinking. We have decentralised coins which is the heart of what bitcoin stands for. Then we have centralized coins of which XRP is a pioneer of, controlled in the similar way a bank works.My advise to the OP is to learn about centralisation first and do some research on the same before investing.
