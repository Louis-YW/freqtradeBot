At the moment, the price of the coin is at its historical support, from which reversal to growth is possible.Provably reversal is possible because this is what always happen on shitcoins in the market. And if I where the investors I would rather stop investing on this kind of token especially for newbies because its so risky to join on pump and dump scheme token especially if we don't know what to do since for sure we will became their bag holder especially when devs start abandoning their project which mostly happen on this scene.",

At the moment, the price of the coin is at its historical support, from which reversal to growth is possible.I agree, and we can't call a coin the next gem unless it really went like 100x-1000x. And at the current rate of the crypto market today, it will be hard to achieved that as we are in a bear market.And as least the OP should tell us what is the reason, how is this project very different from others? what will it make to be called the \"next gem coin\"? and if I will add to that, usually this kind of promotion and hype backfire on the project themselves in the long run, in my opinion.",

I haven't heard or read anything about it and the projects that run on its blockchain so, I would say that I'd rather invest in known and popular coins or altcoins compared to this one that I didn't know. Are you part of that team op?. As far as I can say, I think you are part of the team or you are hired to promote their company/project/coin or whatever you call it. First, you just posted about $HTR that will be the next gem (my thoughts - price increase or its popularity and uses is almost the same as Dogecoin, Ethereum, BSC or even Bitcoin), few projects run in its blockchain few months ago and then suddenly this -Quote from: Okeowo on August 18, 2022, 08:24:02 PM#Do your own research and invest wisely,Remember, no one will bear your loses, just try and play safe in the Industry...I get what you mean what I quoted and it feels like you are promoting the coin but giving advices will make everything you said about $HTR a risky investment if you started investing in that coin.

I can say that $HTR is overrated and probably just part of the hype system in this market. The next big gem will probably the coin already listed on the top, not unless a new project emerge but its really hard to predict it.",

But I agree with the others, this project is not the next gem and has no basis for that statement nor we can really see its potential to become big. For now, it was a failure to seek the next gem and it was hard to find or it did not exist. Many new projects come out but many of them turn into a scam that makes investors doubt these new projects. It is still a smart choice to take old coins and stop thinking next gem.",

The truth s that it is almost impossible to know which coin is going to be the next big hit in the market, as everything needs to come together for the coin to pump hard, and right now the circumstances for this to happen does not seem to be there, after all the market is not growing and many investors are instead interested in playing it safe and only invest in solid projects, so regardless of how good a coin may be investors are not interested in putting their money at risk at the moment.",

It's better to be careful than to regret it later. regretting not making a profit is much better than regretting having lost a lot. I dare not take risks here. even the current situation of BTC still doesn't look like it will continue to be bullish. so I'm going to be careful for now.",

Upon checking coinmarketcap, Hathor is the name I have seen when checking the ticker HTR. Could OP please put more details about what HTR you are referring to? There are a bunch of repeated tickers in the altcoin market so it's better to just put in the name. Asking early because you might bump into the same questions over and over again. Maybe editing the first post will help with full details and link to their website if possible/available.",
