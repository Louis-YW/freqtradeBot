Otherwise the sync procedure of BitcoinCore node on your Linux will start from the scratch.",

The path to folder where it keeps blockchain may be different from default one. In your case you want to use blockchain copy which is already in some directory on you hard drive. Thus, you need to specify that directory in bitcoin.conf filedatadir=<path to directory on  where Bitcoin Core will keep its data># For instance my path looks like this datadir=F:/ BitcoinData where F is my external SSD.",

(been there done that)Also, core may want to rescan the entire blockchain if that installation of core was not the last one to touch it.If you are going to keep dual booting windows & linux make sure that they are both on the same version of core. If you update one and not the other and open bad things, or at least annoying things, will happen.-Dave",

Open up linux, install Bitcoin Core, let it run for a couple of minutes to start downloading blocks. Close it, replace the backed up Bitcoin app data to ~/.bitcoin, and restart Bitcoin Core. It will continue from where you left it at Windows.",

I don't know if you consider it as \"Welcome screen\" or the actual installer.Here's what the GUI's \"Welcome Screen\" looks like (The title bar has \"Welcome\" on it):It will only appear the first time your launched the GUI or if you add --choosedatadir arg to bitcoin-qt.It only has the datadir and prune settings.Perhaps you remembered setting the installation directory in the installer then saw the welcome screen when your launched Bitcoin Core.Anyways, selecting the previous data usually works and will continue where it leftbut since it didn't in your case, you might have conflicting options in your bitcoin.conf file in the selected directory or the default datadir in the previous installation.Bitcoin Core read specific .conf file(s) and prioritizing conflicting options depending on how it was set up,For example: data directory with pruned blockchain but set the new installation without 'prune' settings.",
