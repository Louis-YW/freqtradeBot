  "content": "Hello everybody ! I hope you are well !I am pleased to present the \"1HoDLCLUB PEPE Cards\" project, it was launched 4 months ago via Twitter.This project is outside the 1HoDLCLUB Bitcoin Collectibles projects, it will span several months, unlike the coins which will be released approximately every month, and for information the next coin collection will be the \"Fuck Fiat Money\" collection which will be published during the month of February!The 1HoDLCLUB PEPE Cards project is a collection of PEPE Cards sold on Counterparty (XCP), it is a series of 21 cards, each of the cards will allow you to participate in the physical sale of this one.Each PEPE cards tell an event in the history of Bitcoin, nothing is left to chance!Each dispenser has a custom #BTC vanity address linked to the event, as below for the \"SILKPEPEROAD\" card with the address starting with \"1PEPExSR\"Card supplies range from 21 to 100 cards, so as you will have understood, there will only be 21 Full Sets possible.During the physical sale you will need to send your PEPE XCP cards to the address of the physical cards, each card will have its own public and private key like all 1HoDLCLUB collectibles.I know that some of you do not have a counterparty wallet or do not wish to create one to store your cards there, for this I give you the possibility of acquiring them by DM, your cards will be stored on the address of the 1HoDLCLUB to allow you to participate in the physical sale, once the physical version is purchased I will transfer your XCP cards to the physical version wallet!Currently there are 5 cards that have been released, the rest are coming, every week one or more cards will be released!A special \"Coldkey\" scam card will be part of the 21 limited edition, all funds from this will be donated to charity for the victims of yoggPEPE cards are an integral part of the history of Bitcoin, they are ultimately the first NFTs that have existed in crypto. I know that this project will not interest everyone because mostly we are all here for traditional collectibles in the form of coins, but it is a pleasure for me to create these cards and to be able to make them physical in the form of BTC collectibles .about the physical versions, they will be in game card format and not credit cards, for the moment two options are possible, either they will be in metal or in game card material, it will depend on the final rendering, new prototypes will be made in the coming months, the priority of the 1HoDLCLUB being the coin collections.Below is an image of a prototype produced in June 2022, this one was in Fine Silver 999.9, it will not be the case for the final versions, for the simple reason that I want it to be very affordable.Below you will find all the cards already released and obtainable via their dispensaries.The first card to be released is the \"SILKPEPEROAD\", it is a nod to all the people who allowed Bitcoin to have its wings at that time in history.Dispenser link : https://xchain.io/tx/cb428c0cb96eadd9d54a8c11ae8075579d96a258a6110a125d897cdfad6c414bThe second was the \"KARPEPEGOX\" a tribute to all the victims of MtGox.Dispenser link : https://xchain.io/tx/0efcc9c0ce4b3c49446ceaf86c673e91391cdce34d60b417f16387214f379405The third, published directly during this recent event, which was the FTX scam, \"SCAMSAMPEPE\"Dispenser link : https://xchain.io/tx/df4195690a9d56396073ed2b234c8b3e5a6ffe5741de0cf0ffd00bf7d4f0bb4bThe fourth \"ELPEPEBUKELE\", this day that no one will forget, on June 9, 2021, El Salvador becomes the first country to introduce Bitcoin as a legal tender.Dispenser link : https://xchain.io/tx/4e95692aca0264a8d8144dc81c2f6f745b27f9b4d8cc18840cd7eec5ea708021And the fifth, last card release to date, \"PEPEARESAFU\", a nod to the Binance hack that occurred in May 2017, with the famous \"Funds are Safu\" by CZDispenser link : https://xchain.io/tx/9f6609e7765df1c447757b68245a23bb34ec091e2c20d5e57be48e8237729a4bAnd below, a little sneak peek of future cards to come.with each new release you will be notified on this thread and the cards will be added with the link of the dispenser link.As specified above, this project is a project apart from the BTC collectibles of the 1HoDLCLUB, it will progress throughout the year without encroaching on the coin and bullion collections.Thank you all for taking the time to read my thread, I hope you all like this little project, for me it's a great pleasure to make these PEPE cards, being a big fan myself of this type of design.I wish you all a wonderful day!",

      "body": "I have a few questions:1) The price of the first 5 Counterparty (XCP) assets/tokens are known and currently available for purchase. I was wondering what will be the estimated price for the physical cards. (estimation of either the paper and/or the metal card). If I understood this correctly, we will purchase the digital assets in advance, in order to safe keep them and load them into the physical cards sometime in the future. Hence, it would be nice to have an estimation of the total cost (digital + physical) prior to purchasing the digital asset. 2) When (approximately) the physical cards will be ready? Are you planning to release them in batches? What's the current plan?3) Why do we have to purchase the digital token in advance, to send it to the card address in the future? Why not just buy the physical card (whenever it is ready) with the digital asset pre-loaded?Specifically for those that are planning of getting the full 21 cards set: Purchase in advance all the digital assets now, with the scope of getting the physical cards in an unknown format (paper card or metal) with an unknown total price & in an unknown delivery time, is kinda a step - if you understand what I mean-thanks",

      "body": "Hi my friend ! i hope you're doing well ! Â As soon all digital version gonna be released, i'm gonna produce all cards in physical. I plan to release the physical cards this summer, until all the digital is done and released.once all 21 dispensers are open, a countdown will be started for the closure of the dispensers and the burning of the remaining cards.After that the physical cards will be produced and put on sale to the holder of the physical versions.I am still discussing with different manufacturer for the production of the cards, having 21 designs I have to try to arrange with them, especially as the numbers vary and the designs too.The choice of material is complicated, between paper and metal, because I would like the color to be present, each card has a specific color code, for example the \"PEPEARESAFU\" has the Binance yellow color code, the \"PEPEBUKELE\" has the color code of the blue of the flag of El Salvador, etc.For a broad approximation, I would say around 20$ - $25 per card, each card will have its custom PSA type slab, its security hologram and its private and public key.I completely understand your questions, the project is spread over another 6 months, and the updates arriving gradually, people will still have time to decide, if some want to withdraw they will still be able to exchange their digital version(after the dispenser close.) with another interested person who can have access to the physical version with.I hope that answers your questions!",

This is all about creativity and art, so I can't afford to release things that I don't consider \"Perfect\", and creativity is unfortunately not available to orderÂ   so that took some time.for some time I have also been working on the custom Slab for cards, to provide unique collectibles. it is an assembly of different parts in stainless steel, acrtylic and brass, it is a question here of making 2D sketches with precise measurements etc etc, so this also takes time.All this takes time and requires a lot of hours of work and revision. A first prototype is planned for the Pizza Day PEPE card, so around Pizza Day it should be there.I prioritize ongoing projects for sure, but sometimes in art we go around in our heads because the long-awaited idea does not arrive at this moment.",
