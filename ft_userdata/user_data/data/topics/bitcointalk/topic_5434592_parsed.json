  "content": "Most bitcoiners would agree that it is desirable for Bitcoin's decentralization that we have users running their own Bitcoin full nodes and, now with advances of second layer solutions, to run their own Lightning Network nodes. Today a normal person can open LN channels and be a node operator, which is very good because the LN protocol is decentralized and we can reach more autonomy running our own nodes.One of my concerns is that fees on the Bitcoin network could become very high and that it would be very costly for normal users to run their own LN nodes since to open channels it requires an on-chain transaction. Moreover, if the fees are too high then it would increase potential risk of malicious attackers in a disputed close because a \"justice transaction\" is an on-chain transaction, which can be costly for the honest party trying to legitimately reclaim the funds in a disputed close. This could make LN and other layer 2 solutions quite centralized in the future since normal users wouldn`t be able to have their nodes...Is this really a plausible concern for the next years/decades? How could that problem be mitigated?",

But if you are not running your own node you don't have control over the funds and you are relying on a thirdy party. It is the equivalent of letting funds on a exchange. The saying \"not your keys not your coins\" is for bitcoin layer 1, while for layer 2 it would be \"not your [LN] node, not your coins\"",

And for now, mempool is not congested.LN is not a bitcoin feature. it is its own network with its own rules and can be used without or without other currencies LN is a separate network where payments(onion payments) are nothing like bitcoin. LN can function without bitcoin. yep you can get 'imbound balance' withut needing a funding locked amount of bitcoin under your control. (temp ID does not need any funding to create a channel of msat balance)(aka unbaked/fractional reserve)LN is not bitcoinLN's aim is to take people away from using bitcoin. which is what all crap coins try to dotaking users away fro bitcoin is not \"scaling bitcoin\" it is instead de-populating bitcoinLN love bitcoin fees going up because once they can lock people into LN people wont want to leave due to bitcoin fee fears. and thats how they recruit people into their altnetLN has bad monetary policy. no network accounting system and its not as private as it promotesit literally gossips peoples node funding address and also a tagged name too .the lack of utility makes it easy to 'listen to the noise' of channel updates to see where payments move from and too. without even needing to 'peel the onion'its not what it promises to be..as for the fee thingfirstly to set up LN people need to move funds from a bitcoin wallet to an LN wallet. and THEN split that LN wallet value into multiple channels. meaning MULTIPLE transactions just at set up.. more then they pretend to suggestthen when closing closing multiple channels does not go to a bitcoin wallet but back to the master key of the LN wallet. which then to completely escape out of LN needs another movement outso the whole process to truly enter and escape LN full is more transactions than it suggestsso unless you are making more then several payments for goods/services per (time you want to use LN) its not worth using LNalso when using LN where they use 1% of value per channel as LN fee. if you are 7 hops away from your destination. the fee becomes 7% of value.. which again can end up being more then using bitcoin, which is just sats/byte. which is cheaper when you start spending a sufficient amountin short LN only works on very small purchases..some will say you can avoid chanel closing by using multiple channels to \"rebalance\" but by rebalancing your channels you then off-balance other peoples balance. meaning they then rebalance theirs to counter your act. and suddenly instead of people just moving value to buy goods or services they are liquidity balance fighting to try getting to a equilibrium.. in short they waste more balance on LN fee's fighting each others rebalance attempts against each other..there is liquidity issues with LN tooif you want to move <0.02btc(<$400) 5 hops. means those 4 middlemen need $400 spare JUST FOR YOU to succeedmeaning for you to move $400 needs $1600 spare liquidity in the network for just YOUR payment to go throughif you were to have a netwkrk of 1million users of only $400 per channel where each node has 4 channelsit requires ALOT of value to be locked just to let one person at a time to move value across a networkthe more users on LN causes more bottlenecks. more payment failures..Â there are many flaws in LN not talked about. let alone their utopian promises broken and yet alone the silly sales pitches of saying LN is the solution to bitcoinLN only functions well for small amounts. trying to move more then $500 dont work once you have to move value beyond a few hops to a destinationLN does not solve all bitcoin value needs or transaction needs",

LN with just a setting change within the app is compatible with multiple currenciesalso LN has wallets that can create LN balance without even needing to lock mainnet coins of any of those networksLN is not forced or locked to only work with bitcoin!!also bitcoin(legacy) transaction formats are not LN compatible. segwit(newer format) is the bridge gateway format of LN. and multiple networks need segwit to bridge to LNthese \"segwit\" formats have orchestrated that legacy mainnet fee's be classed as premium 4x segwit fee's (actual code is legacy * 4.. its not segwit / 4.. thus in true code its not \"segwit is discount\" its \"legacy is premium\")thus promoting native legacy as being expensive to promote utility of these newer bridge formats, to then be one step closer to recruit users to another network and stop users wanting to use bitcoin",
