This highly profitable mining will end soon, because ASIC manufacturers are likely to buy back miners' coins in order to maintain the price of the coin. When they stop doing this, the profit of miners will fall rapidly.",

If the beginner is not stupid, then he will check this information and make the right conclusions.The drop in profit is already noticeable, so the price of the coin should go up. Otherwise, ASICs will not be sold. But then the purchased coins will again pour into the market.https://www.hashrate.no/asics/ks3https://2miners.com/kas-network-difficultyhttps://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-ks3-8-3th",

Moreover, my 10 KS0 machines were delivered today, and the supplier is currently helping me with the shipment to my location.Ok and 44000 is much better than 50000? Men i am so sorry for you loose and i don´t understand why you ignore our warnings. The KS3 will fall to $50 a day -> makes a cashback time without power of over 3 years, but sure it will be much more with the common raising difficulty. KS0 is doing $4 a day or less, so cashback time is over 200 Days and the difficulty will raise 10x from this now, so a cashback time of 2000 days for your KS0.Did you really understand what you are doing? I saw a millionaire investing $40 million in a mining farm before the merge -> they earned 5 millions until today and now he is selling all with a total loose of over $30 - 35 Million Dollars -> he also thinked he do a smart move.Just my 2 cents.",
