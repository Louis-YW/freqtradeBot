      "body": "This particular poll was over six weeks before the speech and it's been my own observation that in classic Republican party fashion, they continue to shoot themselves in the foot failing to defeat a senile radical that needs amphetamines to get through a speech.What's the solution to Republicans losing against Joe Biden? Simple. Republicans need to ditch Trump; he's damaged goods. No focus on the economy, immigration, foreign policy, etc. They only focus on Trump and his personal issues with the DoJ. Seeing whatever evidence the DoJ has released convinces me that Trump is at most negligent for his handling of (alleged) classified info, not criminally liable. And if we were playing the game fairly, Hillary Clinton would have long ago been indicted for mishandling classified info and then deleting evidence following a subpoena from congress. I don't see the benefit of going on a tirade against the FBI when there's already a range of viable attacks.The speech shouldn't help Joe Biden. Ostensibly an iteration of \"Dark Brandon\" when in actuality his brain dead advisers recreated Third Reich scenery.",
