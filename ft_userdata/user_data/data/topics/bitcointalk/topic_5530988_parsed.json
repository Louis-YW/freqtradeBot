  "content": "I am planning to write a paper on Bitcoin and immortality.  Below is the basic idea and logical flow:  1. Bitcoin cannot be inherited. If not transferred during one's lifetime, it remains the property of the deceased. Neither the state nor relatives can access Bitcoin.  2. As AI advances, personal AI will become widely adopted, allowing individuals to own highly loyal and dedicated AI assistants.  3. Personal AI will evolve into physical AI, eventually taking human form in the near future. AI can make payments to humans and delegate tasks using blockchain technology.  4. If a Bitcoin owner wishes to be revived before death, they can opt for cryonics. With future advancements in life sciences, there will be a probability of restoring a healthy body and memories.  5. The Bitcoin owner entrusts their AI robot with the private key and temporarily transfers the balance (until revival). The AI has two primary goals:     1. Ensure the client's revival.     2. Preserve itself safely until the client is revived.  6. The AI conducts daily research on the latest developments in life sciences, tracking trends and services related to revival. When it determines revival is feasible, it applies for the necessary services and makes payments.  7. The AI monitors the cryonics storage condition daily and manages payments for the preservation service.  8. Once technological limitations are overcome and the client’s revival is confirmed, the AI verifies identity through iris recognition and private key authentication, then transfers the Bitcoin balance back to the revived client.  **All payments are executed by swapping BTC to USDC or USDT at the time of payment.**  ---### **Conditions Required for This Process**  1. The general acceptance of stablecoin payments (e.g., USDC, USDT) and no resistance to AI making payments and assigning tasks to humans.  2. Bitcoin must continue to appreciate in value despite inflation.  3. A sufficient amount of BTC must be transferred to the AI.  4. If quantum computing compromises Bitcoin's security, the project will fail.  5. If the AI fails to protect itself and gets destroyed or malfunctions, the project may fail.  ---This is my idea on Bitcoin and immortality.

Bitcoin cannot be inherited. If not transferred during one's lifetime, it remains the property of the deceased. Neither the state nor relatives can access Bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't even exist, if we go in this route. There are only transactions on a ledger and some inputs that can be spent if you have the right private key.And, surprise: the private key or wallet seed can be inherited (of course, it depends on the owner of the wallet).Quote from: Ogura Kizo on February 15, 2025, 10:25:09 AM2.

I am not sure what's the shitcoins' place in all this.PS. At the moment AI gains creativity and imagination, unless this happens only after many more decades and by some chance humans' brain will overcome greed by then, we, as race, will be done.",
