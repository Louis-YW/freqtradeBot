      "body": "Nope. You can own bitcoin today just as you can own cash or physical cold today. It's just that centralized exchanges have age requirements so you probably need the help of an adult to be able to buy some.As with stress and stuff, a young person can handle huge drops simply because a young person can afford to wait decades for his/her investment to go back up. Can't say the same for old folks.",

      "body": "It's the same thing as asking if there is an age limit for owning your assets and properties, there is certainly no age limit in Bitcoin investment. Both the young and old could participate, but they must be well informed about the investment before doing so.However, this is applicable only to the core Bitcoin transaction whereby the privacy and anonymity of people below the age of 18 would be preserved. This could be done through the noncustodial wallet and decentralised exchanges. But if the investments are to be done with the custodial or the centralised exchange, KYC might be asked, and the legal underage would be restricted.",

The decision I think comes towards the parents of the child, knowing that they are going to let them pay or do something about their investing portfolio.Personally, I would like my kids to know what Bitcoin is and what it could do for them and making sure that they are able to grasp the idea with how you could take advantage and the reason for having it in the first place. Maybe someday, you would never know, because if you had introduced them at an early age, you would be able to have a kid who can develop and improve Bitcoin as it is and know what type of applications could be done with it.Make sure you know what you are doing so that you won't regret doing something in the first place.",

They're not being obliged to invest but it's an additional thought and knowledge to them to know bitcoin at a very young age.In general of investing, there's no restriction of age on when they can start. As long as they're aware of the basics of it and they know what they do, that's the key to investing to any asset like bitcoin. Anyone can invest as old as they can like Warren Buffett although it's a different case on him because he doesn't like bitcoin. But I'm talking about the general rule in investing that no age is really required on when you'll start and when you'll stop.",

For young children or the elderly, we can recommend bitcoin to them but should let them choose, if they want bitcoin, start with them, and if they refuse, don't force them. I want to emphasize about introducing bitcoin to children, we don't have to rush, let them fully realize life before introducing bitcoin to them, they have more to learn than bitcoin. The early introduction of bitcoins does not guarantee that they will become richer in the future.",

      "body": "Unlike conventional and bank-related investments, there is no age limit for crypto investment especially bitcoin. But there is no point for kids to getting into bitcoin investment, especially at its current price. We might have heard some teenagers who somehow bought bitcoin and now being a millionaire, e.g. Erik Finman[1], which he bought 400 btc with the $1000 his grandmom gave to him at the age of 12. But imo, that's possible to happen for him because it's rare to see a kid gets $1000 even from his close relative such as parents or grandparents, unless if he is from wealthy family. It could be applied to elderly people as well, which the only thing they care is spending their retirement time peacefully and not getting into any complicated thing such as investments, except for those who still have to live their family. Even for the latest category, they would prefer to invest on short-term investment like opening a shop so they don't need to wait so long to get profit and obviously with less risk.[1] https://www.investopedia.com/news/who-erik-finman-bitcoin-millionaire-teenager/",

So if you have the money, no matter your age, just buy and hold—no age limit or restrictions.",

      "body": "I don't think small children should be concerned with investments, but I do think that an age of primary school is appropriate to start familiarizing a child with what money is, how it works, and what kind of money there can be. After all, kids often play games like Monopoly or apps that give them some tokens, which they can use in-game to purchase something or upgrade characters. So it's not entirely irrelevant. And in the light of discussing fiat, gold and other things, Bitcoin can also be mentioned as a kind of online money, but not the kind that a company or a country can control.As for the elderly, these are adults, and unless a person is suffering from a severe cognitive impairment due to their age, I think it's totally fine to tell them about Bitcoin. Not to push them, but to tell them if they want to know something and at the level they are interesting to know of it. My older relatives who are in their late 70s roughly know about Bitcoin from me, although sometimes only at the level 'it's the Internet money', as some of them don't use laptops, smartphones or the Internet at all.Bitcoin isn't just an investment, so it's okay to tell people about it in different ways.",
