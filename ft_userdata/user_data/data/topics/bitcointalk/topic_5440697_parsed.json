Do you think $20K or $30K will happen next?Personally I think if price can reclaim $25K then we will see $30K next, but otherwise if price drops below $23K then $20K becomes more likely again, as I think $21.5K will be less likely to hold as support again.What are your thoughts? Will the bullish uptrend continue or will price get rejected by $25K resistance level and correct back to the downside?",

      "body": "Possible to hit both. Correction could always take place especially if the reason behind an increase, is not that strong, enough to push a long pump in the marjet prices. Right now the market price is more likely to be back at $20k. $30k on the other hand is possible to be crossed mid year but I cannot cite exact reason for this thing. The marjet is just unpredictable and full of uncertinty. The recent increase was not even anticipated by many investors. It just did, and eventually influenced the demand towards other cryptocurrencies. Right now wherein the market is a bit retesting, the next price movement is hard to predict or even assume.",

      "body": "If we have seen the trend, it takes time to break $20k->$24k, and if I'm not mistaken, it's take like 3-4 attempts to be able to break that barrier and sustain it. I'm just working on my memory, and If I'm correct we have seen an attempt to $25k twice already this month and each time, it's not sustainable as the price keeps on going down, maybe the pressure to sell is there obviously.Nevertheless, I think if we can get to $25k in our 3rd or 4th attempt regardless of the time, we could get there and sustain or run. So for more me, it's likely that $30k will be closer than a dip to $20k.",

Clearly a cooldown will come again - sooner or later -, but we seem to jump into a FOMO-like atmosphere already (at least crypto Twitter seems to be there), and if it's so then the cooldown may only happen after 35-40k (and will be a bit painful/disappointing for some).",

Had to go way back, but found the old classic on Daily chart from 2019. Bare in mind this was a 3 month long ascending triangle structure, whereas currently we have one over the span of 5 days (so less reliable):Hence, you can probably see the similarities. In context of what OG said, I wouldn't say a triple top is inherently bullish, it depends on the structure. If price is within a channel of horizontal support / resistance, it's probably more bearish/neutral, as price is likely to continue trading within that channel. However if price has higher lows, it shows bulls are willing to pay increasingly higher prices. Hence in this example, each time $25K is tested it's become weaker (as clears out sellers) and price is (so far) pulling back less far each time, ideally until it barely pulls back at all and eventually breaks to the upside, as shown above.Quote from: dragonvslinux on February 21, 2023, 01:43:22 PM",

I mean Bitcoins suddenly bounced back from 21k usd to 25k usd in a week, so in a shorter period of time anything can happen. But it is assumed that Bitcoins won’t fall down or go downwards. Rather seeing this increase in demand, the price will definitely go high. So 20k usd is not practically possible if we see. 30k usd will be the new checkpoint for all the Bitcoin investors.",

Bitcoin will still come down to below $20k so nobody should think of saying the bull has started. I am not even concern about the price right now. My main aim is to get enough bitcoin before the next bull. That is why, almost a three weeks now I have not checked the price of bitcoin. Because even I checked there is nothing I can do about it instead I left like that. And let me be focusing on the long investment plan. Anyone that is for long term investment should not bother themselves to be checking to the price every day. You will just have high blood pressure.",

The points are obvious and aside from that, I'm very optimistic that the chart is just setting the ambiance before the halving. Yeah, it's still quite far but the same vibes I'm seeing when the halving occurred in 2020, and then with the pandemic and war, 2021 made a great entry for everybody. And that's why I think history will simply repeat itself and will pass $30k soon.",
