The title speaks for itself but I'll just highlight the bullets from the article.QuoteThe US government transferred some of its bitcoin stash to Coinbase this week.The government owns about $2 billion worth of bitcoin in a wallet seized from the dark web's Silk Road.About 2,000 bitcoin were transferred to Coinbase, worth about $130 million.On Tuesday, the US government transferred $65 worth of bitcoin to a wallet address held at Coinbase, according to Arkham Intelligence. The first transfer was seen as a test to ensure proper connection to the prime account at Coinbase.From there, the US government followed through with a 2,000 bitcoin transfer worth about $131 million to the same Coinbase wallet. Earlier this year, the US government indicated plans to sell about $13 million worth of bitcoin following approval from the US District Court of Maryland.Source: https://www.businessinsider.in/cryptocurrency/news/the-feds-are-transferring-bitcoin-to-coinbase-from-a-2-billion-crypto-wallet-seized-from-silk-road/articleshow/109043283.cmsLooks like they're preparing for a massive dump and not just that, based on that article the feds are holding more Bitcoin as well from the recovered wallets from hackers and they're about 94,600 Bitcoins.",

It's going to be cheaper when they do it in the auction though, last time that they've done it, the winner of the bid paid like half of it's worth in the market so I expect that's what's going to happen next time. The effects on prices will probably only be visible once the winner of that bid sells those bitcoins and introduces it to the circulation.",

It was possible those were sold via the spot market. It was also possible the coins were sold via OTC. But I heard of auctions of seized coins in the past. What's interesting, however, is that when the $216 million worth of seized coins were sold last year, it didn't cause a massive dump. Instead, on the day of the selling itself, the price of Bitcoin even went up. And it even continued to rise right after. So, this planned liquidation of around $131 million worth of coins, a much smaller amount, won't probably be a big deal as well.",

You're right, they didn't sold it at once so I guess they're also having that problem that every holder is problematic with and that's about selling in batches because we have no choice as the exchanges will question us. But this is not a problem to them, there is a tendency that they're doing it in batches so not to get as much attention that it will be but if that's the reason, they're not good in hiding as they've been already found out doing this massive tx.Quote from: pooya87 on April 05, 2024, 05:58:16 AMThat sounds more like declaration of War on Bitcoin 😲At the very least this is a significant market manipulation attempt and as far as I can tell this would be the first time the US regime is selling seized coins on a centralized exchange instead of auctioning them off-the-market.The only question remaining is: are they starting to feel threatened by Bitcoin?They can't stop it whether they feel threatened about Bitcoin. The biggest financial institutions are already in, I'm thinking if they've offered this to them or how and why they've resorted into selling and depositing it on Coinbase. Maybe, there's a legal basis on this process.Quote from: Helena Yu on April 05, 2024, 06:03:45 AMAnother easy way for government to make money after taxing someone else incomes, print new money and earn interest from lending.Massive dump won't happen because the bullish trends and upcoming halving events able to cover it, there are still bad news during bullish trends, but it doesn't affect people to believe Bitcoin will pump.Possibly that this is what the speculations are telling that I've read all about, before the halving there will be some corrections that shall come.
