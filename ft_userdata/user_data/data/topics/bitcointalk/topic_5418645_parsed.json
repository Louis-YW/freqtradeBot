  "content": "While scrolling the vast expanse of Twitter because of the news that Elon, upon firing multiple executives after a full acquisition of the social media platform, I stumbled upon this post that is quite revolutionary and is nonetheless motivational. It was stated that Cancer Studies takes a lot of data from multiple countries, and these data are very integral in ensuring that the studies are furthered, and because of the border problem, a group of laboratories across the planet have started using the Ethereum Blockchain to store cancer studies data for the very reason that it is secure, and is borderless. How cool is that?! Link to the aforementioned tweet by the way: https://twitter.com/arigoldnfts/status/1585282991957282816?s=20&t=18A2VhzCHH3vBY1jZiWYjw Link to the article that the tweet sourced from: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01768-5",

      "body": "To include the correction on that Twitter thread, merely storing cancer studies data is incorrect. The thing that got stored is the machine learning model, ML model is a \"weight\" result of a trained data.And to be exact, I do not see Ethereum being used for the sake of security. A related reason for the decision seems because of:\"However, training robust AI systems requires large datasets for which data collection faces practical, ethical and legal obstacles. These obstacles could be overcome with swarm learning (SL), in which partners jointly train AI models while avoiding data transfer and monopolistic data governance.\"So, I don't think the proper word for its use is because it's being used to securely store cancer studies data. Anyway, I don't truly comprehend further about an AI model dataset bureaucracy but it seems overwhelming.",
