Every gambling site have their own promotions strategy and giving bonuses is one of those, read every instructions so you can know what to do.",

As long as the leaderboard doesn't change much after that round then they're one step closer to securing some good profit since the prizes are good even the minimum prize which is 151-200th place will still give you $10 worth and that's still twice as the minimum bet which could cover your losses.Then again though it only takes one big bet to take over the first place or one of the top spots since there's no maximum bet mentioned.",

So all in all it's a good thing for the player but also a good thing for the house, IMO.",

People should really be knowing this basic concept on how these things works because there's no way that we could really be able to utilize nor really see make out some advantage out of these bonuses but rather it would really be just prolonging yourself on your gaming session nothingless.If you are that lucky enough then you would definitely be able to make money with this but dont expect much since we do speak about these things which does have their corresponding terms and conditions before you could make out some withdrawal which we do know that it isnt something that achievable.Even if you are a whale then it wont really be making out guarantees but just like been said that there would really be differences on how much things been given out.",

I was also able to make 160$ from my bonus using free spins on a site but when they notice that their new players are making too much profit from their bonuses, they have set a specific wagered amount before withdrawal. It all depends on the casino but if you're making a good profit out of small capital then why not pursue it? However, I don't think casinos will continuously allow their players to benefit from bonuses without asking for specific wagering amounts because it could affect their site in the long run.",

While for most bonuses, it's common that there's no easy bonus that shall be done by a casino unless it's just a giveaway and there's no other requirement that participants have to do but just to dropby their username just like what we have in games and rounds section of the forum. As said, most bonuses aren't like that and they've got some specific requirements that are needed to be filled for the users. If you're fortunate to have it filled then just do go with it and see where your luck will bring you with small amount of capital.",
