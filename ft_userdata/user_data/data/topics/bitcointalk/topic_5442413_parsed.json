This forum for example, wherein investors and gamblers are interacting with one another. But for sure there will be people to be up against such concept throwing questions such as \"why and what for\". Advantages could be sharing of strategies or picks perhaps. But inspite of these advantages, groupchatd could also promote FUDs which would put the money of new ones at risk if they'd follow those informations. So I hope down ends are being limited if such groups do really exist.",

If you are in some such group please share them here. I believe there are some groups but I can not find them, unfortunately . Thank youI think if we talk about general gambling, I doubt there's a reputable Telegram group for that. What I mean about general gambling is, there are no groups that composed of both casino gamblers and sports bettors as they are having a different approach, styles, strategies and so on.|Pointing to sports betting groups, there are groups of gamblers in sports betting but limited only in particular and specific sports. Answering OP's question, I didn't know some TG groups but maybe his best shot is to look for it on Discord.",

Just my assumption.",

If you are in some such group please share them here. I believe there are some groups but I can not find them, unfortunately . Thank youI really don't know about such telegram group. Because I think it's almost impossible to find such telegram group because there is a lot of spam in telegram which makes it very rare to find authentic members in a group.  And when it comes to gambling it is even more difficult. But you can follow Discord servers of gambling sites without following Telegram where you can find authentic gamblers. And that would be a possible medium.  But if you are satisfied with telegram group then you can search it its totally up to you.  Hope if anyone knows from here they will share it with you",

Could be better if there are bot filtered mods that will delete any post that detects xxx will be good to implement on such community group. And i don't know, i dont really appreciate how the chat looks in any telegram groups that's why i usually mute it after i joined and leave later on.",

Thank youHave a group of personal friends for this one but Its not open to everyone, I got curious as well if this kind of group really exist just like a signal group in trading. This can be a good one if you find a legit group that talks about betting and a possible strategy that you can use in gambling. Looking as well for this kind of group and I hope its free.",

Also, finding invite links are scattered all over the internet.If OP has a discord account try this link that I found. https://disboard.org/servers/tag/GamblingThose are invitations where you could just click the links and then redirect you to discord but you may need to get a role first so you could view the other channels. I tried some of them and they are offering free trials for a week and then you will need to pay for the succeeding monthly subscription. I say just take advantage of the free trials and then jump to another if you don't want to continue.",

Thank youIf you cannot get any credible gathering of gamblers on telegram, I think you can also consider starting your own. Some other people here in this forum and elsewhere may be interested in joining this kind of group and maybe have been searching to find one but still have not. An extra advantage for you who starts is that you can vet the group and be confident in its credibility. There are a lot of dubious telegram groups theses days, starting your own ensures that you are in the right place. You may start small, but with time you will increase.",
