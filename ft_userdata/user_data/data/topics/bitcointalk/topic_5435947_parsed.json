Whether it is a multiple cryptocurrency casino or just a bitcoin-only casino.What matters is their reputation in the community, I have seen newbies that have been sharing their stories that they've ended up to gamble in an unknown casino and then eventually, when they're about to get their winnings they were denied.That's one of the situation that someone will face if he's not into reputable casinos and to determine them, go to the Gambling section and read each of their profiles and feed back on the thread themselves.--> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=56.0",

It might not be super up-to-date, but still pretty helpful.Accepted payment type and/or cryptocurrencies depend on each casino individually. When choosing the right one for you, just pay attention to their history, how long have they been operating, see if there are/were any serious scam accusations against them, go to their official threads and get a sense of what are their users' opinions. And then compare house edge, odds rates, verification requirements and check if they offer payment systems that are right for you.",

I apologize for my silly questions, but I want to understand everything once and for all.If you're not new to casino gambling, but new to cryptocurrency casino gambling, then are no much difference except change in the payment method. However, if you are new to the gambling niche, you'll have to go through some cryptocurrency review sites for reputable casino, though they're multiple casinos for you to utilize in the forum that has been trusted by member, you'll still need to do lots of test running. One thing I'd advise you to always look out for in a casino is their provably fair policy. It'll help you stay away from getting rigged off your money. Moreover, if you're looking for a casino that guarantees winnings while playing their slot games or table games, I don't think such would be advisable for you to think that playing in a specific casino will guarantee more wins. Therefore, no criterion for choosing casino other than confirming their genuineness. Keep hunting for what you want to find.",

Then, you will find out late that it's a scam gambling site. Regarding what coin to use, it will depend on what cold storage you have. Then next is the fees, you don't want to be losing more in transaction fees than what you will gamble. Right?",

There are various criteria or factors for picking the best-suited gambling platform for you however the most important would be its reputation and security as you don't want to gamble on a platform that could potentially end up as a scam.

Before I choose any casino the first thing I do is go through their terms of service to ensure that I am comfortable with them. If I read them and I am pleased with their service, there are many other casino companies to choose from. You should also check their KYC policies as well as their deposit and withdrawal limits. There are casinos that place less emphasis on KYC, while others take it seriously because of government policies. I prefer casinos with low deposit and withdrawal limits because it helps me to plan my gambling activities.  It is also important to consider the reputation and reliability of these casino firms. The general advice I have always gotten from the forum is that it is better to play games with reputable gambling firms that are in this forum.",
