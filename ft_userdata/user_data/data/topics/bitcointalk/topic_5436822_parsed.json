Bitcoin is a decentralized global currency that doesn't need a middle man while CBDC is the same centralized fiat system controlled by the same centralized authorities and suffers from the same problems (and some additional ones since it is CBDC).In other words Bitcoin will remain the same alternative solution for those who want to reach financial sovereignty and exit the centralized monetary system even if it is a partial exit.",

Bitcoin gives one the power to run its own nodes and transfer it between countries making it borderless, but central bank's currencies can not be transferred in a split seconds. You will have to exchange to another to send to that country.Asides that looking for a merchant to run this can be quite stressful, with Bitcoin less stress is involved.

A decentralized peer-to-peer payment system that is fully controlled by its users around the world makes Bitcoin very unique in that it gives its users complete control over their money.CBDC is digital money that is issued and controlled by the central bank, the supply of which can be increased or decreased by the central bank to achieve economic goals. In addition, CBDC will become a representation of digital money as well as a symbol of state sovereignty sovereign currency.
