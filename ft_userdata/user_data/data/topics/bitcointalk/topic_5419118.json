  "content": "Hey guys!I used to manage the BeastBTC account on here from many moons ago! I kinda took a dip out of the cryptosphere, came back when DOGE was kicking, then took another break till the market settled down.I have a question that I don't quite know how to answer.I have a /24 IPv4 block from ARIN. So thats 123.X.X.0 to 123.X.X.255 - that can be publicly announced, routeable, BGP, etc.. I just have no idea where to sell it at. The online marketplaces are kinda crappy, wanting $45/IP which I know is way too much. So, my question is this, where would you recommend selling it at?",

      "body": "No, $45 per IP is about average at the moment. If you have control of the ASN that the block is registered to, and if it's an existing company that is still active you may be able to get $12,000 or more for the bundle. ARIN can in theory block IP transfers but if someone takes over an existing company the number resources can move with it.Take a look at the discussion archives: https://lists.arin.net/pipermail/arin-ppml/A good broker might get you more BUT after their commission you might wind up with less.-Dave",
