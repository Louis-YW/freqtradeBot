Ryzen was / is better to mine Monero and Raptoreum for example, but now it's not anymore, there's no profits to make unless in rare cases you have solar energy or 1cent electricityÂ  You can sell 8700K, and 11800h you can sell if you are not using your laptop anymoreI know it's tempting to mine with GPUs and CPUs to have maximum profits, but CPUs are only profitable in short periods of time, mostly in a bull run and at the lauch of the coin.",

The only thing is Raptoreum and that is if you are in for the long term,so far I have mined like 1300 RTM with 2 processors one E5 Xeon and one Core i5 8500 which is not good,I have quit with the i5 and only use the old Xeon which makes me like 13 coins daily.While the core i7 of 8 gen you are mentioning should make a maximum of 5-7 coins and I don't know about the 11th gen processor.As I said this is only good if you will mine and keeping the coins if you expect a bull run.Personally I believe the price of RTM to be somewhat near that of Monero in the future and if this happens to be the case I plan to becoming a millionaire from such mining activity (I know I am a dreamer but I am not the only one).",

This is contradictory to your question. If you don't want to mine with them in a mining rig then you don'twnt to mine with them, period.On a mining farm, several processor cores need to be used for mining on video cards.

The payback period can be more than 12 months. Instead of using expensive processors and motherboards on 6 mining farms, I would rather build a seventh mining farm on video cards.",

Coinfarm ventures will learn a hard lesson from this bear time. Back to OP, your CPU really doesn't stand a chance in this CPU mining since ASIC will eat anything decently profit so it isn't worth your time to look for coin mining in your CPUs. Either sell the thing and opt for GPUs mining or prepare it as a fund to buy the dip incoming in the crypto market.",
