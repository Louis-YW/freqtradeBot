  "content": "Hello everyone I ask for help. I use electrum and it stopped syncing to the end 2 days ago, progress reaches 99% and again, it's always 223/224 or 224/225. Changed servers, client version, device, network. Nothing helped. I imported the private key of one of the wallets and realized that it was him, that he was not syncing. Thank you in advance!",

Thank you in advance! You imported private key of one of addresses, not private key of one of wallets.Anyways, that address has probably a big transaction history and servers do not load them due to protecting themselves from attacks. The other possibility, also do to a massive transaction history is local RAM. Had that years ago when someone was running an online store that swept every transaction to 1 address. After a bit electrum would not work. Upped the RAM in the workstation that electrum was running on and all was good again. I do not know if this issue was fixed in later versions since after a while the issue never came back after adding the RAM, then they went to bitcoind and then out of business  But, if you only have 4GB it *might* be an issue.-Dave",

Wait, somone may suggest you an alternative to electrum.The last effort is to run your own electrum server or download the full blockchain and use bitcoin core.",

How to solve such a problem?Electrum servers have a default limit for the history of transactions; most public servers have the default settings, hence you may have not much luck there.Some possible options would be:1. Import the private key (safely) of only that one address into another wallet and try your luck - this may work because it will ask for history for only one address and not more.2. Import the private key(s) into Bitcoin Core - but syncing means time and hardware (and a lot of disk space).3. Find somebody who hosts an Electrum server that can be accessed from the internet (i.e. not for local use only) and ask him nicely to increase the limits until you do what you must, then move to a new wallet.",

Because it is at one address that the limit is exceeded.I think towards the second and third.Thanks!",

And it's really not that tough. mynode even has a preconfigued virtual machine that you can run so long as your PC has enough free drive space (550+ Gb needed at the moment)-Dave",

Since that exploit with the malicious \"Phishing Servers\" ..... not everyone can create servers that are accessible to the public... right? How can anyone configure a Server.. and then make it accessible to someone else?",

As sometimes I do some sort of blockchain analysis and digging I ran into sort of the same problem as the OP. The preconfigured electrs Electrum server just refused to retrieve bigger address histories.You can tweak the config of electrs to some amount but for really large address histories I couldn't convince electrs to work as I wanted it. So I ditched electrs and switched to Fulcrum Electrum server. Much faster than electrs and ElectrumX (not during initial sync, though) and rather easy to configure to retrieve and submit address histories in the hundred thousands of transactions.Unfortunately my Fulcrum server is not setup to be public and at present I have some strange issues which developed somewhat out-of-nowhere in the past days and I get weird errors from my Electrum when it tries to connect to my Fulcrum server (connection is refused and I get a constant stream of errors spit out by Electrum; it worked before without any hickups and I didn't change anything before the errors occurred; oh, well, needs more investigation).",
