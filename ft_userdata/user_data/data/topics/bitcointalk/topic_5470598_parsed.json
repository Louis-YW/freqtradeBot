Most times, it could also be that you quoted someone who has awakened a long dead thread, and the post is also considered to be of low quality. There is a possibility that both posts can get deleted. Moderators don't just act for no reason, and people will also be the ones to call to their attention that the post is not qualified to be where you posted it to be, which will warrant those actions.",

I can point to one of the OP's deleted posts - it looks like one-line spam without adding anything of value to the topic.Check here:1. https://ninjastic.space/post/626906112. https://ninjastic.space/post/62424350QuoteThe fate of Bitcoin doesn't need to be determined, it's already going to be a success and it has seen huge success for years now.QuoteKids learn about a lot of useless stuff in school but bitcoin is something with actual use they can learn about. So I think it's a good thing if they learn about it.Someone has reported your post for spam or possibly low quality - it seems correct so you just need to improve the quality. Don't complain just because you get a few posts deleted - moderators don't do it because they hate you and they don't report your posts because you're newbie. So make better improvements.",

Is there any reason for this?Low quality posts are often reported by the users because they are mostly considered as spam by those users and when moderators get the reports and go through those posts and find them as spam as well then they delete those posts. Your post were one liner posts and most of the one liner posts are done by the new users because they want to increase their activity with those posts. But, like Philipma1957 has said that your posts weren't too bad, however, I still recommend you to expand your posts a little if you have more information about a topic.It's not necessary to be extra knowledgeable to expand your posts from one liner to somewhat well structured. You just have to focus more on reading and it's really necessary to read as many posts in a thread as possible before making your posts. Look we all are here for the purpose of learning and then sharing our knowledge in the form of threads and replies and if someone knows more then that user can create well-structured posts.",
