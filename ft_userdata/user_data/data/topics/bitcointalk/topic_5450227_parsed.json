It isn't reasonable for the government to continually step into the private sector and provide emergency funding when the markets are under duress. These banking institutions and their depositors knew the risks going in.Remember -- you as an individual investor do not have such protections. But somehow the banks think they deserve it for no other reason than their wealth status.",

I guess investors knew what was coming just let the stock to sink in, specially now Mr Biden and his administration have proven not to be willing to offer open bail outs to any bank that collapses this year. Source: GoogleEven though Bitcoin is doing relatively good, i worry how these banks bankruptcies could negatively affect the Crypto-FIAT liquidity in the mid term or the long term, most of stable coins are bank backed, after all. Developers are yet to find a fully reliable solution to that problem, even DAI suffered some de-pegging weeks ago, fortunately it was just a close call.",

Another hard alternative is for other banks to buy First Republic Bank bonds above the market value which will help to stabilize its shaky balance sheet. From all indications no bank is willing to invest more funds on the bank after they have injected a whopping $30 billion last month to save it from collapse. Now it seem the collapse is imminent. Customers are withdrawing funds from banks and the Bitcoin space is a viable investment platform this might be the reason for the slight pump in the price of Bitcoin and other altcoins.",

People are fade up of the inflation increase making money to be scared and we have to do extra work for us to earn extra fund so we can pay bills. Since the government don't want to adopt the use of Bitcoin, they should expect collapsing of banks because people no longer have fate in the fiat. It is just unfortunately that this is happening now that Bitcoin is about to push some green candles to the market.",

There are no reasonable reasons other than historical reasons why commercial banks continue to exist.All banks will die.",

Banks here and there are starting to have their shares plummet and recording all-time lows with their shares.Whilst bitcoin is doing good, people is starting to see that there's something wrong with the banking system that must be changed. And, we don't know how many of them will come and bite the dust from these known banks that have been operating for years.

The bad news is that all shareholders of the bank suffered significant losses as a result of the fall. Therefore, the outflow of deposits may be able to slow down, but I think we will still see panic sales of other banking shares.",
