  "content": "While checking out solo mining on Ocean XYZ, I noticed they mined empty blocks from time to time, like this one: https://mempool.space/block/842828I then checked for other blocks and realized that this seems to happen to pretty much all the pools, as you can see by ordering the latest blocks by transaction number. All these are empty blocks, mined by different pools: \"https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?s=transaction_count(asc)\"When you go to the solo ckpool website, it states:Quote from: https://solo.ckpool.org/Unlike regular pools, ckpool never mines transaction-free blocks due to its ultra-scalable code which has miners on both new blocks and transactions concurrently.And it seems that in fact ckpool hasn't mined empty blocks.My question is, how is it possible that this small pool run by one person, Con Kolivas, can manage to write code so that the miners never get an empty block but massive companies like Binance and others still produce empty blocks?Is there something fundamentally different in how solo ckpool is run that cannot be replicated in these other pools?",

If you mine an empty block, you will not get the transaction fees reward but you will get the mining reward which is now 3.125 BTC. So those big pools and most other pools will prefer to mine an empty block and earn 3.125 BTC than not to mine a block at all when they supposed to mine a block.",

The Empty blocks shouldn't exist, if there are transactions to confirm then the empty blocks are useless for the blockchain, the miners don't get that extra reward from fees, and the users need to wait for the next blocks to get that confirmation. But as you mention, it keeps happening, maybe in the future we will see an update in the blockchain to avoid this kind of blocks.",

Once a certain percentage of them agree then and only then do they start building the new block for the pool. Loosing the fees even now is better then building a invalid block that gets rejected.AND not broadcasting an empty block as soon as possible risks loosing it too.It just comes down to routing. It takes about 1/2 a second to send 1 packet of data around the world without doing any kind of firewall / security inspection in an ideal setting.Allowing for the nodes to verify what is in the block, and sending it back out is another couple of seconds and then start building a new block. If all is ideal you should have a new block ready to go in 10 seconds or so.BUT, if you are waiting for minimum of 3 of 5 to do their thing you might add a few seconds on top of that.Add in a bloated memory pool and some DPI From firewalls and you add a few seconds again.All of a sudden you are looking at more time to build a block.Even now there are 2 schools of thought with what happened with what happened with foundry the other day.Some people including Kano are saying that they tried to orphan a couple of blocks.Others are saying that they saw foundrys blocks 1st.It has always been the way it works.And part of the problem is that even if you understand BTC perfectly, unless you understand the true issues of internet routing and the true delays that proper DPI can put into network performance then it's never going to seem logical as to what happened.Dave's pool can put it's nodes out there in public.A corporation with all kinds of security requirements probably has 3 layers of security devices looking at all data coming in before it even hits the node to be processed. Dave's node has seen, and processed the block before it has even gotten through the security devices of some places. On the flip side, it's a lot harder to take out big corps node(s) by flooding them with bad data since it never even makes it into the network.-Dave* DPI = deep packet inspection. https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/dpi-deep-packet-inspectionAnd it's still true today. My LN node that is sitting out on a public IP running on an RPi has seen and just about finished processing a block BEFORE my node running on a 9th gen i7 has even seen the block because in front of the i7 are 2 separate security appliances sitting in series that take a look at the data before passing it back. So sometimes it bad programming, and sometimes it's a deliberate decision. Side note, if you look in the Ocean thread you can see I have no love for them. So I am not defending them here. Just pointing out that it's not as simple as 'bad node setup' it can be that simple but you don't know.-Dave",

So, it takes the same amount of time.The difference is if the pool first verifies the previous block to create the transactions of the next block, and while doing that, other pool simply mines an empty block because they didn't bother \"wasting\" time verifying the previous block to create the transactions of the new block.Mining an empty block is silly because lots of people want to put their transactions there, and that opportunity to charge those fees in that block is gone forever. But I guess many pools simply do constant hashing, without always validating the previous block.",
