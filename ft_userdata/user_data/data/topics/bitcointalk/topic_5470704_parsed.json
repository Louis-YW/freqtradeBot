I enjoyed the book as well I grew up watching all the King films.As far as the shitcoin/shit coin thing if thats what we are debating about I can live with that haha I know the term as one word as well, but on phones, computers, or even on the forum it shows as a spelling mistake when you type it as one word. I will say that one word just works better I should have left out the space, but I did not pay much attention to it at the time I just seen a misspelling and corrected it",
