  "content": "Updates based on replies:- BetKing was locked by moderators- When a topic creator locks a thread and you are urged to respond, make a new one to avoid censorship.Thread will be locked after 72 hours of no discussionQuote from: Bencodie (original post)CENSORED: JollyGood locks discussion about my \"obsessive conduct\" when focus starts to turn to him.I want to hear more about my obsessive conduct. Other members probably want to reply if the thread is unlocked. I think JollyGood should re-open this thread about my obsessive conduct so that we, the community can talk more about the real problem!Sad note: JollyGood will probably never re-open the thread, for obvious reasons. Sadder note: The trusted community will probably let him off the hook again, as JollyGood's time spent pointing out mostly obvious scams that other people don't bother to point out (because they're so obvious) has somehow earned him the power to censor as he pleases.CENSORED: BetKing.io ICO Scam - Token Refunds ThreadMore details about both of these censorship problems can be found in my response to Poker Player here.Sub-question for discussion:Does a member who censors the community from further discussion and locks threads to have the last (misinformative) say, deserve a trust feedback tag?^ addressed in \"more details\" post.",

Unless you are referring to a neutral tag where almost everything fits, but seeing where the story comes from I don't think it goes that way.I know what the trust system is all about however there is obviously a blurred line that needs clarification on almost a case-by-case basis...especially when it comes to censorship, afaik.Quote from: Poker Player on September 23, 2023, 06:08:22 AMAnd by the way the premise is false, JG is not censoring the community because he couldn't even if he wanted to. The proof is that you yourself are talking about it.This was the final response by JollyGood:Quote from: JollyGood on September 22, 2023, 05:57:36 PMQuote from: The Sceptical ChymistsnipMaybe you have checked it out by now. When someone says they are convinced something is a scam yet want to promote it for money and no other reason, there is a problem. Had he backed it up with another nonsensical statement stating the same, it would have been a negative tag. He reluctantly started twisting words and trying to make it that he did not mean that therefore it was a neutral tag.Quote from: BenCodiesnipQuote from: LoyceVsnipIt is laughable but I am not surprised by his conduct.--------------The post deleted from PytagoraZ is here. Let him make his signature quota elsewhere unless he posts something worthy of not being deleted.It will be locked as I created it 14 days and posted three times 14 days ago and and not again till now. I basically allowed others to post their views though I did expect at least one troll appearing. Anyway, this thread can remain as a reference for the obsessive conduct by BenCodie after he received a neutral tag.And let this thread be yet another reminder how a troll is still trying to attack me by using the Goebbels doctrine of propaganda: \"If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it\". Pathetic but not entirely unexpected conduct by BitcoinGirl.Club again.It includes accusations toward myself in the first part of the post, then BitcoinGirl.Club later in the post...It also describes the 4 responses linked above as \"trolling\" when no one, aside from PytagoraZ (who deleted their post) was trolling, afaik.There are unaddressed issues in this thread, there is no closure except the one of that JollyGood provided, with several members muted. Is this really an okay forum practice? Create issues, then mute discussion about them when things start going in a direction that you do not like?BitcoinGirl.Club, examplens and Sexylizzy2813 all responded before JG's posts above, and may have wanted to respond to his latest one due to the content of what he had said. I personally, also wanted to respond to that post due to the misinformation within it. Instead, the thread is locked, and myself, the 3 users above, and anyone else who wanted to comment; now can not. Censorship of a few means:Code:censorship existing within the forum/community = 1The way you are looking at it sounds to me like you are saying \"more people need to be censored before it is a problem\"...Sorry if I am wrong. If understand correctly however, I don't think this is the right way to go about addressing/dealing with censorship within a community forum that is inherently supposed to be anti-censorship (it's one of the moral pillars of Bitcoin after all, no?)Heavy questions come with all of this:1. Is creating issues between the community, then censoring conversation and discussion; really the kind of quality that the deciding portion of the bitcointalk really community want to see in a DT1 member?2. What gives JollyGood the right to create issues with topics, give his final (misinformative) say, and censor anyone from discussing in that topic by locking it? Is this acceptable behavior for a community member (let alone a \"trusted\" one)?I'll leave everyone with those questions in regard to JollyGood.Here is another example of ongoing censorship alongside JG: Refunds for the BetKing.io ICO Scam - Which I am addressing because it is an incident of censorship that is much more relevant to the trust system, considering it is relating to a scam.Quote from: BetKing.io on September 23, 2023, 06:03:38 AMQuote from: BenCodie on September 21, 2023, 11:15:50 AMIt's great that you are refunding clients...but how about all the people who have faced dire consequences from the delay of BetKing's token until now? Now, just a refund? Of course you are in a better position as the price went up.I commend that you are refunding as it's better than a scam, but I think that BetKing should not be allowed to promote on the forum and negative trust ratings should not be removed even when as many people as possible could be refunded.There are always going to be people who miss your thread and do not claim a refund because of the endless possibilities of what happens in periods of years. That is something that you can never compensate for.Delete my post again and I'll be making a topic to express my opinion since you are censoring me here.This is such an obviously wrong take. This wasn't a scam. We didn't just keep funds. The funds raised (including > $1 million of my own) were used and the business ran out of money and had to close. It's as simple as that.If we were just sitting on funds and decided to refund now, why would we not have done it when BTC was at 60k instead?I could have replied to this quite easily, except, I was muted by BetKing.io who decided to lock the thread after my response (after trying to mute me by initially deleting my post, causing me to re-post).Is it a separate incident requiring a separate thread?No, because it is the same problem - the OP is trying to censor further conversation to prevent further damage to their reputation.",

You are technically right, that doesn't mean you are entirely right as this process can definitely ripple effect into other issues quickly.Censorship is not something to be as lightly as you are taking it. If one can, more can, and then it's a very large problem. Accountability is important if we are allowing people to end discussions whenever they want, especially in sensitive topics regarding reputation.Quote from: BenCodie on September 23, 2023, 06:38:53 AMIs it a separate incident requiring a separate thread?No, because it is the same problem - the OP is trying to censor further conversation to prevent further damage to their reputation.It doesn't matter, you can continue the debate here as you are doing.

If JollyGood can stop discussions when he feels like it, I'll reply when I feel like it. I've stated the problem, I would mostly like to leave it to the community from this point onward, if anyone has anything to say about it. If not, great! We can leave it at this  (I doubt that this will be the case, as, once again, censorship is a serious issue).",

I did not expect anything better from him. In fact it proves the point I wanted to make.Anyway, fuck everything. I couldn't wait to reply @examplens when I read your post earlier LOLQuoteSo we can expect Jollygood's tag on Satoshi's feedback page. Something like \"BEWARE: This user cannot be trusted. Satoshi created Bitcoin, and after that, he left the forum leaving many questions unanswered. I will revise this feedback if he comes again and provides some answers.\"I don't understand why did not he done it any yet? Do you think it's a double standard from JollyGood? Feel free to leave your opinion about it 😂QuoteOr should we still start a request from theymos to open a new board next to Reputation \"JollyGood's tags - Revisions and appeals\"You are asking theymos to give him some especial privilege. Please don't even think about it, if such privilege is given to him, he will become more careless and start to feel that he is The One Above All [reminds me CH LOL].Following your imagination, I think he will then tag theymos's feedback page with something like, \"BEWARE: This user cannot be trusted. Theymos collected bitcoin to launch the forum software, and after even a decade, there are no new forum software. It raises many questions and all are unanswered. I will revise this feedback if he give some explanations and launch the software.\"",

If a service provider locks a thread in the face of criticism, then that may or may not inspire mistrust. But even that is context-dependent: a completely above-board business might just be locking a thread because they are tired of dealing with trolls.(edit: looks like the BetKing thread was actually locked by moderators, anyway)The point is there are a lot of nuances in determining the appropriateness of trust feedback and making sweeping generalizations usually isn't a good idea.At least you removed your negative rating on JG, that's a good start.",

He gave me some, I took it into account and I had then told him I'll make adjustments in due time.So, you abuse the Trust system, ask for my feedback, \"take it into account\" and then stop trusting my judgement:QuoteTrust list for: BenCodie (Trust:  +3 / =1 / -0) (407 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP) (created 2023-09-16_Sat_05.07h)Back to indexBenCodie Trusts these users' judgement:1.

When asked about it by LoyceV, he provided some bullshit explanation and later changed his mind, claiming he had \"given it more thought.\"  This is what his trust list looks like now:QuoteTrust list for: BenCodie (Trust:  +3 / =1 / -0) (417 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP) (created 2023-09-23_Sat_05.07h)Back to indexBenCodie Trusts these users' judgement:1.

You are the only member of the forum who has done this, and I am open to reviewing my trust feedback if there is an issue. Also, why you distrust BoXXoB's judgement? His last use of trust feedback was over three years ago, and I do not see any apparent issues there. Similarly, Shishir99 hasn't even used his trust feedback, so I am curious about your reasons for distrusting them.",

      "body": "I wouldn't call that censorship, per se, as censorship is defined as, \"the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security\" [I stole this from google by typing \"censorship\", no source given by the search engine. So... sorry, no citation], or simplified, \"blocks something from being read, heard, or seen\", and though the content of the threads being referrenced here are deleted and \"prevented\" from being read or seen, it is not blocked or suppressed, there are ways to \"recover\" those posts.It's self-moderation, not a censor, which, ironically for your case [not a sarcasm here, just stating a fact], is a way the forum offered for people to express their freedom of speech instead of limiting it, and the forum even offers a way to let the content that's being removed to still be available for public. There's a warning as well as a way to \"counter\" the removal literally above every of the pages of such thread,\"This is a self-moderated topic. If you do not want to be moderated by the person who started this topic, create a new topic.\"Above all, the fact that you can create a thread about this, is the epitome that the forum did not censor opinion. We won't be able to read your opinion and this entire thread if they do.And to set the record straight, I am not saying those things above because I am siding with JG, or with you. I believe there are times I disagree with JG as well as with you, though some might be voiced and some were kept to myself. There is a reason why I am not jumping to every threads made by you and JG [I still grab popcorn and sips coffee over it, though], and it's because I couldn't care less, it's mostly about conflict with two people who have more time to spend on the internet. Most of those topics can be avoided if either of you be more like bill. And the reason why I jumped into a thread that any of you raised is most likely because I feel the need to set some things straight, like this one; a censorship.",

Think of self-moderated threads like little pockets of private property within the public space of an online forum. In these threads, people can set their own rules, including heavy moderation, and decide what's acceptable and what's not, as long as it doesn't violate the global forum rules. So if someone doesn't want your comment in their self-moderated thread, that's their right. You are welcome to create your own topic and discuss further, as you just did. There is no censorship.",

It's because he did not like my opinion and I feel like he did the same thing with everyone for a similar reason. Agree with him? You will be included. If he does not like your opinion, he will exclude you. I don't think we should care about his inclusion or exclusion as he clearly does not understand the purpose of it. Or even if he understands, he is using it for his own purpose (to defend).I did not even check if he distrusted me. I just checked now and I realized I was distrusted by another member for some reason. What should I do if I don't know the reason? Should I ask via PM? what if they report my PM?",
