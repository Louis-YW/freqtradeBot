They will like your content and also make comment.This is very rampant because there's a profit you can make from being a Youtube influencer, Youtubers are now using shills in their videos when it should not be because it's not the comment that can increase your engagement, its the number of minutes and hours that you're viewers stay on your video and the likes and subscribers that it generates. Google is good at tracking fake clicks, comments, and likes, this is to make sure that only real Youtubers that do not engage in cheating are part of their publishers.Top and true Youtubers do not buy or pay for shills they concentrated on creating interesting videos based on their expertise, so if you're a trader then create interesting videos about trading if you have real subscribers they will comment and their comment is based on what they watched on your videos, These paid shills post generic comments they are not viewers and they do not engage.",
