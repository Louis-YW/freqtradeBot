The only concern I have with AZERO is the max supply, do you have any thing holding you back from AZERO pls drop and let's have some convo.Azero future is looking very bright because they providing top class ecosystem which can be Solona killer in long term. Azero not yet listed on big exchange and many other things yet to do so we can say that its price can Go to 10x in one year if they achieved their future roadmap earlier. Azero didn't even working in the same field as what solana does and how can it compete with solana? I think that what you are saying didn't even make sense. This is privacy coin almost the same like monero and how can go to the 10x in one year once the chart was telling the truth if this coin didn't have a very high all time high like another coin? i think that you must see the chart first.",

What about dogecoin? I think that dogecoin do also have an unlimited supply but that is not a hindrance for its value to grow. As long as many people will support the coin everything is possible to happen. It's also normal for a coin to stay stagnant like on what we are experiencing now and that is because we are currently in a bear season.If this was a new coin then we can expect less with it for now but sooner or later the developments can just come and that should help the coin move forward however your number 3 might be right. I remember privacy coins before like monero are also involved in an issue and I think it's also about regulations.",

If it's a privacy coin, sure that's going to be the problem on it since most governments are cracking down privacy coins and they're all against it.

This would be the main issue i wouldn't buy AzeroQuote from: poodle63 on August 09, 2022, 11:41:28 PM3. Privacy protocol like this could become the next targed by regulators. Think about that. Actions and things what governments want on privacy coins are very misunderstood. Right now people are scared of privacy coins because o this. In reality there's a contradiction because even nations who are trying to develope CBDC with a blockchain want it to be privacy preserving. Privacy coin is possible to be regulatory friendly and comply with AML laws. And to top of that, all the law makers agree that privacy is a human right.You can google RegDeFi if you want to know how is it possible to comply with regulations with privacy coins, i am sorry but can't really explain it as those laws goes way over my head.",

The only concern I have with AZERO is the max supply, do you have any thing holding you back from AZERO pls drop and let's have some convo.This is the first time I heard about Azero so I browse their website and it looks good.  I check the people behind the project and there are plenty, looks like a solid team if they are all real.  There are also lots of partners hopefully it is not on the website only.  Then I see that it has an unlimited supply of coins, which is a turn-off.  The project may increase at this moment because of the limited number of circulating coins but I am concerned about how they will sustain the market value when the coin has an infinite supply.  I also think that there will be an issue with its adoption because the way I see it, it looks like privacy coin and government is hostile against this kind of coin, so most probably the adoption of this coin will be hindered due to the government blacklisting this coin.",

The only thing to worry about is regulation since its privacy coin.It’s better to have a complete details in your original post so we can know what kind of token we are talking about. It’s good that you are able to make profit with that investment. Aside from it’s regulation issue, I think the supply is also a big concern here, unlimited maximum supply will turn the investors away I don’t see this as a good token in the long run, the pressure is also there since the regulations are slowly targeting the privacy coin.",

Giracoin / swiss alps mining got their approval and was still a total scam. What AZERO will be facing is FATF, not FINMA. But since you asked, it's trading in exchanges that are mainly famous for their fake volume. It doesn't have a ZK VM nor real privacy. You cannot just mix public and private transactions without the latter being de anonymized quickly.It has nothing compared to what dusk is building in terms of privacy.",
