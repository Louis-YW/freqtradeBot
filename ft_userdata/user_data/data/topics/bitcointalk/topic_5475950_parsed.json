  "content": "Since the inception of the world, there's been transactions in terms of business and this has made for the advent of various means and ranges of money advancements. Like history and science will tell us that we were once in a stone or cave age and now we sit to think, does it mean that there was never really an economy or a mode of financial exchange back then? Truth is, there actually was. And there and then it started till we got to where we are today. Remembering vividly for most people who were only taught but didn't get to witness, the first form of exchange during trade was barter. It was of the concept of give me this for this and surprisingly it worked for them. After a while, cowries came into existence and then, the economy maximized. Traders and everybody generally cherished and desired cowries as it was the only means of exchange. Colony started coming into play and then coins were brought to use and then trading got a lot more easier.  The introduction of coin helped made transactions easier thereby making the cost of goods worth it, after some  years  the introduction of paper money was brought about and the whole economic activity was smooth, the currency had a very good worth in the economic market and livelihood was at its best. A number of years later, coins went into extinction and then the paper money took the full show and then it started becoming much more in use and advanced. A lot of notes got unveiled and it aided more easier means of trading although it led to the advent of corruption because public funds started to get stolen and further caused a declining economy. Up till this day where we see clearly that transaction and finance are getting digitalized. Digital assets are now being used as a means of transacting and looking at the brighter side, it's in a way aiding the economy. Bitcoin and crypto currencies also have good impacts in the economy. Bitcoin didn't seem like it'd experience this massive growth as it does now but after a few years, Bitcoin has expanded in itself and is now one of the greatest asset one would possess.   It is very much advisable that digital economy should be embraced, no one would want to be caught naive when the world evolves fully. One thing is certain that a time would come where all financial transactions would be done digitally and there'd be no hard note transaction, at that time, it'll be difficult to secure an asset for oneself so it's very much best to start now that its still being nurtured. The economy of a nation balls around the financial impacts. Leaving aside the current corruption, we see that there's a difference between the economy of the past and now, we can see how steadily the evolution of money has been.",

Not willing to follow him, it means that humans do not want him to develop.Previously the work system was manual, now it is very sophisticated so that doing work is no longer difficult. All transactions throughout the world can be done at any time in just minutes and everything is recorded.Like the Bitcoin transaction system. People will get convenience without having to be afraid of conducting transactions and without having to involve other parties.",

It's very difficult to write a full overview in a single post about the evolution of money but you did this and thanks to you for this effort. The people who lived in the era where they changed goods directly to each other did not think that in the future there would be a time when people use paper currency to buy or sell goods and now after thousands of years people use paper currency. People accepted the trend and they are following it but issues came when you talked to them about the digital currency. Some people do not understand digital currency and those who have little knowledge about it do not trust digital currency. Someone tells them that this digital currency is the future of today's currency and you have to accept it like you accept coin and then paper currency. This is a new trend everything changes with time and now the era is fully technological this is the need of today's world to change our currency into a digital form so that we will take more benefit from it.",

Leaving aside the current corruption, we see that there's a difference between the economy of the past and now, we can see how steadily the evolution of money has been. Cryptocurrencies are highly restricted in my country. The government is engaging in several media wars against Bitcoin and altcoins. But within these, they know that cryptocurrency is the next phase of money but they are just unwilling to accept this truth. I just remembered teaching my son about money and I was surprised to see that even the anti-crypto government of my country is preparing the younger generation for the era of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are in the secondary school curriculum and students are expected to learn about them.        Source: WABP Business Studies.I am aware that cryptocurrencies might not replace fiat but I am sure that they will play a greater part in the global financial system in the future. This is why many countries are introducing CBDCs in a bid to fill in the vacuum created by cryptocurrencies. But they have also failed to achieve their aim because people know that these CBDCs are nothing but digital fiat.",

For every financial transaction to be done digitally, the whole world would need to have gone completely digital. This is something that is happening gradually and despite how far the world has grown, it has not gotten to the level of eradicating cash. Even in developed countries, cash is still needed at some point so talk more of underdeveloped countries. My point is, we're not going to sleep one night and wake up the next morning in a completely digital era where every transaction is digital and cash is no longer needed. It's not going to happen within a year.It is a phase and we have already started evolving to that point, it may not happen in our lifetime or in this century, but it would happen and nobody would be left behind.",

      "body": "Follow the trend, but never abandon the old tech completely until the new tech is laid and implemented 100%. I used to just carry cash wherever I go. I find it convenient to pay with physical cash and receive change. Cash is accepted everywhere, that's why they say, 'cash is king.' But nowadays, I also use digital wallets to pay for things that I buy. Given that I always carry my phone around, and it's not hard to find a place that doesn't accept such method of payment, it's convenient and fast compared to cash.Then again, if I only use digital payments and not carry cash, there could be instances wherein I'd be stuck in a place wherein digital payments are not accepted. Public transportation here in the Philippines still don't implement digital payments fully, and it's one of those things that could take advantage of the growing number of digital users. But they couldn't, as most of the operators and drivers of public transportation are old and do not trust digital payments just yet. It will take time before cryptocurrencies get understood and embraced by economies. The first transition would be digitization of cash, followed by embracing the truth that cryptos are here to stay.",

And corruption, being way older than paper money itself won’t suddenly go away with the end of the reign of paper money being used as a means of exchange.In my opinion, nothing is truly certain except death of course. So the future where you say all financial transactions would be done only digitally without paper money is still far off and not entirely clear. Of course, it would be advisable to embrace change when it comes.The economy of a nation is determined by what it produces and exports. And that in turn gives the boosts the nations finances.",

It is something that not everybody will accept at ones. When mobile phone came out. Back then some person felt there were no good thing about it but look at now it is used by everyone in the world. We have moved from the stone age to this present technological civilization. All these advancement happened gradually from decades to decades until what we see today. TBH, advancement will not seem to stop till the end of time. There will be more better technologies in the future. Since the world is adapting AI technology and everyone is wowed with the new inventions imagine what technology would exist 1000 years from now. Sometimes i just wished i could live long enough to see how civilization would be in the future. When i mean the future, i meant thousand years from now. It would be lovely to have that experience but unfortunate it is impossible.",

The timeline of history that we know is really limited, as there are many things for which we still do not have specific answers. To me, if you look at it from a knowledge perspective, it is infinite and people find it and apply it to life simply as an adaptation. There are logical things from natural science that make us more stubborn about the truth of life, but rather, everything that appears around us is a reflection of people's perception of life.In terms of AI issues, it's also consistent with what I talked about earlier, the adaptation of those tools. Just comparing back a bit to the period where we had not yet found the application of the power source, it was clear that it was still the same and the problem was created by humans.",

Digital transactions offer convenience, speed and efficiency, enabling seamless transactions without the need for cash. Bitcoin, for example, uses blockchain technology to ensure safe and transparent transactions. Cryptocurrencies not only offer fast and unlimited transactions but also give individuals more control over their financial assets.

Barter needed direct trust between two parties; digital currencies use technology and algorithms. Doesn't this movement suggest a subconscious shift toward trust and worth in human psychology?You're right to recommend digital finance, but isn't it complicated? As we move away from tangible money, wealth becomes more abstract. Despite their efficiency, digital currencies abstract value. Does this dissociation from physicality not undermine our wealth and security concepts? As well as staying technologically ahead, we must change our thinking about value and trust.
