Halong worked with Inno who actually built the miners. Halong had buckets of money and wanted to be 1st to use non-covert ASICBoost, Inno had the design/build expertise to make them and was licensed by Halong to market their own after x number of months assuming the idea (AB) caught on.As for firmware, -ck was paid by Halong to do all of the cgminer code mods and driver work. Initially he was releasing FW updates every couple of days for Live User testing until he got the bugs worked out, odds are somewhere in his git the code is all there.",

It uses the A1 chips that the now defunct Bitmine.ch and Innosilicon collaborated on. Bitmine.ch provided most of the money with Inno getting the option of selling the chips to other mfgrs a few months after Bitmine released their Coincraft A1 miner. Go back to my earliest posts to catch that saga regarding their Made In America version that a company called AMT was supposed to handle...Long story short - Bitmine.ch (and AMT) were clueless idiots when it comes to even the basics of dealing with high power chips and feeding them power. Their hash boards were utter crap. Massive failure there whereas companies like LKETC got it right. Innosilicon back then was an ASIC design house who designed the A1 chip and had them made by TSMC but at that time Inno did not make actual miners. As for the firmware - no idea about that but it has to exist *somewhere* on the `net. Back then the 'control board' was just a SPI data bus fed from the GPIO pins on the Pi. The entire code for the miner is on that SD card.",

If they grabbed it today at 9:37 AM and then a couple of weeks from now today's might not have it, but the one in a few weeks might. It's a slow slogging process that might not get you anywhere but it's worth a shot.Also, don't waste more time then it's worth. You can get a newer / faster / low power miner for not much money depending on where you are in the world.-Dave",
