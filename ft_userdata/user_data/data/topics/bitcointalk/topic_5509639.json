  "content": "And interesting topic here;  Randolph police warn of new email scam demanding bitcoinQuoteRANDOLPH — Police are alerting the community about a new scam involving threatening emails that demand bitcoin payments after victims received messages containing their personal information and photos of their homes.The Randolph Police Department reported an increase in complaints from residents who have received emails, mostly from gmail.com accounts, that use the victims’ full names and addresses.The emails include images that appear to be taken from online mapping applications, such as Google Maps, depicting the street or front yard of the targeted individuals.According to the authorities, the emails have a threatening tone and demand a bitcoin payment, typically in the amount of either $1,950 or $2,000.Scammers have included a QR code for the intended payment and falsely claim that Pegasus malware has been installed on the victim’s computer.Police emphasized that recipients of such emails should not respond.The recommended action is to immediately move the email to the spam folder and then delete it to avoid further risk.The department urges anyone who receives a similar email or has questions to contact the Randolph Police Department at 781-963-1212 for assistance and support in dealing with the scam.The scam attempt seems so simple, yet there are still people who fall for it. It’s a threat, though we don’t always know what kind, but for those who aren’t familiar with the technology, seeing an email where the scammer knows their address and even has a picture could really scare them, not realizing it just came from Google Maps. That’s why people need to be more educated about these kinds of scams and the technology behind them to help minimize cases like this.",

Especially since they send a photo of your house and unless you recognise it was a Google streetview photo you are going to freak out and assume they live in your city and you might be in danger.I heard the ones where they just email you and threaten but didnt think they would send along photos of your place of residence. The things scammers will do is crazy these days and downright scary.Hopefully not too many people fall for these scams but I am sure some will because they wont want to put their family at risk.",

That’s why the police advise not to reply or just ignore it, because they’re not going to follow through, it’s just their scam. If you fall for it, then sorry, say goodbye to your money.According to the report, they’re asking for a big amount, around $1,950 to $2,000... so even if 1,000 people fall for it, they’ll end up making millions from the scam.",

How did the scammers know the images are related to their target btw? Do people upload their location details publicly? A bad idea to put our real name and photo on Google.

Scams are increasingly rampant these days as technology is advancing especially in this era of cryptocurrency, they are getting more desperate and their deceit styles are advancing. I know enough of their schemes and there is no way I can become a victim because I don't associate with strangers' offers not to talk of the digital communications I am unfamiliar with, I just ignore or delete them immediately. But what scared me a little was the Google Map of a thing, I am sure that most people would fall for it especially if their revealed details are genuine. Thanks for the exposè, many should endeavour to educate themselves on this instead of always watching TikTok comedies.",

It creates the feeling of invasion through depicting personal information or images from Google Maps. But I think these scammers are just using publicly available information. It is not like they have hacked into our private life. Also, people tend to fall for this in the case of panic. While the scammers may include names and addresses in that mail, they actually do not have access to sensitive data but are trying to scare us into paying up.",

There are many people who doubt that such technology exists elsewhere aside from in movies so if they happened to be one of those who received such a threatening email, because of the suspense of how the image of their home was gotten they may be forced into believing that the scammer actually knows their homes. Exposure will save many people from these sort of scams, that is why it is necessary to stay informed, or at least have someone who is more informed than you are.",

But, what else can we do other than educating the people as it's not possible to track out each scammer and put those behind the bars.Even if such actions are taken then still the scammers will find a new way to scam people either in physical world or in internet world. I believe the authorities should take strict actions against the scammers when they find any, so out of fear most scammers will think twice before trying to scam someone. But, I don't think that anything like that will happen and that's why awareness should still be given the highest priority.",

Advice from the police is very helpful in minimizing cases like this, lay people will be calmer after advice from the police to immediately ignore the message.There needs to be public service announcements distributed through social media, print media and other electronic media to educate the public so that they do not panic easily when facing a situation like this.
