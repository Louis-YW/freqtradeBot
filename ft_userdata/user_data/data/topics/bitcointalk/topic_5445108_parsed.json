I bought a long time ago before I knew about this form… I’m not sure if this broke up a signature/holo set when they were originally sold to me or if these were extras when people set up those EOPBTC signature sets… I would hate to think this actually broke up a complete set for the encyclopedia… but it could be the case….",

Still looking.I still have a Microsooul coin, but I'm not sure it'd be useful to you... It's also a 2014 Microsoul 0.01 BTC Series-1, but it's peeled and ungraded [\"it used to have ANACS MS 67 grading\"]: PicturesNote: I'm not sure where you're currently residing but unfortunately, I can't ship to the US.",
