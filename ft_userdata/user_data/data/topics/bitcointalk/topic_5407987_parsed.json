  "content": "Updated: 01/09/2022We are a few bitcointalk old timers who are working on Casino Critique. Our goal is to be at the top in the next 2 years for the specific niche. After one year of the launch our goal is to reach $10k per month in revenue and after 2 to 2.5 years we will scale it up for monthly $100k+. And finally the sky is the limit. As per our observation toppers in the industry are making $150k to $200k if not more than half a million dollar per month. It's not an easy job but not impossible too. We are still in diaper stage and a long way to go to become adult. But in our team we have highly experienced professionals who have the enthusiasm to bring us at the top. We have our full commitment to be at the top by achieving the little goals over the time.  There are nothing new to talk about gambling industry. According to some articles only for online gambling the global gambling market is $57.5 Billion with a capital B. It's from 2021. Be able to be a part of a very small share in the industry means it's an enormous opportunity. We are working our hardest to meet the expectation.We are planning to have a crowdfunding. Detailed metric: https://ibco.casinocritique.com/#expensemetricRight now we have a 2 of 3 multi-sig address for escrow to hold the offered chips. Two of the cosigner of the wallet are two well known bitcointalk members and the third cosigner is from our internal team. Everything in the escrow wallet will be spent for all type of expenses for the project to bring live and continue development. Most of the budget will be spent on marketing and content creations.For crowdfunding we will accept Chips (thanks to Chipmixer for the idea of Chips). Minimum unit for a Chip is 0.001 BTC.  All Chips are with 0.001 BTC increments. Maximum Chip from an address will be 1 BTC. For example when A Chips oferrer sends 0.001 BTC then they offered 1 chipsA Chips oferrer sends 0.025 BTC then they offered 25 chipsA Chips oferrer sends 0.100 BTC then they offered 100 chips A Chips oferrer sends 1.000 BTC then they offered 1000 chipsAt the time of crowdfunding Chips will be accepted first come first serve basis. The crowdfunding will be kept completely anonymous. Please be sure that for a transaction which will have more than one input address you will be given a contact form on a spreadsheet to inform us which address to use to send your monthly revenue from the Chips oferrers revenue pool. For all Chips oferrers input address we will keep a public record in a spreadsheet. Once the spreadsheet is final we will bind it with our PGP finger print so you can always verify that nothing on the file has changed. If anyone wants to change an address then they can sign the old address to replace it with a new address via the given email address (you can always use a temporary email) we will have on our website. In that case we will bind the spreadsheet file again with our PGP finger print and will update the file on a bitcointalk post as well as we will have a copy on our website server. Everything will be kept extremely transparent. Even the revenue sharing wallet master public key will be shared among the Chips oferrers and shareholders of the project.Ideal format of the spreadsheet:| Chips oferrers' address | Transaction ID | Chips | | bc1........... | 964795680a.... | 25 | Our official bitcoin address and PGP public key will be found at this page: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1159946.msg60644728#msg60644728",

Congratulations Mbitr!The source of revenue will be affiliate commissions and on site advertising.Chips to ensure we are not working with small fractions of the btc.

A lot of people on here are turning to this forum as a last resort to air their grievances with casinos and most of the time it turns into a shit show of mud slinging and allegations. The casinos get a bad reputation and the gambler just anger the mods and the owners of these casinos. We need someone to handle these negotiations at a fee... so that there can be a positive solution for both parties.   (obviously no guarantees can be provided for that)Thank you for doing this, because most people seem to think \"review\" sites are backed and owned by casinos to \"boost\" their own ratings. We need reputable people that will be unbiased. (affiliate commision might influence their biased opinion )",

I also think that you would be much more careful and dedicated if you would bear the risk of the business yourself. wasn't that one of the biggest problems with the ICO, where the investors took the biggest risk of the whole project, unlike the initiators who more or less came out with a profit?",

On our Initial Bitcoin Chip Offering website in the pie chart we have tried to give the idea of how we will spend the funds. You can check it from our ANN thread too.To bring the project at the top, for the next 6 months, 71.6% of the funds from Softcap will be used to Marketing only and if we reach our Hardcap then 34.9%+35.1% as you calculate 70% of the funds will be used for Marketing and Content creation. So we are going to use over 2/3 of the fund for massive marketing and producing quality contents.Quote from: buwaytress on August 15, 2022, 08:34:53 AMMight keep an eye on this, is it possible I know some of you veterans? Now you should already know :-)Quote from: seoincorporation on August 15, 2022, 08:50:14 PMthere isn't clear where the money will come from. Only ads or referrals too?The main two source of income are on site ads and affiliates from casinos. Once we become large then we will have many other sources of income like blog writing etc. We will have a full tipster section too in the future. I hope it helps now.Cheers,",
