If global leaders could just recognize the usefulness of bitcoin and blockchain it can make our life more easier and as well we can get additional investment option so that we can grow individually in terms on financial aspects. For now its good to accumulate but remember that you still consider how you need bitcoins since if you need money to use then don't regret to use it at in any time.",

But it is quite interesting to hear how Bitcoin is helping people during emergencies. We have been hearing and experiencing great news about Bitcoin in some parts of the world where the currency is gaining more attention and experiencing massive adoption. The most amazing part of it is that Bitcoin transactions are restricted in some of these countries. I hope your brother recovers very soon.",
