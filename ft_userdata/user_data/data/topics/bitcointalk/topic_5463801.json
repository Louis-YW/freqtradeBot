That is a good trading plan. I will only advice you to know how to use the appropriate leverage if you are using it. Do not use any leverage that will result to trading fund liquidation at $15000. This means I will advice you not to go more than 2x leverage. No matter what that will happen, you will later make profit.",

There is heavy instutions money waiting on 15k-20k to buy it so it's unlikely the price of btc can go lower then 15-20k more likely the 18k-20k Will hold BTC price well. But generally the 2023 will be kinda smooth year btc will stay 20k-30k price range. The 20k price Will be likely lowest in 2023-2024.",
