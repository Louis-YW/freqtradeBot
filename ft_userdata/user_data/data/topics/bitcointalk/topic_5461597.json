  "content": "I am not sure if this was posted already and I know that many will raise their eyebrows on this one. Because we've got a lot of experts here that are technically knowledgeable and adept about the Bitcoin network itself and not just for it but also for other chains.But out of boredom and trying to search for something related to this, I've stumbled upon this certification of being a \"Certified Bitcoin Professional\" (CBP) by C4(cryptoconsortium) so I think that I have to share this one. As we know that this is still an industry that doesn't have standards for being a professional and most likely it's just all about being a programmer/developer, project manager, trader, investor and etc. Here is this organization that has set an industry standard for everyone. Looking at the people behind this includes Andreas Antonopoulos as one of their board of directors. The rest of the team members, I don't know them. So they have a course just like any other in able to pass and get certified. I don't know the credibility yet of this but searching a bit of its info, it seems that their certification is recognized based on the google results that came out to me. Going with the exam it will cost you $99.99 as per its website and then the certification fee is $39.99. They also have other courses like Certified Ethereum Professional, the rest is on their website.My take on this one is that if you've got a lot of spare money and you want to get into this, it's just all about satisfaction and getting the certificate unless you want to apply for jobs related to Bitcoin and related to blockchain technology. Anyway, it's still best to have the knowledge when you're applying even without the certification as that's going to be more honored by a company you are applying for. But if you're for the knowledge, the forum is more than enough for what you can learn from there and it's for free and that's why we're all grateful that we're part of this great community. Probably most of those people that are behind these orgs have been here as well.There is also another organization that has this certification aside from C4 and that's blockchain council's - Certified Bitcoin Expert. And they've got more courses aside from this specific certification while for them, their certification is lifetime and for the C4, you have to renew it.PS: I am not related to them and just thought of sharing this and thanks for reading everyone.",

First is whether companies hiring \"blockchain experts\" require such certificates or care if you have one or not. Second is whether these hiring companies even recognize the issuer of such certificates!I haven't really looked for the jobs in this industry but from what I've seen from startups and other small businesses in this field, the experts themselves create these small companies and then they hire regular programmers, etc. to help build the business.Not to mention that when anybody hires employees, they look for experience not certificates. For example when they hire a programmer, they don't ask them who taught them c++. Instead they ask them how many lines of c++ they have written and what programs they've created, and stuff like that.",

Aa company paid for my exam, otherwise I wouldn't take it.One thing that is interesting about this certification are the people behind it: Antonopoulos  and Vitalik Buterin (he was when I took the exam, but I believe he left).I wouldn't do it again, only if someone paid me to do it or to have it.",

      "body": "So what you are trying to say is that a person \"going from one frying pan into another fire\" Means you get out of one trouble to get into another trouble. Wow! Let me explain my words. Andrew Tate used to criticise the current education system as part of the matrix, which doesn't want kids to learn more so they can become independent. Instead, they want to teach kids only what they feel is more dependent.So, when students leave the education system and step into making money, they choose BTC as the best investment plan for a lesser investment portfolio, and to avoid that education degree circle, they will again start another circle of getting degrees in BTC. Why would someone do that because such a field (which means this BTC field) cannot be 100% corrected or predicted by a certified person? So, what's the purpose of that certificate? Are they the true owners of BTC who are distributing Certificates for trading, developing blockchain, etc.?They are nothin, and this is some next-level technique to lure people into wasting their money on such certificates so that they could show off on their social media platforms. Nothing more.",

      "body": "While the prospect of earning a \"Certified Bitcoin Professional\" designation intrigues me, it also makes me suspicious. There is a clear need for more uniform qualifications in this field, but it is unclear if C4's accreditation, or that of any other group, can meet that demand. How does one become a Bitcoin expert? Programming, trading, investing, and other financial savvy would all be helpful, at least in theory.In addition, developments in the bitcoin industry occur at an unprecedented rate, making it difficult for a static curriculum to keep up. It's like trying to keep water from dripping through your fingers.Last but not least, an accreditation's worth is determined by its standing in the marketplace. I am interested in knowing how this certification is seen by potential employers. Does it set you apart from the competition significantly, or is it just another line on your resume?",

Certificates most times are not proof of proficiency in an area because most of these issuing bodies or agencies might focus on making money from certification instead of knowledge. From the little time I have spent in the sector, I have never seen a job vacancy that requires a certification for a Bitcoin expert. Most of these jobs require practical knowledge and most applicants are interviewed or tested based on how well they can apply their experience. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin and the anonymity of some of its reputable early supporters will always make it difficult to have a generally recognized certificate.",

I've no idea what is he up to now.The certificate was designed for professionals from various industries to get them familiar of what Bitcoin actually is and how it works.It's probably not very useful for anyone wanting to dive much deeper into it.

Nothing beats experience in this industry and I can attest to that with the fact that I had a friend in the past who bought these online course training programs, this time for blockchain technology and got his certification, in the end he worked at a fortune 200 company that doesn't even dabble in blockchain technology while another friend of mine who had 2 years of working closely with cryptocurrencies as a full stack developer landed a job in this industry and is comfortably working in the comfort of his own home. Not comparing or contrasting who's better and who's not, just that these certifications doesn't act as a guarantee that you'd be a master at the thing you just trained for.
