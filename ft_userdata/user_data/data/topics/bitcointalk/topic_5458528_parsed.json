  "content": "I came across an ad on Google concerning a faucet that talks about earning free bitcoin every hour when you click on a free spin wheel, at first I had doubts concerning it but then i was forced to make research about it then I discovered it was legit, I clicked on the link from the ad and registered on freebitco and  I was given 0.0000007 btc when I spinned a wheel, then at the home page of the site they offered me a chance to wager and multiply my reward whereby I  had to gamble  my earnings by predicting against other users on specific games to double my rewards of which I won, what amazes me about this site is the cool referral reward that it offers and was also offered 1 free lottery ticket and 1 reward points for every free btc roll my referrals play, I've had a lovely experience on freebitco so far and I'll love to know if there are other faucets or gambling sites that offers free BTC.Note: that this post wasn't created with regards to making an income from the above stated faucet, my aim of joining the faucet wasn't to earn a living through btc rewards because I'm fully aware they offer few bits of satoshi's but rather for fun and to while away time during my leisure, so let's be guided.",

For newbies, faucets are gifts especially if rewards coming from faucets can be used to buy lotteries just like Freebitcoi.in, Faucets are still alive because they still have markets and these are newbies who just get interested in Bitcoin, but as they move forward, they will eventually see that its a waste of time, payout time from faucets is two to three months and so much depends on how active you are and if you have a good number of referrals.",

Some faucets wouldn't let anyone withdraw until they reach a threshold that is too high for someone without patience. So if Freebitco allows $10 to be withdrawn, its really must be worth it for those kids. Making users bet the coins they got from the faucet is already a good bonus, it's a huge chance to win if they can.  They hit the jackpot and withdraw I guess that can be a goal. I haave not seen any success tory about this yet.",

Nowadays, the payout from faucets isn't worth much, and you can definitely spend your time more effectively by doing something else to earn more. But hey, some folks out there don't have the money to buy bitcoin directly, so they make use of their free time.Here's the thing though: we can't predict how much bitcoin will be worth in the future, whether it's a few years or a decade. Let's take a look at the first faucet created by Gavin Andresen back in 2010. It paid out 5 BTC. If you had the chance to go back in time, would you use that faucet? Back then, bitcoin had little to no value, and those 5 BTC would have been worth just a few cents.Who knows, maybe those small fractions of bitcoin earned from faucets today could turn into something significant down the line.",
