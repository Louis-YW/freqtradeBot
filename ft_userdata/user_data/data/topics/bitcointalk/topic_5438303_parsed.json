Â And, if they acquire merits and become full members of the forum, they can then post in the Known alts thread having earned trust from other investigators.Quote from: Rikafip on February 08, 2023, 03:34:44 PMAh yeah you are right, I rarely nowadays post in that thread as I kinda got tired of that whack a mole game so I forgot about his \"no newbies\" rules and only think that they can do si to share link of their investigation so someone can take a look at presented evidence.It's cut down the hysteria and false accusations (and associated \"whack-a-mole\") to near zero.",
