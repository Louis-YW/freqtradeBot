But as you want altcoins that are not shit coin, I will suggest you to look for coin lists on Coinmarketcap or Coingecko. The top listed coins are not shit coins. The more you go down checking the coin, the higher a coin can be a shit coin. Marketcap is important to know how valuable a coin is.",

I wonder for some altcoins, they were suppose not to be go but they scammed without any reason! And hundreds of altcoins are in my wallet, which are turn into dead shitcoin now. First of all, the word scam is thrown a lot by newbies, and usually it's because the price is dropping, even though that has nothing to do with the fact if the project is scam or not, not unless devs dump their tokens and remove all liquidity.Also can you do TA or do you understand how valuation works? Because while it's simple when you know enough, there also are several things worth looking for and enough to write a book about different kind of scams and examples how projects can fail. Basics are pretty easy for someone who has seen a lot of scams, but there are just too many red flags worth looking into to list. it always depends on the project and different tokens have different red flags. And red flags on some projects can be even green flags with other projects. It all depends what your tactics are and what are you looking for.There's no such thing as a guarantee that legit projects would make money. In fact i've made more with pure scams by getting out fast enough.I wonder what your thought process was that you thought they were supposed to be good that time. What qualifies as a good team, or community?",

Shitcoins are generally regarded any token created without a long term roadmap to scale the project. Nearly all of the newer tokens in dexs like Dex screener and others should be regarded as shitcoins which they rightly are. I would also suggest that you avoid any altcoin calls by influencers on CT. A solid project don't need to be shoved down the throat of users like these influencers do because they'd get a share of the supply.Stick to projects with proven track records and you'd be fine.",

I think you can just assume most coins that are starting out are shitcoins so that you're on the safe side. Don't trust their promises, \"to be done\" projects and ideas and stuff like that. Look for results, and only then should you start investing. Yes, theoretically speaking investing before a project has grown could produce more profits, but how many new projects are actually able to \"grow\"? You'd probably lose more trying than earning. Might as well just play it safe and invest on projects that have a well built reputation already yet relatively small. Takes time but much more effective imo.Ofc, this is projects that aren't say, plagiarized, scams or what not though. Filter out projects that aims to only scam the money out of its investors, then filter those again to determine actually good projects.",

As an already experienced investor, you should know the risks.Maybe some of your hold altcoins performed well during their hype or actively developed during that time. But as time progressed, and we know that the crypto-market experienced several hits, most projects were unable to keep up and decided to stop the development and ended up abandoning the project.We can't really determine if these projects will continue and keep up with their development once they are announced to the community. Rather than risk your money in these new projects, as it turned out it didn't go well, maybe try to focus on investing in coins that have been in the market for a long and already established a good community. Not saying you should stop investing at new projects but at least, you will minimize being scammed if you test the waters at already established coins.",

You should not be tempted by profits in altcoins 10x or 100x it will turn into a scam, new projects are now difficult to identify sometimes even from a good background they are only looking for momentary profits and do not think about others, if you are an investor why not choose a coin that already has a large capitalist or the top order? Why not include bitcoin in your portfolio as a major investment? Are you ignoring it?Now choose bitcoin instead of shitcoin which is useless, if you often experience losses avoid it and be wise in choosing coins especially new projects are not recommended.",

I will skip all the project that carries these things; -  it has no use case - offered sweet promises - huge rewardsWhy? Because scammer usually uses attractive words and promises and creates a project without a core market value and purposes. It is too hard to identify when you are a newbie and even if you did research sometimes you fail to recognize them which is why we should be more cautious. But the best thing we have to do is to focus on old projects, not new and hyped ones.",

Also with a \"bootleg\" of something popular, indeed. However there are coins being introduced as a project and turning out to be one of the mentioned category so I do consider referring to it as failed tokens which had a price dump upon its listing to exchanges, and tokens with low market volume. But there's really no absolute definition of the mentioned term.  It won't be listed without any value in the first place. Well  for swing trades, these coins are still profitable but expect extreme price volatility especially if whales would choose to manipulate its demand and market value.",
