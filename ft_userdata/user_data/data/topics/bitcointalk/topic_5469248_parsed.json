      "body": "It's very easy to use coin control feature on electrum.Go to \"Coins\" tab to see all your UTXOs.If \"Coins\" tab is not available, click on \"View\" at top of the window and check \"Coins\".If you don't want a specific UTXO to be used for your transactions, right click on it and select \"Freeze coin\". Select \"Freeze address\" to freeze the UTXO and all other UTXOs received on the same address at once.Whenever you want to make a transaction, the coins that have been frozen can't be spent. ¬†If you want to use specific UTXOs for your transaction, right click on the UTXO and select \"Add to coin Control\". Once you do so, a message will be displayed at bottom of the window. The message tells you number of UTXOs you have selected. If you go to send tab and make a transaction, only coins that have been added to coin control can be used. You can click on \"reset\" button at bottom of the window to remove all coins from coin control at once. Take note that even if you click on \"Reset\" button, the frozen coins will be still frozen. You can select any of UTXOs you want, right click and select \"Fully Spend\" and then \"Send to address in clipboard\" to make a transaction using selected UTXOs and the ones you have already added to coin control. Take note that if you make a transaction in this way, your transaction will include only 1 output and there won't be any change. Obviously, \"Send to address in clipboard\" button doesn't work if you don't have any bitcoin address in your clipboard. Don't forget to check inputs of your transaction before broadcasting it to make sure you have selected the correct UTXO(s).",

If you have frozen some coins and you click on \"Max\" when making a transaction, you will send the coins that have not been frozen. If you want to make a transaction sending all your fund, go to \"Coins\" tab and unfreeze all frozen coins.",
