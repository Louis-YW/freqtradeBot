If the money comes from a scam, you will be an accomplice in Bank Fraud which is a Federal crime in Aussie. You can get 10 years in prison. Same time scammer is probably in India or Pakistan and wouldn't get 1 second of jail time.",

If you want to do anything like this them you must use an escrow for it so that you will have the assurance of getting your funds or take the risk without escrow and lose all the fund. This is a faceles forum and anything we are doing, we need to be very careful and act smark if not, we may regret our actions. Very soon you may start getting dm from random persons claimimg to be from Canada. Do not agree easily but scrutinize the person so you can be sure who you are dealing with.",

How do you think an escrow will play a role here?From what op said he needs AUD account operator who is to receive money to that account, I believe escrow plays major roles were two parties are exchanging different items be it currencies. That's, Mr. A needs 200$ worths BTC and has ETH worth $200, while Mr. B has the equivalent in BTC, now Mr. A gets an escrow were he needs to send his ETH worth $200. Then Mr. B will now directly send the BTC worth $200 to Mr. A after confirmation then the escrow will release ETH worth of $200 to Mr. B. Note the escrow can come from any side depending they are providing a reputable users to escrowed the fund.In op's case I don't think anyone can play as escrow here since the money is to be sent directly to someone account through local bank.",
