      "body": "It is important to approach price predictions with a healthy dose of skepticism, as they are often based on speculation and cannot be guaranteed. While it is possible that ETH may continue to outperform BTC in terms of price increases, it is difficult to predict the exact ratio or timeline of these changes. It is important to focus on long-term investment strategies and consider the fundamentals of the underlying technology, rather than short-term price fluctuations.",

Everything has a possibility, but regarding Ethereum (ETH) that will surpass Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of price increase per bull market it is very difficult to happen, mate. As we know that currently a lot of L-1 projects are being developed, such as Aptos (APT), Oasis Network (ROSE) and others. Of course because of this, the MC in crypto will be significantly divided which causes an even increase, except for Bitcoin (BTC) which is The Godfather of crypto.",

You are right about that because if someone is going to look at the percentage gains, ETH did really an amazing run from 2018-2021. That's a lot of percentages that we've never seen from it. But anyway, everybody is free to choose and we're all telling that someone has to take BTC and have it for the next bull runs because it is the future. While we're also learning from different altcoins, it's noticeable to see that there have been alts that have been good as of the moment but lack development in the future which made them like a nuisance project and eventually forgotten and died.",

But the ratio speed of pumps per bull. I remember 2018 when ETH was less than $150 but ETH takes two weeks to a bull market. If somebody should be wise enough ETH would be the next 28k dos. It can be easily noticed when low market cap coins like ethereuem make a price movement and at the moment that could be noticed in the price of ETH which is already close to 2k price, but then it is not surprising at all since bitcoin already break every market bearer for other coins to follow. The only problem is when there is a market correction, its impact will be deeper on those altcoins and their drop will be at the same speed as the pump so you need to know that altcoin is a pure gamble, no doubt ethereum has done well in the market but then ethos still in the category of altcoin not to be compared to Bitcoin.",

There’s a huge movement for ETH and its pretty bullish but again, Bitcoin is Bitcoin and ETH is not meant to surpass Bitcoin, and there’s no way for altcoins to do this not unless Bitcoin started to collapse especially on its dominance in the market. ETH will remain to be on top, and be a leader of altcoins, bull market will benefit ETH and we might see a new ATH for ETH, better to have some now before it gets more expensive.",

NO, because it was not the only basis that we would think it happen. No matter how much the ETH pump, Bitcoin will remain the number 1 among crypto.

ETH network may grow but I am also on the side that it won't surpass the popularity of bitcoin. They have different usage among crypto users, but bitcoin will still be the first to be recognize by people as cryptocurrency.It would take time for newcomers to understand how ETH network works, and what is the deviation of this network from bitcoin.But in any case, we are grateful that both networks are existent today. We can simultaneously utilize them depending on our needs.",

In normal crypto session 30-32 Eth equal to 1 Btc but in bull season we have seen that increase in Eth price is higher than Btc and i noticed 20-25 Eth equal to 1 Btc price. We cannot say that ethereum will surpass Btc but according to previous experience investing in Ethereum will give more benefit than Btc. Only problem with ethereum is now its migrating to proof of staked and Btc still proof of reserved and decentralization of Btc is more than Btc which will not Big whale to sell Btc and invest in Eth which was possible before migration. There are so many fud i read in some articles about ethereum after migration. 28k is very big number and big money will be injected to Eth for reaching 28k. I think there is possibility of hitting 5k when Btc will hit 50k and 10k above when Btc hit 1 trillion. In crypto space everything is possible and Ethereum is Rank: 2 coin but apparently its not to happen in three years.",

I believe this will not happen again, you need to consider a lot of things back like the market cap of the whole cryptocurrency market, and before altcoins is not that so high in dominance against Bitcoin, Ethereum got most of the market cap among the altcoins market cap compare now.Speaking of whether Ethereum will surpass Bitcoin, I don't it will happen, market cap says at all. Even if you try to combine all altcoins, the market dominance of Bitcoin is extremely far.",
