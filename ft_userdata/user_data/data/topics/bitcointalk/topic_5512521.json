We need further details to understand what exactly happened because the warning message is just a precaution to prevent you from making mistakes. It does not necessarily mean that you sent coins on the wrong network. If you look up your deposit address on a block explorer like mempool.space, it should tell you if your funds were received by Coinbase or not. You should also check your withdrawal history at the casino to see if sent your coins to the right address.",

I can still understand if I made a mistake when choosing a network (for example, the USDT network of Ethereum and Tron), but here is the case. I strongly recommend contacting the technical support of the exchange and casino so that they can consider this problem and give specific steps to solve it. Money cannot just disappear.

But the thing is, this is a rule, and they have warned and emphasized this to users before. If the user is wrong, the user is fully responsible and they will not help to get those bitcoins back even though they can do it easily.This is the rule of most centralized exchanges for all coins, not just Bitcoin and Coinbase, and if we are careless, we will pay the price for our actions.Yes, the only thing OP can do is contact the exchange support but I don't think they will help him since that is already the exchange policy. I have met some people in the same situation as OP on other exchanges but it seems they can't get their money back either.",

Is this new?https://postimg.cc/JtvgzRVJThere is nothing here mate, that warning is usually there for all withdrawals or deposit of cryptocurrency. This is at times doesn’t matter to bitcoin network except when the exchange actually accepts two or more bitcoin type of address. For example if coinbase only allows withdrawal to legacy addresses only (address starting with 1) then you need not to copy any type of address form as receiving address other than that starting with 1 otherwise you might be at the risk of losing your funds. But if you’ve been sending to this particular address before then it is the network. Coinbase are fond of using low fee to send transactions so there is high possibility that the fee is also low this time therefor hindering the possibility of getting the transaction confirmed fast. How to know if it is the network and copy the transaction hash and go to mempool.space or any blockchain explorer and see the details of the Transaction to see if it is still pending or not",

However I could remember a female friend of mine that lost $250 because of a memo tag. Earlier this year or some months back ToN network was free when you want to use it for USDT or BTC transactions but after some time they added charges to it, (whichmeans in some exchanges you can no longer use it for free). So she sent usdt with ton network but she didn't include the memo tag and the transaction was stocked and she didn't know what to do. But I told her what and what she could do to get back some of her money. Am just trying to say that whenever we want to make any transaction we should be careful so as not to send it to a wrong address.",
