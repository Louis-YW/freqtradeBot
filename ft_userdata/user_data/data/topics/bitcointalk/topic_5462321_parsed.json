At a game where the odds are 43.3% for a win, 8.7% for a push, and a loss is 48.0% this is very strange math.And this is not the only time this happened. I often lost 60-70% of games, while I should lose 48. In other words, it is definitely not a fair game.And back to the topic, this is exactly what triggers reckless gambling. They will say, oh the odds even out in the long run. Yeah but if you ALWAYS start with 60-90% losses, and I mean always, it doesn't matter if it evens out in the long run, because after a couple of hands you have already lost all your money.",

Gambling addiction cannot be guaranteed, but we can only feel that gambling addiction has arrived. And because of that, we must be careful when playing gambling and be able to recognize if gambling addiction has started to interfere with emotions that are starting to increase.Becoming addicted to gambling can also come when we have not been able to win a gambling game, making us more curious. That can trigger us to use more money even though we don't know whether, with more money, we can win or still lose.",

Players who have experienced money from gambling wins will not all be complacent and will continue to gamble. That is, the basic goal of trying to play gambling is to find out the ins and outs and usually a player like that can decide to stop playing when he has got what he wants.This does not mean that not all players can forget about gambling.",

I think addiction starts after you win, even if it's just once, that's when you start gambling recklessly and you also start betting higher. Yes, it depends on the perception and perspective of each person, my personal view is that someone can be addicted to gambling without having to win the game, let's say he does 100 spins on the gambling machine and gets several wins but also loses more, so he doesn't have to win also they can get addicted because they are definitely curious about getting that win.In the end they continue to play gambling until they get the win they hope for but the result is a loss, they can also experience addiction when they get a win, just like when new casino users will read player behavior for example new accounts are very often lucky to get wins so the casino knows that gamblers will come back again to gamble to get even bigger wins. that's how to react to gambling, the most important thing is to just control playing gambling so you don't get addicted",

I think addiction starts after you win, even if it's just once, that's when you start gambling recklessly and you also start betting higher. I also think that there is nothing to bring you to becoming addicted when you have lost money except when you have lost in an offline casino and there have been people around you,so you feel the need to come back here and win back the lost amount which is the first step of addiction,this is because of our personal pride,luckily very few persons who were born 1990 and after go to such casinos nowadays so the risk here is small.In playing online gambling when you lose money there is a higher chance you quit rather than go back to play and thus risking to get addicted,no one watches you when you are playing online so the level of the pride is really low when we lose money,I agree addiction starts to come as soon as you win a nice decent substantial amount of money.",

If you bet and you don't win anything, you find it boring and you don't feel like playing. Even when you've been betting for a long time, something similar happens. If you go on a streak where you don't win, you get bored, but if you start to win some small prizes, the excitement rises.",

Nobody likes to lose, and it's precisely because nobody likes to lose that when people lose they play even more to recover everything they lost.and with that they become addicted to gambling, people start to isolate themselves from the real world, they get depressed due to many defeats, that's why even if they won they wouldn't stop playing, because they want to win more, games should be seen as fun, something people look at and know I'm going to bet 10$ and if I lose it's okay and in the next game don't think about the 10$ you lost, don't bet for revenge and don't bet to recover the 10$, go back to bet 10 $ as always",

You're right winning can trigger an addiction for gambling is a bettor gets carried away by their winnings and forget the risk involved thereby staking recklessly to earn more that's when the person is likely to become an addict, but that's not the only criteria for gambling addiction because there are people are addicts today,  I've come across one or two that says that they barely benefit from but continue because they don't want to lose out completely and would keep trying until they recover what they've lost in gambling. Now that is one of the major reasons why there are many addicts presently not knowing when to quit, before you go into gambling you should already we are of it's risk and winning is not guaranteed so if you lose and refuse to give up you might end up losing more or spend funds meant for other important things, people fail to acknowledge their lose and try to recover I thereby losing more, in my opinion you could quit for a while restrategies and try again later.",

I think addiction starts after you win, even if it's just once, that's when you start gambling recklessly and you also start betting higher. And if you won early, that's what we call \"beginner's luck\", and actually it's a curse, because ones you taste that feeling of winning big, you are going to look for more of that experience, the adrenaline and that's what makes you a gambling addict.On the other hand, I also do believed that you can be addicted as well if you haven't won any yet. Why? It's because you want to come back for more, try to chase your lost and recoup everything. So gambling is really very dangerous, as both losing and winning in the beginning will have a dire consequences in the end.",

Some people have argued that it is like a welcome that casino do to attract you into playing more but I doubt that is the case. I believe it is just a coincidence that it happened and not like a manipulation. But really it is attractive to play more when your first game appears to be a win it gives you more courage to try another bet.",

That's true. You wouldn't expect someone to get addicted after repeating to fail every time, would you?You need some wins, preferably balanced with losses, so that one time you lose $100, next you win $200 and then you again lose $100. After a month you'll be at 0 but you will still remember that time when you won $200 and will keep on trying to repeat it. Gamblers who keep losing usually don't get hooked but discouraged and grow a feeling of resentment towards gambling.",

Well, I think gambling addiction goes in both ways this is because even when the gambler either winss or loses their both could lead to addiction or all depends on how the individual decides to handle the whole situation and what matters most is if and when the player decides to chase a particular direction be it losing or winning that drives him into possible addictions,  I have a personal view that in every winning there is always an ln extra two games ahead even if the gambler has earlier intentions of taking a break and in doing so,  is what lead to addiction because doing that consistently will tie the gambler down. Same as losing because when a gambler record a loss it is obvious that he will chase after that loses and in doing that, that is what leads to excessive gambling and if not checked could slide into gambling addictions.",
