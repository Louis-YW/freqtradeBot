Many altcoins are scam and they won't exist too long in the market. Many other altcoins are incapable to develop something that the world actually need so they gradually die especially with downtrend in bear market.Bitcoin is already a survivor after many years since 2009 and if institutional investors want to join cryptocurrency market, they must pick Bitcoin as their first asset. It has biggest trading volume that is perfectly matched with big capital from institutes.Dead Coins: How Many Cryptocurrencies have Failed?.Altcoins are dead coins, Bitcoin is a survival coin.",

So others will ignore no matter how good new altcoins are because they want some assurance about their BTC and when BTC prices fall, they always recover as we can see today.",

Even if Altcoin or shitcoin becomes dead or increases in number it doesn't help to grow Bitcoin. @OP it means it doesn't impact much or no impact if there are many altcoins being born or dying. Most altcoins are scams and it is likely someone develop a new product and resells it to the market it is likely a Fake vs authentic product but the original product doesn't drop in the price instead it increases in value while the fake one keeps declining.",

I think that having so many altcoins which are scams stops people investing in btc because they only hear of the horror stories with the altcoins and assume that btc or crypto is dangerous to invest in. That probably has reduced our adoption but I still think people will eventually understand that altcoins are just people trying to emulate the success of btc. There is probably only a couple of altcoins that are worth peoples time and they can be counted on one hand.",

Then people do not want to invest in crypto because they are scared that his will happen to them. This does effect bitcoin and it would be better if we only had altcoins which offered unique features instead of having 1000+ altcoins that offer the same features.",

I think altcoins are the best way to learn about crypto because most of them are worth nothing and you can make mistakes without big consequences. You cannot do the same in btc because it is worth something and will always be worth something. People can learn without these consequences and then when they are ready invest in btc and be safer because of their knowledge of altcoins.",

On the other hand, the existence of a wide range of altcoins may have also sparked public awareness and interest in the cryptocurrency industry as a whole, potentially leading to increased demand for Bitcoin. The presence of a diverse range of coins can also bring new innovations and technologies, which can benefit the entire industry and lead to a positive impact on the price of Bitcoin.
