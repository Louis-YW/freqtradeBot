The US/China flag icon will give you the control to translate the content of there website. Some words can not be translated like the banner since it is a picture and not in text format. I’m currently browsing it without a problem on my end. Google chrome too has an auto translate feature if you can’t see the translation button.The website looks like the typical chinese casino that is available on both ios and android. I play some them but on free version and the visuals of these games are very entertaining. My concern is just the reliability of this casino since they are chinese.",
