If you mean from the passive earning while you hold bitcoin? Crypto capital gains tax. You will need to read about crypto tax in your country to know about this. There are some countries that have the law already that you have to pay tax of certain percentage from the profit you make from your crypto holding. But that is only when you sell it. If you continue to hold it, no tax.",

In my own country, here the government has just implemented crypto trading regulations, so that people who want to convert their bitcoins to local currency on an exchange will automatically be subject to a 0.1% tax on each trade. It does seem quite a hassle, but due to regulatory issues people eventually get used to it.",

Maybe the country may have also subjected bitcoin as part of the resource for income revenues.So every damn transactions would be charged at this course as taxes because it's an registered assets just as the real estates maybe.I also hope that you don't misunderstood between taxes and transaction fees Op?",

Where you live is a most important part. I personally live in a country where income from foreign countries is not taxed. Crypto incomes also are not taxed. I have never ever paid any tax on any of my income and I have never had a problem. For example, the law requires you to pay taxes if you are self-employed but to be fair, no self-employed person pays taxes in my country, everyone knows that and everyone feels okay about that. So you have to act according to what are the laws and what applies in real life. This is my reality, yours might be different.",

I think people like the OP have doubts about such things, but they don't want to consult with their tax offices for the reason that they could suggest that they own cryptocurrencies at all - which can certainly be risky in some countries.I would describe the whole tax thing in the following way - if you don't trade through CEXs and it's mostly about smaller amounts that pass under the radar, why bother with all that paperwork. If you are a slightly bigger player, have KYC on CEXs, make bigger profits and buy houses, apartments, cars from that, then it would be logical to pay taxes - unless you want someone to take it all away from you one day.",

You may only get covered when it is about the non-custodial approaches, but when it is a custodial and centralised arrangement, you will be exposed. It could even be tough for the government to know if the centralised system is not registered in your country, but in the long run, what if you are a person of interest and you are later exposed? This could be sanctionable or jailable in many country's laws. The thing is that different countries have their tax laws as you stated but I've never seen a country that will exempt you from paying tax on investments, which makes it general.However, if it is a gain from futures trading, it is still arguably not taxable in some countries, which makes the whole thing complicated. Because if you buy and hold your Bitcoin and also trade it in the futures markets, how do they differentiate the income when they are lumped together? This is often possible if the centralised company is registered in your country and cooperates with the government, they will be able to issue the record on that to the government to know which income to tax and not to tax.",
