  "content": "GM crypto fam, a few days ago  I shared on this board some DeFi  Real Estate projects and the features they may have for the future. Some of you guys wanted more info about how it could work, improvements over current projects and also if there was a legal framework over this new business model. I recently read an article explaining fractional ownership on Real Estate, giving the opportunity for early investors to instantly sell and get access to liquidity. Also the article does reference to the legal implications on this new market, last, but not least, it also mentions that even if only 0.5% of the traditional Real Estate market moves to the blockchain, it will create over 1 trillion liquid Real Estate assets. For more info about it you can read the full article here:https://medium.com/@dwellfi/dwellfi-makes-real-estate-investing-easier-f0b8c97073ee",
