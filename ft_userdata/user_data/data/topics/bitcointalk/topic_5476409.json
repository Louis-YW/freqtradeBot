      "body": "This conversation goes all the way back to Hal Finney, who suggested that banks could issue currency backed by Bitcoin reserves sort of like the Free Banking era of the 1800s. Lyn Alden points out that this is the basic structure of our money already. A base layer upon which successive layers lose hardness but gain flexibility. Venmo floats on top of Visa which floats on banks which float on the Fed which ultimately is grounded by US debt (Treasuries). Look hard enough into money and you see the whole world is just floating on top of US Treasuries. It's kind of mad.So yeah, there's a good chance that future humans will rarely interact with real Bitcoin. Just like we don't pay for coffee with Treasury bonds, even if that's what ultimately is happening. The difference is that the base money layer would be a whole lot more solid with Bitcoin than it is with debt. But that's a whole other theoretical rabbit hole to go down.",

DonaldWe very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size.To detect and reject a double spending event in a timely manner, one must have most past transactions of the coins in the transaction, which, naively implemented, requires each peer to have most past transactions, or most past transactions that occurred recently. If hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions, that is a lot of bandwidth - each must know all, or a substantial part thereof.This is why the Lightning Network was developed so you can perform transactions that do not require you to use the main chain every time.",

Taproot allows for collaborative and privacy-enhancing transaction setups. Multiple users can sign a transaction and have their signatures combined into one, more compact. That, and the merging of multiple spending conditions into one, can greatly improve scalability. I can imagine a second layer solution, where 1000 users broadcast one Taproot transaction to open, e.g., 1000 lightning channels. (That example probably won't work with the current lightning software, but it's technically possible)",

That's what you get from his reply to Donald ? That it doesn't scale onchain ?\"Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification ( section 8 ) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.Satoshi Nakamoto\"",

Second layer solutions demand a main chain transaction, so it won't help. Even early adopters will be forced to move to second layer solutions.At this pace bitcoin is becoming a tool for the system it was created to destroy.Well yeah of course once Bitcoin is used a lot 99.9%+ of transactions won't happen on the main chain. And you seem to be confused about second layers if you think it won't help. It is literally designed to help this. With, for example the main L2 solution currently, the LN, you can do a single on-chain transaction and then do many off-chain transactions, potentially thousands. So of course doing thousands of transactions for every single on-chain transaction helps!Yes EVERYONE will use higher up layers in the future. That is normal and expected. All financial networks work in this way. Higher layers are for efficiency, lower layers are for security. Anybody who has a bank account regularly uses the higher layers and not the base layer of the fiat system. Bitcoin will be the same, except you'll be using Bitcoin instead of fiat and banks.The base chain will only be used for on-boarding onto higher layers, and moving large amounts of money around. Think about it this way, if we're talking about Bitcoin being used on an everyday basis in a way that can completely replace your use of fiat: you do a one-time onboarding transaction to let's say the LN, you then get paid your paychecks on the LN, and spend money on the LN. You're spending your paychecks and getting your LN address refilled with each paycheck, so ideally you can do that indefinitely. The Bitcoin ecosystem will probably need other L2 solutions, and perhaps even L3 solutions built on top of those.Also lots of people just care about convenience, and don't care about having a decentralized self-banking currency. So many millions of people will probably just have custodial wallets in which the custodian does the vast majority of the transactions off-chain and the users never even hit on-chain at all. Everyone is used to using banks, most people are gonna prefer their bitcoin being used like they used banks, rather than bitcoin displacing banks, and so banks or crypto companies will hold their bitcoin and everything will be handled for them internally at these custodians or on higher layer networks between custodians. Layers, custodians, etc scales Bitcoin's 5+ tx/sec to thousands of tx/sec. The ecosystem is going to be developed so that people can avoid having to pay a ya know like $100 fee even a single time to hit the blockchain, cuz nobody wants to do that.The business models of the bitcoin ecosystem will be developed around users not needing to hit the chain and pay large fees. Thousands of transactions will be done for every single on-chain transaction. This will require a lot of building. Bitcoin is still very early stages in the grand scheme of things. Only a tiny bit of the eventual ecosystem has been built out or even thought up at this point.",

The points that OP raised, is super valid. The Bitcoin architecture itself is not enough for mass adoption. The network is simply not capable of handling huge amount of transactions. Lightning network is a side chain. But it also needs to broadcast the transactions through the main chain. If the mempool always remains busy, eventually the lightning network will have to pay higher fees while broadcasting.
