El Salvador has become the first country to make #Bitcoin legal tender! This was discussed yesterday on the thread: Re: El Salvador has become the first country to make #Bitcoin legal tender!

El Salvador bitcoin ATMs are not supporting lightning network before and they want to make it start working so that El Salvadorans can start making use of bitcoin lightning network payment. It is good to hear this.",

That's why I don't know exactly how much time it takes to withdraw funds from the BTC ATMs and what the procedure is. It would be pretty much the same as the fiat ATMs we are using. Anyway, we still want them to be implemented in our country.If this implementation of the lighting network is new in ATMs, then I can say that the transaction must be expensive while withdrawing from ATMs. Either way, I am glad that new improvements are happening, as this will increase the adoption rate. Because of more transactions, there will be more demand and more funds in circulation.El-Salvador is implementing the lighting network, which means they are preparing for the upcoming bull run in which their citizens will try to book the profit, this will give boost to the economy of the El Salvador.",

Thankfully it wasn't until a layer 2 was invented, I ment the LN which actually has got a lot of potential. They as in the government of Salvador, adopted and legalized Bitcoin for what? Getting hammered by high transaction fee! This is the truth nothing is stable and concrete as it looks.You are right there government being the first to adopt Bitcoin and then going through high transaction  fee is ridiculous. Wasn't the whole purpose of creating Bitcoin was to create an infrastructure which would dent the banks and make a local individual enjoy their benefit of financial freedom with  cheap inter country transaction fee The way things are going around I feel it would be a big problem in the future. Like Gold, Bitcoin won't be accessible to someone new to this system or a middle class. As we know already it is hard and not easy for anyone to buy Bitcoin without revealing yourself.",
