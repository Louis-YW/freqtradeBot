This tells me everything I need to know about you. If you start talking about prophecies and that you know why Bitcoin was created and all of that.. I’m better off not knowing your “very valuable” information, thank you. You pretend to be a mentor but you can’t show proof of how well things have been going for you.How long have you successfully predicted the market for? How do you know secrets of the world? Are you an actual mentor and knowledgeable person or did you try to just jump into the “hustler” hype train and hope people will come to you like fools and believe you know it all?And what is GOMEX btw? Never even heard of it lol",

How fortunate they must be to bask in the glow of your all-knowing wisdom.I can only imagine the wealth of knowledge and wisdom that I'm now deprived of. Truly, it's a loss for the ages. Hahahaha!",
