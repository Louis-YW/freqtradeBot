Part of this liquidity will flow into the crypto industry. Without this, there will be nothing to pump up the price of cryptocurrencies, it will not magically grow.",

I think that you must understand that if the bad impact from crisis was making crypto get less demand by the unique investors that frequently came to the crypto. There will always be a bad and good side from crypto. It can be said that if this time i can't expect something big from crypto until the crisis will be ended and peace will be coming back again. People are preferring to hold cash rather than crypto caused by it's not so volatile like crypto and it can be used in urgent situation as well.",

But as per investments, we both agree that bitcoin is better than sitting your money in fiat.The world is experiencing a lot as of the moment, coming from inflation and its being driven by the pandemic, war and other crises that's being startled somewhere else like in the FTX debacle. I expect things to be lighter soon, it won't be as low as this forever and it's okay since the crypto market just came from the top and ATH.",

Given the current momentum and interest, cryptocurrencies are growing profusely day after day, so I agree with you and OP. Bitcoin is a safer and more profitable coin in the long run and in light of the collapse of the global economy and the collapse of the crypto market, the solution is not to panic sell and hold Bitcoin until the next halving or until the market recovers. It is always difficult to give a price prediction, but I expect that the bear market will not last long, so we have to invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other Trusted coins and hold them in our wallets and wait.",

The output from the market is really unpredictable at this moment and i believe i just trust the process that is still going on in the crypto. The world economy has very big impact to the crypto. The crypto itself was following the stock market and that makes me feel disappointed as a few years ago crypto was not always following the stock market. It seems like that if we will be in the sideways mode until next year. You can expect a good thing from bitcoin but the question is can bitcoin go up when stock market was doing the reverse thing? The fud must stop to raise the interest and that will make crypto stable.",

He just said crypto and for the question if how long or how much then the answer will already depend on us and not on the market. The market can change from time to time but if you already now what you are doing then you can't be affected by it in a negative way.If you are in for short term only, you will sold your coins and make a profit just before the price dumps but if you are in for long term, you may skip selling for now but you will only hodl and buy more coins. Death of coins is possible but that can only happen for the most cryptos because they don't have a good purpose on why they are built. There is no point of hodling or using them.",

I would like to know about your expectations about cryptocurrency, please share your opinion.I remember that I got acquainted with cryptocurrencies in the middle of 2016 just before the previous growth. Yes, it was insanely cool because I was able to make good money. After there was another growth four years later, and now we entered the next cycle, which means we can assume that by the end of 2025 we will have another flight to the moon. These are my expectations, yes, I expect a new rapid growth, but only when the crisis subsides. As for money and cryptocurrencies, my personal opinion is that it is better to keep funds in cryptocurrencies, for example, in BTC and in fiat. Why fiat? The fact is that you must have fiat money for life, since you will still need to make purchases in the store, and as practice has shown, it is cash that becomes necessary when, for example, the electricity is turned off. I went through this and now I understand that fiat money is also needed. Well, for greater security, it is better to distribute funds for storage as follows: part in cryptocurrency, part in gold and part in fiat.",

When we have a recession, people will focus on fulfilling their basic necessities, they won't have the intention to put their money into crypto investment. But how about we have bullrun in 2021 (last year)? I believe everyone still remembered that we experienced Covid-19 pandemic at that time, the world economy was decreasing much, and stocks market was crushed badly. On the contrary, crypto market experienced bullrun, BTC made a new ATH and many altcoins skyrocketed. Isn't this the fact that crypto market doesn't fully depend on the world economic situation? Please let me know if there is something that I still don't know about this.  IMO, CMIIW",
