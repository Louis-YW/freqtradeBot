However,  you can just enter some addresses you have (like the ones you share here, which already have zero privacy) and see if you have some interesting satoshis.I think it is amazing to have a satoshi from this 10,000 pizza in my wallet, which traveled a long way before reaching me...You may also have some sats mined by satoshi himself, and things like that.",

Honestly, that I am not sure on how or what to do but if the website that OP found is helpful or useful then I would use it to know if I have rare satoshi and I think it will only let you know if you have rare satoshi and ensuring that you send the rare Satoshi is that I don't know as I have said earlier but if that's the case then it's better to send all the Satoshi if it's in small amount. Anyway, it is only \"what if\" about some people being a Cryptocurrency collectors that collects rare Satoshi. In short, I can't answer on how to ensure that it is the rare satoshi that I have sent if I found a buyer.",

I'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but as far as I can see you can only see that there are bits that have been use to buy the legendary pizza, you don't know exactly bit it is after a transaction, so there is nothing to collect here and it is just purely for decoration. I doubt you can extract those every single bit that have been used to the purchase. And well, we might all have rare satoshi that have been gathered for historic exchanges heist before, who knows?!
