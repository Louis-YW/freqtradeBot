In turn, institutional traders are usually not working on those days. And on the other hand, private traders, on the weekends also slow down their activities a little, to be with family and friends.In short, it is very normal on weekends and holidays for the market to slow down a bit.",

An exchange has a huge amount of coins listed and each project has its own private and public investors, and the project teams themselves do their own market making and add liquidity to make their coins perform well in the market. And private investors and project teams take their holiday every week.  But public investors and traders like us never spend holidays that's why every coin is traded every day of the week but trade volume is slightly less during holidays. I think that's actually  happens.",

Retail investors like you and me knows abot that and stop trading to avoid getting caught in the trap of a false breakout on low volume in the absence of the biggest players. Scalpers see lower volume so they also quit trading. This way, whether we like it or not, it's a weekend, even though crypto is open for trading, 95% of the time nothing happens. You can either deny it, or fight it, or adapt and go on a picnic with your family, touch the grass at least 1-2 days a week.",

      "body": "Quote from: cafter on March 12, 2023, 08:12:23 AMI trade bitcoin regularly.....Big and small candles indicate the volatility of the market and are caused by many factors such as high and low trading volume, volatility of price, market sentiments that are played by the news cycle, and much more factors on the list. Why are they big from Monday to Friday and small from Saturday to Sunday? Less trading volume can cause a big candle in working days, like traders from crypto markets and traders of institutional markets or from stock markets, all of them do trading in working days crypto traders are already adding trading volume, and let's say when in working days, things for stock traders go wrong and now they want to diversify their assets instead they sit free. So stock traders and financial market traders put their money in crypto to diversify their money to gain profits which ultimately increases the amount of trading volume in working days. which increases the size of a candle or vice versa. Another factor could be that Saturday and Sunday are relaxations in which most traders do not put much in crypto trading volume, for institutional traders. so overall, in working days there are more traders in the market which causes more trading volume and which increases the size of a candle in Monday to Friday. well, I must say that is good for overall markets because it keeps a pattern that normal and traditional person can understand and figure out when to put assets in the market let's say out of 100 people ten uses this (big and small candles behavior on weekend and on working days) as an indicator and try to avoid to put money in the market in the weekend which also decreases the trading volume and 1 more thing most of the big transaction are also performed b/w Monday to Friday.I also have a question why do these institutional traders not participate in the crypto market on weekends, while they participate on working days? maybe they are just tired of working the whole week and want to spend some free time for leisure. well, there could be many factors that I can relate but I must say there should be some survey done for this question too.",

During week days there are lots traders and learners who don't seems to understand the market very well ending up feeding the other traders while people like you who scalps enjoys every single moment of it.The institutional traders doesn't go on holiday during weekends, as a matter of fact, that is when most of them really engaged themselves the more but it depends on how you enters the market because you can't expect all days to be the same as last week. However, always try to use 30 minutes candle and 2hrs candle to determine your entry, 3 minutes candle or charts are always confusing so as a trader make sure to interchange the candles to foresee what would come next of the market. Although scalping is the easiest trading but it requires lots of capital to gain up with the short period entry or holdings.",

Othe than this we can even say a normal retail investor also is on holiday on Sunday so that also might effect this.",

On the usual, ofcourse they'd choose not to or to set some rest days just like if you're employed. They do tend to trade still but most of their time is just observing unlike during week days wherein they tend to gamble on some patterns because of a more active indicators. The second reason is questionable; news on my country does not pause on any day of the week simply because it is necessary for everyone.Best viewpoint here I guess, is domino effect. Most of the traders and investors chooses to rest on weekends to give themselves a break. This generates small candles since they are not that active.",

This is why always following these fundamentals or so called patterns wont really be that as precise but i cant really deny up that these kind of observationin between weekends and weekdays are really that indeed true but of course there are really times which it do really oppose on things on what should happen.This is where things make more challenging and wont be that simple.",

These people had also time to relax from crypto trading and spend time on other stuff like family bonding. That is why it was very usual to see the market movement if very low during weekends and holidays. But it was not the reason we feel bad about the situation, we can relax as well. Besides, it was not healthy anymore for us to do looking for money every day, so why not give ourselves a break and enjoy life?

Accordingly, many market participants are resting, which leads to a reduced trading volume and, accordingly, liquidity decreases. Therefore, many traders try to stay away from the manipulations that occur on such days.",
