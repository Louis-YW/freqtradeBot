  "content": "MOOX PROTOCOL is my focus today, MOOX on the Whitepaper offers 0.00943% of the balance of every holder every 5 minutes which is approximately over 287 times a day if that's compounded would accumulate over 2,017,700% APY on investment. So far the project has been running for 3 months now and distributed over $46,000 in $BUSD to Liquidity stakers also total circulating supply stands at about 1,096,000 and 19.15% has been burnt so far.After looking at these properties, one part of me say i should send my $5,000 in while the other part of me is skeptical, there's no better place to talk about this than the legendary bitcointalk forum. I need an advice what am i not seeing?",

      "body": "Non sense APY like that will be clearly hurting the token in long term. You shall have learned from what happened with SAFUU, DARTH, LANUNA. Those were just example of projects that offered non sense APY like that. Don't be so stupid to put your money in the scam token like this. You will lose your money in long term. The more tokens minted and the price will be less. Why don't you see how it was going down from $3,5 to the less than 30 cents? This will be going even lower caused by more tokens will be minted. This is pretty similar with shit token mechanism. Max supply was also so big. The future price will be the same like shit token or meme token",
