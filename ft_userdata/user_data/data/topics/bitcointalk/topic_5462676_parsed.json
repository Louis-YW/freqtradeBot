By the way, why do we need another rank anyway? Is there any flow in the current ranking system or it is not serving the purpose it intended to? Perhaps many new members do not know but there are some special titles in the forum like \"Donators and VIPs\". They are just some prestigious titles for those who donated 10 to 50 BTC to the forum a very long time ago. I am not sure if we still have any active VIPs in the forum or not. Thats a lot of money in the current market.",

It would be nice to have a debate on having  Immortal Member  and  Ultimate Member  as the next rank.Think about it @EarnOnVictor.",

What name would be better fitting?¬† My suggestion would be to name it  Ultimate Member .What's your take on this and what name would you call the next rank?I don't think that Ultimate Member makes any sense when we already have legendry rank members. The only good tag for such members that could be above legendry level should be Mythical, but I doubt that even that tag would make a lot of sense. That's why I think the current system of ranks for members is up to date and should not be altered to make some people more special than others.A new thing that could be implemented would be to have proper tags or texts on the profile of some members who have done a lot for the forum. Tags like Best-contributor, and Most-supportive are good one if such system is implemented as they can show that the members who have done a lot for the forum have been rewarded by the forum. But, I still doubt that such things are going to take place anytime soon.",

I don‚Äôt think we need a new rank, there‚Äôs already the 5k merit club and so on. Anyone who needs any more title can aspire to be the first to reach 20k merit.
