  "content": "I somehow randomly came across this article that discusses how the US based sandwich shop Which Wich ran a promotion selling these crypto boxes with coin tied to actual bitcoin value that could be used in stores to purchase food. As many of you know already and I know many of us here own some of these physical coins they made, but did anyone come across these crypto boxes or have one for sale?",

I've followed \"Which Wich physical cryptocurrency coin\" on ebay every since I found out about these but I've yet to ever see one of these boxes pop up on there.  I wonder if they even exist in real life, perhaps this just was for promotion purposes.",
