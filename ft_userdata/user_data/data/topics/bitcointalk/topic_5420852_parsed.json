And then it shows wrong values and no warning whatsoever that the shown values might be wrong.It didn't synchronize; more likely, it decided not to synchronize and just found a server that is can still connect to.Here, I reproduced it to see the logs after it's done with the endless sync attempt.First, I got bunch of these errors in a loop (or variation of such), one server after another:ERROR | interface.[random_server:port] | disconnecting due to GracefulDisconnect(RPCError(1, 'history too large'))After a long while, it looped through all of the available servers but wont initialize synchronization, just to find a server that still lets the connection through:DEBUG | util.profiler | HistoryModel.refresh 0.0000 secINFO | interface.[random_server:port] | skipping header 763103INFO | interface.[random_server:port] | skipping header 763103INFO | interface.[random_server:port] | could connect 763103INFO | interface.[random_server:port] | skipping header 763103...The \"could connect\" shows-up as the connected server in the client (so it's \"green\") but the history will still be empty since it didn't sync.",

I suggest try to switch to other server by clicking the green circle or change your device DNS to Google/Cloudflare DNS.",

Instead, as shown in the screenshot of my last post, everything seems to be fine from the GUI user's perspective (green ball in the lower right corner and no error message).I agree with you on this. Electrum messages usually don't let you know what's going wrong. Electrum usually produce a generic message when something is not right and you have to figure out what is the cause of the problem.But in this particular case, it's obvious that Electrum didn't finish syncing or something went wrong. On the to bar menu it's showing: \"imported, nur lesen \" and when translated it means \"imported, no read\". So it's obvious there is something wrong. And it didn't show any wrong values, it didn't show any values at all!",
