      "body": "Let me answer that question with a counter question. Imagine a situation where your campaign manager is temporary banned, and while they are in such a status, they stop all their management activities: counting weekly posts, answering questions, providing support to campaign members, and doing payouts. Many people are impatient and would scream scam, scam, from the top of their head if they had to wait a few days or weeks to receive their sig payments. Imagine how many questions and scam accusations we would have if no one informed the community that a certain member was temporarily banned if that person couldn't ask someone else to do it for them? I think an agreement was reached between two parties in this particular case. It involved posting that thread on a day where Royse777 was temp. banned. Since he will be back after a week to carry on where he left off, it's not a big issue. It would be a completely different situation if Royse777 was permanently banned. Even if that happened, you would still expect him to finish the obligations he had with payouts or escrows, for example, wouldn't you?",

But the question is, how would they know? Let's assume that neither the campaign manager nor the participants use Telegram or other external ways to talk with each other. The temp ban wouldn't permit the person to PM those in their campaigns, hence there is no way to find out. Temporary bans also don't get recorded in the sec log if I am not mistaken.¬† Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on January 06, 2023, 08:25:57 PMI've seen campaign managers delay payments for weeks without much complaint (Lutpin and lightlord immediately come to mind).¬† And you know why?¬† They're afraid that if they make noise they'll be kicked out of the campaign, so they put up with whatever unreasonable amount of BS that's thrown their way. That's true. It depends a lot on the integrity of the temp banned users, how much the community trusts them, and the characters of the people in their campaigns. Those that complain might not want to use their real accounts, but an undeclared alt account will suit just fine. This thread was most probably created by someone with other accounts on the forum. It was registered back in June and made only one post before this discussion. Why would someone with just 1 post altogether be interested about what a campaign manager is doing, the forum rules, etc.",

And it's, by far, not uncommon to privately invite a couple of higher ranked users (eg members of CM campaign) for such campaigns. Still, it's the first time I see somebody (temp)banned for this. Whether he mass spammed or not, I don't know and I don't want to jump to conclusions without facts.And even if it's one such PM, it is a problem, I won't deny the obvious, but I am almost sure the temp ban hurts him enough to not do this in the future.However, your actions on this matter and the way of seeing all this don't picture you in a \"Peace enthusiast\"",
