If you prefer web-based dashboard instead of mobile apps, there's also cryptocompare. Just a reminder that the convenience you're searching for comes with risks especially if you're going to connect your exchange accounts.",

Why do I say CMC is the best? Currently we have 2 major platforms for checking price data, market cap and other data. They are Coinecko and Coinmarketcap, but from these two websites, I prefer CMC because they present data faster than Coinecko (according to my experience).",

Because for someone which has a portfolio of 5 to 10 coins then it is not a big problem to check this information in a matter of minutes, something like this would not become a problem until a person was holding something like 20 or more coins, and in that case my focus would be on reducing the number of coins I am holding.",

I suggest you visit their website and the documentation page for a complete look of the features.A comment I made on another thread:Quote from: vv181 on January 07, 2022, 10:30:19 PMI don't know if @OP already made the choice, but I wonder why Rotki hasn't been suggested yet.The base application is fully open-source and it met all OP requirements:1. Adding Manual Balances.2. Adding manual trades3. Creating a profit/loss report4. Locally stored dataI do personally use Rotki, and so far so good to meet all of my simple portfolio tracking tools. So, @OP if you haven't decided yet, try to look around on that, see if it's a match.",

Usually I think OP will hold coin have been listed on exchange market, if difficult checking with CMC, I think you was right trough eitherscan but he needs to save and hold assets on wallet not exchange. I think keep faster and easy when checking assets holding on CMC, just use with how much assets saving and will show about values how much with the OP coin or token.",
