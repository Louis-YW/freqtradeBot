But gambling, no one needs anyone to tell them that gambling has harmed many already, especially if they do not apply wisdom to it. This still bottoms down to how you use your Bitcoin. If you use it for payment and investment, then you will always get to prosper in it, at least in the long run, but if you deliberately gamble with it, then that is no more the fault of Bitcoin but you who are taking gambling risk with it.In other words, Bitcoin is an asset and you get to gain through your asset if you know how to use it well. But gambling, it's risky and it's very easy to lose money through it.",

      "body": "I don't see it wise to compare bitcoin investment and gambling. This is because when someone decides to invest in bitcoin (investing in bitcoin is different from going into trade using bitcoin), if you buy bitcoin and decide to hold it for a long period of time until the bull market will come for you to take home some profit, even if the market happens to experience some bearish season, if you don't sell off that instant and still hold on to your holding until the bull run will come, I don't think there will ever be any loss that a holder will record. You can only record a loss when you sell below what you purchased, if, out of your carelessness, you lose access to your key phrase, or if you make your wallet vulnerable to hackers. But in the aspect of gambling, you will have to put in your money and try out your luck. If your selected game enters for you, then it's a win-win situation for you, but if it doesn't, you lose the money entirely, so the only option you have is to put in another amount of money, which you can use to try another luck if you can recover it or not, and the chance sometimes might be very slim.",

Bitcoin is in no where comparable to gambling because bitcoin can never turn in zero value when you invest in it. Just because of its volatility it could go down in price relative to fiat and as such when you sell during those period you lose some amount which is not what gambling is. Gambling doesn’t hold a single value once you lost because it either a profit or the other way. Only Alticoins or investing in shitcoins can actually have the same effect in cryptocurrency with gambling because most of the shitcoins usually turn dust over time. But a bitcoin remains a bitcoin",

      "body": "Actually both have downsides, cause we keep focusing on the \"profits\" which we're not taking notes on losses which will affect the expectation on the two. Investment and gambling is literally two different thing, they just similar into the money involved for you to start. If you started to invest your money, you could still expect a return even a small value depends on the market's volatility. While for the gambling once you lose the money, there's no chance for you to recover what you've lost only if you tried to gambling again and won it back, which is the negative side of gambling that might lead people to addiction, cause there's no guarantee you would won since it's based on luck. While in investment in Bitcoin, it would just differ on the calls you would do for you to profit or loss.",

This is different from expecting profits on Bitcoin from the investment you make. Losses may come from trades made because investment means expected profits in a short or long period of time.Of course, there are more losses due to gambling than experiencing losses due to bitcoin investments. There are differences in interpreting losses and profits in gambling games with bitcoin investments so that it is not wrong to tell people the differences.People who experience losses with bitcoin are people who use it incorrectly, for example wrongly and don't know how to trade and invest. Most people who invest long term will make a profit.",

Bitcoin is an speculative asset for which everyone knows that its volatility can do either positive or negative to their money. Whilst for gambling, it's commonly known that the house always win and that's why when you gamble, you've got either 50/50 chance or lower than that. To myself, Bitcoin has never done me harm and I have never thought of it that it will have that impact in my life. In fact, it has done a lot of good things and it's one of the reasons why my life has changed a lot, for real. And with gambling, I'm just kind of neutral on it. I'm not a compulsive and severe gambler so the impact isn't pretty much for me.",

Although it's a debatable thing, I don't think it's worth our time to ponder which is which and what are the distinctions. Gambling relies too much on luck meanwhile bitcoin doesn't, some might say that those who invested early were lucky but at that time, they didn't know the potential and they just bought in because they liked the concept.",

Although technically some would say that they should gamble on investing and holding Bitcoin, but it’s still not gambling but can be compared to stocks where you are also doing the same. Gambling brings you more addiction than buying Bitcoin. Whenever you have winning or losing streaks, you intended to bet more money to play until you are out of control and funds are running out. Buying and holding Bitcoin is much more of a safer route than gambling because even if it loses value you still have the same amount of BTCs in your wallet that could possibly gain when bull run comes again.",
