  "content": "While going through Carl Mengers' news letter on running a phone Node which he recommended for a time like this when running a full node is like owning your own keys.  A question was raised on the comment box about if its possible to run a full node using Android phones. At first I thought it was a silly question, but my instincts about the question changed when Carl Menger shared this link https://portaldobitcoin.uol.com.br/brazilian-teaches-how-to-run-a-full-bitcoin-node-on-an-android-smartphone-tutorial/    A blog that translated the Brazilian, Ricardo Reis, Tutorial of running a bitcoin full node on Samsung phone - dex enabled. He listed, an external storage device like HD or SSD with atleast 1TB memory space, USB Hub type C as the two devices needed to run Bitcoin full node on Android OS to enable a bitcoin node set up. My scepticism about it started changing and I was seeing more possibilities, then I further read. A pic he shared. The processes he share includes; Formating the hard drive Installing Termux Installing Ubuntu on Termux; then execute this Code:pkg upgrade && termux-setup-storage && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndronixApp/AndronixOrigin/master/repo-fix.sh > repo.sh && chmod +x repo.sh && bash repo.sh && pkg update -y && pkg install wget curl proot tar -y && wget https://bitbrasil.com.br/sh/ubuntu20.sh -O ubuntu20.sh && chmod +x ubuntu20.sh && bash ubuntu20.shInstalling Bitcoin Core on Ubuntu by executing this command on TermuxCode:apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt install curl -y && curl https://bitbrasil.com.br/sh/install-full-node.sh | shThat's all. Looking at the method and external memory which is capable of storing the Bitcoin data and the methods he displayed, I didn't have much doubt, but I think it'll have some loopholes on the pipeline.This is a video of Ricardo Reis process on running a full node on Android phone.https://youtu.be/IrM8K3XUYwo",

The phone must be able to detect the external memory device and charge at same time to maintain 24 hrs runtime. However, I checked the threads they're not same the other thread seems like the phone is not connected to an external memory device.",

If you look more carefully at the picture in the other thread you'll see that in the back of the phone there's an external HDD. So they're pretty much the same.Also if you look at the other solution's Git it tells:Quote from: https://github.com/smartm0use/smartino*It may be not recognized by Android. Please consider that Android supports exFAT/NTFS/EXT4/F2FS partitions up to version 8.1 (Oreo)You jumped too fast to the conclusion they're not similar.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on December 03, 2022, 08:03:06 PM... it makes very little sense.

Second hand laptop may be a bit more power hungry and nowadays electricity may be expensive in certain areas/countries. And Raspberry Pi devices are overpriced and hard to find (in my country there's only one official shop and it's always out of stock since more than a year ago).However, I agree, it makes much more sense as a fun project than something to use for long term.",

There's some docs for doing that. This completely removes the need for things like Termux, or any third party application to get it running. The UI is not very usable as it's just the desktop Qt UI jammed into a phone screen. There's also some issues with the phone pausing the app when it's in the background though.",

It's more like murdering your phone with poison which kills it slowly day by day.The battery health will degrade sooner everyday and performance of the device will start decreasing too.Basically phones are not mean for running a full node. We can simply run a low end processor to run a full node instead.The cheaper and convenient option would be raspberry pi instead. The cost of running it would be lower along with maintenance.Running things which are not meant for a device isn't cool. So the idea of running a bitcoin full node on Android isn't really cool.",

Some smartphones and single board computers may be too weak to run it, but if they are capable of running a node, I don't see a reason why not to. We know that weak ARM chips can power nodes, looking at Raspiblitz, Umbrel & similar, running on Pi 4's around the world. So it is possible.Let's say you have an old phone with 6-8GB of RAM with dead battery, that has no value anymore and is not used anymore, at least try to run Bitcoin Core on it, before spending money on new hardware.

Running a Bitcoin node in a standard way, such as with a RPi by following reputable OSes (e.g., Raspibolt), is going to save you a lot of time, and you're going to do it in the right way. If you an issue emerges, you can address their Github repository. You can of course try to install such OS in the Android device, but an untested and non-reviewed manner is prone to failure. And if we're talking about spending an extra $50, then I don't think it's worth it.",
