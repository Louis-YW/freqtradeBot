The place is known only by the early adopters of this forum and they won't let you go anywhere near because we don't want any newbies disturbing the memory of our prophet. Now go away in peace and forget satoshi ever lived here.",

Please tell me how I can find those posts.I have a recommendation about the discussion thread you made here about Satoshi Nakamoto, but I don't know if it's true or not about the people who provided the discussion in the first thread posted on this forum by Satoshi Nakamoto.
