Then I took half of my Hashing power out and put it in Solo mining while the other half stayed in the pool generating something. I know it is luck based but we use to average 5-6 blockchains a day.

If I do that, my hashing rate is running about 850TH/s. Not bad, but its a lottery. I don't live off the money so I don't need to generate money daily. Just curious what some of you would do?James",

With that hashrate, it is possible that you can become lucky like any of those unknown miners that mine a block.But if it is me, to even buy a single ASIC that is generating 110 TH/s is costly, I will not think two times to join a mining pool and be getting my income steadily, instead of going for solo mining.",

I've had a lot of block-less days without any blocks when I was mining and I never really had to shift away from the pool. The profits in the long run would be the same anywaysWhile that is correct, the long run has to be set to infinity for this actually to work out, but if a \"long-run\" that is a reasonable period of a few months or years, then the pool's payout will be very different if you mine to a pool that doesn't find a block for a whole year, there is no guarantee that the next year the pool will find double the blocks to make up for that first year if you mine on the same pool for a 100 years, it's more likely to even out, but that isn't practical.There are a few things you need to remember when thinking that all pools will eventually pay you the same, as difficulty increases your pool needs to ramp up real fast to cover up for the losses, it's like giving someone a loan without interest, the more the \"bad luck\" period lasts the more people leave the pool which makes things even worse, so instead of things breaking even next year, you could be looking at 3 years.Even if the pool hashrate stays constant, it will find fewer blocks as time goes on due to the difficulty increase, it just keeps getting worse and worse, it doesn't matter how you look at it if you are stuck with a pool that isn't finding blocks NOW, it's just a bad deal.This is the reason why > 90% of miners mine to PPS pools, it's not worth taking the risk, I rather pay 2% more fee and be guaranteed to get payouts than have to wait for a week, month, or a year just to save 2%, where in reality you won't save anything if the difficulty increases before you even out.OP:If I were you, I would point enough gears to PPS pool to cover the electricity bill for all miners.For example, 10 miners, need 100$ a month in total, and each miner makes 20$ profit.point 5 of them to a PPS pool to make 100$ to pay the whole bill.point 5 of them to solo to mine for \"free\".This way, all you risking is the \"cost\" of the miners, in fact, just the devaluation of the cost since you can still sell them at some point.",

Just curious what some of you would do?James In some other way, I understand that you are in a situation where you are choosing between continuing to mine in a pool and switching to solo mining. Here are probably some things to think about if you are choosing something. Actually, it is up to you whether you choose to mine alone. There is no right or incorrect response to this matter anyway; instead, the decision for you will depend on the particulars of your case scenario.If you choose to transition to solo mining, I advise you to do it gradually. You could start by shifting a fraction of your hash rate to solo mining; as you get more accustomed to the dangers involved, progressively raise the percentage. I hope this will help resolve your problems here.",

Though I know solo mining exists but going further and distributing the hash power to someone and getting those cents in the fees is just amazing idea right now. This can definitely set aside new income source on top of the solo mining right? Just one more question while I was reading this, whether we get the reward for the solo mining when we are also sharing the hash to let us say viabtc.com ? Like in the normal case I would be getting my fees for mining and they would be getting added to the account based on difficulty, hash rate etc. So if I am sharing the hash for getting those 7.0 cents per th, will it also take down my pool reward with it?

In any case it seems sharing the hashing power is best way to go for mining and earn enough money after the bills as compared to mining as an individual. I can't imagine the money they would earn if someone had entire farm of miners and dedicated everything for the 7 cent /th ?In short whether it is one income source or two incomes sources with this strategy when someone is doing solo mining?",

So I have access to them and the pool login. It's LTC mining but the point is the same.4 x Bitmain L3+ unitsFrom 1 Jan 2019 to today they have found 10 blocks on LTC PoolThe blocks would have generated about 150 LTC in total (less but using round numbers and quick math)They have gotten paid about 90 LTC in total from the pool. (OUCH)BUT of the 4 miners and 10 blocksOne miner found 1 blockTwo miners found 2 blocks eachAnd the 4th miner found the other 5.Is one miner better then the others. No, just had a ton better luck.That is the way luck works. Mining solo you could have the miner that found 1 block in close to 5 years. Or the one that is finding about 1 a year.So, bringing this back to BTC solo vs pool. You can have some good luck mining solo and the potential to be way ahead. You just have to be aware that the other side it true too and if you had that miner that found 1 block well then.....Yes LTC is a lot different in cost and difficulty then BTC. But the math does not change only the amount of money involved.-Dave",

Indeed, and to make things even more \"saddening\" we need to explain to those who don't know that with LTC things are A LOT easier, and here is how:LTC hashrate is 800TH, so 4 L3s get you 0.002TH which is 0.00025% of the total hashrateBTC hashrate is  475000000TH, 4*S9s gets you 56TH which is 0.00001%In order to have the same chances you would need 1200TH which is 85*S9, but then also, BTC average block time is 10 mins whereas in LTC it's 2.5 mins, so it's more like you need 340 * S9s to match the number of blocks with the L3 scenarios, of course, BTC blocks are worth a lot more, but then again, even with 340*S9s your chances of hitting a block are pretty slim, let alone 1 or 2.QuoteOr, as I once described it to someone, it's not lottery mining, it's lottery mining using lottery tickets that people already threw out since they did not win and you are going through that pile of old tickets hoping to find the one that was a winner that someone missed.That's a brilliant explanation indeed, might want to add this part to it \"The lottery organizer is getting very old and may die at any second\".",
