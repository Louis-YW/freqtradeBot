  "content": "Anyone experiencing/experienced a gambling disorder pls. feel free to share your feelings after losing/winning.Documentary Video of Gambling Addiction, the feeling and thoughts of a gambling addict | Documentary Video 1  | Documentary Video 2 |As the title stated, I stumbled on an article[1] published way back in 2021 and wanted it to share with you in case anyone is interested in how a problem gambler's mind works after losing his bankroll.  It was stated that losing a huge amount of money is a sign that we must stop our gambling activity but...Why do gamblers continue to bet even after they lost?With all the effort of planning, setting a bankroll budget, and time limit, gamblers tend to bypass this plan and continue gambling.  It was said that Gamblers specifically compulsive gamblers don't just gamble for money.  Since compulsive gambling is a behavioral disorder that alters the brain[1], there are more varieties of reasons and motivations to gamble.Chasing lossesQuoteIn most cases, when an addicted gambler loses, they don’t stop there. They think that they are so close to winning, that if they just try once more, surely they’ll win this time. This is a very dangerous mindset to have.They often feel a sense of panic at the amount they have lost, and are determined to gain it back. This is referred to as chasing losses.In reality, the odds are never in your favor. Relying on skill won’t get you very far, since gambling is not based on skill. If you continue to gamble after you’ve lost a large amount, you will only lose more, and it will result in deeper financial debt, as well as deeper guilt and stress.Post-Loss SpeedingQuoteGamblers often engage in “post-loss speeding” by placing another bet quicker following a loss because frustration from the defeat prompts them to try and win back their money. As a result, gamblers become more impulsive - instead of becoming more cautious about spending money, they become more reckless.How Excessive Gambling Leads to Mental Health DisordersQuoteThe amount of money that they spend on gambling often causes a strain on their personal relationships and can negatively impact their job performance and overall work life.In some cases, gamblers will go to extreme lengths to cover up their gambling addiction, and may borrow or even steal money from others. Gamblers tend to feel guilt and shame when they lose, which can greatly diminish their sense of self-worth. These intense feelings accompanied with problems that gambling is causing in their personal lives can lead to depression, and even suicidal thoughts. Problem Gambler often feels depression after losingProblem Gambler often ends up in depression every time they suffer loss.  They wanted to get out of these feelings which is why they tend to continue gambling to beat the house which is highly unlikely. With this loss chasing and Post-Loss speeding, they end up losing much more money than they can afford to lose.  They end up spending money allocated to households budgets, embezzling others' funds to the extent of stealing money from others.  This triggers family misunderstanding, friend disputes, and even crime.  Due to the problem piling up, a problem gambler often falls into severe depression and possible suicidal thoughts.Solution:Be honest with yourselfJoin a CommunityGet to the root of why you are gamblingGo to TreatmentRead the explanation here[1]You can also refer to this thread to know about gambling addiction its  signs and possible management:Tips on How to Manage Gambling Addiction an Open DiscussionThe characteristics of people who are addicted to online gamblingPrevention:Gambling in moderation or Responsible Gambling is one of the popular prevention of gambling disorders.You can also find the benefits of Moderate gambling in this thread[2] discussion.Differentiating Myth from FactThis thread[3] can help differentiate Gambling Myth from factsHere is the definition of a Problem Gambler to make a clear view between an ordinary Gambler and a Problem gambler.Problem Gambler is the person with problem gambling.Problem gambling is defined as QuoteProblem gambling is defined as gambling that is disruptive or damaging to you or your family, or interferes with your daily life.source:Problem gamblinga more scientific discription would be:QuoteProblem gambling or ludomania is repetitive gambling behavior despite harm and negative consequences.

What does happen is that when they develop the addiction they become more antisocial, at least that is what I have seen in various addictions, especially if the groups of friends they have do not share their addiction.Quote from: Strongkored on August 11, 2022, 04:48:41 AMFeelings will be even more depressed when the money used is completely exhausted because don't have the money to go back to chasing what have lost.They usually enter a self-destructive process in which for most of them the only way out is to seek help, which makes their addiction less of a hidden issue.",

No, we don't have. What we have right now is counselling for problematic gamblers to completely stop their gambling habits. That IMO is a better solution than just teaching problematic gamblers some risk management kind of stuff because once they got greedy and felt that they can win big time again, they'll completely forget this risk management thing and then they're back to square 1.

We don't provide any sort of tutorials to gamblers and accept them to be clever and intelligent enough to solve all their problems on their own.It is an extremely hard task to help a problematic gambler re-learn his ways, but helping him stop his destruction and those around him is somewhat easier.  I think the main challenge problematic gamblers face is the stigma around them. If only our society is quite open on these hard discussions I think problematic gamblers will be lessened as they will know that people is willing to listen to them if they try to get out what they can't say. That's what's lacking in our current society: togetherness and oneness. A lot of problems such as this one can easily be solved if people banded together and look for each other.",

But anyhow, most cases actually involved actively expecting something from their sessions, which shouldn't happen. The most that we could expect is that sense of fulfillment for being able to gamble, but nothing more than that.

But what if we losses again? then regrets will set in, or worst, majority will want to recoup and come back and play with their capital now in hope that they can duplicate and win again.And it will be another regrets, and if that is the case with me, I will completely stop for a while. For others though, it might be a different story, the addiction will be so tempting that they will have to find a way to make money and then gambling again.",

For example, gamblers typically gamble in order to pay for their expenses, bills, etc. while only a fraction of gamblers do such act purely out of entertainment. The former is most likely to suffer from addiction and bankruptcy. This kind of initiative is what we need in this forum- something free and open that anyone could speak.

Chasing losses could lead to gambling addiction especially if we can't handle or control our emotions.
