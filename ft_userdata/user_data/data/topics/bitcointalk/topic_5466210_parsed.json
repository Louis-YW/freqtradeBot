  "content": "Revolutionary derivative smart contracts for speculating on a wide range of crypto assets and experiencing futures tradingIntroduction:Suppose you had to open a long or short trade on your favorite memecoins at their launch. Now, thanks to the Bubble Futures Trading Bot available on Discord and Telegram, you have the capability to go long or short on any on-chain assets just 36 hours after their initial launch.Contemporary Challenges in On-Chain TradingThe challenge associated with on-chain trading primarily stems from low liquidity levels. Low liquidity can pave the way for price and funding manipulations, potentially causing forced liquidations. Consequently, market makers (MMs) often lack incentives to offer liquidity on-chain. Addressing this issue, we introduce the Bubble Futures Trading Bot as a viable solution.What Exactly Is the Bubble Futures BotMeet Bubble-Futures-Bot (BFB), an innovative derivatives contract designed to streamline short-term speculation on any crypto asset, utilizing an on-chain oracle. Bubble-Futures-Bot (BFB) comprises futures EVM-compatible smart contracts featuring a 36-hour expiration cycle. This innovative tool empowers traders to effortlessly take long and short positions on top-tier blue-chip assets or the latest trending meme coins, whether on Ethereum or any other EVM-compatible chain. The primary objective of BFB is to reinvigorate market maker (MM) participation, addressing their hesitancy to provide liquidity for certain crypto assets arising from low liquidity concerns.$Bubble Core FeaturesStraightforward Structure for Margin-Based Short-Term SpeculationDaily Closure Ensured with Guaranteed $USDC SettlementFinal Settlement Aligned with the Underlying Asset Price Oracle at ExpirationAbsence of day trading funding paymentsOpen for Creation by Any User, for Any Asset, Assuming Availability of an On-Chain Oracle for Underlying Asset Price ReferenceNo Borrowing Required for Shorting the Underlying AssetNote: Upon reaching expiration, the BFB price consistently resolves to the underlying oracle price, determined by the chosen settlement calculation method (e.g., 1-hour VWAP, 1-hour TWAP, EWMA, last-traded price, etc.).#Bubble comprises futures smart contracts characterized by a 36-hour closure cycleMuch like traditional futures or perpetual contracts, these contracts can be traded in both long and short positions throughout their duration. Any positions that remain open at expiration, without being closed or rolled over, will be settled directly back into the trader’s account as $USDC. This straightforward structure empowers traders to readily engage in speculative activities — whether it’s going long or short — on their preferred crypto assets, including BFB on top-tier assets such as $BTC and $ETH, as well as the latest trending memecoins!While perpetual futures have gained popularity as a means of crypto speculation, their complexity has often hindered retail participation. Bubble Futures Bot offers a more streamlined trading solution, making it accessible to a wider audience.Using Bubble Futures Bot as the first financial product offering (FPO) we encourage the community to provide liquidity to the lending pool just like users hold money in their banks ( while banks screw them up by making a lot of money on their money and rewarding them with almost nothing).As a trader: You’ll borrow funds from the lending pool at an interest rate of 3.6% for a 36 hour cycle to increase leverage on your trades which increases the chances of profits. Of Course the risk of increasing more is involved.As a lender: You’ll provide liquidity to the lending pool earning you 3.6% interest on your active lending every day. The problem with other decentralized lending pools is as the pool grows the chances of your funds being used there is lower. This is why our protocol prioritizes using funds from early lenders so they get the most out of the platform like FCFS.Price Oracles:Futures trading is all about betting against the pricing, this is why Bubble Futures Bot will use Chain Link price oracle on Ethereum Chain to fetch real-time prices from centralized and decentralized trading platforms.#Bubble is DeflationaryWhile many other meme projects operate on an inflationary model, Bubble Futures Bot stands out with its primary objective: buying back $Bubble tokens using 3% of the profit share generated from leveraged trading. According to our projections, the $Bubble token is anticipated to experience a deflation of approximately 30x within its fourth quarter of 2023.Transforming our Discord server and Telegram into a CHEX in under a minute.Now, our community members can trade and engage in trade discussions, all conveniently in one location.Kindly be aware that futures trading carries significant risks. The value of futures can vary, potentially leading to losses surpassing the initial investment. When trading such products, including those traded on margin, you might be required to make additional payments later. It is imperative not to invest funds you cannot afford to lose, as losses and liquidation are ever-present risks. Always engage in responsible trading practices.Mastermind Behind BubbleBotBubblebot is a flagship product of Dingdang labs.
