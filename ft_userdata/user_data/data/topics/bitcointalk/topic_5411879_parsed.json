  "content": "Basically anyone going into any trade no matter the part of the world that they may come from their intent is profit making from any trade they initiate. Right from the age of barter trade through to legal tender and now the world has upgraded to an age of digital asset still the intent of profit making remain constant for all traders and investors.Many persons fail to give importance to financial planning in same vein they do with profit making in their trades. The hidden truth here is that, the profit you making in your trades or investments can't be felt or recognized without a thorough financial planning system, and that is what makes the former and the latter inseparable (symbiotic) when it comes to building wealth.The world of digital assets, such as cryptocurrency have created an unimaginable opportunities at different  spheres for every individual to maximize and technically make as much profit as one can no matter your location and that's one of the beauty of cryptocurrency.Here a very few tips on how to create a financial plan for yourself.(I may not be a financial expert but certainly these tips has been working for me for long now).*Make it a rule to regulate your expenses, don't just spend all because you desire to spend. The more you give into spending based on desire, unknown to you it will turn into a habit. So therefore, look inwards and eliminate any form of unnecessary expenses.*Don't rush into any investment or trade without a safe financial plan. As this could save you from any form of financial wreck.*Endeavor to set a  financial target for yourself and possible means to achieving it and also create room for adjustments just in case of obstacles but don't keep your focus away from your target.Mind you, sometimes you may not hit your target, but not to worry, cause financial target helps you to have track knowledge of your financial growth within a framed of time.* This may sound somehow to some persons but I'll still say it anyway, and that is, Take your health seriously for it's only he that is healthy can think of making profit and financial plans. No wonder they say, \"health is wealth\". On this note, I say learn the habit to be reading books that's teaches on how to utilize the financial instruments within your possession to create wealth for yourself. Stop reading what I call anyhow books, for you are not an anyhow person.More ideas on financial planning are welcome as I believe to learn and benefit from you too.",

IMO, a financial plan is something like an answer to those questions:\"How much money do I really need?\"\"What rentability am I looking for each month?\"\"how much % of my overall portfolio should I be trading?\"\"What is the benchmark should I compare my portfolio to?\"You need to know where you are and where you want to go. This is financial planning.I don't think anyone should be all-in in trading strategies, neither all-in cryptocurrencies. Personally, I don't trade, and I am very satisfied with my portfolio performance as I am above the benchmark that is my personal goal. (My goal is about 5% over inflation per year)",

Quote from: Lida93 on August 31, 2022, 12:08:42 PMMind you, sometimes you may not hit your target,Yes, the idea is not to always meet the target, but to get really close. In setting very high financial targets and working hard and smart to try to achieve it, you will be surprised how better you have performed, much better than setting a mediocre target for yourself.High targets can encourage you to work hard.",

It is essential for us to have an idea of what we are doing financially, it can be a great asset to our success and of course, we really achieve what we planned for. You can't do a financial management if you are not planning your investments wisely. It is important so that we will have an idea if how much money we already put in or pulled out. It can help us minimize the risks that we are going to get. Failed to commit is worse than those who tried and failed.

That is not possible. In trading, it is always possible to lose no matter how organized or experienced you are but that's fine tho as long as your winning ratio is still higher and it doesn't make sense to continue if you arent getting anything, other than donating money in the market.",

If it were possible for most, they won't have seen even a single loss at all but, losses are inevitable in business. You win some and you loose some, its a fact. Even the richest men in our world today, have times when there assets reduce in value.Although, there are a set of people and am talking about the NGOs (Non Governmental Organisations) who goes into rendering there services in terms of aid without expecting any profit in return. They take consolace in the fact that, they were able to aid another needy individual and that is satisfying.For one to truly know how much profit or loss one has in course of running a business or an investment, documentation is highly important and inevitable. It takes into account what you might consider minor or petty cash but that too is taken out of a multiple of value. Planning gets you there and proper documentation tells you how fat and how well you've done. Them both are a necessity.",

I thought it was just entering a trade with a 25x-50x leverage and I'll be rich overnight, but it was way more than that. Capital is the most important thing in trading, because that will help you to decide what kind of approach you'll do to budget it in every trade you'll do to gain profits, because you can't just randomly put an amount in your trade without being aware on your balance, you'll go bankrupt that way.However, even if you have a plan on how you'll make this and that for this month, for example, sometimes it won't go that way. That's why trading needs a lot of dedication and commitment, once you go in, you can't back down because you want to make profits.",

We should take care of our health first and the rest will follow just like how you treat your wallet with care. Being a workaholic sometimes will force you to do things that you aren't supposed to do just like taking for granted about your own health. It's not bad to get to your desire or wants but when you lose sight of how you treat your body, it will eventually took it's time to let you pay for it.Trading should be fine as long as you do it moderately with care about your body and not just going full time almost everyday.",

Before, I was in good health, with almost no minor illnesses, but after a while, things suddenly went downhill too quickly and I started to realize my health was going downhill. I had to stop all previous plans to take care of my health. We all want to make a lot of money and have many plans to execute but we almost forget that a plan no matter how perfect without health will never be possible.Despite bad health we can also survive depending on the severity of it and the age. If bad health is because of old age then it means we should have had an investment we did in young age or what we have survived with when young and that why when young we try to use our strength, idea and ability to do certain things we can benefit from when old. Apart from old age, there are some businesses that we can hold on to even when sick depending on the illness though. I think online businesses can be of less stress and other businesses that you can employ someone to run it on your behalf.",

Then, there is this imbalance and anxiety that comes when the time is up running and you haven't achieved an appreciable percent of your set target. To some, this anxiety might cause them taking unplanned risks, either by increasing stake or leverage or by other means. When this happens, it could be a real build up to perpetual loses. I prefer trading at ones pace and taking trading as a passive opportunity and not the only job.",

As this could save you from any form of financial wreck.(.....)I can relate to this tip and most people also experienced this and made a mistake from this part.Some people that telling or doing some investment with the proper plan is like gambling, which they thought at first that those are investment act but they don't know they are doing it wrong or not expecting the other side effect.",
