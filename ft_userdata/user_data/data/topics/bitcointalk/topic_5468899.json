The coins are 50mm diameter stainless steel. 13 coins were made #1-9 are reserved. The character on the front of the coin is the crimson ghost from old 1940s movies, and later used by the punk rock band (the misfits) I just added my own touch to it. I will do some stuff like this from time to time I know it is not something everyone might like, but I am here to have fun making coins so that is what I am gonna do.

I don't think I would even be messing with a laser if not for him. He is the first to make cool double sided designed coins that were large, and the first to have off centered holos, his quotes, the not giving a shit what people think attitude and so on... he deserves a lot of credit for being innovative! His use of different metals, and his manufacturing process is next level the list goes on ..¬† I am certainly influenced by his greatness no doubt.",
