  "content": "According to this article, the Dutch Gambling Authority have awarded 4000€ to students for two Gambling Related thesis. Quote Leonard Delank, a master’s student at the University of Groningen and Newcastle University, wrote a paper on loot boxes; items that feature in many video games and offer players a random reward.In his thesis, Delank drew on the theories of 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant, who argued that people have a moral obligation to do the right thing.Ultimately, he came to the conclusion that loot boxes are not ethical. For his paper, the KSA awarded Delank €2,500 I think in the paper there were few points that were really interesting, most of the times physicians do categorize the gambling addiction into mental disorder but some might accidentally compare it to the OCD. Whereas it claimed how the gamblers who are addicted are 'too uncertain' therefore should be treated seperate from the OCD patients. Apparently the mentality lied in being sensitive to rewards, overconfidence, overestimation as well. I think it's a wise article and should be taken as a reference when any medical help is being provided to gamblers and at the same time gamblers should also take a note and understand the psychology better. Would you ever consider doing your research in Gambling?  https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/16389/ksa-awards-4000-to-students-for-gambling-theses",

Like something that can actually contribute knowledge to the gambling industry/sphere since there are already lots of studies with regard to gambling, in general.Like what you also mentioned, creating a thesis about gambling requires time, effort, and resources on your end. It has to be something worthwhile- something that will bring benefit to the public as it will definitely outweigh your personal needs for them.",

For his paper, the KSA awarded Delank €2,500 I think the article lacks important details for further understanding the awarded thesis. Why aren't loot boxes ethical? Maybe because some people win legendary prizes, while others win common, uncommon rewards? Well, people know the odds and still want to play by the rules. What is wrong with that? It's up to each person to decide to play or not. There is nothing moral or immoral on that, since there isn't cheating.QuoteChannah Osinga, a graduate of the University of Amsterdam, analysed data from 28 gambling addicts for her bachelor’s thesis....“OCD is in a sense the opposite of a gambling addiction. People with OCD are too uncertain,” said Osinga, adding: “They don’t trust their previous choices.Not every cases of gambling addiction are the same. The addiction can be a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder or not. There are gamblers who are constantly uncertain and fearful, with no confidence when playing, but they just keep clicking the 'roll' button, because they can't avoid doing this due to compulsiveness.The thesis has a point, but shouldn't be concluded as a generalization of gambling addiction theme.",

That is, if you are that dedicated to it that you will came up for a topic about it.In this case, without having the knowledge with the whole thesis, I think that they are not really directly discussing about gambling as they've mentioned loot boxes on games which may have similarities with gambling. As we know loot boxes or gatcha in games has their own risk since you will most likely to buy it with real money or even grind for it to gain rare items. The chances of these things are limited and with these rare and limited rewards, people are addicted to buying with having any certainty that they'll receive the items they like.As for the prize award, probably they have defended their thesis too well against other thesis projects which might be reason they've received that award",

The majority of poker table nowadays has built-in calculator about winning chance rate base on the players hand card and the open card in the table. It's really possible to apply AI technology to this kind of game since there's a fixed numbers of cards in the deck while the number of ways can be determined using math calculations. This AI technology can apply on other games that has same methodology of poker like Blackjack.We have no rights to question the thesis content since we don't have full knowledge on the main purpose of that research and what's the needs of the countries that awards grant on it. We have different preference so we should respect others research and stop saying garbage on others work. This is an insensitive remarks tbh.",
