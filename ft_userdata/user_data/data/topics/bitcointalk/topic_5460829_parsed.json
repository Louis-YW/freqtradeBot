If they were real and contained such massive amounts of bitcoin, they wouldn't have sold them in first place!If you want to waste computing power and electricity it is much more profitable and productive to start mining some GPU minable PoW shitcoins and dump them in exchanges for bitcoin. There are a bunch of \"whattomine\" websites that can guide you and also there is a altcoin mining board which you can read and learn more.",

Your computers will be infected if you try to open those files and crack them. Worse if you store your Bitcoin wallets in that computer, it will be accessed by scammers and they will steal your bitcoin.Second, if you want to test your method and computation power to crack a Bitcoin wallet, why don't you create a new and empty wallet by yourself and assume you don't know anything about it. Try to crack and find that wallet by yourself too.If you can crack your self-created wallet, you can test more as it seems your method and computation power is good and enough to crack Bitcoin wallets.",

It does sound lucrative to crack a wallet with thousands of dollars in it however it will be almost unachievable in the span of 10-20 years if you keep on doing it continuously with your GPU cards. Why not buy ASIC and use it for mining and generate Bitcoin from it? That will be far much better than trying your luck (at least in my opinion).",

Trying to crack a wallet that doesn't belong to you looks like a scam to me.What you might get: Your chances of getting scammed by those who want to sell tools to you will definitely be high.Â If you want to keep your hands busy with some cracking codes, go to the internet or any block explorer and get some random addresses with holdings. You can start from there. Since you might be too lazy to create a wallet on your own.",

Trying to crack wallets with a balance with a password that can be guessed, or at least knowing part of it, with the ease of predicting these words, is the only possible way, but the owner of such wallets will not sell them on the Internet for $ 100, while he can get more if he sends them to a specialized wallets restore team. all wallets that are sold on the Internet are scam or not worth the trouble of trying to find out the private key.you can provide recovery wallet services that provide the ability to crack passwords with some complex conditions but such service are managed by people who have good experience in this field and are reliable. even if you try to create such a service, you will not find much support.
