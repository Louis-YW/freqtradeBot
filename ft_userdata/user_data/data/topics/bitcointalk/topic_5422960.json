  "content": "Hey there,anybody out here who is interested in a full set of the History Series 2020 from Coldkey?The serial of each card is identical. (#22)I have the same serial even for other editions like Halving Series (#22 is the first of the silver variant).The cards are still fully loaded (approx. 0.07 BTC) and undamaged.If it appeals to anyone, feel free to make me an offer. Here or by DMIt is not a distress sale and I have no exact asking price. So please make an offer, anything else will be ignored.",

And 2 cards for the Halving Series.But this is not all! Just the sets that are mentioned in the OP!I got a lot of Coldkey cards, I tried to not skip any release but I don’t have an exact overview for now  Just wanted to start it of here and see if there is some potential. Quote from: owlcatz on November 24, 2022, 04:38:33 PMVery nice! Looking back, I feel lucky just to have a full set, (Mostly same serials, but some variations)... And still growing since I just received my latest Q2-2021 cards! Good luck, although I'm fairly sure it will go quickly!  Thanks owl. I want this set in good hands!!Edit:Almost forgot it: if it was possible I got the same serial on each card. Maybe a positive thing for a true collector!The Halving series had three different variants so it was not possible to catch each card with #22.But me and yogg tried the best, the Bronze variant has for example #122",

Before you auction them off as solo cards, maybe try to at least keep the \"mini-sets\". As far as I know cards were sold in 3 consecutive months with similar motvies from the same collab artist, right? Splitting these is actually considered a sin, so beware!",

That was my original intention.The collab artists - including you - have been changed quarterly, but if I don't find anyone (it looks like I will) I will just sell them individually... even if it breaks my heart",

I shipped them by the end of last week.I got every card with #22 when it was possible.  If there is real high interest in the whole set I will make some pictures for you, otherwise it will be auctioned in small batches  in the next few weeks.",

The 2021 are as I mentioned before in auction in the next few days. Got some covid cards and buyer funded aswell. I have all 4 bitbill commemorative cards aswell in #22.It's special with the Halving series cards. There was only a #22 there (and that's the first possible silver variant). But fortunately this is also in my possession",
