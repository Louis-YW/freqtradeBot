  "content": "It is nice to see new changes in the forum. That is, the administration is working even though it delayed.Though if this change was existing in the forum but I was not noticing it all these while. I saw it last week in the front of someone's name, written (OP). Example: Agbe (OP). I do not know if others are also just seeing it or they have seen it since the day of their registration. With this any comment the OP (author) makes, it would be written (OP) at the front of the author (writer). It is a nice upgrade/update if it is new.Â  In a community, Village or Society those who identify new changes very fast are always on the save side. That is they are conscious about the system. They follow the rules and regulations though nobody is perfect but to some extent they are conscious of the system. They observe everything plus movements in the system. We need more updates/upgrades that will make the system easy for notification, and communication. Thank you for your tireless, and active work in the community.",
