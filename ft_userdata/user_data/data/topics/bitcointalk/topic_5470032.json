However, it evolved already, then there is ETH being accepted and then the top altcoins. But still though, BTC is the preferred crypto, a deposit and withdrawal address is fine without going to mandatory KYC.But then again, when crypto casino started to grow big and then becoming a billion dollar industry similar to land and fiat based, the so called regulators started to take noticed and as I have said, we know have mandatory KYC specially if you win big.
