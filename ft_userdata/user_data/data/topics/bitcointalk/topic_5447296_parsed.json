That makes trading to be riskier and it can result to a poor mindset that will not offer anything more than losses. Do not depend on trading.Even if you have work that you are doing, only use little percentage of your weekly earning for trading, not making it to affect your financial or family financial life.",

Trading is a very risky affair, you often end up screwing the whole capital a lot of times. Even if you don't end up blowing up full, there are very good chances you will never be profitable, for this whole time then how will your survive? How will you feed yourselves and your family if you have one? It's like gambling with every last bit of penny left with you. One need to understand that first of all trading needs capital. You can't do trading without any capital. Second you need the right mindset, just earning quick money mindset is the worst mindset to make money in trading. Thirdly you need to have extra capital to dive in the market again if you blow up the first account. Jobless will not have any of these even if he has good skill set of trading.",

Because you will always want to go back home with profit every single day, and not just profit but profit that can handle your daily needs, which will put you at a higher trading risk since the higher the risk, the higher the profit.  Am not entitled praying for bad trade for any one but this is the worst mistake any one can ever do, putting all his life and others entirely on trading. That person might even end up not having anything at all at the end of the day, that little savings which he have saved and accumulated and decided to start trading with it, will just vanish before he will even realize it.",

The crypto market is not as friendly as having a bull run all the time, it has its bear market which is very unpredictable. Nowadays you can see people saying the bear market is over but you will be surprised that after a week the price will plunge to $23k. (Just my example of an unpredictable market) Becoming a day trader is not easy so I hope they won't leave their job and focus on day trading.",

Yes, it is worth trying in order to know if they can really take the risk and carry the stress. Anyways, so many online jobs were available at this time and the only thing we do is to choose a kind of work that we think we can perform well and in our comfort zone. But it was not just the option, if we have money enough to run a business, that is also a great idea.",

I believe, having a regular job is still better, trading is too risky to depend on.",

It's slow moving and you'll literally have to wait for a few weeks to turn to a meaningful, livable profit if you aren't trading huge amounts. It's still better to get a job, take what's left of your money after everything is already accounted for, then start trading. Doesn't have to be full time, you just have to know what you are buying, when are you buying, and when are you selling. A lot of users can attest to this, and it's easier to build up your money this way because you'll always have something to cover for your expenses and necessities.",

The truth is, you need money to buy decent PC. You can't efficiently trade by using your phone. You also need some money to start. Trading with $100 will not be very successful since beginner traders often are at a loss and even if they can earn some money 1 month they will probably lose some the next one. It also requires some basic knowledge and psychical predisposition to trade. The more scared you are of losing money the worse you will perform. You need to be calm and calculated.If any of you want to be a trader, especially in crypto, be aware that more than 80% of traders lose money. If you're at 0 profit after a month of trading you're doing better than the majority!",

New trades can be taken easily by someone but reviewing them and extracting profit from there is very difficult task. Many skilled traders often lose big while an unskilled trader has more risk. Profits and losses are normal in trading. A trader needs to have knowledge about many things. He has to have knowledge of world economy, politics at all levels. A man can trade even if he has a job but fails to trade even though gives up everything. A trader needs to be knowledgeable in all relevant matters first. One should not leave everything and rely only on trading. In this case, there may be a big financial crisis.",

Trading cryptocurrencies involves great risk as well, so a person would need to take all the steps very carefully.Though it's right that a day trader's life is pretty good and full of freedom and free time for friends and families, it is also very challenging as it is not always that easy to earn profits from trading on a daily basis.",

So it always good to have a regular job or business as a source of income. Then do sideline trading while on it.",
