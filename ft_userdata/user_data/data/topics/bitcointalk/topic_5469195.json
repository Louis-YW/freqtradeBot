During the COVID-19 pandemic, that was when the work from home increased and today virtually all businesses now exist online, some creating different apps to make you comfortable patronizing them, of course the competition is high even among casinos and they are creating different features to keep winning new gamblers and retaining old players.",

If it was possible for gambling developers to have access to the wide markets  of apps, I would bet we would see more development for APKs in order to play in a more comfortable interface for us who hold our phones with us most of the day.Still, credit to credit is due, there are casinos which have a very good mobile/browser version for their webpage, so they do not need to focus on APKs (which are a target for scammers as well, through digital counterfeit and phishing). Stake being one with the best mobile interfaces",

And the governments today are looking to give each citizen a digital ID, they will need this ID for regulations before they can likely proceed with their plans from consumer protection to tax which I doubt people will subscribe to get a digital ID. The current developments seem not broken so it may stay this way for a long time where users just use browsers even when they are using their phones.",

The development related to gambling is already on top-priority and a few casinos offer really valuable and entertaining games that the gamblers love to play. The mobile gambling applications are good for those gamblers who want to place bets on the go, but I think they aren't that good because they can be the cause of gambling addiction and an addict may use smartphone most of the time to place bets and waste his/her time on such applications by leaving other important tasks. Still, I believe that those mobile gambling applications can be useful for those gamblers who want to spend sometime by placing bets. But, the user must have to be careful while using those applications as they may have malware in them which may compromise the devices of the those gamblers. I would always recommend to place bets on a casino's site instead of downloading their applications.",

That online casinos should have mobile apps for more people to access? ‘Coz if that is, then such thing has been long existing in gambling industry. But with crypto-based online platforms, that would be hard to put into reality. Also, gamblers in web3.0 prefers playing in website because games in applications are more prone to cheating; recorded matches and forging of results. There are online casinos which are having mobile applications but those are ones which are registered. In my opinion, developments for gambling industry should include accessibility across countries ‘coz some players are forced to use VPN just to play to their favored platform.",

Therefore, there must be some developmental strides in this modern day technology to match the evolution. Same applicable to casino. Casino business took the swipe over the physical gambling during the COVID period when there was no movement. This was made very possible through bitcoin and Crypto currency and ever since the inception of the digital casino there have been lots of development in the gambling industry with big names competing with each other to remain in the mainstream while others lag behind.",

While the gambling companies were so astute to taking advantage of the internet spread they also took quite another impressive advantage of the covid-19 pandemic situation to expand the online gambling market. For it was as if they were prepped for the covid-19 providing every available means and features online to pinned down gamblers and prospects who were all seeking for a way to have fun and get entertained away from the boredom of the covid-19 period. It's so obvious to note that there has been an astounding use of online gambling since the post covid period all thanks to the internet. Arguably what the government can do is to input regulatory policies and measures to this unprecedented level of online gambling success to protect gamblers from undue conditions from  gambling companies.",

We do know that this would really be always in connection with that simply law of supply and demand on which if there's really that a demand for gamblingthen expect that companies would really be continuing on launching and those oldies would really be continuing on progressing and adding up more options and other things which makes interestand recognition do even become higher.As for gamblers perspective, the higher the competition then the more advantage for us because we could really be having those lots of options or thingsthat we could really be able to deal with on which its a pro thing but for those business owners then having lots or tons of competition is one of the risks thatthey would really be needing to face on.",

Because the app's data size might increase to an extent of lagging the operation of my device. Though, it helps gambling on the go, just like any other app. Op would have suggested few app based online gambling. I've also experienced some telegram based gambling activities. Yet it doesn't seem convincing to try such gaming. From the very observation of the gaming niche, lots of players do it web based not via app. With each user's different opinion for their preference. However, his statements are unclear to me, I'd say that despite the uncertainty of what he wrote about, it centers at online gambling. The government is also regulating online gambling, not for its widespread alone. But, to keep control of the kind of people involved in gambling. Underage gamblers. Addicts and cheats, contributes to some of the reasons people are asked for KYC. And other regulatory moves. Hence, the speed in growth of internet users, have flooded the online gambling sites with lots of irresponsible players. Making the regulatory process more difficult for the government. Countries like Australia, try had to keep check on the online gambling sector. Such as to save her citizens from addiction and bad gambling conduct. Following its importance and portability to the gambling society, we expect more players to adopt online gambling. Thereby, creating a huge gambling market, depending on the growth of internet users. Which we know expands everyday. The easy gambling at home process, have made lots of players get so attached to gambling activities. And it pose as a disadvantage.",
