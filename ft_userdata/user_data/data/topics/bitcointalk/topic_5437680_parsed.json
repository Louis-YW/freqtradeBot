I can remember that 1 1/2 - 2 years ago there were often bugs or you were disconnected from the connection and thus left some chips.   That would be very counterproductive in this case.I would be happy to see old faces here.

Since I have already played in several poker tournaments on Bitcointalk in the past and always had a lot of fun, I would of course also participate in this series (if my time allows it).  Quote from: cygan on February 01, 2023, 07:17:46 PM~Thanks for hosting this @cygan & @icopress and lovely Icarus cards ofc. You guys really manage to create awesome new collectibles pretty fast. The collectibles community is striking back stronger than ever. I love to see that, amazing!Quote from: seek3r on February 01, 2023, 09:34:55 PMI think that 1mBTC would be feasible for everyone. I wouldn't set it too high, as it could scare off potential players.I would agree, depending on how many dollars one Bitcoin is worth when the tournament series starts, 1mBTC might be a bit high - although I personally think that amount is best.Quote from: icopress on February 01, 2023, 09:21:22 PMI'm thinking about having a 5 week tournament (4 games + final table). And restart. The problem of the last tournament was that after 4 weeks some users stopped playing because they did not see the prospect of making it to the final table. A strategy to reduce in-game weeks should fix this issue (I think).That was for example the reason why I could not participate in the last tournament series. I simply didn't have time on all dates and then decided that it doesn't make sense to play only about half of it. Make it short, fun and then restart. I personally wouldn't make it longer than five weeks, but it's up to you guys. I just hope that enough members can be found who want to participate in the tournaments.  Quote from: seek3r on February 01, 2023, 08:11:33 PMI would be happy to see old faces here.

Hopefully many people will participate again. I'm particularly looking forward to seeing old faces again, but of course also to new ones.  Quote from: cygan on February 02, 2023, 10:21:14 AMi would also be for a buy-in of 0.001BTC -snip-At the current price of $23,816.67, that would be almost $24. Sure, many of us can afford it, but it seems a bit high and I'm afraid it doesn't get many participants to the tables. Especially if you play all the games in a series, you can quickly reach $100 to participate. So I would go for something like $10 or even a freeroll to attract players in the first new series. This could result in more people getting involved and continuing to play even when the odds of winning are slim.",

I can't imagine that the skill level will be too high in our poker round. Therefore, I am sure that everyone has a pretty big chance to get to the final table and win one of the great prizes.",
