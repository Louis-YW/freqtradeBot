  "content": "Main sponsor:I am happy to announce that our main Sponsor for this year is Sportsbet.ioI believe no further introduction is necessary since we are talking about top crypto bookie here. I am sure you all have an account there and if you don't, what are you waiting for?The deal includes:1. 40 mBTC cash for pool rewards if there is at least 15 of us. 30 mBTC if there is at least 10 of us.2. 0.5 mBTC free bet for every participant, in other words you get half of entrance fee back as free bet on Sportsbet.io when the tournament startsHow this pool worksFor prediction we will use Superbru page and we will have complementary discussion topic here on the forum for participants only. Superbru has been around for years and they are very good at providing custom pools for all kinds of sports. The idea of the game is to predict correct scores from all the games which gives you max points (3). If you get outcome correct but not the score there is still some points awarded (1-1.5). The winner is the person with most points at the end of the season.This time it is a bit different competition so read following paragraphQuoteImportant NoticeWelcome to Nations League football! Important notes: (1) Our Predictor game only covers League A, given that this top tier features all the biggest teams; (2) We will not include the finals because they are scheduled for mid-2023. The tournament will end after Round 6 on September 27thWe will abide by Superbru rules for everything.Buy in This is a paid pool and buy in is set to 0.001 BTC (1mBTC), just about 30$ at this moment. Â All the collected money will be used for prizes. Also you get half of it back as free bet. Please send me a PM with tx id, your Sportsbet username and Superbru username when joining. That way I can immediately approve you and put you on the list for free bet.Escrow and payment address I am escrow for the funds on following BTC address, use it to pay buy in fees:1LvuzbbzYFwVmBLBT3oQUsbfRqUFPuUuDd Rewards:1. 28 mBTC2. 15 mBTC3. 10 mBTC4. 5 mBTC5. 2 mBTCwe have almost 1 mBTC reserved for fees and everything that is left will get added to 5th place reward. If it is not enough (it should be way more than enough) it will get taken from 5th place reward.This thread is intended only for participants of the pool. If you did not pay to compete with us at least refrain from shit posting.",
