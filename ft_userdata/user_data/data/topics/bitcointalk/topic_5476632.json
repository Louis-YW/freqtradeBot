Then my family didn't have money to send me further education for which I took a job in a garment company and worked there for two years.I was dismissed from that garment company as I had no work experience.For which now I have chosen a profession that is Masonry.I have been doing this for about a month. But I was involved with Cryptocurrencies while in school because my friend was very expert in this crypto currency and I used to take ideas from him and try to learn from time to time.I earn around 600 to 700 taka daily in our local currency doing this mason work which is enough for me.I was told by my family to deposit some of my earned money in the bank but I did not agree.I ignored them and decided to invest some of my earned money in bitcoin instead of keeping it in the bank and hold the bitcoin.I mentioned this to you because I invested in Bitcoin with Mason's money.I started investing in bitcoins with a dollar amount that I earned from a day's work as a mason.Maybe my invested bitcoin amount is not much but I want to start with very small amount at first since my income is very low.I bought $5 worth of bitcoins today.This $5 amount means a lot to me because this is my first bitcoin investment in my life.I want to hold my invested bitcoins for a long time and add more bitcoins to these bitcoins in the future.",

Today you invested 5$, but you can keep buying more Bitcoins along the time, as you are paid by your employer or customers. In my opinion you did the right thing by not listening to your family, because to deposit money at the bank doesn't bring any considerable returns on long run, due to the interest being paid usually staying below inflation. On the othet hand, with Bitcoin the chances of growing your funds into something substantial is higher, especially during halving times, which is the one we are approaching to, next year.My only concern is that you don't have a safe cold wallet to store your coins, neither the money to acquire one... But that is something you should start looking for soon (Ledger or Trezor physical hardware wallets).",

Since the invested amount might be big as per market standards but it's the every single dime you have hence I would suggest to explore investing into Altcoin at this moment for a short term as we are approaching Bull run and Altcoin can give you excellent returns then you may cashout and use this fund to invest into Bitcoin during the bearish season and accumulate Bitcoin for years. Hope you prosper in your life and get good returns through this investment and to be honest you are an start who is setting examples on no matter how hard life can be we need to invest into our future instead of lame excuses which many gives.",

My advice is you should increase the amount you are using as it's too small to bring you any significant ROI when a new all time high is finally achieved, the problem that many investors have is enough amount for dollar cost averaging into Bitcoin.Someone who can afford $5 per week into Bitcoin will not make what someone who can afford $50 per week onto Bitcoin, the higher the amount you DCA the better your ROI will be when the bull market is in a full adrenaline mode.",

Anyone leaving their cash in the bank at this moment and they're into cryptos or Bitcoin specifically, they aren't doing themselves any good at all.

There's no problem actually if you invest with a very small amount, as long as you also have the will and intention to make it grow and increase the volume of your bitcoin portfolio. With the help of DCA, that would be very possible.Now, while you are starting to invest, make sure to increase your knowledge as well and develop your skills and strategies so you can prepare yourself if you enter bitcoin trading in the future. But for now, you can try to add some side hustles so you can gain additional income. That way, you can start DCAing so you can prepare your portfolio for the upcoming bitcoin halving.",
