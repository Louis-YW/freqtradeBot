      "body": "Governments can have an effect on crypto, both positive & negative. We saw a negative way with China banning bitcoin (again). This caused the price to tumble, I remember going from 45k to 28k within hours. We can also see a positive way like El Salvador adopting bitcoin as official currency.Governments donâ€™t like crypto because it empowers the people. They will try to put as many hurdles in the way as possible but they are happy to take our tax money from profits.Eventually governments will have to take a knee to bitcoin.",

These politicians make laws that determines how cryptocurrencies will be used on their country. Politicians from El Salvador and Central African Republic made Bitcoin a legal tender and it led to a wide adoption of the currency. While politicians in China and other strict countries are not supporting cryptocurrencies which have made many crypto experts to leave the country.",
