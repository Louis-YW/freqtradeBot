  "content": "BC.Game is becoming famous in finding very creative ways of not paying out the winnings, they are now using non-existent TC as the excuse. The following two threads from third party mediation website explain everything you need to know. Both still unresolved.https://casino.guru/bc-game-casino-player-s-winnings-confiscated-afterhttps://casino.guru/bc-game-casino-player-s-withdrawal-blocked-due-toIt‚Äôs a simple tactic, either due to incompetence or pure fraud, but once the player meets the wagering requirements, you create new requirements and deny the winnings. When you are asked to present proof which show new requirements existed at the time of the play, casino goes quiet.At this point, their rating with AskGamblers is abysmal, but even Casino Guru has posted a warning which informs players ‚ÄúBC.Game will use Bonus TC against the players.‚Äù BC.Game prefers non-payment over the loss of its reputation simply because its hoping new players will replace the loss of revenue plus they get to keep legitimate winnings, so in the short term, they can continue with the fraud.However, on their website they have posted a logo of: Cryptogambling.org as a verifier of the operation.But you cannot get in contact with cryptogambling .org as their contacts are all invalid. If you send an email to the one listed, ¬†\"admin@cryptogambling.org\" , you will get this response:¬†\" Address not found. Your message wasn't delivered to admin@cryptogambling.org because the address couldn't be found, or is unable to receive mail.\"I don‚Äôt know if this issue is with BC.Game only or all Blockdance B.V are engaging in these kinds of behavior, but PLAYERS BEWARE.",

      "body": "Well these casino licenses that most crypto casinos get are known to be just facades. You shouldn't trust a casino simply because they paid someone to put their badge there. With that said, BC also stopped funding their signature campaign lately. Quote from: icopress on October 12, 2023, 09:58:47 AMFriends, sorry I come with bad news. The campaign fund has not yet been replenished, so I am currently suspending the campaign. If there is no news by Sunday, I will make sure that from Monday some of you will continue to work with me in other campaigns that I manage. This is never a good sign when done without prior notice. Also some discussion happening in that thread.",

This one mistake most of us make, we feel so lazy to go through that cumbersome writes and forgetting that they are information and conditions to use the site. They are lot of clone site in the internet right now, we can even tell which is genuine and due to ignorance we fall for most of this Ponzi scheme. I understand how frustrating it is to deposit your money with out stress and when time to withdraw comes it‚Äôs becomes so difficult to get back your money. In most case were you don‚Äôt provide the necessary documentation to verify you‚Äôre not a bot, I won‚Äôt see reason why the casino should release the funds to you.¬†¬† This is why we should be careful of clicking any link we see in the internet, some of this link are viruses that can leak you personal information. I personally suggest to use the most common platform. With the huge type of engagement they have they should be legit. They are other legit betting site you can choose from if you don‚Äôt like the experience with the previous one.",

Actually, There‚Äôs a lot of problem on BC related to their bonus reward even before. This issue just escalated quickly now since BC stop communicating and just banning/confiscating all the bonus rewards from users whenever they find it looks like suspicious on winning the bonus.Their signature campaign already stop while they already change their bonus TC too much harder requirements. I guess they already starting to feel the impact of the negative issues piling against them.",

(Remind you the website had recently gone through an 8-hour upgrade/maintenance.)I read the Terms and conditions of the deposit bonus, 40X wager which makes it $31040. BC.Game has a different bonus type than some other casinos, so I am not sure how they got their bonuses and about this x40 wager requirement. BC matches our deposits (as you can see on this image) and we need to wager a lot to unlock it. Open the bonus page and you can check more about it, the formula is: \"Unlock amount = wager amount * 1% * 20%\". We can deposit more money, or we can withdraw our money, anyway the bonus is not credited instantly, we need to unlock it and when we do it we can do what we want without those BCD's.",

The website is functional but basic functions around it are not working properly therefore leaving many people disappointed. Csshouts not functioning, signsture campaign participants not being updated in time and more. My hypothesis is that BC amins might have realized that operating as a legit casino and just utilized that they had remained anonymous and started scamming. Or perhaps their managers went AWOL and therefore many functions are unaccessible. We might never actually know, but when a platform starts showing these signs it's best to stay away from it.",

Beside that, I have also came across several other cases and complaints about this casino. But, even though let's hope it doesn't turn out to be another scam, similar to the 1xBit case. If their team doesn't address the concerns promptly, users here might flag anyone promoting or defending the casino when the situation is so clear.

When you are asked to present proof which show new requirements existed at the time of the play, casino goes quiet.There is no controversy in this fraud, I believe this is a deliberate act, the T&C tactic is not new when a bad casino wants to refuse your payment. It's so unfortunate that their aggressive marketing presence in virtually all sites has helped them to grow, not using the growth well is a bad attitude on their path.It pains me when people are scammed and also use this medium to warn people reading random reviews about them online, that they are already paid to write in their favour, be wise.",
