Mucho gracias How old are you? If you are 17 years old and choosing computer science degree, then many things will change when you get your BA in CS and over time, you'll find a job, get experience and will understand how to create a mixer. But if you are not a teen anymore and you are an adult with different career, don't waste your time on bitcoin mixer. To be honest, my advice for you is to not start a mixer because you have no idea what you want to start. Almost everyone ends up seized or arrested and blockchain analysis companies are getting smarter and smarter every day. In order to compete, you have to be smarter than the Chipmixer owner.By the way, have a look at [banned mixer] and their github page: https://github.com/jambler-io/bitcoin-mixer",

No big deal bro, it's just a matter of time not yet ban so I can say you are free to talk about it till the due date that was mentioned by theymos. Though the update is being pinned at the top below your username and is noticeable visibly for everyone to see the update. Since it's associated with ban I know people are too funny most at times with the way they behave when they are ban.",

Thank you I never got this recent update, my bad..Maybe those who keeps promoting mixers will limit or remove their code to be at the safer side. Yeah it's good even though mixers are ban but yet should be given privilege to talk about but not by referencing someone to the site or even having to share any content that directly related to the site hope this won't have any bad effect to user?",
