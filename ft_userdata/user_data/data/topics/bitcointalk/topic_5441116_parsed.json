The scammers may use a variety of tactics to convince victims to invest in their scheme, such as using slick marketing materials or making exaggerated claims about the potential returns. Once victims have invested in the scheme, the scammers may use a variety of tactics to delay or prevent them from accessing their funds, such as claiming that there are technical difficulties with the platform or that the investment needs to mature before it can be cashed out.In many cases, the scammers do not actually invest the funds in gold, but instead use them to pay off earlier investors or for their own personal gain. Basically yet another dress for the good old Ponzi scam.Generally speaking always stick to the \"too good to be true\" ruleÂ  and to do thorough research before investing in any new opportunity.",
