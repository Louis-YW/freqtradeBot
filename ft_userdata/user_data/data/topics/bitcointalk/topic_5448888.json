  "content": "THE ART ON \"CINDERELLA\"ArtiKanDo Collection by giammangiato* QuoteIn philately, a cinderella stamp is \"virtually anything resembling a postage stamp, but not issued for postal purposes by a government postal administration\".ProjectIt was the 19th April of 2022 and Artikando had presented its first bitcoin-themed artistic work.After a year, his second idea... arrives to public!This time there is a \"special stamp\" ... a Cinderella!  (also known as \"back of the book stamps\", or erinnophile).Obviously they can be used as a stamp... in addition to the price that would be paid for a shipment, or as a \"back of the book for closing a letter\"  In short, this a limited edition collectible (20 sheets produced - 2 already reserved by authors).Each sheet is notched and gummed like a classic postage stamp.The proofs were prepared on card stock or A4 paper. No Gum.The mini sheets were printed on Fabriano paper (weight greater than A4).Release Details* “Cryptoverse” limited supply 20 items realized* with 28 stamps/labels each one. Hand numbered with pencil [with UV ink]   *2 already reserved by authors* “Proof of print 81” 1 item, printed in cardboard paper, with nominal value of 1000 satoshi for each stamp (81 stamps/labels) * “Mini Sheet Essays Moonwalk” 2 items, hand numbered with 8 stamps/labels [with UV ink]* “Mini Sheet Essays Jumping” 2 items, hand numbered with 8 stamps/labels [with UV ink] * “Mini Sheet Moonwalk” 9 items hand numbered with 8 stamps/labels each one [with UV ink]* “Mini Sheet Jumping” 9 items hand numbered with 8 stamps/labels each one [with UV ink]* “Proof of print 49” , 1 item. Printed in classic paper, nominal value of 1000 satoshi for each stamp (49 stamps/labels)* “Proof of print 4” 1 item. Printed in classic paper, nominal value of 1000 satoshi for each stamp (4 stamps)* “Mini Sheet Moonwalk - Error print” 2 items hand numbered with 8 stamps/labels each one * “Astronaut 1 Zen” (Original drawing by hand) 1 item * “Astronaut 2 Moonwalk” (Original drawing by hand)  1 item* “Astronaut 3 Jumping” (Original drawing by hand) 1 item*   “Earth” (Original drawing by hand)  1 item* “Moon” (Original drawing by hand)  1 itemWhat authors says?Cryptoverse is for obvious reasons the achievement of Astrobit's beloved crypto realm.The jump and moonwalk is where the \"astronaut\" takes action! He starts to dance, \"jumps because  is happy\". Here in this moment he discovers the real potential of these innovations (obviously \"B\" is at the center, just look at the details  )Even for this work, all the drawings you will see are original and created by Artikando with a BIC pen. Yes, just a pen and fantasy! Even though this is a sales topic, we gladly accept criticism and/or advice to continuously improve ourselves!Auction of Limited EditionEach piece will therefore be unique and unrepeatable because they are numbered by hand.Bid Format: BTCStarting Bid: 0.0000000 BTC for each lotMinimum Bid Increment: 0.00010000 BTCAuction End Time:  21 Apr 2023 - 19:00  (EDT)Shipping:  On 4-6 May 2023.

For those who are not familiar with stamps, they come in different perf holes per certain area.     The standard for measuring is the number of perforations found in 2 centimeters (20 mm).    Good luck with the auction...will be sure to monitor this!",

Thanks for all your comments and questions.@IcedThis type of objects have their own niche of interest among collectors. Thematic collections of \"cinderella\" with a hundred pieces can easily exceed 3000 euros (for example, aviation,politics or industry theme). I have sold recently a collection and there was interest for the same item from multiple countries/buyers.@krogothmanhattan @IcedStamps are perforated with method \"blocks\" at 13 1/2. No variety has been identified/errors during this process of production.  @Kryptowerk\"Cinderella stamps\" could not be used as regular stamp... but can be used in addiction to regular stamps!  I will (probably) use one sheet to create some \"postal history\" cover.  Auction End Time:  21 Apr 2023 - 19:00  (EDT)",
