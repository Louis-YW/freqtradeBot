  "content": "As humans, we tend to have a need for immediate satisfaction. These needs keep increasing on dialy basis, if one decide to go by all these needs, one may end up without a saving. Most time we are faced with a decision like whether to spend our money on our daily needs or to save them. Here, we may likely to be biased toward our present selves, so we're likely to make the choice that will benefit us most at that moment which mostly will be buying our daily needs. However, we can overcome present bias by taking away the ability to choose between saving and spending altogether. This is where automating your savings comes in.What do I mean by automatic saving? Automatic savings is a type of personal savings system in which the plan contributor automatically deposits a fixed amount of funds at specified intervals into their account. The typical structure of this type is an automatic transfer from an individual's bank account into a savings or investment account.When you automate, you eliminate a decision – to save or not to save. Once you decide to set up auto-save and go through the initial process, that’s all. You keep saving at interval without a need to make a decision on either to save or not. With this one savings keep accumulating with time till one have a reasonable amount.With automatic savings, ones monthly salary becomes: Salary- Automatic savings amount. With this, one will only calculate is daily needs on the remaining amount rather than calculating on all it's salary.CONCLUSIONSaving money isn't something easy, it comes with determination and self-discipline but with automatic saving one can easily set his/her saving amount at interval.",

You need money and sometimes saving up can be a real life saver. Now when it comes to automating your savings it's just going to help you save a particular amount in which you have placed for it to save and you can also withdraw at anytime. For me, I would prefer locking up my savings. with this, you can place the automator and lock up your savings till when you actually need it and this I will say comes with determination. However, you should be aware that when you decide to do this, you can no longer have Access to your money even in emergency and this can be frustrating. So wouldn't recommend this for anyone who knows that they just don't have a reliable source of income.",

That means you only spend a part of what you earn on the things you need and the rest goes to investments. This is not a easy way to live and most people won’t choose this lifestyle. I prefer to save my money in a currency that’s higher than the one I earn, for example I’d save my money in usd if I earn in naira, that way I hedge against the inflation and my money appreciates in value.",

Clason writes in \"The Richest Man in Babylon\", \"Wealth grows where men exert energy to acquire it.\" By automating our savings, we can ensure that we are consistently putting in the effort to build our wealth, rather than relying on our own willpower to save. As we continue to deposit a fixed amount of funds at specified intervals into our savings or investment account, our wealth will grow steadily over time, without the need for constant decision-making or discipline.

But savings should be through initiative and discipline indeed, for it to have some sort of 'chain' to not be used to \"wants\" than with \"needs\". Initiative would somehow push that individual to avoid using his/her savings easily. But this simply depends on the person. The problem why savings does not work the way it should be, is because of drives and implusiveness. If an individual would be fully aware of the cashflow in his/her account, expenses would be anticipated and measured which would allow the individual to avoid being oushed to the edge of withdrawing some of the saved money.",

I just started inculcating the habit of saving last month, it was dawn on me as I've been spending so much, and most of them are on frivolities. This is because I had excess and without a good plan.So, people could be indulging themselves whether they have the money in excess or not.

Most of the Western sphere believes in the share market or stock purchases. Moreover, their contribution is based on accounting and saving up money in the bank accounts and getting those savings interest rates. On the east side, their other ways such as Recurring deposits, Fix Deposits, Mutual Funds, Real estate (land focused), and Gold Accumulation. I have seen the last two at their peak in Asian countries. Anyone with a land mass and gold is rich person and the trend of saving money in them is insanely higher than any other country. Definitely saving pattern changes as per the culture as well and it plays a crucial part in the same. I would say, to be an efficient saver, one needs to have a proper portfolio.
