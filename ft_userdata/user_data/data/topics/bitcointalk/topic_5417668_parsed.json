  "content": "So a strong title needs some strong evidence, which I hope I am able to provide here.The main reason why the Oasis Network caught my attention is cause of their founder Dawn Song. A brief intro to her so you guys can see why she's so interesting. Dawn Song is the most cited scholar in computer security (her h-index is over 130. An h-index measures productivity and citations) and a part of the Initiative for CryptoCurrency & Contracts (also known as the IC3) I'll include all the links down at the bottom btw. She's worked with google to improve their AI, as well as a focus on adversarial machine learning, to improve the defences of machine learning, due to the fact as technology evolves so does the methods of attacks. What also attracted me to Dawn, outside of her credentials and the respect her work demands from her peers, is that she's clearly a very productive and driven woman, whose primary goal is enabling a responsible and fair data economy. Protocols and chain lead by such people are always a very good long term bet, as they're not driven by material wants such as a lambo or faux respect, like you see with other founders and CEOs. If you want to take the deep dive, check out her google scholar page which I'll link down below.Also on a quick short note about the IC3; it's an academic focused organisation that are aiming to solve the challenges of blockchain, spearheaded by Ari Juels, the chief scientist of Chainlink (and the co-author of the paper that formulized proof of work in 1999). Challenges such as confidentiality, scaling, interoperability, correctness of code; I'll include a link for that as well down below. But to copy paste it here;QuoteSecure Scaling and Performance: Scaling up blockchains to handle intensive global workloads for both permissionless decentralized blockchains, and     permissioned/consortium blockchains supporting >100,000 transactions/sec.Correctness by Design and Construction: Making it easy, and even automatic, for blockchain developers to produce secure protocols and code, by utilizing (1) programming     language techniques to create correct code, and (2) cryptographic protocols with security proofs.Confidentiality: Combining transparency with confidentiality in blockchains, by utilizing (1) cryptographic techniques, as well as (2) trusted-hardware.Authenticated Data Feeds: Supporting a robust ecosystem of trustworthy data feeds for blockchains and contributing high-trust data feed solutions.Safety and Compliance: Enabling techniques and protocols for effective monitoring and targeted intervention in blockchains, informed by evaluations of traditional contract     law and risks of crime in smart contracts.Sound Migration: Formulating practical migration paths to production blockchain deployments and enabling integration of new blockchain systems with legacy systems.Social Good: Applying cutting-edge blockchain technologies to pressing societal problems in order to illuminate overlooked technical needs and create impactful solutions.Dawn has multiple papers here published on the IC3's website, some co-authored with the Chainlink team. So what is the Oasis Network? To put in short terms:    Oasis is a privacy-enabled, layer-1 blockchain network, with high throughput, low gas fees and a secure and modular architecture.     The network has a unique architecture that separates consensus operations from compute into two main layers: the Consensus Layer and ParaTime Layer. This design     allows the Network to support many different parallel compute environments (aka ParaTimes) that can be  customized for a broad set of use cases. It's similar to a rollup.     Another explanation is that a ParaTime is its own separate compute environment that can operate as a smart contract environment as well. Hence why Oasis already has     one EVM compatible ParaTime called Emerald, and soon it will have Sapphire, which will be the first confidential smart contract environment on the EVM.     For more information I'll be linking a whitepaper overview, and a link to the whitepaper itself. It also has some interesting backers such as: Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain, Pantera, Dragonfly, Binance Labs, and several projects already building like the CryptoSafe Alliance with Binance, The BMW Group, Chainlink, Genetica, and Meta (yes, Facebook).The name of their native token is called ROSE, and yes the token has a utility. It's used for staking, delegation, and for transaction fees both for its consensus layer and its ParaTime layer. There's a lot more, and I'll be updating this thread to make it more readable, but I'm always up for answering questions, keep in mind I'm not a developer.The links I talked about;Dawn Song's google scholar page: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=84WzBlYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=aoInitiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts: https://www.initc3.org/projects.htmlProof of Work paper: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Proofs-of-Work-and-Bread-Pudding-Protocols-Jakobsson-Juels/1745e5dbdeb4575c6f8376c9e75e70650a7e2e29Whitepaper overview: https://docdro.id/dn0PG5k (this is a shortened unofficial paper of the whitepaper)Whitepaper itself: https://assets.website-files.com/5f59478e350b91447863f593/628ba74a9aee37587419cf65_20200623%20The%20Oasis%20Blockchain%20Platform.pdfMeta's working with Oasis Labs: https://ai.facebook.com/blog/assessing-fairness-of-our-products-while-protecting-peoples-privacy/",

We're seeing the need for privacy in web3 and its utility manifesting itself with the recent Equifax news. Posting the link down below.Outside of privacy, one of the things that Oasis are focused on, is utilising NFTs to help foster a data driven economy. This means that when we see the emergence of data NFTs, most, if not all, of retail will have soured on it, cause they lost their money on stupid monkey pictures, or cash grabs by b-tier celebrities. Essentially a data NFT means that when you submit your data (through a privacy-preserving smart contract) you get issued a data NFT. The data gets computed in the enclave, and then extracted (while your sensitive information still stays private), and you are in return awarded tokens since you're the holder of the NFT. This is useful for building credit profiles, insurance, medical data, and so on.Link to sign up and view the Town Hall https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/5016666104422/WN_-JxkFujXRfabgLm99lCMaAhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oasis-labs-partners-with-equifax-to-power-on-chain-kyc-solution-for-the-web3-economy-301659732.html",

Their goal is to provide privacy compliant methods, IE, while users have their sensitive information protected, it still allows for auditability. Not to mention that Monero is privacy at the consensus layer (meaning the bare bones), and doesn't provide the ability to offer privacy-preserving smart contract environment that allows for more complex executions.",

She's the most cited scholar in computer security, and given that Meta, and now Equifax are using their tech to provide privacy for their users (though Equifax is still on going work), I think institutions are recognising the shift towards a data economy, and the focus on Oasis, is to allow users complete sovereignty over their while still maintaining privacy.",

Those that have read up on Oasis are aware that their upcoming ParaTime, Sapphire (which enables confidential smart contracts on the EVM) relies on trusted hardware, also known as TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), namely Intel's SGX (Software Guard Extenstion). The unrelated part comes that another blockchain called Secret Network that also uses TEE, was hacked by white hackers, and their master key that decrypts all the confidential information was exposed. Here's the more interesting part, the group of white hackers, featured Andrew Miller, one of the scientists of Chainlink Labs, who also co-authored the Ekiden paper, which is what Sapphire is largely based on. The Ekiden paper goes on to explain how its tech mitigates sidechannel leaks in TEE (which is the vulnerability of it), and Miller tweeted that he remained bullish on TEE smart contracts.",

Anyone has trusted this guy, from average joe, to some big shot sports personalities. However, everything has crumbled down to it's knees.I'm going to strongly disagree with the comparison of Dawn to SBF. Dawn is an accredited professor, a certified genius and part of the IC3. To the veterans in the blockchain space, the IC3 should ring familiar, if not than some of the names involved. She also didn't move away to the Bahamas, and still lives in the U.S. her research is literally funded by DARPA and various government grants. SBF to my knowledge was just some rich kid that basically fooled around with other peoples money, where as Dawn is completely focused on creating a responsible data economy. The reason why I am so focused on her, is cause of her credentials as the most cited computer security expert. Outside of this, it's pretty solid tech, based on strong research, and they're going to be the only chain that offers confidential smart contracts on the EVM. The Equifax news should have you all excited, since it's pretty clear to me that they'll be utilising Sapphire for it. The only unfortunate, or rather fortunate given that this place has been largely unaware of the Oasis Network, is the price action has stagnated a bit in this bear market, however the prudent buyer would DCA in these ranges.",

We want to work with what has been created and empower developers to take it to the next level. Solidity developers, EVM chains, and major dApps are starting to hit a Web3 ceiling because of a lack of privacy, and with the Oasis Privacy Layer, we’re forging a path forward.In other words, they're (Oasis) aiming for making their solution easy to implement on any chain so users can have access privacy-preserving tech and confidentiality.",
