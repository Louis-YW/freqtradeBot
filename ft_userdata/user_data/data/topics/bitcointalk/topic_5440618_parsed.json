But if you keep putting the same guys on the set then change will never came on that country so citizens of nigeria should work for its change because its really bad if your health care system,economical and other aspects has been neglected by the head of the state. But its good if you open up this discussion on Nigerian section because people came from outside Nigeria cannot do anything about it so speak up on correct board to get more good result since maybe you can influence people to vote the right leaders on your country.",

And majority or we Nigerians believe that Peter Obi has the potential to change some of the political activities that has been holding the nation back but the only issue now is that most of his supporters don't even have voters card to vote but still keep on rooting for him.

In various internet media that I searched, Nigeria is going through a cash crunch causing long queues at all the ATMs, cases like this are very rare in some other countries and to be honest I have never heard of anything like this in other countries. Suggestions for the OP to move this post to the Nigerian Local board, because the discussion specifically is more directly related to events, or it can also be moved to the Politics and Society board because the OP mentioned about selecting leaders for the future.",

The hospital is being probed right now.I agree with everything you said. You seem to be on same page with me.First I think the woman died because of very bad medical care and idealogy in Nigeria. Apart from network issues or shortage of cash, a good health system would have done better in any situation. This brings us to bad government and politicians who have also been very quick to hijack the new currency for the purpose of buying voter's conscience at the ballot. Just like you have said, they are fighting back the policy because they know that it has really taken out cash from their reach and doing transfer will not be a fast approach in the ballot. From the broadcast from the president, he also alluded and confirmed that the policy has minimized the flow of cash in this electionary time and this is true with the way corrupt politicians are almost wanting to engage the president or the CBN governor in a boxing match. I think we have to be patient because after the election, those new currency that have been hijacked would find their way to the system.",

Now it's time for election let's vote wisely let not suffer for 8 years againThis is a very difficult thing and I have never felt anything like it where I am. From the news I read on a site, it was stated that the country of Nigeria is experiencing a paper money crisis so there are many queues in front of the bank at night until the morning in order to be able to withdraw cash as quickly as possible. I certainly couldn't imagine this because there would be more time to be sacrificed to queue in front of the bank in order to be able to get cash for those who already have a bank account.But those who don't have a bank account will be very angry and confused because they can't buy anything when they don't have cash in their hands. But what I read from the news that was published a week ago said that the Nigerian Supreme Court has ordered the relevant regulators to speed up the distribution of paper money in order to overcome this as quickly as possible so that this does not last too long, especially if in the near future the Nigerian state has to choose new leader to lead the country better than before.",

The cashless policy has failed, ATM is not dispensing inside bank on the cashier desk is not paying.One of the main reason of the redesigned of the banknote is to stop vote buying in the forthcoming election in the country but that has been failed.

Now it's time for election let's vote wisely let not suffer for 8 years againYou can rest assured, whatever leaders you have will simply screw you over in similar ways, I doubt the opposition parties have much to offer that could get Nigeria out of this predicament. Unfortunately this is often what happens when your country just keeps on growing beyond the resources it needs to sustain itself and all the people of Nigeria actually hold some blame in this matter. This is not a problem solely in Nigeria, but lack of contraception usage and having far more kids than you can look after is somewhat irresponsible too. Using them as your retirement plan is often the case in developing countries but it can make economic problems much worse if many people will not have decent jobs when grown up.",

Even with the fact that, the CBN is actually dispatching this catch to the various banks there is but, the corruption which have rooted in the minds of those in administrative officers have given them the idea of profit over where you work rather than serve the public. You have these guys swapping these notes at a deal behind closed doors just to get a percentage.The idea of rebounding of notes goes from reducing the rate at which individuals are hoarding currency to ensuring looted funds by politicians and those collected in ransom by criminals are rendered unusable but, somehow these guys are still finding there way to swapping these notes and thereby, the people just suffer the scarcity for no reason.",

Yeah, I just saw another thread about Nigeria in which the death of the pregnant woman was brought up.  It wasn't clear to me how the long ATM lines and her death were related, because her husband was, or could have been, standing in the queue instead of her.  I wasn't even sure she was in that queue to begin with.  In any case, I gave my opinion that it sounded like sensational journalism, trying to persuade the public that there were a rash of deaths because people didn't have immediate access to their cash.  I seriously doubt that's the case.",
