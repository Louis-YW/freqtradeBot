We've had several people starting same thread as you and with promises of giving out their services free of charge but after asked to go continue their services in a private channel and even charged some fees.It will be nice if you drop your proves of your previous picks as this will also help to build the trust of your potential customers and when giving out tips, you should try as much as possible to show your losses as well and not just your wins.",

Some people just don't like the app that has restrictions that's why they avoid that but if you have other choices to offer they might wanna change their minds. So, what do you think?You might be the known tipster in this forum if you give a useful tips and tricks to some of us that would be a great help to minimize our losses.",

Communicating via discord is more convenient and potentially a real time convo vs the forum, but also means notifications and annoyances(yes notifications can be disabled I know).

If he can prove one “scam” or anything negative about me I’ll donate $5000USDT to him immediately.He contacted me first asking me to DM him and I responded publicly that he should comment publicly so everybody can see what we are talking about. He is a degenerate who has an obsession with me (I’m flattered). So the ball is in his court, provide some evidence and I’ll send $5,000 USDT.

If op is genuinely interested in sharing tips with forum members then he should edit this thread and share the tips here or perhaps lock this current thread and create a new one for the tips that way the whole tip sharing would be transparent and the probability of getting scammed would be reduced.",

I don’t ask people to place bets for me.I post the picks daily and they can choose to tail me or not.Look at his comment history and the first time he contacted me when I posted thr $417,000 win. He tried to scam me in private messaging saying he can sell me VIP stake account. When I called him a scammer he lost his mind and literally went crazy to the point I had to block him. Just look at our post histories it’s as simple as that.I don’t understand what is taking this guy so long to post evidence or screenshots proving his claims. He even said I was on Reddit complaining about my losses and being broke lmao. It should take him 30 seconds to post his screenshots and claim his $5kUSD reward. What’s the delay?",
