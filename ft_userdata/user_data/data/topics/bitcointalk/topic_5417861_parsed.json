Quote from: CryptoQED on October 21, 2022, 07:38:32 AMThe crypto market is giving investors no hope of recovery as the price of Bitcoin returns from its recent gain.Many altcoins have no hope of recovering after this winter period, you are correct with that one, but bitcoin's recovery isn't even open to or for debate, the longer the winter season, the more weak hands are lost, and that is good for bitcoin.Quote from: CryptoQED on October 21, 2022, 07:38:32 AMExperts in the crypto world revealed that the current market situation results from several macroeconomic factors.

      "body": "Every Bitcoin investor is aware that we are still in a bear season, so they don't expect the market to go bullish soon. There is still speculation that Bitcoin might drop below $17k. The bear season is a time to fill your basket and hold on for the next bull market.However, you should be aware that feature trading necessitates a skilled trader due to the potential for losses, so it is not advisable for a newbie to engage in feature trading unless they are highly skilled at it.",

      "body": "These articles usually tell you nothing. If you read it till the end you'll get to this part:QuoteThere’s no confirmation regarding the possible movement of Bitcoin during the expected recession. However, chances are that it could appreciate as a result of quantitative easing. But this is only possible if the Fed pulls off a strategy to handle the demand slowdown.On the other hand, it’s also possible for BTC to dip even further due to the recession. The main reason is that stock markets barely perform well during the recession, and Bitcoin is no exception. In other words, bitcoin could go up or it could go down. we don't know. What was the purpose of the article then? Oh, right, you get paid for it regardless of whether you have something to convey or not.  Remember guys, the moment where everyone turns bearish is the moment when it's time to buy. Those who wait for another dip end up like people who were waiting for 1k bitcoin in 2019, when the price was 3k. I didn't sell for 30k, so why should I sell for 20, or 19, or 18? People who write these articles don't realize that a large number of bitcoin holders will have to be satisfied with an offer to take it and will not sell unless that happens. People who did not sell now will not be satisfied if the price dips to 18k again. A panic move is when we go from 70k to 30k, but when that happens most people become immune to the market and don't react to drops from 19k to 18k. I think that there's not going to be a big panic move again, like the one we saw in June.",
