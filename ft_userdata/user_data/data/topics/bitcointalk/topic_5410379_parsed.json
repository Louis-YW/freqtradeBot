  "content": "New electrum version is released.It contains some minor fixes for Lightning network and UICode:# Release 4.3.1 - (August 17, 2022) * build: we now also distribute a \"source-only\"   Linux-packager-friendly tarball (d0de44a7, #7594), in addition   to the current \"normal\" tarball. The \"source-only\" tarball excludes   compiled locale files, generated protobuf files, and does not   vendor our runtime python dependencies (the packages/ folder). * fix os.chmod when running in tmpfs on Linux (#7681) * (Qt GUI) some improvements for high-DPI monitors (38881129) * bring kivy request dialog more in-line with Qt (#7929) * rm support of \"legacy\" (without static_remotekey) LN channels.   Opening these channels were never supported in a release version,   only during development prior to the first lightning-capable   release. Wallets with such channels will have to close them.   (1f403d1c, 7b8e257e) * Qt: fix duplication of some OS notifications on onchain txs (#7943) * fix multiple recent regressions:    - handle NotEnoughFunds when trying to pay LN invoice (#7920)    - handle NotEnoughFunds when trying to open LN channel (#7921)    - labels of payment requests were not propagated to      history/addresses (#7919)    - better default labels of outgoing txs (#7942)    - kivy: dust-valued requests could not be created for LN (#7928)    - when closing LN channels, future (timelocked) txs were not      shown in history (#7930)    - kivy: fix deleting \"local\" tx from history (#7933)    - kivy: fix paying amountless LN invoice (#7935)    - Qt: better handle unparseable URIs (#7941)https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTEShttps://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/tree/4.3.1",

      "body": "I downloaded and verified the new version 4.3.1 and yesterday with a Testnet incoming transaction the unconfirmed transaction didn't show up in the transaction history list while waiting to be confirmed and mined into a block (the transaction was visible for several minutes in mempool with a blockchain explorer).On the other hand the transaction's amount was shown in the pie chart as \"unconfirmed\" rather quickly (as expected), so Electrum knew about the incoming transaction. Only with the first confirmation the transaction showed up in the transaction history list.I must say, I don't like this behavior of the present version of the wallet if it wasn't some sort of glitch. I will need to do more testing, though.Is this intentional? What's your experience with incoming transactions in Electrum 4.3.1?Edit: must have been some weird glitch yesterday. Today I can't reproduce the observed behavior. Sorry!Edit2: I made two receive requests in my Testnet wallet, both were \"paid\" on-chain, both were displayed properly initially as unconfirmed in transaction history list. Both requests though are not shown as paid in the Receive queue and both entries remain there even after restart of the wallet. Electrum wallets pre version 4.3.0 behaved differently:* a paid receive request was shown as paid with a confirmed transaction to the associated address* a paid receive request was removed from Receive queue automatically, latest after re-opening of the wallet(Yes, you can delete the Receive queue entries manually, but it wasn't necessary before to do it manually!)",
