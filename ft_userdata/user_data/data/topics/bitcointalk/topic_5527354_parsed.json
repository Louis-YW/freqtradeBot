  "content": "No matter how much you have saved in fiat bank, it will not make you rich unless you invest. No investment is like Bitcoin investment. Both real estate, stocks, and gold cannot be compared to Bitcoin investment. There was an argument within my neighborhood, arguing about how risky crypto (Bitcoin investment) is. One thing for sure is, some folks don't get the point that fiat currency can be riskier than Bitcoin investment. The reasons are Inflation: causes the price of goods and commodities to add over time. I.e, buying a liter of fuel for $3.100 today and buying some fuel for $4.600 the next day. Economic instability: This can also make the government borrow money from different countries. However, if the economy is unstable, IMO many citizens will travel out and go to a better country with a stable economy. Also, if foreign investors leave the country, the currency will be valueless. Currency devaluation:[/by When a currency doesn't have a value, it can no longer afford things that cost that same amount months back. All this can cause fiat to lose value.  There are many reasons why it's very important to keep our money in Bitcoin as an investment. Bitcoin is decentralized: The decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes it very difficult for the government and the bank to have access to and control it. Can send Bitcoin anywhere/country on a cheaper rate: With Bitcoin, you can send money to any foreign country at your own comfort and on a cheaper rate. High return on investment: This is one of the most important reasons. If you invest in Bitcoin, you can make a 100% profit from it, mostly when you invest in the long term. Investing in Bitcoin will also give you the advantage of learning a skill, skills like trading and investment. IMO, with Bitcoin investment, you can also control your finances. Invest only $10,000 in Bitcoin for 5 years, and you will make decent profits from it, but when you keep the $10,000 in your bank account for 5 years, you cannot use it to buy what you will use the money invested in Bitcoin to buy because the fiat value has depreciated. But the $10,000 invested in Bitcoin will yield profits, and you can use it to buy what you want to buy.",

      "body": "All the points you listed about the cons of fiat are just the same point, which is inflation. Economic instability and currency devaluation still boil down to inflation. Inflation is a problem but it's not riskier than bitcoin, except if you live in a country where the country keeps nose-diving daily. The situation is not the same in every country. In a country where the currency is stable, bitcoins riskier than holding fiat but fiat won't give you any profit.A $10k investment in Bitcoin wot make you rich in 5 years. Yeah, you will get profit but you won't be rich. I agree that bitcoin can make you rich in the future but it depends on how much you invest and how long you hold it. There is no guarantee that bitcoin will make you rich in 10 years. The price of bitcoin might just be 300k in 10 years, that wont make you rich.",

However, for the past years Bitcoin has proved to be a good investment and a hedge against inflation. I wouldn't hesitate to introduce people to invest in Bitcoin because it has proved to be stable and dependable. But they would also have know the risks involved. I will be a very bad decision to keep money in banks because inflation will make them lose value within few years. It might not be Bitcoin, but just ensure fiat should be invested in profitable ventures instead of keeping it in a bank.",

So we can’t tell completely that investing in bitcoin could guarantee us to become rich in the future. This is the reason why we don’t have to force ourselves to invest in bitcoin, it’s never a compulsory but only a voluntary one. However, if one decides to invest, it should be done using extra funds, not from using our hard-earned savings, so that if bitcoin suddenly loses its value in the future, our finances will never be greatly affected. DCA is a good and effective strategy, provided that you do it regularly regardless of the current price of bitcoin, and having risk management while you are still in the hodling process.",

Let’s go by the past trend of bitcoin and it is that it increases as the adoption spreads but the increase in price is actually having a reduced volatility and as such the price pump is ideally not going to be like before. Before it is easier or predictable to see more than 10x in that space of five investing into bitcoin but right now with growing reduction of volatility it doesn’t seems achievable again and as such I can only predict that we could see something like 5x so it depends now which amount the investor puts in that will classify him/her as a rich person, someone with less than five to six figure capital are those that will maybe be actually able to say they are rich later",

      "body": "In this case it is difficult to define “rich” because in the end everyone has different thoughts about this but it is undeniable when we do DCA to invest in bitcoin even with a long enough vulnerability coupled with good consistency in DCA that is done then there is indeed a situation where we will at least get a profit and it could be that the goal of financial freedom that we always dream of can happen.I don't want to talk about benchmark timeframes like 5 or 10 years even though it is ideal but in the end not everyone can do that because after all it takes a strong hand if we want to succeed in bitcoin for a longer time. It is good to do indeed because it is quite ideal to actually be in bitcoin for a vulnerable time of 10 years because apart from the risks that are indeed becoming less extreme for a short time, it could be that the benefits obtained are more optimal, it's just that we also need to consider in this case whether we can afford it or not because that is the challenge, when indeed we are not able then the game could be over.",

The mistake a newbie in the crypto (Bitcoin) space makes is they do not have a long-term perspective even before they get to invest in Bitcoin. Over the past years, we have experienced a significant changes in the Bitcoin space. Early last year (2024), Bitcoin was below $40k price and presently it's more than $100k, which means investing now and holding for the long term, like up to 10 years. They will make a lot of profits through it. Just like I have said even before now, that keeping $10k in the bank for 10 years will bring no good because everyday fiat currency depreciates based on inflation and economic instability.",

It's true that the money in the bank for 5 years with that $10k will just be lower in purchasing power because of the inflation. Whereas, if it's being put to Bitcoin and after that period with another halving and cycle coming in, we will never know how much it will be but because of volatility, the value might go higher than that. But to have an exact amount to invest, I know this is just an example but not everyone can afford to do a lumpsum. So, make targets for your accumulation and have that amount in your mind that you'll have no other things to do but to follow DCA for as long as you can be. Anyway, that amount might not make you rich but could help you have a comfortable life and financial status.",
