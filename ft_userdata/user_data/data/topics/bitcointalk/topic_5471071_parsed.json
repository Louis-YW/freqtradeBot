If you want a project adopted by more than 10 people you need a better algo, or multi algo. Redblock red like vagina lips color. Nothing can better supplement ur lust for money earned through market selling a big chunk of funny token than desire to delve into the opening formed by genitalia lips. I have tampered with mining pools feeding in fake block count from my own chain which I mined on same rpc ports. Now chain is halted. We can now talk about release of that money I was promised to get if I took over the coin.",
