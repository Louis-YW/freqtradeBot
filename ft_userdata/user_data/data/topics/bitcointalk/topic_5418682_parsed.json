  "content": "Hello everyone,I want to know how I can find the public key (compressed or uncompressed) of any address, because i see there are too many addresses but they didn't have the public key so i check them blockchair.com and other explorer but they also didn't show the public key. Here is the sample address: 1N45DoSuhiNi5dCqMTpC2k3tfSaHEw1uKk",

      "body": "If the address isn't yours (I mean you don't own its private key) and there isn't any transaction made from that address, there is no way to find the public key of the address.You can't derive public key from the address. The address is derived from the public key through a one way function. If there's a transaction made from the address, you can find its public key by checking the transaction details in a block explorer.If the address is P2PKH (legacy), the public key is the second part of Sigscript.If the the address is P2WPKH (native segwit) or P2WPKH-P2SH (nested segwit), the public key is the second part of witness. Quote from: Morexl on October 28, 2022, 09:17:50 PMHere is the sample address: 1N45DoSuhiNi5dCqMTpC2k3tfSaHEw1uKkSince no transaction has been made from this address, there is no way to find its public key. To know the public key of this address, you need its private key.",

Your transaction should contain the public key, so the nodes can verify your signature. Since the public key is calculated automatically by your wallet and broadcast to the network, you don't really need to know the public key of your address. That's why wallets usually gives you the addresses and private keys and not the public keys.Maybe OP is just doing some studies on how private keys and public keys are calculated.",
