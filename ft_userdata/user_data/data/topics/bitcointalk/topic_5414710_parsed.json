  "content": "Just like traditional trading, futures trading has been a very good innovation in the crypto space, yet I still feel incomplete without trading Bitcoin with Option. I was happy to see the Option trading feature with Binance, which is my only exchange, but they offer a different kind of Option trading from the traditional one I know. Their style of offering is designed to make one lose as your winning is not guaranteed even if the difference between the striking price and the price at expiration is in your favour.Take, for example, I bought the (Call) option on BTC at 18634.35 on Friday for an expiration of 1 hour. Could you believe that the price of the market was at 18855.87 at the expiry time, but Binance still concluded that I lost the bet? This is not a mistake because such a situation has happened to me more than 5 times with the same exchange.I don't know how Binance calculates their options trading and I don't care again. Is there any exchange you can suggest to me that gives winning like the traditional Option trading where the slightest point counts?",

Also it depends on the premium you paid for this option? The gain loss might have been calculated considering the premium paid for the option when you would have bought it.",

It is not about the advanced technology that Binance is using, it is obvious that their Option trading is not the true way to trade traditional Options. About 6 trades can't be a mistake, they knowingly designed the platform to make you lose in trading Option, which is not fair. This is glaring.As for the FTX, I know them, and I have an account with them but have not traded there before because I didn't want to go through the stress of KYC and they still disappoint me like Binance.Quote from: teosanru on September 24, 2022, 06:59:58 PMI think they might be taking up the price of the underlying asset while calculating the gain/loss which means you might be using BTC futures to calculate the win and they might be using btc spot instead.

In my understanding of Option trading, brokers/exchanges don't segregate. No regular or premium account, Option trading is the same and the same principles suppose to apply to such an account.",

And as for the risk, people here are used to risk, they are not afraid of it either. They game and gamble, what is risker than that? My question only falls short of many responses because of this section of the forum, I don't know who transferred it from the initial place I posted it. Finally, Bitcoin traders might not know how and where to do Option trading in a professional way.",

It's obvious that no one could trade Option without the knowledge of how to trade futures because you need to speculate and know how to earn from the market through it. However, the only difference between the future and Option trading is just the expiration of the tenure of the betting and the fixed amount to earn which must have been foreknown.",

I believe it's not just the institutions anymore. Plebs like us, perhaps absolutely no one uses it except for the purposes of gambling/trying options, but there might currently be more whales during this cycle that use a more advanced strategy that utilizes options for hedging their long or short positions than the last cycle.It's probably good to learn about options to understand its effect on the market when their expiries are coming.",
