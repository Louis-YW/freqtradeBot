Satoshi Nakamoto created a project to be decentralized so it makes a lot of sense to leave the community and eliminate all massive impacts from the founder's developments technically or from media with posts in the forum.",

      "body": "Satoshi might still be living among us or dead, but it doesn't matter; all that matters is that the technology he designed is working effectively the way he thought of it before or after creating Bitcoin.Perhaps Satoshi said that a lost Bitcoin \"only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more.\" So, a Bitcoiner should consider his lost wallet key as a donation to the success of Bitcoin technology, what if he also just distroy the key for his wallets that hold a huge sum of Bitcoin? In this life, before something can work the way we expected it to, there are some sacrifices we must make, which I guess is what Satoshi Nakamto did. He locked up a huge amount of Bitcoin in his wallet and probably distroyed the private key to the wallet. He also realised that his technology might not really be decentralised if he made himself known. So, it's all for the good of Bitcoin.",

There is no other cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and there has never been a founder with almost the same backdrop...only Satoshi got it and he left us with a legacy that will go on 'forever\" or maybe until humanity remains to be viable on this planet. Right now, no one can be sure if the man is still alive or if he was already 6 feet below the ground...and it would be a BIG news if one day he would resurfaced and moved one of his many cache of BTC.",

No one can also say if he is dead or alive. Since one can fake his own death and travel to somewhere that no one will ever think of and remain there without no one notice. We don't know the identity of Satoshi and you might be at his side buying some stuffs in the supermarket and wouldn't know that this person is the great Satoshi. You know he is a very intelligent person and I believe that he has the foresight of what might happen to him if he reveal his identity as Satoshi. We should be happy that a man like him was given birth to the world. Someone that gave us financial freedom from the government financial entrapment.",

Maybe he is Hal Finney, it will be very logical because he was one of the first to use Bitcoin, at the same time he was American while Satoshi was posting in British English, probably make it more real that he and Hal were two different person. Deep in my guts I think that one wouldn't manage to remain anonymous for such a long time with such a big wealth. I think that Satoshi is dead in real life. At least what we all can say is that this man did absolutely everything to make Bitcoin number one and the most decentralized currency by sacrificing his virtual existence and it was way earlier than Hal Finney's death.",
