  "content": "Whitepaper: https://docs.bitboost.org/TL;DRBitboost proposes an EVM execution environment on Bitcoin. It uses Bitcoin as the sequencer and data availability layer for transactions and executes these transactions on an off-chain EVM indexer. It connects to Bitcoin through a PSBT-based decentralized trading pair between its native token and BTC. The entire protocol is trustless and has the same security level as Bitcoin. Â It's a working project and please refer to the whitepaper for more details.",

It does not have to be a dollar stablecoin but it is necessary to prevent people from throwing spam on the protocol to get it to rise or fall in price. It will in particular help avoid the pitfalls of Ordinals.",

We have updated some thoughts on reducing gas fees. Among them, it is proposed that when the co-processor transaction size is small, users can also choose OP_RETURN to store the transaction. See this page https://docs.bitboost.org/system/performance-improvements for more details.",

It will in particular help avoid the pitfalls of Ordinals.We appreciate receiving such suggestions. In fact, we have considered several ways to stabilize the token's price, even including using economic mechanisms similar to algorithmic stablecoins to create wBTC and wORDI on the co-processor. We call this as \"Economic Bridge\" and will provide more details on this page https://docs.bitboost.org/system/economic-bridge in the future.",
