It is safer than Proof of Stake, smart contracts which can be exploited and new tokens can be minted by an exploited smart contract.With Proof of Work, you can not do that. With Bitcoin network that is a biggest one with highest total hash rate, risk to see 51% attack is low and nearly zero. It is why people have biggest belief in Bitcoin but not in other coins or tokens. With Bitcoin, investors will not have fear of sudden inflation in circulating supply like with smart contract.QuoteI personally think that Bitcoin can be the only product for long-term trade management or long-term planning.Bitcoin is not a product. It is a mean for payment, transactions peer-to-peer. Other businesses or people can use bitcoin for their service payments or for individual trade deal.To manage your bitcoins good in long term, you must know about self custody wallet and only store your bitcoins in such wallets.Must backup your wallets for recovery when your initial wallet or device is broken technically.If you make your long term plan by storing your bitcoins on exchanges, you might have nightmare anytime.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

I personally think that Bitcoin can be the only product for long-term trade management or long-term planning.You've got a point right that the return on investment in Bitcoin is relatively low. But the risk is much less compared to other coins if the profit is relatively low. It is better to aim to earn a low profit with a relatively low risk of your financial assets than to think of making a high profit by putting your financial assets at high risk. Because if your financial resources are safe then those financial resources will be useful at any time. But if I lose all my wealth in order to gain more profit, I will have nothing to support me in times of danger. But through Bitcoin, it is possible to earn profit by investing in a short period of time without investing much time. If you are trading with a large amount of capital and fixed a certain target, then there is no need to invest more time. Because buying coins with more capital when the market goes down relatively little and selling when the market goes up a little will show you a good amount of profit.Quote from: Negotiation on April 09, 2023, 02:25:35 AMDo you think there could be anything other than Bitcoin in terms of long-term planning?Bitcoin is the first and best choice if you are planning a long-term investment considering security. Since you are investing your money for a long time, if you do not invest in a trusted platform, there is a risk of losing your money. As Bitcoin is always best for long term investment I will definitely choose Bitcoin for long term investment.",

And many days ETH has more volume than BTC even if the market cap for BTC is higher.I think the reason why is because there seems to be more trades for ETH and it’s more volatile. You can scalp 25 ETH all day and for every $10 move you catch that’s over $250 profit and a $10 move on ETH is not uncommon.",

I personally think that Bitcoin can be the only product for long-term trade management or long-term planning.Bitcoin trading is much more good, but if you trade good altcoins, it can be good too, but just that bitcoin is more reliable than altcoins, this is the reason I can say that bitcoin trading is also more reliable and can be the best that you can go for. There are different types of trading. Scalping, day trading and swing trading are the types. If you trade frequently, opening and closing positios many times in a day, you may not like bitcoin because of the less volatility, you will pay more on fee on each trading. If you do not want to pay more on fee in trading, you may want to increase the leverage, which is also already making the trading more volatile and riskier. But for day trade with just one or two positions opened, I think trading with bitcoin is better. If you are the type that have enough money to use just 1x leverage for bitcoin trading, I think only bitcoin trading is better too. But if you want to use leverage more than 1x or 2x for bitcoin, some traders may just still use 1x for for some very good altcoins, but just with good altcoins and still less volatile altcoins.Quote from: Negotiation on April 09, 2023, 02:25:35 AMDo you think there could be anything other than Bitcoin in terms of long-term planning?In trading, it is said that traders should use not more than what they can afford to lose to trade. I do not see anything bad to use some good altcoins that you have been studying for a very long time to trade. But what is most important is that you have to be using a leverage that can make liquidation to almost be impossible.I prefer bitcoin trading, but I also trade with some altcoins and make profit but I will reduce the leverage or not using leverage at all.Quote from: adaseb on April 09, 2023, 04:51:25 AMThese days I actually swing trade ETH more than BTC. And many days ETH has more volume than BTC even if the market cap for BTC is higher.No need of confusing, you mean ether has more volatility, altcoins are most of the time more volatile. Trading is very risky, some people even still see bitcoin to be volatile as they are using high amount of money to trade without using leverage.",

Sometimes these traps are set up by exchanges to liquidate the money of the greedy fellows. Bitcoin will keep you safe from those traps.Trading in Bitcoin is very safe, and you will surely not lose your capital if you invest it in Bitcoin, but instead you will earn profits in long term. The profit ratio of Bitcoin is lower than that of those pumping altcoins, but after the pump they will be dumped badly. There is even potential of high profit in Bitcoin, but that is for only those who can Hodl it for long term.",

So for long term, it is advisable to stick with bitcoin. Just remember that we talking long term investment, it could be subjective, but the best approach will be like a full cycle of holding, bear->bull. Meaning you buy when the price is down in bear market, accumulate and then hold till the bull market and at least time when we are about to peak, all time high and sell and make that profits.If you are going for a prime mover altcoin, the best bet could be Ethereum, in my opinion. There could be others like BNB, ADA or those in the top 10. But there we still need to be very cautious and not put huge amount of them.",
