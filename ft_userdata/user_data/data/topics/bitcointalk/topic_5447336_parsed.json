  "content": "A simple and concise guide for new traders help those traders to achieve their trading goals. 1. Start trading with a \"Trading plan\"A trading plan is a very important step for a trader. A trading plan is a proper way to plan your trading goals by making proper steps that could allow you to earn profits from your trading activates. It's necessary to make a proper trading plan by writing your investment goals and desired returns of the investment as well as a timeline to achieve those goals. Without a proper and working trading plan one can never earn enough profits from trading and the chance of loss is also higher for such person.2. Educate yourself about tradingA good trader always tries to learn about trading from various sources that include books, online courses, and other available stuff present on the internet. the traders who have no knowledge about trading are prone to face huge losses in trading and that's why it's better to learn about trading and its concepts as a first step before doing any actual trades.3. Start smallIt's necessary to get familiar with trading process, and that can be done with very little amount of money in beginning. The traders who begin their trading journey with a little amount of money will always have higher advantage over the ones who begin with huge sums of money because the prior ones won't get impacted by lost trades as much as the later ones.4. Invest what you can afford to loseMany traders start trading by investing a lot of money into it, and they don't know that in trading one can also face losses sometimes. When those traders lose that money then they think that why they have invested that much into trading. A good trader only invest the amount of money into trading that he/she can afford to lose, and investing is more than that is unnecessary. 5. Diversify your portfolio: Someone who diversify his/her portfolio can reduce the risk of loss to huge extents. A good trader often diversify his portfolio by investing in various class of assets because a single asset in a single market can sometimes be a cause for huge losses and that's why a good trader should diversify his/her portfolio.6. Use stop-loss ordersWhen you are investing in a market then it's important to use risk management tools such as stop-loss to limit your potential losses. A stop-loss order is an order placed with a broker to sell a security when it reaches a predetermined price, designed to prevent significant losses by automatically closing out your position.7. PracticeTo become a successful trader one need to do trading practice on daily basis because a trader always has to learn and master new things and those require practicing. A trader who give proper time to practicing his/her trading skills often gets higher advantages during real time trading. A trader doesn't always need to have real money to begin practicing trading because such trader can begin with a demo account, and he/she can improve his/her trading skills by practicing with virtual money.",

By starting small, you will have other small capital pieces to restart your trading after your first, second, third trading piece ends with failure and you lose most of that capital piece.I don't know how many capital pieces is needed to change a newbie trader from failed one to successful one? Ten times or twenty times or more, I don't know, it's personal issue but I am sure it is not easy to be a successful trader.",

So apart from good trading plan, if good money management is not part of it, it is good as no plan. Another important point is our money that is involved which becomes a source of concern for us and that increases the instability of our emotions because we are likely going to be making decisions based on the equity we have which is different from demo account trading that you can allow a losing trade to run until it returns back to profit. In real trading, if you allow your losing trade to run then you may not find any equity to continue another trade",

It's a roadmap to follow inother to stabilize the chart. A very solid foundation for traders and profits is the ultimate priority. Know the rate of losses you can take in and don't be move or become greedy to close a trade when the market is moving in your direction. I used trading view to analyze charts for good entries, I bear in mind not to expect too much from the market because it's volatility can scattered plans anytime.",

Not only beginners can't control emotions, many times it is seen that many experienced traders lose millions of dollars while trading. Whether trading short-term or long-term, there are always risks involved in trading and managing emotions is very important. So I think this point of emotion control is very important to get the desired result in trading. Because I myself still fail to control my emotions while trading.",

Because I myself still fail to control my emotions while trading.Unstable emotions or psychological states certainly have a cause, whether it is because the trading strategy is not as expected, or suddenly the market trend decreases due to some scattered FUD. There are many factors that make psychology unstable and overflow emotions so the trading plan that has been made does not match what is expected. and having more than one trading strategy is quite useful when the first trading strategy fails.The first point discussed by the OP about the trading plan includes doing good and correct trade management. Without any management then trading can not run perfectly. Must do financial management, and risk management and build good portfolio management. Like the tips given by Crypto COBAIN about Portfolio Management. You can learn it and adjust it to the type of market capitalization Large, medium, or small.",
