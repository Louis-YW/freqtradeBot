First of all this board is dedicated towards forum related discussions only and this belongs to Reputation board or specifically the topic mentioned above by @Solosanz and you can celebrate your 365 days on the forum.It seems to be that one self praising threads on B&H section that are created with the intention of earning more merits and frankly saying passing full year on the forum is not a big task as you see we have been here from years and if all started creating these threads then there will be piles of them on these boards spamming up the forum.You have created some good threads like you mentioned above but posting them here is no good and this whole thread don't serves a good purpose so make sure not to indulge in these practices.Edit : The thread has been already moved to the Reputation board.",
