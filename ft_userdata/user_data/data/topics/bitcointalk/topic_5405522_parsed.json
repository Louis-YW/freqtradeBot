The ASIC controller would a driver on the host PC with only minimal FW required onthe card.ASIC cards would be avaialable at lower price points opening the market to smaller operations.The Future bit Moonllander was an interesting proof of concept but was limited to USB power and was effectivelyjust a toy. A PCIe expansion card would not be so limited.",

BTC is not so decentralized as many people think - this what i say for years  Interesting idea ASICs for PCIe, i see big use case for this.I have also the hope to see more FPGA´s for normal consumers in the future and thanks Teamredminer for be the first miner with integrated FPGA support.Quote from: adaseb on July 08, 2022, 03:31:21 AMI think this would be possible but it wouldn’t be cost effective.

Yeah i see your point, but mining ETH with Asics is more efficent - but we all mine it also with GPU - because this ETH Asics are to expensive. And you can expand your \"ASIC PCIe RIG\" with one card after another. You can use PCIe splitter to expand and so on.",
