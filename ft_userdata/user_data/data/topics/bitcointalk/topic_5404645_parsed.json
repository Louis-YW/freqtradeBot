  "content": "First started investing in crypto 4 months ago but have not really thought about the tax I will have to pay when I withdraw profits. I have £4k now invested overall and plan on holding until I at least 10x my money in the next bull run. The majority of my holdings are in Coinbase, two in FTX & I have my CRO on crypto.com. Being from UK , how much are we taxed when we cash out our profits and how do we go about paying this tax?",

You can search us \"self assessment tax registration\" to find out what you'll have to do. You'll be taxed about 10-20% on the profits you make and those should be easy to calculate if you can download your history from coinbase, ftx and crypto.com easy enough.",

      "body": "Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on June 30, 2022, 01:56:38 PMBeing from UK , how much are we taxed when we cash out our profits and how do we go about paying this tax? Capital gains if you've generated money from what you've earned. So, it'll be something like profit - investment = x, then they take a percentage off that profit. So, I think its 20%, don't quote me on that as I haven't looked it up. Obviously, goes without saying, this isn't financial advise, but generally that's how its done. Income is taxed different, well it's still 20% or whatever the changes were recently with the tax. I haven't sat down yet, and looked at it. I've just sent my records off to my accountant, but will wait until I get the documents back to actually break it down. My advise is either look up on the government website, HMRC, and do a self assessment once you've understood everything or pay an accountant 100-200 to do it for yourself, and have piece of mind. Here's a good website: https://listentotaxman.com/ again not to be relied on, but can give you a idea of the breakdown. Although, isn't as useful for capital gains tax, mainly income tax. Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on July 01, 2022, 02:38:03 PMMy salary is £30,500.If I was to cash out £50,000 profit for example , what would the total tax be I have to pay?(If too confusing or long don't worry about it)You're in the first tax bracket with that wage, i.e not the 40% or 50%. It increases above 51k off the top of my head. Again, ballpark figures, check these for yourself, but it's around that amount, not exact. If you had £50,000 profit on top of your salary, you'd be reaching into the higher tax bracket, and therefore would be paying more tax on anything over that threshold. Quote from: FERDYs on July 01, 2022, 02:28:02 PM£30,000 + £40,000 - £12,300 = £57,700. This is above £50,270 which means the rate applicable to your capital gains is 20%.Capital Gains Tax:£40,000 - £12,300 = £27,700£27,700 * 20% = £5,540Once again, I suggest that you consult an accountant. Taxation can be complicated and you could miss other details that affects the computation. Even my example could be inaccurate.I do believe you can take away to initial investment, so £4,000 in the example provided. Since, you only get taxed on profit, so worth putting that into the calculations. Although, again not 100% on that, since I let my accountant do all the number crunching, as I find it easier, and just more peace of mind.",
