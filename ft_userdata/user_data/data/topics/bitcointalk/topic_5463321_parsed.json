At least according to all the volatility charts.Most likely it’s due to summer and due to people just losing interest in crypto. All eyes are on the Bitcoin spot etf getting approved and eventually launched. Then we should see a large trigger of new money flowing in. Right now it’s just going to keep trading sideways for weeks.",

It's like a long wait for the Bitcoin price to start increasing and breaking above $30k levels. But before that happens, it looks like we will see another up and down movement like before.You can buy it now if you want. You can also buy later when the price decreases. It's up to you but you have to analyze before deciding. But to trade, you have to be more careful because Bitcoin's current movement is difficult to predict.And to me, the current price movement looks sideways and still waiting for the moment to increase. But I don't think the sudden increase is coming, at least this month. It's just a possibility because we don't know the truth. So be careful when deciding.",

What you are possibly referring to is your local fiat dumping faster than dollar (hence the exchange rate going down). In which case converting your fiat to bitcoin for as long as your fiat is dumping could be a good opportunity. Of course your should first educate yourself about Bitcoin, wallets, etc. so that you just don't lose what you bought!",

You have to focus on the long term. The worst thing you can do is think about buying today to sell in two weeks or two months. Buy to hold for 5 or 10 years and then you will see real profits. In 10 years time the current price will look like a bargain, so if you have that long term view you will buy at these levels to the extent of your financial ability.",

Do you think the price will continue voraciously by the day?If you want to hodl bitcoin, you can do it now because nobody can tell how the price will be in the near future, but with the way things are going, this is the time you should buy bitcoin if you wish to do the investment because the price of bitcoin has been normal for investment for the past month now, and the price can rise at any time, so you can see that anyone who is able to buy by this time, even if the price rises, can do what they want. But with the price now being stable, I think it will be like this for now. However, if you also think you can't buy now, it's up to you to make your decision the way it will favor you, but with the way the bitcoin price was moving early this year, you can see that it's decreasing when compared to the current price. When you make your decision, don't forget to invest the amount you can afford to, mate, because I can see you are still a beginner.",

Do you think the price will continue voraciously by the day?The currency of my country is also losing against the dollar. People prefer to hold their money in dollars because they don't have confidence in the local currency. Others that are are knowledgeable about cryptocurrency are converting their fiat to Bitcoin. But for those in the developed world, the dollar is losing value. I am not an economist but it is glaring that Bitcoin has not lost its value since it was created because it keeps regaining its losses over the years. It is also believed that it will get to ATH within the next few years. Lump-sum investing might not be a bad idea but Dollar cost average should be the best option when investing on a small scale. It helps to spread the risk and the purchase less burdensome. See bitcoin as a long time investment if you want to benefit from it because the price doesn't move like altcoins. The price move gradually over a while. But if you want to be a trader, you need to understand how the market moves in a short time.",

So, this is an opportunity to have bitcoin based on the ability to buy because the opportunity to get a profit is still open if you are able to survive in holding for some time to come.Various estimates of many sources began to emerge to the surface that the situation happy for Bitcoin holders had approached the target caused by various positive signals that were summarized and analyzed.",
