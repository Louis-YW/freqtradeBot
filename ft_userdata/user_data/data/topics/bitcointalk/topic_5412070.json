  "content": "I suspect NVIDIA is in a lot of trouble for a couple of reasons:1. Their graphics cards are not selling anymore for a whole bunch of reasons such as:1.1 The global corona pandemic/vaccines killing gamers. 1.2 Transient-corona-gamers dumping their graphics cards and going back to work.1.3 The cryptocoin market collapsed, possibly caused by countries banning/blocking/outlawing bitcoin.1.4 Power supplies not capable of handling NVIDIA's latest and graphics RTX 3080, RTX 3090 and RTX 4080, RTX 4090.1.5 The Ukraine vs Russia war rising energy prices, bad for miners, miners shutting down.1.6 The global inflation making everything expensive no more money for a graphics card !Now the solution:All those people/gamers that received LOVE from NVIDIA during their lifes through fantastically beautifull gaming, I call upon you, to participate in the following BAIL OUT PLAN for NVIDIA:The plan is very simple, all of us that received this LOVE, we will will buy bitcoin in the ammount of exactly:0.00101010 bitcoins.As long as the purchase price remains below 100 euro or 100 dollar every LOVER will be able to buy !This exact bitcoin ammount is chosen as a binary signal/support such that it will not cost more than 100 euro/dollar as long as the bitcoin price remains below:100 euro / 0.00101010 = 99000,099000099000099000099000099 euro.Currently this ammount of bitcoin is worth/could be bought for:0.00101010 * 20195.54 = 20,399514954 euro + transaction costs (? hopefully it can be set so that this exact ammount can be purchased ?)In case you want to buy up to a 100 euro/dollar for this project/support experiment/bailout then you should purchase multiples of this exact bitcoin ammount but to different bitcoin addresses.For those unfortunate LOVERS that have been banned/blocked from buying or selling bitcoins there is still HOPE for you. In case you have sufficient bitcoin you can still participate in this SUPPORT campaign, by transferring this exact ammount from your existing bitcoin address to a new bitcoin address.The fun part in doing this is:1. Driving up the bitcoin price gently.2. Sending a big fat signal that we want to save NVIDIA.3. Showing the entire world our power.4. Showing the entire world our determination.5. Making an nice profit.",

Showing the entire world our power.4. Showing the entire world our determination.5. Making an nice profit.It would only drive up Bitcoin prices temporarily, and that's assuming you get enough users in the first place to buy Bitcoin at that amount, which is unlikely in the long term hence the temporary part. Also, I doubt Nvidia is dying as you say. They're the most well known brand, and are still the most popular hardware for not only gaming, but the corporate world. They aren't the one's we should be worried about, I'd much rather be concerned about smaller businesses. Also, Nvidia while having decent hardware have always been rather expensive. So, I'm not sure why anyone would have the brand loyalty that you're displaying here. They've a manufacturer, but charges you what they deem worth it, to mass produce these things. They certainly aren't looking to do you any favours, especially when typically similar hardware, albeit less supported can be found for cheaper. Showing the world our power, and determination doesn't really benefit anything really. Plus, even if you got a million users to do it, it would be short lived news, that wouldn't change anything much, and would be forgotten about within a week. The profit part might be true, depending on how long these buyers hold, and at what point they get out. Bitcoin could be susceptible to another decline, and your buying power isn't likely to change that, since you will find it hard to get people to follow this movement. I get brand loyalty to some extent, but it's not like Nvidia have looked after each, and every one of us. Plus, those that game on their systems are paying for it, just how you pay for your electricity, and other utilities.",

Apart from energy companies, and the like I'd go as far to say that the vast majority >95% are taking hits due to the recessions caused by either war, the pandemic or a combination of the two. Plus, we're very likely still feeling the effects of the 2008/2009 recession also. Honestly, the competitiveness of Bitcoin miner actually helps the average consumer since graphics cards have become less beneficial to mine with over the years, and therefore less competition, and lower prices for everyone. I do believe the current prices are from miners somewhat, but I'm also pretty sure there's been global shortages in certain materials. Wasn't it something to do with the conductors?",

If so what is it?BTW, you failed to mention the coming POS transition of Ethereum (not that I'm agreeing to most of the given reasons).You might want to add that  1. How the value was chosen, it was a bit complex but not too complex, here it is:First I started with 100 euro max at a price point of 50.000 euro.So this leads to:100 / 50.000 = 0,002So basically this is the maximum fraction that one would buy of that 50.000 price point to stay below the 100 euro/dollar.However the price is currently: 20.000 / 0,002 = 40 euro, which is ok.So basically the factor 0.002 can also be seen as a bitcoin ammount/factor of the total price.So now we just find a nice digital looking number below 0.002:   (I think I also did some divisions and such but is not necessary):0.001 is below 0.002 so now we just add some binary digits to it, flip flopping as well go:0.00101010Bitcoin is capable of handling 8 digits behind the dot, so the above value 0.001 filled with flipped digits until we have 8 behind the dot.Now re-computing what this gives at different price points:0.00101010 x 20000 = 20,202 ~= 20 euros0.00101010 x 40000 = 40,404 ~= 40 euros0.00101010 x 50000 = 50,505 ~= 50 euros0.00101010 x 100000 = 101,01 ~= 100 euros.So I realized this digital number/fraction is a bit low, so we can push it all the way up close to 100.000 to compute the actual limitation take:100 euro / 0.00101010 = 99000,099000099000099000099000099 euros  price per bitcoin.Unfortunately no hidden message, would have been cool, but maybe somebody can come up with a hidden message",

      "body": "I think the op is inaccurate on many accounts.Gamers wanted NVIDIA cards, they were willing to buy at MSRP or up to 30% more expensive whenever a GPU was available. I don't think the pandemic killed gaming at all. The problem was with Ethereum miners, wanting tons of GPUs for their mining farms and willing to pay way more than a GPU should cost. So the prices were crazy and people were waiting, hoping for it to be over. Now that the market is down, miners are suddenly not so interested. You can now buy a GPU of the last generation at MSRP in many places (although not everywhere), but given that the 40s series seems to be around the corner, gamers have waited long enough already to upgrade to the new ones. As for power supplies, it's not really an issue because there exist good and strong power supplies that can handle whatever the new series bring (and for 3080 it's totally fine). Also, while inflation is rising, GPUs currently cost way less than, say, 8 months ago, when inflation wasn't an issue but chip shortage and scalping were.NVIDIA is a leader on the market of GPUs, they'll be alright. They'll make less money, yes, but I don't think there's any chance they'll actually go out of business.",

I don't think the pandemic killed gaming at all. I mean with everyone off school, and off work there was probably a lot more people playing games, and therefore paying for computers with the latest hardware. That probably drove up the prices. To be honest, I'm having a hard time believing that Nvidia are struggling at all. I imagine they've seen record sales, right? Or at the very least record profits, due to the pandemic pushing everyone into their homes, and therefore looking for things to do, one of which would be gaming, especially since most people couldn't visit friends.",

But, at the moment with the 4xxx coming out the 3xxx sales are slowing as predicted.While the PoW to PoS for ETH might matter there are 3 things to consider.1) Most of ETH mining was being done with ASICs or cards that are not really suitable for home / gaming so those will not be hitting the secondary market hard2) A lot of the GPU miners will keep trying other algos / coins for a while before giving up so those will slowly trickle into the market as they give up3) [guess] A lot of GPU mining is being done with older cards by people with free / cheap electric and cards that outside of mining have no value since they are so old / slow / outdated.-Dave",
