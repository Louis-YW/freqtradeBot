It seems UnionPay is blocked in Europe in many places online and offline, which I feel is a good indicator to push DeFI even more without regulations. this is ridiculous, I can't withdraw my money because of traditional finance such as ATM networks have chosen to block UnionPay cards quite much everywhere... at least in EU.",

      "body": "For those who are wondering what's UnionPay = one of the biggest card issuers in the world, even bigger than Visa and Mastercard... their only fault is that they are Chinese corporation and a lot of russians are using their cards. I'm not russian nor chinese. This is really the field of which cryptos are intended for. For taking control of your own finances. But it doesn't really work if there's no connection to fiat money - at least yet. Let's invent something that works.",
