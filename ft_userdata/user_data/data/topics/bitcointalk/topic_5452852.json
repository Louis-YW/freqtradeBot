      "body": "The increasing number of wallets holding at least one Bitcoin is a clear indication that Bitcoin adoption is on the rise, and more individuals are showing interest in owning and utilizing it. As a result, it's probable that the demand for Bitcoin will increase, which could lead to a gradual increase in its value over time. Nonetheless, it's worth noting that Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and its value is susceptible to significant fluctuations in response to market conditions",

      "body": "Thats a big number. Having one bitcoin is really big thing. It can be considered as investment, holding or whatever. For what they've achieved during the years we can expect more people getting aware of it. When the holding increases we can experience the increase in the adoption. This gives the common holders to stay positive and make use of each and every opportunity. Majority of the wallet owners seems to be between 25 and 40 years of age.Quite often we were able to experience the changes happening in the market out of the volatility. Some state that the price will stabilize beyond certain point, in real-time it is highly impossible as the demand to supply market continues on its track.",

      "body": "Indeed, this is worth celebrating; in every bullish and bearish market, there is always a change of ownership among Bitcoin holders. Most people see the bull run as an opportunity to sell off all their holdings, which is why there will always be others willing to buy and bag up more. This 1 million address holds at least 1 bitcoin. There could still be possible holders out there whose holdings are not being recorded because they might be holding their coins on a centralized platform where all their holdings are recorded as part of the exchange's own until they withdraw them to their personal wallet. I believe after the halving, we might as well see an increase in the amount of wallets holding more, even above 1 bitcoin.",

I have a wallet with over 1 BTC, yet my coins are spread across multiple addresses, so I don't have a single address with >1 BTC. I probably never had such address, even in the earlier days, when the price was lower, because back then I was moving my coins a lot.Also, the addresses with >1 BTC could belong not to single users, but to organizations that hold someone else's coins.",

The important thing I guess is we see that there's 1M wallets that have been filled with 1 BTC and all of them are holding. While it's estimated that satoshi has got 1M supply and that will never be recovered. We can think of how many of these are no longer in circulation while these 1 btc's that are in these wallets, this only simplifies  that many have been taking care even of themselves and hold at least even 1 btc.",

According to the report, That is good news, this means Bitcoin users continue to rise every day and strengthen the system. And, I hear not only 1 BTC but, another nominal like 0.1 BTC also rise in every day, from 1 million in 2019 to 3 Million in 2023. I think people around the world is understood very much the function and how they take advantage of the investment. Bitcoin is one of the strongest investments than other instruments, like stock, and gold. That probably will rise with the new user, especially at the same time with a halving moment where Bitcoin always hype, and will appear frequently on in every news.",

They even are not able to identify what are addresses belong to one owner. Addresses can be connected that they belong to one wallet if they have transactions in history that help explorers to connect those addresses.I agree with you that the writer should have a note about it and without note, it is like they intentionally hide the truth but we can not exclude possibility that the writer even does not know about this technical thing.You can use LookintoBitcoin.com with some charts for addresses with balance > x+ amount BTChttps://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/addresses-greater-than-0-1-btc/",

I mean, it wouldn't make sense for that number to increase if mass adoption itself isn't increasing. One person doesn't need too many wallets even if they have the habit of moving or spreading their Bitcoin possessions. I'd say that most people like that wouldn't need more than 30 wallets that they would actively use. And the number of people who would need more wallets than that are probably quite few. I believe that the number of wallets having at least one bitcoin will keep on increasing with time, especially on bull run seasons.",

As the day passes by, lots of people are beginning to see the importance and need of holding bitcoin. I would not be surprised if the holders of bitcoin surpasses this very number stated here but i believe it would definitely be more than that in the nearest future as the  case maybe, there have been series of holders whos bitcoin holdings are very much little  but in the future, it would develop a bit-better than as it is now even much better.",
