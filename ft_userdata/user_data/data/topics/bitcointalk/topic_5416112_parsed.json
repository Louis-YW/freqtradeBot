Coldcard is also a very good wallet because it has the option to be used in an air-gapped manner which means it doesn't ever need to be connected to a computer.For new users either any of the two most popular wallets are beginner friendly and will keep your bitcoin safe.",

Trezor provides you with a reliable, efficient, mobile and 100% secure hardware Cryptocurrency wallet. When you get all these features from a trezor product then it's up to you to decide if trezor is the best, but in my opinion Trezor is the best.",

      "body": "Welcome to the roller coaster ride with us. Yes, that's great because you are a newbie and have realized that it is not good to store assets on centralized exchanges, \"not your keys, not your money\".Currently we have many different types of cold wallets, but the two most popular and widely used are Trezor or Ledger that you mentioned. Both are good and worth using, you can choose either, as long as it suits your pocket. What's more important is that when you own it, how you take care of them must be a top priority. No matter how good a wallet is, if you don't store it carefully, your assets are still dangerous as usual.This is a list of hardware wallets compiled by a reputable member that you can refer to, but I still recommend using one of the two wallets you mentioned.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5282364.0",

You shouldn't keep your bitcoin on an exchange and that's not only due to possibility of getting hacked. You shouldn't keep your bitcoin on an exchange, because in this way, you give them full control over your bitcoin and they can freeze your fund at any time for any reason. It's always recommended to use a non-custodial wallet or a hardware wallet.Take note that you don't have to use a hardware wallet. You can use electrum and if you want to be 100% secure, you should install it on an airgapped device.If you want complete security and you can't use an airgapped device for any reason, you should use a hardware wallet.",

Overall though, pretty decent wallet even though there are some huge downsides.",

Detected when access using different IP address and Coinbase need your authorize on email notification send, I think if your account get hacked and you still have email in your hand they can't access to your Coinbase account.
