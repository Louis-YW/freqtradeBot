It's because blockchain.com has organically funnels any new users while using google when searching bitcoin wallets. OP might register when he still newbie or still newbie in this spaceI suggest to OP that listen to those guys suggesting above. Electrum is way more better to use as a wallet.",

Its the wallet with more bugs if I am not wrong so switch to Electrum as omega mentioned to feel what is the experience of using an actual wallet.",

Blockchain.com has a history of too low/too high recommended fee, I wouldn't trust them. But I'm guessing OP's problem is more than just setting a fee too low for blockchain.com eyes.",
