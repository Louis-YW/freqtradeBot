When you're spreading the word about Bitcoin, instead of bragging about how awesome it is, just share the cool stuff like how it's helping folks who don't have access to traditional banking or how it helped you and people you know. Keep the language or the jargons laid-back, address any doubts people might have and tell them some real stories of Bitcoin doing good. Tbh, this is just a casual conversation for me and my friends when we were in undergrad and didnt have any money at all. We were all just full of hopes haha Just try to build a vibe of community",

      "body": "I am pretty confused. What do you mean by being proud here? Do you want to hide yourself even though you advertise related Bitcoin? And advertise online or in real life? It depends on how you are advertising Bitcoin. If you want to advertise something related to Bitcoin, then you may hide yourself in various ways. Based on the advertising platform, you have to find specific solutions. If you want to advertise in real life and Bitcoin is legal in your jurisdiction, then you can still hide yourself by hiring a marketing team who will advertise on your behalf.",

At the point of been a bitcoin earner,minner,marketer as well trading how can one be free of proud reason because is a genuine business compare to many illegal business people indulge on.I am finding it difficult to understand the information you are trying to pass across but I assume that you mean how to introduce people to Bitcoin without being boastful. It is common to hear about so-called Bitcoin investment experts telling you how they made millions from the sector. Some of these news might be true while others are just intended to lure people into get-rich-quick schemes. For me, you don't need to tell people how much you are worth or how much you have made from Bitcoin to advertise the coin. Tell people about Bitcoin as a currency or an investment platform and allow them to decide to join the space. You don't need to be proud or boastful to attract people to BItcoin.     QuoteSecondly I understand that any business people engage without being proud why advertising it have questionable character. As a beginner on this platform I have seen Bitcoin as business one need be proud of, because is of more legal backing even though many nation have not approved it, is more acceptable  because only few business can be compare with Bitcoin in genuineness because many are illegal that some time involved bloodshed,loss of life etc, the reward of Bitcoin,it value freedom to operator with any level of certifications has brings many people with lost hope into a renew hope,this few point still ask if proud during advertisement on Bitcoin can be removed.The part of your post is also confusing but you cannot be proud of an illegal business. I will always tell people that I am involved in Bitcoin because the coin is legal and genuine. Even if it is banned in my country, I might devise several legal means to acquire it. I want to also advice that you don't go around telling everybody that you own Bitcoin because it could be risky.",

But an advertisement of a new technology or platform needs to create a persona in most of the cases. So without creating a persona, the advertisement will be generic in nature. Which may not be able to reciprocate the benefits of this new technology. So the boasting is a part of the promotion which can create a perception in people's mind and create FOMO. Unfortunately, that's how marketing works.",

Many people will misconstrue you and think you're referring to Bitcoin as having an attribute of pride. What you're saying is one having faith and being confident to associate oneself with Bitcoin investment. Yes, that's true. Come to think of it, Bitcoin is the bedrock of the crypto industry. Remove Bitcoin, and I'm sure the industry will collapse. People take pride to say they're Bitcoin investors even when they're clearly not.",

Try making it in clear terms and believe me, you would get the responses you hope to get on this thread.I don’t believe you’re not an English speaker but, writing might be the issue here. Try and get it fixed and perhaps, come up with better composure and a topic that would have a good correlation with what is being discussed.",

But that's impossible to do, advertising must be public.If people think the ad is arrogant because they feel proud, it's up to their perspective.People just need to know what bitcoin is, and how it works. Easy as that. Moreover, the advertisement will not discuss Bitcoin too technically because it will be quite difficult for ordinary people to understand.Unless there is an in-depth discussion about bitcoin, a technical discussion is needed to make it more comprehensive.",

If Bitcoin is illegal in your country, you should be careful and refrain from having public conversations about Bitcoin. One should be proud to be a bitcoiner but should never expose how much money he has in Bitcoin. Your hodlings are your private property and information like that should not be shared with a third person even if you’re teaching that person about Bitcoin. There are better ways to introduce someone to Bitcoin without telling them your success story in Bitcoin. Perhaps you should wait for the festivities to end before posting. You probably typed this while holding a bottle of champagne in one hand.",

Honestly, I read through twice and couldn't understand what he meant, especially when legal and illegal came into the article.Appearing boastful while introducing bitcoin to others could be a habit picked by the one who bitcoin is being introduced to. Well, could proud and being boastful mean that the person is talking much about the fortunes bitcoin brought them?I do not go to people to talk to them about bitcoin. When you approach people to tell them about bitcoin, you will have much to prove and many questions to answer. But if they come to you, the work will be so easy to do.",

I think this has to do with individual personality and how you relate to the people you’re trying to tell about bitcoin. Bitcoin does not have such rule to guide it but why being so proud of yourself because you own some bitcoin in your portfolio. To me, you’re already breaching your privacy and making it publicly known, it is better you keep it to yourself and only share what is needed for others to know about bitcoin. Not all that glitters are actually gold, so you have to be extra careful on this ecosystem.",
