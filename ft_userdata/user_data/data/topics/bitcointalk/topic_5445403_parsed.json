Votetoo is a platform that allows people from all around the world to come together and share their opinions on a variety of global issues. Whether you're interested in politics, social justice, the environment or something else entirely, Votetoo has something for you. The VOTE token has been designed to allow users to easily log in to the system and cast their votes on important issues that affect the world. This whitepaper outlines the technical aspects of the VOTE token, its uses and its potential impact on the world.Technical AspectsThe VOTE token is based on the Bitgert network, a secure and decentralized blockchain platform that allows for fast and efficient transactions. The BRC-20 standard ensures that the VOTE token is fully compatible with other BRC-20 tokens on the Bitgert network, making it easy to trade and use in various applications.The total supply of VOTE tokens is approximately one token per person on the planet, which equates to around 10 billion tokens.
