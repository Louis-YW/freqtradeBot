My question, is the raffle game will be one of your game in your crypto casino site or you will have 2 different sites? 1 for the raffle and 1 other for the casino/sportsbook?Quote from: Betcrypto.cr on November 06, 2022, 06:28:22 AM1) 100% anonymous we are never going to ask you for any personal info or KYC BS it doesn't matter the amount Is it even possible to have 100% anonymous? How about license? Afaik, crypto casino and sportsbook are always dealing with gambling license and one of the terms is related to KYC. Does it mean that you will not have a license for your casino/sportsbook?Quote from: Betcrypto.cr on November 06, 2022, 06:28:22 AMwhat else should we add?It will to write what you should add if your main focus is only the 5 above features. I suggest you to learn from the older successful casino/sportsbook to see what they have and what they dont have. Follow what they have that attract players and add what they dont have to be more attractive for players.",

The biggest challenge for a casino is to fight against the frauds. Bonus abusers will make your life as hell and eventually they will take your profits resulting the business down. However it you can afford to be 100% anonymous then good luck :-)Quotewhat else should we add?Launch it then you can add any feature on demand. I wonder which provider you are going with?Have regular offers and do effective promotions in all possible advertising networks including on the forum. Feel free to contact me for bitcointalk promotion if you decide.",

It's always great to check out a new websites and see their games. I hope you are successful and can make it work in the gambling industry. Especially your second part sounds very promising, we don't have many casinos with live gambling yet and it would be a good alternative to see actual games and not only virtual ones for a change. One more thing you should be adding if you have the time would be a chat function, so you can interact with other gamblers during the live casino games. Going into sports betting and casino gambling all at once it a lot of work. But your timing is not bad, launching during the christmas period should attract a lot of new customers.  Let's hope you will run some special promotions for the friends here on the forum.",

That would include huge costings as well. Still a broad description for me. But since your main platform is sportsbook aside from being a casino, you should as well highlight it to the extent of how will you create or apply it in your platform which would compete with many gambling sites at this moment. KYC on the other hand is a small thing to other players because some of the players are just using names which aren't them. Making a more detailed list would be better if you really want to catch the audience as early as now.Quote from: Coin_trader on November 06, 2022, 12:31:03 PMTo be clear. Does your casino will have a license to operate right because you are offering games from erd party provider. How can you guarantee that you will never ask KYC if your license is strictly requiring it for AML policy?This would really matter for it to be accessible around the globe. Even if OP is just gauging the idea of his platform, many factors should really be considered.",
