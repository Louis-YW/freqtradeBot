Regarding the recommendation, I think it is pretty much a temporary fix. In the first place, the faulty token implementation is one that should be fixed. In the meantime, it is better for users to triple-check their address, what I usually do instead of when checking the first and last characters, I also check the middle one.",

FYI, the attacker has also spent around $25K (46$BNB and 9$ETH) to carry out this action, this is a new phenomenon in crypto, so be careful if you have a lot of money stored in crypto.",

Go to etherscan2. Search for USDT3. Click on \"Holders\" just beside the \"Transfers\" tabThat's just the manual way of doing it. Imagine if they use a tool or bot to scan the entire chain.",

While these recommendations somehow provide guide to users in securing there funds and transactions, these does not necessarily stop the problem and worries. With the rampant attacks and scam schemes that pops in and out, safety precautions like double checking or adding layers of security should be initiated by ourselves as standard measures in making transactions or any other activity.",

The problem is so many people didn't even carefully to double check the received address before they wanna try to send the transaction. This attack has been using people's carelessness to take the advantage. The transaction in the blockchain was irreversible and that gives advantage to the scammers to take the opportunity from people who didn't wanna spend a few seconds to make sure if the receiver was the correct address. I hope people care about to double check everything.",
