His portfolio might really be that negative (for now) but that owner of said address does really know on where it would be heading. There's no point on cutting losses and there's no point that he would be spending up tons on something that wouldnt be worth. We are talking about millions of dollars on here on which it would really be just that normal that there's always that certain risks because noteverything it would really be going on what we do expect or plan but in speaking about potential then it does really have.DCA on bitcoin isnt really that bad because sooner or later, we would really be seeing the fruit on what we have done earlier.

As far as I can tell, there are still 2535 BTC just chilling at the address bc1qnujzvts45qka3cr2eqqw8ur3q6g6s0ze2wlk5m, which, in my opinion, seems like a cold wallet.

If it is said that it fails, then it is not true. DCA will provide more asset accumulation with different price values. Bitcoin is indeed volatile, not even just bitcoin, all altcoins will be more volatile because they are influenced by Bitcoin. The price movement that continues to fall provides a good opportunity to start buying, and doing DCA with funds that have been provided from the beginning. Then hold for the long term. Then the profit will be more if the main price target has been reached. They must be prepared for all conditions in the crypto market.",

      "body": "I see this was also discussed on reddit a few months ago. I would not say that this is a \"failed DCA strategy\" of an individual, most likely it is a fund of some sort or even cold storage that is being moved to another wallet. I would assume that the movement was initiated by someone accessing the funds and moving them manually, or some automated process (this would explain why it was moving in chunks rather than all at once). Besides, the entire fund is still sitting at the new addresses and has not been moved to any wallets of known exchanges, so I think it is wrong to assume that the Bitcoins have been sold. All in all, OP, I think your statement about \"failed\" DCA strategy is misleading to say the least. There are many other possible explanations for what happened here. How do you know that Bitcoins were actually sold? No clear evidence exists in the blockchain of any such sale. So, I think it's pretty clear that there was no sell-off and the coins were simply transferred to new addresses, possibly as part of an update to improve security.",
