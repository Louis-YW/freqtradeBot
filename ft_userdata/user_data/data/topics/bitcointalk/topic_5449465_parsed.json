  "content": "I recently started Playing lots of games on Dream11 (Fantasy11) where I pick the best playing 11 (including both teams) and place p a bet. It would be really cool if there's a site where you could use Cryptocurrency's to play the same. I think it would nice to start with just Football, Cricket and basketball and slowly add more games in as the site starts to grow, What are your thoughts on this?",

I think there are promotions in most gambling sites I think you can check them all one by one they have unique promotions on every league I think it's better to check them all or participate to all of it as that would really give you a good chance to win good amount of money, you can try to predict different combinations to different gambling sites.",
