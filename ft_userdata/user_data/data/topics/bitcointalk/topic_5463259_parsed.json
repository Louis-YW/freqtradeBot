  "content": "I got a very simple query to ask. I am recently switching from the Mycelium wallet because it has many issues in it's iOS version. It's not much friendly and frustrating to operate on the regular basis. The android version is good but I am not fan of it. Perhaps mycelium is in existence since 2012 but they have not progressed much. Now I want to ask whether there are Wallets that are secure, synchable in between the desktop app and mobile app together?For example if I am going to set up the wallet on desktop then I will have to enter the Private key there. In similar ways when I will set the wallet on my phone then also I will have to set the private key there. Is it going to be issue to insert my private keys on two different devices?",

No issue, but know that your wallet will become more vulnerable as it is online on two devices. One can be better, but also depends on how secure you make your device to be. Avoid malware and store just little amount of coins on it.For high amount of coins, go for cold wallet.For online desktop, you can go for Electrum, Sparrow or Spectre. Or Bluewallet, for MacOS.On mobile, you can go for Bluewallet for Android or iOS, or Electrum for Android. Know that mobile Electrum does not have fee customization but it has fee slider, but which is not that accurate for me.Mycelium wallet? I can not recommend it as a bitcoin wallet. It is not even supporting replace-by-fee.",

It is like that also on Android. There are times you just have to close the app and open the app back. Also if you make transaction, you better check the mempool to customize the fee. The fee estimation is not that accurate, especially few weeks or months ago. Recently that mempool is showing 7 sat/vbyte, Bluewallet will estimated highest fee priority as 6 sat/vbyte which is causing the recent inaccurate few estimation.",

Is there ever a time you are using your computer and you don't have your phone with you, which would require you to have the wallet duplicated on your computer? For most people the answer to that is no.If you are not going to spend bitcoin in person or make transactions on the go, then you don't need your wallet on your phone.Every additional piece of software you import the same seed phrase to increases the attack surface for that wallet. Similarly, every additional device you import the same seed phrase to increases the attack surface for that wallet. There is nothing stopping you duplicating the same wallet across multiple pieces of software on multiple device, but is the increased risk really worth it?",

      "body": "According to my experience it should not be a problem but the best practice i follow is not to logging same wallet on two different device. Because in this way the spammers, hackers have two doorways to break, let's say before there were only one and you were safe too as that door was not breakable but when you created second door then that door might be breakable most of the time the hacks and spams i have seen are on desktop or laptops.Because most of the people prefer to use cracked version of different apps on laptops (windows or IOS) + Most of the user even do not use official windows or any other OS instead they download them from websites (pirated ones).The best practice if you wanted to log in any type of wallet on desktop is to not to use any crack website, or software on your device try not to click on any links etc. Try not to attach any usb or any other external device which might be compromised and then i think you are good to go. But still, these are just my experiences that i am sharing with you i hope you will find these helpful.",

All you are doing is doubling the attack surface, doubling the chance your wallet is hacked, and greatly increasing the chance you accidentally leak your seed phrase when importing it in to a new wallet.If you are going to use your laptop very infrequently, then just keep the wallet on your phone. If you absolutely must interact with the wallet from both your phone and your laptop, then get a hardware wallet and pair it with both devices.",

The stumbling block won't be if your transaction is or is not opted in to RBF, but whether your wallet software supports creating and broadcasting an RBF transaction.There are already several major pools mining full RBF replacements, such as F2Pool and AntPool. And even although a lot of nodes have not enabled full RBF, it is still fairly easy to get a full RBF replacement broadcast through the network. Given that the average node makes 8 connections to peers, with only 25% of the network running full RBF then each node still has a 90% chance of connecting to at least one full RBF node.You can take a look here to see all the full RBF replacements being mined: https://mempool.space/rbf#fullrbf",

You don't buy airgapped 'devices', you create them yourself, by airgapped we mean a wallet that is totally disconnected from the internet and will never be connected to one; it is a DIY wallet. Let's say you download Electrum wallet on a completely airgapped device and verify your download, this wallet holds your keys that won't ever touch the internet, then on another online device you use the master public key of your airgapped wallet to create a watch-only version of the wallet, you use this to create and broadcast transactions that have been signed in your airgapped wallet, that's how it works. Though there are airgapped hardware wallets that you have to purchase, but that's not what my post was about.",

There are indeed several cryptocurrency wallets available that offer secure synchronization between desktop and mobile apps. These wallets often use a seed phrase (also known as a recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase) to securely generate private keys and addresses across different devices.It doesn't offer \"secure synchronization\", if your wallet lets you access the privatekeys, you can actually access your bitcoins in any wallet regardless of the type of device with the default sync process (fetching data from the blockchain). Maybe you're talking about how to securely import the wallet to different devices, which one depends on how you do it.",
