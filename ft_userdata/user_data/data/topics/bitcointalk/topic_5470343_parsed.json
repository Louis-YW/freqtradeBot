  "content": "How are we feeling about Logan Paul Vs Dillon Dannis and KSI vs Tommy Fury Today Scheduel:The main card is due to begin at 7pm BST (11am PT, 1pm CT, 2pm ET). Paul vs Danis is likely to take place at around 10.30pm BST (2.30pm PT, 4.30pm CT, 5.30pm ET), with ring walks for KSI vs Fury expected at 11.30pm BST (3.30pm PT, 5.30pm CT, 6.30pm ET).First fight is KSI vs Tommy FuryI would think Tommy Fury wins this one. I could be wrong as KSI actually moves really good. Interesting matchup, also a lot of passion in it.Main Fight Logan Paul Vs Dillon DannisI dont even know who to bet on this one. As bad as this sounds, Logan looks way better movement wise.The trashtalk on Twitter has been epic tho! No matter who wins, the other is going to need to eat a lot of humble pie!",

Am i missing something here what is that the odds maker are seeing .",

I do not want to see any win by decision in that one, it would leave so much room for doubt on both sides. And yeah, Logan seems so insecure the way he came in, also i can not imagine what will happen should he loose to Dannis after all the trashtalk about Logans wife lol. Will she instantly leave him and go on a bangtour lol",

These are not boxers. These are celebrities trying to make money somewhere away from the stage where they are not the stars. Poor sport of boxing if these kinds of fights will continue to be shown. But promoters don't care much because money is the most important thing to them. They will definitely set a pay per view boxing match between Hailey Beiber and Selena Gomez if they agree. Lol.",

And it was really a disgrace to see how the fight between Dillon and Logan ended. What the hell is Dannis thinking when he try to pull the choke hold on Paul?And then he started to go to the corner after the bell rings and then try to swing on the body guard, and unfortunately, he didn't even hit him. So this is a garbage fight but unfortunately, there are fans that is willing to buy the ticket and so I don't expect them to bitch around and saying that they have been scammed. And that's why this kind of exhibitions fight are going to continue as long as there are fans willing to be scam by this so called social media influencer.",

So much hugging and then crying at the end.Logan vs Dannis showed how bad they both are. Logan was so reckless the entire time with no guard, throwing punches without any thought (maybe the talk about his wife really got him that bad). Dannis on the other hand looked so flat taht theres not really much to say there",

Well, that's a shame for Logan to marry on someone like her but I think that made he push his limits against Danis because of the extra rage and angriness that he brought to him by leaking his fiancee's images.Quote from: OgNasty on October 15, 2023, 07:24:45 AMI think things turned out exactly as I expected that they would.

I didn't watch it and hope others follow too because these scumbags shouldn't make easy big money (I have to admit Jake Paul worth watching).

The thing is that Danis being the MMA fighter didn't even secure that neck and Paul just throw him on the ground and try to punch him but the referee was very quick to stop him.But the reaction of Dillon though, he attack Paul even after the referee has separated them and chase him until Paul's bodyguard was there to stop him. Throw some punch (his best in this fight,   and even failed to hit the body guard). Not sure what the consequences of his action though, but nevertheless Paul was declared the winner so his hype and the bandwagon continues.",
