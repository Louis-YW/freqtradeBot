      "body": "It's actually why a lot of companies buy others that are in distress.If they know the general cost of acquiring a customer within a few percentage points and they know how many customers the place they want to buy has it's just math at that point. You have to figure in 'loss' which would include duplicate customers, those who don't want to use your company for whatever reason, those who will no longer consider using your or any other similar service and so on. But, it's not a bad idea in general.The question is can they make it work if they do acquire Voyager or will that drag down FTX.-Dave",

It's sad to hear that investors will received only part of there money but still it's already good than nothing.It is good for FTX with their reputation to rescue projects that have huge communities behind. In future, FTX will have deals to buy those platforms at very good discounts.For investors who have money stucked at Voyager will have better support to get compensation. Long waiting time to receive gradual compensation is still better than nothing. In their eyes, FTX and Alameda are like heroes. In future, if FTX and Alameda take over those companies, they will receive very strong support from Voyager users.In addition, those users will have more reasons to use FTX exchange like loyal fans.",

Quote from: Wapfika on July 23, 2022, 03:24:52 PMThe supposed to be rescue of FTX is just a drama to get profit from distress investors that will surely liquidate there crypto in fiat directly on FTX.Let's hope this is all it is. I'm having visions of ftx trying to sell a new stablecoin like bitfinex did after some investors lost funds (and this could be a way to return funds back to the users in full - over time - but would be very costly for ftx, perhaps too costly unless there's something valuable they're hoping to acquire from voyager).Quote from: Wind_FURY on July 23, 2022, 01:25:56 PMPlus the money must come from somewhere.

Because not having enough conviction to pump money in the hole will have atrocious consequences.I doubt they'd get much negative press for pulling out though. It's not their company that went bankrupt, it's another they're trying to patch up.They'll get investors angry with them for not offering something high enough or competitive enough which might be something they'd listen to and try to improve their image by fixing the issue but I don't think it's their burden they're taking on here.",

The point is no entity should issue a bail out if the entity doesn't have enough money, or enough conviction to ensure that the bail out actually works. FTX will only be throwing good money after bad if still Voyager still fails after the \"effort\" of a failed bail out.",

They can still roll out this money and if they get lucky, they can be able to recover the full amount that they have lost before and then maybe earn some extra dollars.I think that it was also the ftx exchange last time who got involved on some crypto partnerships.
