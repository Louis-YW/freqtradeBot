I bet this guy had the luck of the entire population all to himself on that day because you can't expect something like that to happen more than once in a lifetime for a single gambler.I'm still surprised to see a lot of people playing dice, as it's so risky and highly unpredictable relying solely on luck with no control. In the long run, you're almost guaranteed to lose, as the likelihood of running out of money becomes very high if you continue playing dice for hours. If you're wise and can control your greed, you'll quit after a few rounds and walk away with a profit",

Trying to chase up those kind of multipliers which would be hitting up that 0.0*** x something? This isnt really that kind of my interest and just like you then it would really be preferring on setting out multipliers which would really be the maximum of 20% winning which i could really be able to get that low. Yes, its true that each gambler is different because there are those people who do really love on chasing up those rolls no matter how slim the chance is but at least they do really enjoy on what they are doing. As long you dont make use that much of money on hunting up these numbers then it should be fine.Getting ourselves that entertained or really that enjoying will really be always that depending on what we do.Im sure that there are other people who do able to hit up those big multipliers on dice but it wont matter much though because as long it won't really be that \"0\" then you would really be having that chance on hitting those spot even if it do takes thousands of bets involved.",

I haven't lost chasing this multiplier, since i do it with Martingale each time it hits i end with profit. And since the bot is made to hit an x8 in the best scenario then you don't need to double up the starting amount, i mean, if i start the run with 100 clams and lose, i can bet 100 clams again and end with profit. And if i lose consecutive times i start increasing the bet. So far my biggest losing streak with this method was like 7 runs.",

Congratulations to the big winner and for his better days.I am also very unlucky when it comes to fast-paced gambling games like dice and roulettes and I think it wasn't for me. And it kind of hard to bagged big wins, especially on dice because most of the bets are usually smaller. Also, the probability of winning is super low, hence taking big wins is really rare. But well I guess, other people are more lucky than others. So, big congratulations as not everyone has the same luck as you.
