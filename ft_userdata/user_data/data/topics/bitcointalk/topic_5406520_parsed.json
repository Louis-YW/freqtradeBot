  "content": "The case of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK have continued to skyrocket and according to the Office for National Statistics, figures show that around 3.5m people in the UK had come down with the deadly virus in the weekend of July 6th as against it's 800,000 recorded from the week before. .  The above chart throws more light on the weekly registered deaths, estimated amount of people with the infection, weekly total admissions to the hospital and the total first set of vaccine doses administered. upload pic    The above charts give us an insight to the statics the ONS where able to conduct and vaccines have been issued out in doses. With them still battling inflation, and now with the newly discovered and fast spreading Omicron in circulation, what are the measures put in place to fight this? Your thoughts, please.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51768274",

However, hospitalizations and severe cases have severely decreased, firstly because of the high vaccination rate and also because of the multiple virus mutations which are slowly turning Covid-19 into a flu.I'm more worried about the upcoming winter, there's already a surge in cases now, we're bound to see another increase in the winter. Resorting to lockdowns will halt the economy, thus, I don't see it as a viable measure, but chances are that it'll be with measures against Covid-19 once again.",

Maybe it might be because Covid-19 has the same symptoms with malaria and typhoid fever that is why it is still unknown to me. Last year I had almost the same symptoms of Covid and it gradually subsided after I took malaria drugs. I am not insinuating that the disease is not real, I am just saying that I have not gotten a first hand information. Cold weather is the best time for pathogens to strive hence, it is expected that infection rate would increase.",

Take a look at their plan.WAYNE ROOT: The Democrat Plan to Steal Midterms. Say Goodbye to Biden & Hello to “King Kong Monkey Covid.”Quote from: https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/07/wayne-root-democrat-plan-steal-midterms-say-goodbye-biden-hello-king-kong-monkey-covid/Do you think the GOP will win a landslide victory in the November midterms? Do you think it will be a cakewalk? Boy are you naïve.I've been warning about what's coming for many months on my nationally-syndicated radio show \"Wayne Allyn Root: Raw & Unfiltered\" on USA Radio Network. It's all starting to happen just as my crystal ball predicted.First, I've been warning nonstop that Democrats are planning to steal the 2022 midterms, just like they stole the 2020 presidential election. More on that in a moment.Second, I've been warning that Democrats (and their PR wing in the mainstream media) are planning to bring back Covid hysteria again. Just in time to steal the 2022 midterm election. This is the perfect timing to demand universal mail-in ballots, with no Voter ID or signature match to steal the midterms.Third, I've been warning that Democrats would find a way to force Joe Biden out of office and then blame this whole economic disaster on him- thereby deflecting blame from the Democrat Congress.Don't look now, but it's all starting to happen. The signs are all there.First, Covid. It's back- just as I've predicted for many months. Just read the tea leaves. The WHO just recommended indoor masks for everyone. New York has mandated indoor masks again. Los Angeles is mandating indoor masks starting in two weeks. Both cities claim to be inundated with Covid cases....",

This tells quite a powerful story.High cases is a consequence of the removal of all requirements for self-isolation and social distancing, and the guidance that even if you test positive, you should still go in to work or school if you feel able.This guidance may or may not be considered somewhat controversial, and whilst it is partly a consequence of the latest variant being less deadly than earlier variants, it's also a direct consequence of the high levels of protection conferred by what has been a hugely successful vaccination programme.If you're interested in the data for the UK, this is a great source that has everything you need: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-kingdomQuote from: BADecker on July 18, 2022, 11:06:14 PMHello to “King Kong Monkey Covid.”King Kong is an ape, not a monkey.

This means that they were already almost dead from cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc., already before Covid hit them, and nobody knows for sure what they died from.The 6% that died from Covid without comorbidities, is far less than any annual Cancer deaths... far less than any annual heart disease deaths... far less than any annual diabetes deaths... and even less than any annual car accident deaths.Then, when there were too few comorbidity deaths to count (because all the deathly sick, comorbidity people had already died), then the vaccines came. People started to die from something after they got the jabs. It looked like Covid. Maybe it even was Covid. But it affected regular, healthy folks after the vaccines came, not before.Was it caused by the vaccines? Loads of doctors say it was and still is. So does the timing.
