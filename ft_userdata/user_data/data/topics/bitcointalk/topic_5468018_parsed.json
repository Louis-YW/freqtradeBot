They just want to enjoy easy life without putting in any effort. Unknown to many is the fact that what appears to be free on the surface may actually come with huge consequences.  Scammers hide under this guise to get their victims.

I use the sites for many times and it was not profitable. I can remember that a pay-to-click site even directed me to a fake mining site that said it has mined 0.005 BTC for me that I should pay half amount into a bitcoin address for me to receive the bitcoin mined, it was a scam and luckily I did not pay. Faucets and pay-to-click are waste of time.",

I know how cheap it was to claim Bitcoin faucets in 2015 and 2016, a very serious person is capable of gathering 0.5BTC from faucets only by joining different faucet platforms, some comes in 30 minutes claim, some an hour and some are more than an hour, today, faucet is done for good.It was a skill to be a faucet hunter years ago, either you like it or not, many made cool amount of BTC, Litecoin, Doge coin with faucet. Later Airdrops came, and as stupid as airdrop sounds today, it changed the lives of many people when it was still 🔥 hot, things changed, time went by, we all need to move forward, isn't we? Even if you learn a skill, it's mostly time-based, as time goes on you will need to adjust yourself or remain in the same spot, the best I can say is, be willing to learn something new, even if what you know right now is enough for the rest of your life.",

I still have a part of the earnings from faucets when I was just starting to get interested in them, and the amount I have is not very small, let's say you should be in the signature campaign you are currently in for several years to earn that amount. Of course, nothing is free, but in the beginning the faucets were something interesting, and you didn't have to click all day to get through them all, because then faucet rotators were popular - in a little more than an hour you could collect more than 300 000 satoshi + earnings from referrals.You're generalizing things, because you can also say that everyone who was an early adopter spent all the BTC they had, although we know that's not the case since the blockchain is public and we see daily transactions involving coins mined in the first few years of Bitcoin's existence.",

The thing is that there are certain things we put our time into years back that we never knew or were not so sure of them gaining value today but we just gave it the benefits of doubt. 1btc today is worth thousands of dollars and can buy a few pizza companies but in 2009 it could only buy just one single pizza. Yet, there were people that gave in their time despite how worthless the value was at that time while others sold theirs thinking it was all a waste of time.  Today if bitcoin never gained this much value for those that hodl they would have falling into OP category of time wasters while those that abandoned it in the early stage to go into any kind of skill would have said to have taken the right decision and spending their time well.",

If you put the same amount of time in learning some valuable skill you will earn better.I don't know how much time have you wasted on faucets or on PPC but I learned this lesson a long time ago and in a very short time period too. Because, I almost tried every website back in time and each website was connected to another, and we ended up in loops of websites in the process of completing the tasks. And now as a content writer, I do understand what was happening and how can I earn more money by just making a website like faucets and how can I earn way more money than using faucets. I also wasted a lot of time on such things, and a thought always came to me that I was wasting my time. I should look for something more productive. But every time I gave up this thought, whenever I saw that people were making that much money out of the same faucets, which we can easily see on the reward timeline section of every faucet. I think that's why they have integrated that thing on their faucet websites.",

The earlier we realised that nothing is free, the better for usI think it is not that easy to get anything for free. It may be the fortune of only a few, but not everyone. In crypto currencies, if someone is told to spend nothing and get a lot of money in return, it would be a misrepresentation. Crypto currencies involve both profit and loss. I don't think if someone told me to give one and take two, I would easily believe it, Or anyone can convince someone to earn a lot of money without spending and they can easily believe.However, I believe that everything comes with hard work, and if anything is most valuable, it is our time. The better time we use in any good activity, the more profitable it will be for us. No matter what business you are doing, or what job you are doing, you need to work hard in every area of life, then you get the reward. All the rich people in the world didn't get wealth so easily, but they got everything in their life by working hard with their precious time, so I think we should never focus on the formula of getting something for free.",
