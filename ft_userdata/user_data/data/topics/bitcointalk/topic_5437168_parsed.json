These small pools can give a nice opportunity for small miners to earn more than usual if the pool is lucky (double check before pointing any hashrate, Shhpool is still in Work in process and OP stopped his previous solo pool)2.

Thank you !(yes MRR doesn't look very nice, their prices per Ph/s are crazy high !)I am more than happy that you Kano did all this work on your pool and on Gekkos softwares.

We call it EasyMining since anyone with BTC can buy these packages and have a chance of hitting a full block reward. https://www.nicehash.com/my/easymining/Basically, you can buy a package for $2 to $200 worth of BTC and have a probability of 1:74000 to 1:740 of hitting a block. The reward is paid to your BTC wallet address of your choice (inputed before setting up an order).This also allows NiceHash to pay the miners (sellers of hashrate) more than mining to any other pool. Since the launch of EasyMining. We paid 6% more to the sellers (miners) than mining Bitcoin via pool.",
