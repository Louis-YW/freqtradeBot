No one, that's why people sold their Bitcoin very early, I played with a few faucets years ago and I sold everything for less money, no regrets. Today it's harder to sell Bitcoin because we have come to understand how valuable this asset is, Bitcoin is the hardest asset to get for free, it's the most scarce with very low inflation, mostly on par with Gold.",

If you did this once a day, you could have been a millionaire today. This way of thinking is exactly why there are very few \"millionaires\" around. You are thinking of gaming a system (the faucet) that was not supposed to be used that way to earn peanuts! This is while there were (as there are today) lots of better ways to honestly earn a much larger amount of bitcoin. For example you could have turned your computer on and used your CPU to mine a single block to earn 50 bitcoins as the reward! Or even you could have spent $100 to buy 2000 bitcoins!",

I see absolutely no point thinking about what you could have/should have done more than a decade ago as it won't do you any good. The same goes for all those articles during bull run with titles such \"if you spent $100 on bitcoin 12 years ago now you would have xyz millions\". The only thing that it achieves is newbies investing in altcoins instead of bitcoin, thinking that they are too late while they should focus on getting bitcoin now.",

But among those who managed to learn about Bitcoin so early and tried the faucets, I'm sure the majority would lose what they got or sell whenever it costs anything significant (say, at $50 per coin). So it's all very hypothetical. Overall, I agree with Rikafip that it doesn't matter. I think we should focus on reality and on how to behave going forward.",

That faucet didn't last long because even then there were people who abused everything they could, and your reminder doesn't really make much sense considering that everyone could mine Bitcoin on their computer back then, and the reward per block was as much as 50 BTC. Therefore, if you claim on that faucet every day in one month (30x5 = 150 BTC), while with only one mined block per day, you would have even 1500 BTC per month.Quote from: krishnaverma on January 04, 2023, 05:01:30 AMWere you aware of this news ? Most people know about that faucet, but in the context of the time it existed, I don't believe anyone got rich using it.

But unfortunately not early enough when there were bitcoin faucets. Think they were called rai or what it is now known as nano.It was a fun way to dip those toes into the waters of the unknown back in 2015-2016.Even the bitcoin pizza persona had taken to using faucets to try out the water.Great thread, thanks for referring to it Dave1!",

I'm sure some of you will find this thread priceless as you can see another legendary bitcoin personality there replying, laszlo and others (including satoshi himself  ).I read some of these replies and I learnt so much from the thread. It was great to see how Bitcoin was cheaply given as gifts and how some of the receivers were selfless enough to return some the coins they trickily got by using Tor browser. The simplicity of getting 5BTC for just solving captcha would have made me think it was a scam. I am sure I would have refused to join such activity and it would have been my greatest regret. Considering the price of Bitcoin today I would have been the richest in my family and one of the richest in my area. I am sure most of the people that took this uncommon opportunity are millionaires.

It would only take a strong believer of Bitcoin to hodl for ten years because the coin was not very popular then.",
