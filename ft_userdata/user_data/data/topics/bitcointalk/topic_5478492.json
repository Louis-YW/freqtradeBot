Mostly it's about the congestion or how much TX's are being done. If there are people who are paying higher amounts to get their transactions confirmed, it will even be worse for you who would pay standard.I believe that's mostly the case. Congestion and the fee demand or standard fees to get the transactions confirmed.",

The more inputs and the more outputs, the bigger size.- Transaction type. You can use Segwit address for less transaction size.Why people should be using SegWit addressesFee rate will depends on network, miner capacity to confirm transaction and demand of Bitcoin users that cause Bitcoin mempools are clear or congested.You can not control it and you only can choose a fee rate that is good for you.https://mempool.space/https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),24h,weighthttps://mempool.jhoenicke.de/#BTC,24h,weightBitcoin transaction fees - Everything in oneBitcoin transaction fee does not depend on how big or small the value of your transaction. I mean you will have a same transaction fee for two transactions with same transaction type, same inputs, output numbers and same fee rate. Even transaction 1 has its value is $50 and transaction 2 has its value is $1M, transaction fee can be the same like $25. I think till this example, you get the answer.",

No matter how big or small the amount of btc that will be sent. However, if it's a small transaction like $50USD, I think you can still use a fee of around 19sats/vB even when the fee increase is currently occurring due to congestion on the Bitcoin network which has not yet subsided. Because with this number of transactions and with this fee, at least you can use the free accelerator service from ViaBTC.1 I use it often and it works pretty quickly. But there are limits to the accelerator service per hour. that is, only 100 transactions will be accelerated. And currently, in just 1 minute, 100 transactions are always used on viaBTC. which indicates many are using it now.But if you want your transaction to arrive quickly then of course using the recommended fee (the highest currently) is the best. But it will definitely be much larger than the total you sent.----------Reference:1. https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator",

Trying to simplify it, I would say that the fee does not depend on the quantity. Right now you need approximately a minimum of $10 fee to send a transaction that is likely to be confirmed, whether it is $50 or $50,000. The inputs are more important, i.e. it is not the same if you have received $50 (or $50,000) in a single transaction than if you have received 5 transactions of $10, which will increase the cost. The type of address you are using also affects.",

If it's on Dex like trust wallet it will charge you like $13 for transaction fee. But if you use multisig wallet like blue wallet or electron wallet you will need to set your transaction fee according to mempool conjection maybe like using.Fast==>medium or low. The fast transaction required higher sat/vbite to accelerate your transaction for fast and quicker transaction. Just like someone paying higher fee on ATM que to be the first set of people to achieve their target. And it has maximum of 1hour to confirm the transaction in mempool.While the medium requires lesser fee compeard to the fast and it poses as second to the first transaction. And it could take 3 hours to confirm it's transaction. While slow transaction takes time for it to be confirm in mempool with a lower fee and it's take about 24hours to complete it's confirmation. And this transaction is best to use use accelerator to boost it's transaction.",

The fee paid is determined by The fee rate used, which is determined by how congested the mempool is. The higher the congestion, the higher the fee rate and the higher the fee that would be paidThe number of inputs and outputs. As the inputs increase in a transaction, it makes the weight and virtual size of the transaction to increase. Also the output increases the transaction fee. The higher the output the higher the fee, but we can say increase in output still decrease the transaction fee because if you send to individual address one by one, the fee paid will be high than sending to many addresses at ones.The address type used. If you use segwit, the fee to be paid will be lower than while using legacy addresses.",

I did a check on coinbase just now, to sent $50 worth of Bitcoin is costing about $33, to sent $300, it is costing the same! The OP can check every so often to see when the most opportune time is to make the transaction, againprovided its not urgent you have to pick the best time.",

The transaction fee doesn't depend on the amount you send. As already said, the transaction fee depends on number of inputs and outputs.In the left image, you are sending the whole balance and your transaction would have 1 output. In the right image, you are not sending the whole balance and your transaction would have 2 outputs. The extra output is created for receiving the change makes the transaction larger and causes the fee to be higher.",
