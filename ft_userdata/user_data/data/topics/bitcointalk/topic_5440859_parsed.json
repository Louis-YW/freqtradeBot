      "body": "People especially newbies should not or never use newly launched exchanges even if the price on their platform is cheaper until they reached a level of reputation, if the exchange is really legit they will reach out to market aggregators to list their exchange, open an announcement here in Bitcointalk, not create hype on their project.I always have suspicions when new exchanges do massive hype on social media and faucets ads, especially on telegram.",

The domain registrant team seriously reviews these reports and takes strict action on violations of the policies and terms.",

      "body": "These scams are very dangerous for newbies. The newbies always focus on the design of the site and if it's looking good 50% of belief comes from it. The accused site design is looking very cool and that is a plus point for the scammers.I was surprised by seeing their BTC/USDT trading speed  Seems Binance has not such trading speed for BTC/USDT  There is no confusion it's fake but it should be at least reasonable.BTW we all should report the domain also besides reporting here.",
