I will learn a lot from this forum thats for sure and i'm willing to read a lot of threads. But first i'd like to ask should i keep buying crypto coins with my revolut account? If not , what do i do with the ETH i have on my account in Revolut?Thanks in advance!",

But if they don't, then you should switch to a proper exchange instead. Sell your crypto to fiat, and use it to buy the coin you want in Coinbase for example, and then withdraw that to your personal wallet.",

But My option in Revolut is only buy the crypto for euros , sell the cryptos for euros or send (maybe my crypto??) to a crypto wallet (it says add a crypto recipient / Transfer funds to an external crypto wallet)",

How can i know that or check that?Another friend of mine uses only Binance for example.Your current choice, Revolut, is not what most cryptocurrency users are using. Binance is the prominent one followed by Kraken. Both exchange and others have their own advantages and disadvantages, so you might research what suit you the best.If your concern is the fee, note there might be a deposit fee and trading fee that you should be aware of when comparing each exchange.For example, you can take a look at such information here:Kraken: https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030303832-Overview-of-fees-on-KrakenBinance: https://www.binance.com/en/fee/fiatFee",

And from what I understood from your last post, that should also include Revolut. Now whether they charge more or fewer fees than other exchanges, I'm not sure.In addition to Kraken, you should also look into Coinbase.

As for the transfer, it depends to the exchange or platform where you'll be doing that. Some may have a bit of fee and some are free to do so but don't you worry, when you withdraw that from any platform, it's not going to cost you that much.But the problem today is that the mempool is quite clogged and expect a couple of bucks could be the calculation for the transfer fees.",

Add to that the free escrow fees that Binance and some other providers have... you will then end up only paying withdrawal fees.",
