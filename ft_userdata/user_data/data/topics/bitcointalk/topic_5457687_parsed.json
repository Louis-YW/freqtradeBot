A few things about us:- Team has been working on the project for over a year.- Platform is operational with over 1k+ registered users.- Have some revenue (not significant) and growing.- Partnered with a top-tier CEX.Minimum ticket size of $100k. This is an equity round but can also be converted to SAFT depending on the discussion with the investors.",
