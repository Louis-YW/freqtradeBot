      "body": "if it is about borrowing funds all countries borrow funds, just that since this APC regime the percentage of Nigeria borrowing money has increased since 2015 in 2015 Nigeria had a loan of about $7.3 billion under the administration of Johnathan, and around 2020 Nigeria had a total of debt of about $21.27 billion, despite the large loans there is no improvement in the affairs of the country even in our revenue generation even with the resources, all politicians are just after what they will get, politicians have finished this county we should have been the best but corruption has eaten deep.",

      "body": "It's caused by greed and selfish interest from politicians,My question now is, the money they have been borrowing from other countries, what have they done with it? The answer is nothing, This politicians go to an extent of using the country's (Nigeria) name to go borrow funds with a motive that they want to use it to mobilize, upgrade and help the economy growth of the country, and yet they will end up using it for their personal interest like buying cars, travelling for a tour, building estates and others for themselves..Now what if the country they have borrowed money from needs their money back, whose gonna pay? I can't even imagine how Nigeria is so indebted to China, because of the huge loan that is supposed to be paid back to China...",
