Most devs can script this stuff up all day and use it. It's all masked to masses though. And if you invite that bot to another server.... More data.Making a pitch to a community like this for a service like this is kinda counter intuitive imo. Vaultcord has major competitors though good luck! I've been out of discords loop for about 6 months though so I may not be up to speed on current tos.",

Yes it is legal as long as people aren't using their location to dox/swat them. And that won't happen as we only give the estimated location of them for example their state/country. We do not provide IP addresses instead we have hash address so if you already have the persons IP address you can match them together if someone is trying to bypass the alternate account detection feature.I don't remember exactly why I have it as \"Discore\" instead of \"Discord\" I will see if I can fix that right now.",
