Because an incident like this happened in my city, where a Bitcoin billionaire was on holiday and then the place where he was staying was visited by several people and he was held captive together with his girlfriend, his Bitcoin worth 200k USD was drained by the threat, fortunately his life was still safe. So yeah the best way to avoid cases like this is to stay alert and don't let other people know how much bitcoin you have.",

Nobody in our respective neighborhoods may know that we have any, but these days there's only a thin line that divides your online and offline life. Though you're mk4 and I'm Darker45 here, for example, somebody else may or might have already obtained our real identities. All I'm saying is that the man could have led a low-key and quite life in real life, but somewhere online his identity and that he had Bitcoin were known. Which leads me to conclude that it isn't enough that you appear to have no Bitcoin in real life. It might also be a must that we don't attach our real identities with any of our online accounts. Next to impossible, though, I'd say. It would also mean not using any service that asks for KYC.In addition, it is said in the news that \"people in a nearby house heard screams and saw the man being beaten and bundled into a car.\"[1] Nobody came out? The criminals could have immediately fled with the sight of people checking out what happened.[1] https://kyivindependent.com/foreigner-kidnapped-forced-to-transfer-bitcoins-then-murdered-in-kyiv-police-say",

From the statement from the police, it reads;Quote\"It was established that the perpetrators were preparing for the crime in advance. \"They found out that the man has bitcoins, the value of which is several million hryvnias. They tracked down where he lives, waited, forcibly dragged him to a car and took him to an abandoned building in the territory of Kyiv region. There they forced him to transfer bitcoins to their crypto wallet, which were then transferred to cash, and the man was killed. so obviously, he allowed others to get access to the information that he had some amount of Bitcoin in his possession for reasons best known to him. Even without looking for this police report, if a criminal attacks me, the highest I would expect them to do to me in terms of stealing from me is to force me to open my bank account and transfer my funds to them. For any reason that they make enquiry regarding my crypto holding, it means it's actually a compromise from someone that knows I'm currently holding Bitcoin or alternatively I have knowingly or unknowingly given them an impression that I have some amount of holding in my wallet.",

But this continues to be a lesson for those who believe they can be flaunting their wealth, especially the digital assets like cryptocurrency that is decentralised, the danger of robbing them or even killing them is high. Thanks to the CCTV camera that captured the perpetrators, it could have been untraceable in some environments, so we should be private with them even as Bitcoin preaches privacy and anonymity.Practically as you asked, I have these few tips;1. Never disclose your Bitcoin asset or its worth to anyone and make sure you only buy your Bitcoin from external sources that can never trace it to you.2. If you make the mistake of being traced and have a huge number of Bitcoins in your wallet, I advise you to mix them and send them to a self-custody wallet afterwards.3. Show restraints when Bitcoin discussion is mentioned in public, and even among friends, the enthusiasts and lousy mouths will always be the number one target.4. Do not have Bitcoin wallets installed on the gadgets you take to public places if you have a huge value of it in them as anyone may be a victim of robbers and unforeseen circumstances at times. Checking your phone alone could put you in trouble as cryptocurrency is the aim of some evil-doers now.",

I don't have to go through so many stress to access my funds. It was his fault in the first place, that why his coins were stolen. I wonder why people would decide to not keep their mouth shut. The public is unsafe, but no one will ever know you have Bitcoins if you don't announce it.  Though him being murdered was completely unnecessary, I think there is more to this story. If they wanted to steal his coin, they could have just taken it and left. What the point of killing him? It also shows clearly that the ones who stole from him are people he knows best. So they don't want him to recognize them so they killed him. The world is dangerous so as a Bitcoiner, we have to take our privacy seriously.",

Our you could misplace it.Almost all Americans keep their savings in a bank or other financial institution. These companies specialize in keeping things safe from criminals, and will give you your money even if they get robbed. Maybe banks don't work correctly in the country you are from, but they work just fine in the USA. I would never keep any amount of significant money on my own person.",

Just like MK4 mentioned, they would not have come for him if they were not aware about the bitcoin he has .Keeping your Bitcoin holding secret is very important but privacy is becoming very difficult. Most exchanges require KYC, which can lead to loss of privacy. Some members of forums might also know each other physically which can also be a problem. Using privacy tools to cover up transactions might also be a good way to remain private.Quote from: legiteum on July 30, 2024, 06:12:52 AMUse a bank instead. That's why people like banks.

But the good part of it is that such funds can be tracked easily. If a bank employee commits a crime, the bank is liable and makes you whole. They do so because they will get sued and/or they are required by regulations to do so--and also because they will ruin their own business if they don't because everybody will take their money out of that bank and into a safer one. For what it's worth, the notion of somebody keeping their life savings physically on their own person is rather... absurd in the developed world. The tiny number of people who do it either have very little in the way of savings (hand-to-mouth subsistence), or are considered... sorta crazy .Muggings dropped drastically in US cities starting in the 1980s. The reason? Credit cards: people stopped carrying lots of physical cash. Their savings was safely stored under their own name in a bank.Most people don't want to create their own security apparatus, and instead want to pay somebody else who has one already. That's what a bank is.",

This was one of the lessons that I learned as a newbie in this forum, never to announce my Bitcoin in public, this is because your private keys is the only proof of ownership, if it changes hands that means that you have automatically transferred the ownership to whoever that is holding your seed phrase. This is one of the burdens of being your own bank, there is no centralized authority that you can report to, when you're robbed of your seed phrase that can stop the criminals from stealing your Bitcoin.",

Public figures that the whole world knows have large amounts of Bitcoin and can afford top security, they are mostly in the most secure places compared to common people. There is a slimmer chance of those kinds of people getting mugged on the street or in a bar or restaurant.
