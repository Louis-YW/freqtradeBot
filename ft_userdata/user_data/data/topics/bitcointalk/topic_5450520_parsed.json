It's better guide him trade like doing a live trading, letting him asking you a questions about crypto and answer it with all your heart and knowledge along with the trading course. In that way he can build his confident and avoiding one of the biggest risk in trading, a \"lack of knowledge\".",

Yes that’s true and since no trader has privacy (but for the exception of no kyc required exchanges)then there won’t be any privacy issue. But one thing I can also point out is his friend is a newbie and many newbies aren’t versatile in their research if he starts him with a centralized exchange like binance in trading he may see binance as his go to place even for buying and selling of his Crypto, but like you said it’s simpler for traders using centralized exchanges also using decentralized exchange has its down side too and one of them is that the conversation fees are very high especially on instant exchanges.",

The volatility involved in this type of trading increases the risk and human are found of many obnoxious behaviors and like you said it won't be any surprise if he/she eventually turns up and start blaming you when he/she experience losses in the trading classes. I have tried out trading myself but couldn't seem to work for although I was trading on synthetics and I concluded the trading to be one major term which is \"advanced gambling\" you can never be too sure so I left it and I won't try to convince any one to trading and definitely not crypto trade.",

They may be your friend but that doesn't mean you'll do whatever they want, no? Try to sit down with them and be honest about your worries - that you feel burdened about the whole thing and would feel some kind of responsibility in case something goes wrong.

It's entirely up to him whether he would trade or not. Not sure how Binance handle unverified accounts these days, but I would suggest to not verify the account of your friend first so he would at least test the waters if trading would be really for him as trading is not really meant for everybody including me. I had my horrible experience trading, although I learned a lot.

This is really just a simple problem which you could always tell them that the market is risky, invest and deposit only on the amount which you could afford to lose.Dont make out some assurance to your friend so that he wont really be expecting something out from those words which it would really be just that simple.Its not your responsibility if they would be losing up money out of their investment, as long you arent assuring them about on being simple or easy money to make via tradingthen i dont really see a thing for you to worry up that much because we know that this isnt how the reality works.",

It's an evidence of a good conscience you possess but the truth is that you ain't doing anything wrong at the moment. You have told him in clear term about the risks involved and he still persist in wanting to learn how to trade. So take him onboard, I believe his interest will drive him to be a good trader eventually. My candid advise to you is to make sure to also make it clear to your friend not to put into trading an amount he can't afford to lose. In this way since it's inevitable he  may make losses in the beginning he would only have to consider those losses as part of an experience in his trading journey and wouldn't be affected psychologically by the losses. You talk about using binance for your trading, hope you understand binance is a centralized exchange and it's risking leaving your money their especially in periods you ain't trading. Why not create a non-custodial wallet where you would have your money stored there only to use it on binance when trading and a return to your wallet after being done with your trade. It's important. I'll want to use this opportunity to introduce to you AgoraDesk, a no KYC exchange platform for your convenience and privacy. You might want to give it a try.",
