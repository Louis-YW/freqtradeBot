Have u ever contributed or u have any experience of any of such days ...There is already a nicely written calendar that covers most of this (and more), see https://bitcoin.holiday/ and some sort of announcement here.Of course, Cypherpunk Day is not directly bitcoin related and also Satoshi day is most probably incorrect - I guess you don't expect a man very careful about his privacy would give out the correct birth date just like that..If you feel you can add dates, you can also contribute there: https://bitcoin.holiday/",

Even i don't see people talking about them on those days mentioned.Among all these days, it was bitcoin pizza day which is known to everyone and some of people celebrate it too. I have seen people share the bitcoin pizza day pictures here on bitcointalk where they have decorated pizza with some bitcoin designs and celebrated.",

But I think there are some days here that make no sense and I don't see any reason why they are important to Bitcoin in any way, such as Independence Day, Bitcoin Infinity Day, Bitcoin Whitepaper Day, Bitcoin Logo Day, Bitcoin Day, and HODL-day. Because I think these days makes no sense, but it would have nice if only had you explained it a more better",

And also, if it is strictly a Bitcoin holiday calendar, I guess I would omit the likes of Mt. Gox Day or Shitcoin Day. Anyway, the good thing with Bitcoin.holiday, which others have suggested above, is that it provides a brief information about the particular holiday. But, again, there are still days there which I think are not really that relevant in Bitcoin's history that they need to be considered holidays.",
