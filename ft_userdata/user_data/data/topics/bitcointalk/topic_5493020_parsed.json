  "content": "Quote from: Christian Langalis, “Bitcoin Sign Guy”When Bitcoiners ask me about the sign, I tell them, “You’d have done the same in my seat.” Yes, only I attended the hearing, drew the sign, and flashed it for the camera. However, it was the network spirit which seized the image and fabricated the memes. The full poetry of the stunt was far beyond my devising, therefore, my attitude can only be one of post-authorship. Bitcoin was massively rupturing into the halls of institutional finance in 2017. Any Bitcoiner worth their sats would have told you so. It’s good to finally liberate this number from my sock drawer and offer it back to the Bitcoin public. The message was subversive then, but now merely obvious: Bitcoin is flowing. Control is dead.Auction Start: Thursday, April 18, 12 pm ET (16:00 UTC)Auction End: Wednesday, April 24, 7 pm ET (23:00 UTC)Auction link: https://scarce.city/auctions/buy-bitcoin",

The digital currency has more than doubled in value this year, raising concerns it is entering bubble territoryBitcoin has been getting free ads from mainstream media for over a decade, though they thought they were FUDing it. I also wonder what happened to the “bubble territory” Perhaps it has now shifted  I think a bitcoiner is going to try to win the bid. Perhaps some early whale. It would be interesting to see how it goes.",

If Bitcoin is not ban in your country, it is banned in some countries and that's the reason why there can not be any Bitcoin museum now, maybe until Bitcoin becomes globally acceptedaccepted. Another way there can be a Bitcoin museum is if an NGO in country that Bitcoin is freely accepted will take it upon themselves to build it.",
