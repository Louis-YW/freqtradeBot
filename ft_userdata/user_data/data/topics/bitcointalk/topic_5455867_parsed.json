It shows data on the actual RTP of the game in a certain time frame. This shows what slot is paying the most and slot that doesn't pay at all.RTP(Return to Player) -  is a term used in gambling and online games to refer to the percentage or prizes that will be returned to a player depending on funds deposited during the game initially. Return to Player is one of the ways to attract players.(Screenshot from Bitcasino.io)I'm still in the discovery phase of this feature and I don't know exactly what's the best working strategy. Some users said that it's good to use a hot slot or high live RTP because it's consistent in giving payout but other users use a cold slot or low live RTP for a chance to win a huge multiplier since a slot machine that recently pays huge amount is very rare to payout again some huge amount on short period of time.What strategy you are using related to live RTP?",

Either hot or cold slot, if you are unlucky, then you'd lose. I doubt there are players or is player who consistently win on slots, dice, and other pure luck games, I doubt that there's such thing. Bigger RTP won't guarantee winning 'coz we are talking about probability only.If such timezone promotes certainty, then most of its players should be rich by now and all players would play on that certain timeframe. I'm not saying slot providers are fooling people on their data but there's one thing players are not seeing; there are timeframes wherein rewards are often given to the gamblers by playing but not with the ratio of those who win and who lose. So I guess things are just the same to both classification/category.",

You might not experience mega win but at least you have a chance to be on the profit side unlike hunting a huge multiplier on cold RTP because there's no guarantee that cold slot will play during your game.I think the cold slot strategy is only for hardcore slot hunters because it needs a huge bankroll to hunt. There's no certainty on what you chasing on this strategy so I typically skip this one.",

As I knew so far, the most advised one where you should play were the slots games with highest RTP percentage, as you have extra probability of making profit. But the idea of cold slots also make sense, if you are pursuing a single valuable shoot. The choice must depend on the personal preference and personality of each gambler. For me, I don't like low winning chances, because it's quite frustrating to play for a long time without being rewarded with anything after all. I prefer to win lower prizes, but consistently, so \"hot slots\" is my pick.",

But now I don't really take it as a reference, because it turns out that casinos don't always give a good game when the RTP is high, and not infrequently it's just a lie, a manipulation to make someone more excited to play. In the end, it's still about luck where you will win when luck comes your way. On the other hand, I often feel strange, why is it that when I really play seriously with the goal of wanting to win, it always ends in defeat, but when I'm not too serious and play carelessly, luck often comes? Maybe psychological factors really influence when playing.",

As I understand live RTP, It involves all the spin of the players playing that same game. This is the reason why the live RTP is different on the general RTP of the game. You are pertaining on the main RTP of the slot while the live RTP is percentage of player profit on the specific game. Although it’s really not gonna matter what RTP you are using because slot is still a luck based games with high house edge which is why this game sucks for me.",

I wouldn't put that much attention into the live RTPs because you're still going to lose anyway, so you might as well pick the games you want to play and have a good time instead of filtering your game list due to the live RTPs. If others found success through the help of live RTPs then good for them, but they might be a coincidence since any of these slots can quickly go from hot to cold and vice versa.",

Personally, I'd choose the guarantee over higher profits. Which in this case a hot slot will provide. The fact that it gives you surefire profits or at least increased chances of getting something out of playing with one makes it hundred times better than waiting for the time that you get a jackpot in a cold slot, which I would tell you is a long-ass time considering that it doesn't pay a dime to its winners. There's still the question of enjoyment and whether these slots are fun to play but that's besides the point, in a case of prizes, having some sort of guarantee that you'll get them is still a much better choice than the promise of getting more from something that's not usually giving its players a win. You'd become another hopeful on the latter, and a happy camper in the former.",
