These trending coins will mo longer give profit and we have no idea when will Elon tweet something bad about doge and same with other coins. investing in these coins are risky and i will not recommend anyone to buy. Doge already rised 20% after Elon tweet and now I don't think it will rise again. Â Bakac coin is new coin and i haven't hear about this before reading this post. These shitcoins will not remain for long time and their goal is to attract community and then you will see no update. You can see the results of pepe and Floki which are continually down falling after Binance listing.",

That's why when you see some veteran investors convincing others to buy Doge, it is because they are just gambling their investment with the new investors and when they see the price rises at a decent price, they rush to sell their Doge in order not to get back their capital with a decent amount of income.",

I have mentioned these situations before. When some coin starts to be actively talked about, there are 2 ways:1. The coin does not grow at all and shillers are trying to attract some attention of hamsters to the coin to make money at their expense.2. The coin has already grown and is preparing to sell, so on various forums and social networks shillers attract attention to the coin, so that as much as possible to buy it, providing a profit to those who bought earlier and ready to sell.",
