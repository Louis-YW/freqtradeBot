As I already said, coinomi is close-source and even if you use a strong password, there is no guarantee that your wallet is safe. It may worth mentioning that even if you use a trustworthy open-source wallet an an online device, your fund isn't still completely secure. Any online device is prone to hacking.",

But there is nothing to fix and not return. Try to use other, safer crypto storage methods next time. You have already been advised to use a hardware wallet, so I will not repeat myself. Can you tell me how much money was in your wallet? If this is a significant number, then why didn't you think about buying HW devices? Also, I agree with the rest of the comments above that the cause of the loss is not necessarily the Coinomi. Too little information to draw such a conclusion and be sure. Perhaps you yourself made a mistake somewhere or the attackers who hacked turned out to be very lucky. In general, more evidence is needed to identify the culprit.",

It's never a good thing to use a closed sourced wallet because you never know if there's a backdoor for devs to look into your account and steal your funds. And I know alot of people have suggested that you go get a hardware wallet but if can't afford a hardware wallet you should look for a reputable open source wallet and we have Electrum as an example. Another thing you should consider aside from the type of wallet is how you keep your secret phrase. How sure are you that your private key or secret phrase never got exposed? Did you at anytime input your key into any online service? And since you said you didn't write it down so they'll be no way for someone outside you and your wife to know it except your system was infected with malware that steal information.",

Although Coinomi is a closed source wallet, you shouldn't immediately blame them as it is possible that your computer was hacked or you accidentally leaked the seed phrase.If you don't have any proof, then you can't do anything and they won't have any liability to you. Not only stay away from Coinomi wallet, but you should stay away from all closed source wallets, better buy a hardware wallet.",
