Especially when they start noticing what they are missing with web3 and others, I believe they have no clue about blockchain technology, few countries where this stupid before, until they understand what they are missing.",

Time will speak.However, Kuwait is one of the 2nd richest Muslim countries. Despite this new policy I'm not sure it will create a backlash because it's not necessarily that bitcoin is of critical interest among the population. On the other hand I believe almost every citizen in Kuwait has achieved their financial freedom.The important thing is that there are no dirty practices in the political system, I think their policies result from common sense than other corrupt countries, and rejecting bitcoin is not controversial at all.",

Banning it because of money laundering is just gibberish as they don't ban fiat currencies with same reason.I don't expect it too because Middle East nations are more friendly with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency than Europe and North America. Many blockchain summits, conferences, companies were hosted and operated in Middle East. This regulatory movement from Kuwait is very strict and not expected.",

If they like, they can ban other cryptocurrencies, but bitcoin has been achieving all-time-high. If they do not sell in panic and during loss, the price will appreciate and they will later gain. They should consider bitcoin as a speculative asset, but in long term it is a store of value. I wonder if trading fiat and stocks is accepted in the country if that would be the reason. I think what that is stated above would likely be the reason why cryptocurrencies are banned in the country. But that is just novices understanding and fiat is worse regarding that.

Cocaine and many drugs are banned but people are still able to buy and sell it among themselves. In my country, marijuana is banned, but you will see high school students taking it. How about cryptocurrencies which are easier to get. All that is needed is decentralized exchanges if it is a total ban. But if it is an implicit ban, their citizens can still trade within themselves on centralized exchanges too.

Also I will like to  know if it is a total or an implicit ban.It can even be like China that bitcoin is banned but Chinese can hold it as a property legally  . Do not mind me, that is just a joke.

Maybe the level of money laundering might increased there. That's why the governments took these steps to ban all of the things. And believe me, i belong to the same continent and these ban are temporary and will be lifted after some time.Maybe when the time will be right. Because these steps are made by some of the people with great power who would make such things happen. And every time such bans has some agendas behind them. The main thing came to my mind is only. There must be some illegal activities that has forced them to make such steps. Otherwise, unlike US, China, they can not manipulate market, because the traffic or i would say legal traffic or crypto users who add volume to crypto industry from Kuwait are less.",

The major issue is the decentralized nature of bitcoin that cannot be accessed by government to track who uses it,they have seen that their government can't control bitcoin users and it has become a threat to them. They should have regulated it instead of banning it. This isn't a problem to bitcoin adoption or price because other countries and individuals will keep on adopting bitcoin.

Some will be friendly now others will be in the future. Kuwait is claiming it wants to abide by the rules of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to curb financial practice, terrorism financing, and money laundering. But they are been too harsh to the crypto community because FATF recommends strict supervision of the financial activities of crypto operations and not an outright ban. In other nations, regulators are coming up with advanced methods of monitoring, tracking, and recovery of illicit crypto funds, instead of a ban. They will lose most of the opportunities that cryptocurrency offers. The good news is that this year more countries are opening up to Bitcoin. Affected businesses and miners will move to friendlier neighboring nations like UAE and others to avoid sanctions or penalties.",
