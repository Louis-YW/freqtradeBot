  "content": "I'm wondering how people do when they lose their 'mnemonic' (secret key words for wallet restoration).Just in your case, what are you gonna do for below?[Case] You lost mnemonic stored in your private space because of some reasons (ex. computer has been formatted by unknown error / a paper wallet you printed out has been burned). Or you can't access to your cold wallet because you forgot the mnemonic and have never remembered it.I'm curious for this case. If you can remember the mnemonic in easy and efficient way, and there's no need to store the mnemonic to private space if you sometimes remind it, then are you willing to do that? Or, just keep them only in your private space?What is your opinion?",

      "body": "If you lose your recovery phrase, the smart thing to do is to create a new wallet with a new recovery phrase and send all of the bitcoins in the old wallet to the new wallet. If you have also lost the wallet, then there is nothing you can do.But, it seems that your real question is whether or not it is a good idea to make your own recovery phrase that is easy to remember. The answer to that question is generally no, because a recovery phrase that can be remembered for decades will be easy for a computer to guess.",

      "body": "Thank you for your reply. I would abandon the wallet as you participated in poll as well if I can't do anything.But, I was wondering if I remember in my brain instead of just writing that on any place that I feel safe.I think if it's possible, it would be more relieved than I do nothing üßêAnd also, if there's an easy way to remember the mnemonic, then willing to use it to remember it? or it would be useless?",
