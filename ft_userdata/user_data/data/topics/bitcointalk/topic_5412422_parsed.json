      "body": "If the gambling site support live chat, you can start from there. If customers can only create ticket, you can start from there too. The first thing you should do is to make sure that you contact the gambling sites customer care to ask the reason why you are not able to withdraw. If the gambling site give reasons that is not in your favour and you did nothing wrong, and they ban or block your account, you can process by creating a thread about it on gambling board or on reputation board on this forum. But this would be good if the betting site has an official bitcointalk account and/or if the gambling site has an official thread on gambling board.But also for people to avoid the betting site, there is nothing bad to create such thread even if the gambling site is not on this forum.",

However taking screenshot or maybe screen recording it can be a good first step to do if you are worrying about something. Few days back I experienced an issue in Fortunejack when my cashout on sportsbook is not working properly (cashout done but the money is not reflected to my balance). What I did? I contacted live support and they helped me to fix it. Contacting live support is what I usually do when I'm experiencing a problem in a casino because I believe it is the fastest way to get an answer.",

For deposit and withdrawal problems, I always use chat support, because every online casino provider has a live chat feature or by email. Maybe for some providers it takes more than 1x24 hours to respond to emails. We can create a thread on the forum, if the time limit that we have given (personally) to the provider is not carried out. However, if the provider has a representative on the forum, we can delay creating an accusation thread, by trying to communicate with the representative. if all of our ways can't giving any solutions, so we can decide to create accusations thread for this provider.",

But when they don't take actions and you're likely waiting for nothing then that's the time you do the next action of contacting them again to refresh that concern. If still nothing happened, that's where you go into different platforms and forum to address the issue to get their attention.",

I had once had this issues on a casino, when I try to withdraw nothing happens and there was a message that is very strange to me.And so I talk to them and sort things out as this should not happen to me. And so we did, they didn't tell me the reasons but they said that I can withdraw and so I did. Perhaps it's better to have a screenshot of conversion as proof. But if you think you did nothing wrong then you don't have to fear anything.",

The most normal way is to create a ticket to the support service (and after waiting a day or two, since bonuses are not taken into account/calculated immediately). Taking screenshots of the current situation and recording correspondence is, of course, reasonable.",

Usually if you win too much they will restrict your account to do some further KYC. Once that's done they usually remove the restrictions and you're free to bet again. This happens on big reputable gambling platforms, not sure about the new and smaller ones though.

This is elementary to ask from support the challenge of withdrawing , you write with proofing in the screenshot.This is minor phase trying to get your withdrawal done either seeking the support team attention with screenshot of your challenge.

Any if things do go wrong, and you play on an online gambling casino which is legit and registered, then they will obviously fear any legal actions against them and if you have proof, then they definitely will want to avoid a quarrel with you.I would definitely also make my concern public, in hopes that the mentioned casino does not wish for bad PR and would rather give you your money than face public humiliation.That all said, this is only in the case where you are in the right and have broken no rules.",
