Btw Op I saw alot of people were rejected in the campaign which means even if they do their weekly or daily task they won't receive any payment, did you by any chance check if your account or the accuont that didn't recieve payment was part of those rejected?",

Previous users told you may not join any bounty campaign I have also checked and I could not trace any bounty-related posts on your account. That means you have not joined on that campaign by this account which means you have not received payment on your alt account.",

My question is that if they send over payment to some hunters this is manager fualt not bounty hunters then why he give punishment to videos participants I didn't follow the case from the beginning, obviously, so I didn't have an immersive knowledge of the case, nor I am interested on reading every single chat on their group since 15th to today to get acquainted with every complaint and \"anyone participants ask about reward they blocked from group not giving any clear answer\", but perhaps you missed their pinned post?Quote from: https://t.me/Bounties/406505Dear Bounty DetectiveÂ Community, This is an important notification about the BS bounty rewards.We encountered a technical issue (bug) with the Cointool DApp used for the distribution of the bounty rewards for the Twitter campaign through the Polygon blockchain.As a result, the DApp conducted multiple transactions totaling 7,000 BS tokens to various wallet addresses. Here you may discover the relevant data in the block explorers:ðŸ”˜ TX1ðŸ”˜ TX2Therefore, we respectfully request that you return the overpaid rewards for the Black Stallion Twitter bounty campaign to this wallet address as soon as possible:0x08d2F5Aa6bCE6bc03b6460597FFE39bF3E147211You will be eliminated from our current and upcoming bounty programs in case you neglect this notification and do not return the rewards that were intended to otherÂ legitimate participantsÂ but were issued to you in error.The video and article campaign rewards that have not yet been distributed are still covered by Bounty Detective's guarantee.We appreciate your continued participation and support in our bounty programs.Kind Regards, The Bounty Detective Team",

Even your Bitcointalk account with this username has nothing to do with the mentioned bounty. 3) You are shamelessly lying by saying, \"Only a few participants got their rewards\" Almost 1000 people got their rewards already, and only 17 people are left. As clearly mentioned in our pinned post, we told our community that Bounty Detective still guarantees the remainder of the rewards.Our spreadsheets and transaction links are public, which is only one of the reasons we have that vast community and supporters. Your type of slanderers and liars who use alt accounts and cheat in bounty will not stop us from finding additional cheaters.4) The below participant is banned from the bounty campaign because of violating bounty rules by deleting the Youtube video.Username - oghmerdeds5) As clearly mentioned on the bounty thread and bounty post, the reward distribution already \"began\" as promised on the 15th of May, 2023, and it is none of your business to decide when we end it. I know that you hurry up not to be caught for cheating. However, it is our right to make additional investigations about cheaters.We have distributed over 500,000 USD worth of rewards publicly, honestly, and fairly to date. Therefore, our followers already know our reputation is more considerable than only the ~$800 value of the remainder of BS token distribution. Finally, if you knew us, you would have known that we never knuckle under blackmail or some of the trust system abusers in this forum (like the imperative retired scammer Lauda and her gang). You can continue to slander us with your alt accounts like cowards. We will not stop our investigation because of your type of potential cheaters and not eligible participants.",

I know that you hurry up not to be caught for cheating. However, it is our right to make additional investigations about cheaters. Bounty detective escrowed all tokens and when date if distribution comes you start scamming by starting extra token drama. on 15 may BS token price was almost double of today and the reason was game launch of Blackstalion. probably bounty detective sold these tokens at high price and now you will buy at low rate. You charging hugh fee then why you taking more tham 8 days to end the escrowed distribution? It's clearly indicate that you are scamming with poor hunters who don't know how to deal.

No need for blah blah, my question is very sample, why you not distributed tokens? why you break your promise? if you distributed 500,000$ then why you hesitate to distribute these token to hunters. If someone late to make report form one day you not giving stake because he reported weekly task one day and here you are already late 8 days, your reputation should also be questionable.",

The wallet on the pinned posts' transactions is public, and everyone can see that every single token went to the bounty participants. We even bought BS from our pocket and added it to the pool. Before accusing someone, learn how blockchain works. Again, you are already banned from the bounty because your video is not available anymore. And pushing it will allow us to investigate your potential alt accounts. You still write from an alt account, which has nothing to do mentioned bounty like cowards, and this topic is already irrelevant.",
