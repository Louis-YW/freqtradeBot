Any lessons you learned the hard way that you'd like to share?The key advise any new gambler must take is that gambling is not supposed to be done when you have not figured out how to survive without the money you invested in or targeted to win. You should only gamble when you have a job or another means of generating income. Let gambling just be another stream of income that should be done with a little fraction of your money such that you can afford to loose it. Secondly, whenever you have a good win, withdraw the money and use it immediately in something very important that you can remember and appreciate. Don't keep gambling and hoping to win more whenever you have had a major win. Don't give back the money to you win, it is not the right thing. Finally,  treat gambling as a game of probability because nothing is sure. Don't be greedy and don't be desperate.",

Profit will just follow if you are consistent on your game and doesn’t subject to any abnormal increase of bet when tilted.That's the first step that every gambler should pay attention to, especially for those who are new to the world of gambling, always about setting the amount of budget that you can be responsible for whatever the final result is, I understand that there are opportunities in gambling but what is certain and what has been proven is that usually the final result is more often losing than winning, so that's why as we know now more and more people are suffering from large amounts of loss, none other than that because they are too serious and bring the wrong mindset to gambling. Gambling is nothing more than a fun activity, so don't be fooled by the name of opportunity, because on the other hand there is no guarantee and certainty for you to win.So yes of course the amount of budget that is not excessive will have an important role as one of the precautions, because I'm not sure you can accept if the final result loses when carrying a large amount of budget that you cannot afford. Right, make sure we will stay awake in each of our gambling sessions, after all this is just an activity that relies on luck alone no more than that.",

Any lessons you learned the hard way that you'd like to share?Just don't borrow money to gamble and only gamble with money you are prepared to lose. That's the only advice that novice gamblers should listen to so as not to get trapped in debt that they shouldn't have. Because most gamblers often get caught in problems like this and newbies shouldn't follow in these footsteps.",

Any lessons you learned the hard way that you'd like to share?Gambling actually has both good and bad sides but when the bad side outweighs the good side, gambling causes serious harm. Especially those who are interested in getting involved in new gambling should consider gambling as a part of entertainment. Gambling should never be taken as a source of income. Moreover, those who are newly interested from the young children of the family should keep away from practicing gambling. Moreover, such students should never involve themselves in gambling as they suffer in studies.",

Register an account, deposit to be able to play and withdraw if you need it when you win.Select the type of crypto you will make a deposit. At the casino where you have registered an account, you will definitely see the type of crypto option you will choose to make a deposit.There is nothing difficult that I can tell you.If you want advice, know that gambling involves losing and winning. Don't be disappointed if you lose because winning is difficult to achieve continuously.",

If you start thinking of it as your survival, you might end up among those who struggle with addiction. This could lead you to borrow money for gambling, not set limits, and get too emotional while playing. Being a responsible gambler means keeping control to prevent becoming addicted.",

What extra money? The extra money also are hard earned money. But just that the money should be very small and should be considered as money that has been lost. You are not wrong that gamblers should not chase losses becuase that is the time a gambler can continue to deposit money and continue to lose. But not only that, with little winning, a gambler should quit for the day becuase that day may still lead to losses if continuing gambling.",

This is dangerous because you might thinking betting in USD but in reality your currency is set to mbtc or other currency that has high value than USD.  I learn this the hard way when I’m new on slot game although I rarely saw a casino that doesn’t use standard USD currency on in game bet.Lastly, Play only on reputable casino and avoid using unknown casino just because they offer too good to be true bonuses because it will be a painful loss once they halt your withdrawal when you won.
