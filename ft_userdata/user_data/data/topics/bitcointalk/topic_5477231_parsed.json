Hating on other peopleâ€™s success mostly leads to destruction of your own self success. I have never seen a person so focused on making things right for himself been unsuccessful unless your time is not right yet. Letâ€™s keep the envy aside, support others when we can and focus on building on ourselves.",

When maturity comes there are decisions that we would make unconsciously because it cones with the mindset. Concentrating on your improvement, focusing on being productive and managing things that gives you money (work, business and AOB). The aforementioned attributes is what maturity does. We should also understand that age has nothing to do with maturity. Someone may be 34- 36 but his mindset and way he responds to things dhows that he is not matured enough. While you may see someone at the age of 20 to 25 but is fully matured.Â  Â Environment also affects a persons behaviour. Ive heard experience in the market place. We see a lot of gossips and sentimental characters from market colleague. If a person is not matured enough he would join them to sct that way. The only way to survive and flourish in that kind of environment is to focus on your business.",

Even the Bible says that time is very important and whatever our hands find to do we should do it well and God will bless it,Â  this is why as people we need to discover what will keep us busy as a business and remain focused on it to get the best result.",

If you check in our environment today, you can see that the little ones are even the ones that are bringing forth solutions to some problems in our society whereas the so called adults and advanced people in our society has little or no knowledge on how to do things that will bring about positive changes in our environment.
