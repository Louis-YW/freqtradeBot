      "body": "First and foremost, it is imperative to consider the intrinsic value and impact of the tools utilized in the composition of any text, be it artificial intelligence or traditional penmanship. My primary intention is to extend assistance, and an undue focus on the medium rather than the content of my message suggests a misplaced prioritization. Moreover, I am endowed with considerable education, enabling me to articulate in a manner that might surpass common understanding. Should the discourse deviate from substantive matters to trivialities concerning the origin of these written words, it would be a lamentable misallocation of our collective time.In conclusion, should there be any genuine inquiries or need for assistance, I encourage their prompt presentation. I wish you a delightful day and advise a redirection of focus towards more fulfilling and life-enhancing pursuits.Thank you.

If I may ask you OP this proposals you are putting forward here looking for investors because that is just what you are doing now calling on people to get you a high sophisticated computer so you could do your work, have you been able to do any working on it as to show proof that you did something of this nature before because that is only what you can use to convince investors to look into your directions otherwise you are on your own. What can you be able to put forth as evidence of your output because that would assist you in pushing forward rather than using AI to generate words to convince people which is very bad. Already your profile is tagged and that has to do with your reputation here and I don't think it would be easy to convince investors when you have some tag to your account.",

Let's keep our discussions healthy, respectful, and above all, focused on progress and learning, shall we?  Let me give you the benefit of the doubt with some service-related questions:- What are the parameters for your success? (e.g, do you need X amount of the seed phrase words, or X amount of the known characters/known amount of characters for the password)- What is some information surrounding your method (without giving away your 'secret sauce', if there is one)Elaborate on how you are doing what you are doing, explain to us more about the service.No one cares that you used AI if you had some original content there - you could have used AI to make the marketing part of your thread, but then spent some time putting some information in (that AI can't possibly know/write) yourself, and credited the part that AI helped you to use. The problem is that you have told AI to describe a service, you've plagiarized AI's work, and you've included nothing unique, or nothing that can possibly tell us that you are truly doing something.I hope this makes sense.",
