If you are doing this to promote your referral link then you are doing wrong because referral link promotion is not allowed in this forum. And if you come to promote this site you can run a bounty campaign by the legal way in the Bounty Altcoin section",

Because the Altcoin Discussion board is only for discussing Altcoins.¬† It is not right to promote any new project or share any link of income here. Or if it's an irrelevant post then the op should lock the topic",
