  "content": "We haven't been in contact for more than 10 years, so the circumstances have separated. Now we live in the same city, but we haven't even called once. Do you think parents are forever? Or do family ties get lost over time and it's worth forgetting about it? maybe someone has experience or has advice.",

I am now more older and I see the reasons why he was not there for me. I did alright even not knowing him that much.I think we can say yes this is true. Parents are forever and so is our family. I do not think so that family ties will be lost overt time. We have to make some efforts to become part of our lost family. You are lucky to be able to still do this. I wish I could be in your position.",

      "body": "maybe you should make peace with your parents. because, parents are people who have always looked after and cared for you since childhood. Although it's a bit difficult for you to meet him. but if you have her cell number you can call her and apologize if you never told her about yourself and never visited her. then meet them. because if one day your parents die, you won't be able to see them again. this is your chance. May you and your parents get along well and forge a strong and harmonious family bond. this is just my suggestion üôè",
