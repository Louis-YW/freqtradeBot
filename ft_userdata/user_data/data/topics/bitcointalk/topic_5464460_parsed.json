If you look at most of the big projects you will see multi-national people in their team. Indian and Chinese origin people are common in crypto projects after all they share a vast number of people combined. Scammy project is easy to identify. Most of them are copycats and team members are nowhere to be found on the internet. Its easy to identify legit team members if you check their LinkedIn profile.",

      "body": "I was aware that Polygon founders are Indian but it is not an Indian startup. Indian government minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar claimed in an interview that they are trying their level best to reverse the brain drain issue. I am optimistic that the way this government is working in different sectors it will take some time. We might see some development in the crypto and blockchain hub after regulation are rolled out. At the moment the government is giving more preference to those companies or startups that are working on development projects within the Blockchain technology.",

It's a known thing. In fact, the co-founder of Polygon was the one who created the crypto covid relief campaign during Covid to support the people.Vitalik had donated a huge amount in this campaign and this was when I knew about him.",

It is not that he is late there may be others who might have the same opinion. The main reason Indian media gave an extensive coverage when these guys become millionaire. The coverage went to an extent that some of them claimed it to be Indian startup. Later on, the founders came out and clearly informed the media that they are not Indian startup.",
