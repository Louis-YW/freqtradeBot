This is quite absurd. On the surface it will look like they are charging the armies to not back down from the war, fight till the finish and defend their motherland but deep down, this is high profile suicide. Russia have everything to finish this war and if the Ukrainians see that they are losing more, and decide to concede, why impose such a heartless bill on them?",

The threat that the common soldiers have to put up with is, the threat of the firing squad for not following orders, or the threat of the soldiers they are fighting against.Ukrainian solders often have figured out that their war is not with Russia... that their war is really against an evil Ukrainian government. They wished they had know this before they joined.",
