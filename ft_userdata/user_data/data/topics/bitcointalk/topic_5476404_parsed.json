ERC20 or TRC20 ?Both are fine but if you are saving some fees, TRC20 is the option. That's the advantage of going into TRC20 because of the cheaper network fees than the ERC20.",

Because anything can happen in the cryptocurrency world.Both options like USDT in TRC20 and ERC20 are good you can use you can choose one of them from both. But there is anything can happen in so be careful. Sometimes stable coins also depegg and can crash the market.Both of them ERC20 take more fee as compare to the TRC20. Otherwise both are good.And your decision regarding to buy Nano X a good decision. Storing the assets offline is an excellent idea.",

If, I'm not mistaken, BUSD is also managed by a consortium which includes well-known financial companies too, but if Binance has gone there, this must also be taken into account because if there is talk that if BUSD is removed from the exchange it will be at risk in the future.",

Do you advise other stable coins and why ?USDT is centralized which means it can be frozen even if it's stored in a non-custodial wallet which makes it as unsecure from my perspective. ANd there are decentralized stable coins like DAI which are controlled by smart contracts so the value will remain close to $1 all the time.Quote from: igotek on December 03, 2023, 06:44:22 PMLately I bought Ledger Nano X.

Paxos will continue to support it until February 2024, as the issuance of new BUSD has ceased. BUSD was among the best stablecoins in the market and will soon cease to exist. Most stablecoins may fail due to regulatory pressures and the failure to provide currency reports. USDT is currently considered the best option, and the TRC20 network is the best in terms of fee cost, as ERC20 fees are excessively high compared to other networks, and the Ethereum network is consistently congested. Therefore, diversifying the wallet with multiple supported stablecoins in a hardware wallet and on networks that offer cost-effective solutions and transaction speed is considered the ideal solution.",
