It sounds weird but when one creates 12 keys in any btc wallet then either user knows his 12 words or this wallet knows these 12 words.Is it it possible to hack this 12 word from btc wallet software.ANY OTHER tips for making trezor safe.Thanks",

Those using Trezor, what additional security they can do to make sure they are safe apart from trezor PINProtect your wallet (Trezor one or Trezor T) from physical theft. A physical attack on it can be used to reveal its seed phrase. Or best to use a passphrase to generate the keys and addresses along with the seed phrase.Quote from: btcethgold on January 28, 2024, 08:01:52 AM2.

Those using Trezor, what additional security they can do to make sure they are safe apart from trezor PINDon't tell anybody that doesn't need to know that you've got a Trezor wallet, in fact it's a good practice to learn all you need to know about setting up a Trezor wallet instead of asking a person how to set up one so you're comfortable knowing that no one knows that you've got a Trezor wallet. Shutting up about why you've got this bitcoin or crypto related stuff is the best thing that you can do.Quote from: btcethgold on January 28, 2024, 08:01:52 AM2.

Even if there are other devices that can be used but can still be hacked, it means that the wallet software is considered weak in terms of function and security.",

      "body": "The Trezor PIN is more like security for only the hardware so you will have to use further security method which is the passphrase. So if you've got a passphrase the next security tips is for you to protect yourself from physical attack and protect your passphrase like your life depends on it because if slightly exposed your whole assets is at a very big risk. Why this passphrase is so important is that it's required for a transaction to be carried out if your Trezor hardware is stolen or it's compromised the theft will have to need your passphrase to initiate a TX.",

But there might have been funds kept in a Trezor that were stolen. It's not about a question of storage; it's about a question of keeping the storage safe. It's pointless, for example, to keep your funds in a Trezor but also entered the seed phrase on an application somewhere. The storage may be good but if you're keeping the key to that storage in the open, accessible by anybody, it is of no value.

You are the one who can secure your wallet proper if only you can store your seedphrase in a place where no eyes can find it. If you are using a good wallet you don't need to be scared if your wallet will be hacked just like that, someone else can only get access to your wallet if only your seedphrase is stored in a way that can be exposed. Â Some people stored their seedphrase in online handle or messages that are easily hacked, when this is done the hacker can get information of you to steal more of your valuable asset. It is better for you to know where is best to save your seedphrase that you alone can have access to it anytime.",
