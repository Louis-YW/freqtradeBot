It's not about if it's unlikely, because it is definitely unlikely but we all know fully well that pools and miners could do this coordinated attack if they so please. It's all about what would happen, as OP asks in his main post. Now to answer OP's question. With Network Congestion comes people who would wait for the network to be less congested so they could carry out their transaction, sure they don't count for the mass majority but in a large-scale maneuver like this one, they'd be a great clincher. I'd say that when they do decide to congest the network so much that you'd have to pay 10x the usual price you pay for transactions, millions of cryptocurrency users in the world will mutiny, will not create any transaction for let's say, the next two weeks or so, or would boycott the usage of what they assume were the reasons for this fee increase and transaction delay. Utter chaos will commence within the industry, which will only lead to the general public getting whatever they want.",

This can lead to a less efficient network overall, as more resources are required to process a larger number of transactions.
