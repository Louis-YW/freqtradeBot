      "body": "I never thought about this that such could exist and not even on ebay anyway, but this sounds good and impressive seeing that bitcoin is been painted over all the online platforms and some desirable products like this, this information will help many to know, and this as well is now available after a long time they might have heard about it, there should be more online malls that may have this same product as ebay and walmart do.",

Probably have another couple of them buried in storage. Makes you wonder....how long will the actual Pez last.-Dave",
