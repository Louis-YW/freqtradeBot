  "content": "ClackDo you know the way? No ? I found it, the crypto way! Clack Clack What is Clack?Why Not? DAO system. Funny mini games, Utility NFT’s, Airdrop’s, Staking and more. All for community created by community. You can say this is another shit meme token at Solana Blockchain yes and no, there will be a more serious attitude and an attempt not to repeat the mistakes of other projects.Token burning for important events also will be present.Support Liqudity poolsWe wil use money from sales Stacking solutions and other non community based NFT, service to support Liqudity pool and price at market’s.AirDropsThere will be rewardet good projects what give use cases for Clack. Reward will depend at project quality. Ordinary users will also get a chance to be rewarded in various promotions and events.Rank SystemThe rank system will be given out for services to the community, which will allow you to receive additional bonuses, it will probably be backed up by the NFT pass system.Marketing/AdvertisingActive promotion on all possible social media platforms, avoiding ways that can harm the project.ProjectDAO - ClackDAOEach user will be able to join the DAO of the Project with a certain number of tokens, but in the future the system may be transferred to the NFT pass and may be excluded after the full formation of the main team of the DAO, but the possibility of the existence of Project SubDAO is not excluded.Listing on ceralized exchanges.For listing on centralized exchanges, we will have to go perhaps a short or a long way, but still lean towards option 1. This decision will be made by the entire DAO of the project, the community is the driving force for listings on large projects, such as binance , bybit etc.ExpansionIt is planned to expand to other platforms ( Blockchain’s - ETH, BSC, Polygon and other ) by wrapping the asset, which will open up other ecosystems for us that are not available on Solana.BurningA lot of coins will be burned to maintain the liquidity of the project, burning will be produced for significant and not only events.Clack SpecificationBlockchain:  SolanaToken name:  ClackSymbol:  ClackDecimals After Zero: 5Minting:  LockedStart Date: 02.18.2023 00:00:00 UTCStarting Supply: 100,000,000,000,000.00 (huge amount will be burned)Actual Supply: 99,998,999,999,999.00 (Updatable)Token Address: https://solscan.io/token/2Y6sQjp2PiwnQpMPSvGGYFNSQGY24YubNYXtrB9ufon9Token Address: https://explorer.solana.com/address/2Y6sQjp2PiwnQpMPSvGGYFNSQGY24YubNYXtrB9ufon9Token Address: https://solana.fm/address/2Y6sQjp2PiwnQpMPSvGGYFNSQGY24YubNYXtrB9ufon9?cluster=mainnet-solanafmbetaLP: https://solscan.io/account/GrpG2ySMApbHATEnbH7TD395dR46LLte3baPEqGHf1W8Websitehttps://clack.unoSocial MediaTwitter: https://twitter.com/clack_inuDiscord: https://t.co/T3RMVeAkAxTelegram: https://t.me/ClackinuTelegram CN: https://t.me/ClackinuCNTelegram DAO: https://t.me/ClackDAOTelegram NEWS Channel: https://t.me/ClackinuNewsGithub: https://github.com/clackinuCoinMarketCap Community: https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/Clack_inuSwaps and exchangersRaydium Swap: https://raydium.io/swap?inputCurrency=2Y6sQjp2PiwnQpMPSvGGYFNSQGY24YubNYXtrB9ufon9&outputCurrency=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&fixed=inOpenbook: https://openserum.io/GF6wnStjCqYnYRADr3FZMV24KWXoBdUzvW69VuC8Cx91birdeye: https://birdeye.so/token/2Y6sQjp2PiwnQpMPSvGGYFNSQGY24YubNYXtrB9ufon9",
