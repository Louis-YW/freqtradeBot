If you don't know or have all the asked recovery options then easy to say you can't recover it. Brute force attack may be an option but if you don't what it is and how to do it, well, it's the end of it.",

While it's true that the Google support forum may not always provide a satisfactory solution, there are other options available such as contacting Google support directly or seeking help from a trusted IT professional. If Google support is unable to assist you, then it may be time to accept that your old account is lost for good. Honestly, storing your backup and login information on a third-party mail service was not a smart move in the first place. You should know better than to rely on external providers for something as important.",

Some questions they usually ask are date of birth and perhaps the time your account was created.

Only ask Google about recovering your account and maybe they will also ask for KYC this is just based on my old experience they ask for KYC to recover my account but I just ignore it until my Gmail account got deleted by Google.Another thing is have you tried to recover it through your mobile number?",

Already tried the online form 100s of times but is there any real help I can get from google without sending upfront payments to random scammers.As long as the device on which you created the account and the user IP you know, there is a chance, albeit small, of recovering your account.Stop sending more messages to Google and try to remember more information, if this was years ago, your chance will be less.QuoteAlready tried the online form 100s of times but is there any real help I can get from google without sending upfront payments to random scammers.I do not think that what you are looking for is legal, as hacking your private email is considered an illegal act, and therefore you need to search in the dark internet sites, and you will not find a reliable account that enables you to do so, so do not enjoy the scammers and waste your money.",

Sample this mine I tried to recover or log in without the password using the \"Try another way\" it asks to my phone if I will grant access to this new device.Just go to your phone and type that code.If it didn't work and If you still using the phone where you log in to this Gmail and it is logout now try to recover it using that phone sometimes it works.",
