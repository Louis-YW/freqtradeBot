Could you make something that would visually display your private key and how it corresponds to x and y on the curve, like clicking on a random point on the graph( interactive) and watching everything in real time!",

      "body": "Making a graphic interactive version would be interesting but I think I am going to put down the spreadsheets for a little bit for now.  This one took a long time for me to understand the math that is happening within the ECDSA algorithm (am not a math expert by any stretch) and then build the functionality within the spreadsheet.  I am not happy that one has to copy and paste each point as it is calculated in order to get to the correct x,y result, but excel is just not built for size of digits that bitcoin has.  Since I did the SHA256 algo in a spreadsheet before the RIPEMD160 is on my list for next up once I recharge.  This way I hope to create tutorials for all the steps between making a private key to making a receive addressSorry you could not download it where you are; not sure why it would be prevented.  It is a big file but prevented?  That is strange.  I'll put another link out there if you want to give another go for downloading--let me know",

While I cannot confirm whether this is the first time it has been done, I can appreciate the effort and time it took to develop such a tool. However, it's important to note that Excel may not be the most secure or reliable tool for handling sensitive financial data, especially regarding Bitcoin transactions. Thank you very much for the kind words, and yes, agree on your note that it needs to be used in a purely educational way, not to store value.",
