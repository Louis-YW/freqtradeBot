But as a gambler, you'll still find a way to continue what you've been doing and instead of using bitcoin you'll use the other altcoins that you have. Despite their value is dropping too.You won't mind spending them as you have the priority to hold bitcoin than the alts. It is something like that for which you have bias towards bitcoin because it's no brainer that it's best to hold and have more when we're in a bear market.",

If you are gambling, you would still Gamble for that minimum amount in dollars wedged against the bitcoins but at the same time you can have a lot of problems If you had some amount of Bitcoins on a gambling site so you won't be able to generally sell it fast ⏩ during the dumping as well. That's why most people who gamble daily on Bitcoin sites encash it timely thus making the whole thing easy and efficient as well. Never store your Bitcoins on any Gambling sites this can actually cause problems, always have them stored in a wallet.",

The rewards are still not exciting so i won't take the risk instead. Although some would not mind the current exchange rate because some casinos have certainly fixed rewards, but still i prefer not to gamble using bitcoin. It would be a waste of bitcoin if i end up losing them, it will be better to just store them in my wallet and watch them grow their value when the market recovers.

But it's interesting to see if it's positive or negative! Addicted or professional gamblers will try to put more units of bitcoin in the table because of the low price. Hobbyists may stop gambling because their networth will go down etc. It's hard to say what exactly would happen! But such a drastic price decrease will definitely have an impact on everything related to cryptocurrency.",

Not unless you're that person that always calculates how much you've spent in dollars while gambling with those bitcoins.I think that's the only thing that matters for this impact like spending 0.001BTC when the price was $69,000 and compare it to the price now.",

The reason is that when it goes down, its value decreases, and our stakes will increase in Bitcoin. For now, I stopped betting with BItcoin and focused more on trying to buy some entries. An alternative to the steady gains of USDT betting is used today.",

The traders, investors and gamblers are not left out as well. The impact is that during this timeframe, gamblers who use crypto in gambling may reduce the amount they use in gambling or stop gambling with crypto and revert back to the traditional fiat method or even start visiting offline casinos. The average gambler believes that with every bet, he is likely to win, so the possibility of a core gambler stopping completely even during this dump season is out of the question.",

It mostly will discourage those newbie gamblers that want to try gambling in crypto, they may stay with fiat. For the addicts it will reduce how many times they can gamble because when they have low refill, they have no option than to reduce or source for more coins. Bear market effect like we have it today do have effect on every aspect of crypto business. The casinos also will record low volume of gamble.Quote from: virasog on June 13, 2022, 03:15:50 PMTheir motive is to play gamble and they may not be a concerned if the price of bitcoin is declining sharply?When they don't get winnings and the crypto bear is telling on the refill then the motive will definitely change to reconsideration and reduced outcome of gambling time.",
