  "content": "Hello Everyone,I hope you are all well, slightly longer post than usual.As the title suggests I would enjoy to hear:1 hill you'll die on regarding the future of BTC1 common delusion you've seen related to BTC1 piece of advice that you wish you got told sooner relating to any BTC variable[UNRELATED BELOW, ASSORTMENT OF THOUGHTS]Questions are the metaphorical key to pandora's box but with every action there's an opposite force, in this case one answer could unlock subconscious treasure for an individual stuck in the box we call programming. Programmed since birth whether that is from parents relating to lessons they've received from generations passed or the indoctrination of the education system, I could go on an endless tangent about the capability cap one puts on his or hers self relating to the coding they've subconsciously downloaded from whatever the source may be but I will turn the key to open my next point.Limitations relating to one's potential is common & accepted due to the fear of trying something new, being with the blanket of comfort while not entertaining the idea of going into the cold unknown draws parallel to BTC, those who are opposed to this market have the perception of everything being pitch black but don't realise that BTC can be the light leading to eventual clarity & comfort. Why limit oneself in avenues connected to financial stability & or freedom, there is the argument of balance with there needs to be the average, the talker & or the cowardly to highlight the excellence, the doers & the brave.The connection to oneself could be described as connecting cognitive capabilities to the centre crevouses of cured slow aged growth",

I hope you wouldn't mind or take it hard with my criticism, really want to help you out. You can also focus on posting in your local language board, who knows, you might be able to learn more there and you can communicate much easier there.Make it make sense, your post I mean.",

Alright to your question,  I don't understand the first so would skip. The second I would say to the Bitcoin supporters one delusion I find is it's going to replace Fiat currency,  To me they are going to complement the short comings of the other.  And to the Anti Bitcoiners (ignorant one) is that Bitcoin is just a digital currency, when it is in fact something more. To the last question, it would be always Buy the dip and never sell the Dip.Apriori Bitcoin would always recover from any fall.",

I believe the title of the post and the post itself was written with the sole aim of confusing it readers not to gain any significant idea about whatever message it's giving, that's if actually it's giving any message by the way. Apart from BTC that was made mentioned in the post all other writings sounds philosophical but with a loose body of message that seems to be a real waste of time after reading.Op you can do better than this.",

For example, I saw some people who did not know anything about Bitcoin think that Bitcoin was the cause of the FTX incident and the loss of millions of dollars to people.",
