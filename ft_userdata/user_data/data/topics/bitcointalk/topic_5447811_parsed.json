It is open to all searchers and block builders.This collaboration represents our commitment to providing a trusted, neutral product available to all Ethereum users. We invite additional contributors - please get in touch if you're interested in supporting the project.How does MEV Blocker work?MEV Blocker facilitates an auction between a network of “searchers” who are given the opportunity to backrun your transactions. In return, they protect you from frontrunning and sandwich attacks - the nasty types of MEV that exploit Ethereum users every day.When searchers submit winning bids through the orderflow auction, MEV Blocker sends the full amount of the bid to users and validators at a 90/10 split. Validators keep the 10% as a reward, and users pocket the other 90% as profit they'd miss out on if they weren't using MEV Blocker.As long as you have MEV Blocker set as the RPC in your wallet (as if it were another network), you are protected from frontrunning and sandwiching when using any Ethereum dApp. And the profit share from backrunning is deposited automatically into your wallet.\"",
