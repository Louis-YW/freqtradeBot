But I was surprised that the exchange is demanding for name and mobile number while registering, or to register using Google or Facebook.I tried to find out how their p2p works but I was unable to do that to satisfaction, I will appreciate if anyone among us can let us know about that",

Same here I had a bad experience using Roqqu, it was in the early days and I wanted to buy bitcoins from the app. The whole process was tiring. I don’t know if they have improved their service now because I stopped using after this experience. To buy bitcoins back then, you had to deposit into your roqqu wallet, they charge I think 50naira for that. So now I’m short a lil cash and I don’t mind, I place a buy order and the money is deducted but I don’t receive any coins, after 2 hrs I message support. No response (this was on a weekend, I later found out they didn’t work on weekends just like the banks) and had to wait till Monday before it was resolved. I moved my coins to another wallet, and the transfer fee was just too much. I was pissed. I moved everything from the wallet and never opened the app again. I wouldn’t advice anyone to use their service.",

      "body": "Not to criticize the app but they nearly chased me away from cryptocurrency. I remember doing a transaction that I wanted to receive my money to my local bank (first bank to be certain) but they told me the payment option wasn’t available that I should use Wallets like Opay, Kuda and the rest after choosing both Kuda and Opay I wasn’t still able to withdraw. The only payment option as at then was Raven, something I didn’t had that time I tried opening Raven account but there KYC was taking too long and I had to use a friends Raven account. When I asked around from people already more experienced in crypto as at then they warned me about there support and I should never use them again",

Even some big name for bitcoin space for naija nor get idea of this place, na Reddit and steemit dey common. My problem be say the two exchanges for naija Patricia and Roqqu no be wetin person go out mind. I don talk about my experience with Roqqu and I don hear from a close friend his own bad experience with Patricia. While I got my money back from Roqqu, my friend wasn’t so lucky with Patricia. In essence, Wetin I dey tok be say we need to do research before we use any exchange. Forget the hype, some nor know wetin them dey do.",
