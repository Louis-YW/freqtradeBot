In Africa, bitcoin offers an indispensable financial safe haven.Key Facts:The naira redesign has exacerbated the current economic hardship faced by Nigerians and increased pressure on the unbanked.Nigerians headed to the polls on Saturday to decide the next leader of Africa’s largest democracy, with economic challenges being top of mind.Given the current economic climate, bitcoin is viewed by many Nigerians—especially amongst the younger generation—as a safe haven for both the underbanked and unbanked as economic conditions worsen.(...)",

I think that was/is a result of converting BTC Naira price into USD at the \"official\", inflated rate.Quick search: official rate: 1 USD = 461 NGN; and the \"black market\" rate: 1 USD = 755 NGN (source)This makes sense, and essentially means it's not so much that BTC is appreciating in price, but Naira is worth much less than officially declared.",

The newspapers have greatly fueled this misconception, but it was debunked nicely on bitcointalk, see:Misconception of selling at premium in NigeriaBasically the BTC-USD parity is the normal one, just the USD price/rate in Naira is much bigger on the street than what's in the official papers.So the premium is not on Bitcoin itself, it's actually on USD, if we can say so.",

      "body": "There are currently two technologies that are being used as alternative payment options in Nigeria, namely Bitcoin and MPesa. The one is centralized and the other decentralized... so it might help, if someone could educate those people on which one should be the best. The danger of centralized technologies like MPesa are that the new government can block transactions over Cellphone providers, but they cannot do that with Bitcoin transactions. (Where would you rather keep your wealth in uncertain political situations like this?)",
