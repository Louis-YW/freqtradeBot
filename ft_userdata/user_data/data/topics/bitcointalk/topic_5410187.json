  "content": "Cryptocurrency pioneers, nice to meet you, this is my dad's account.He is a dedicated promoter of the crypto community. He used to explain Bitcoin to me when I was a kid. He watched Bitcoin come into being and grow. Because Bitcoin was too expensive to target for long-term storage, he often remorse. Many times he lost money by investing in cheaper altcoins, and the chronic stress of family life and work overload left him depressed.I read the discussion on the development of Bitcoin in the early days of the forum, and felt very magical and incredible. This is a great invention, a great era. When Bitcoin was born, I was a 7-year-old ignorant girl, and I also missed it. got it.We weren't there when shells were money, we weren't there when gold was there, we weren't there when cars were there, and I wasn't there when electricity was there. Those who can mine 50BTC or 25BTC in one block, you are the luckiest!The developers of the Bitcoin community, a group of young geniuses, who did not want to have fun when they were young, but got into the field of cryptography and created a great Bitcoin. For their ideals and beliefs, I adore them very much!I hate altcoins, they made my dad lose money and they are just imitating bitcoin, a lot of altcoins are just to scam money and then disappear, and the real king is bitcoin. So I call on everyone to join me and only believe in Bitcoin, abandon those altcoins that cheat money, and just follow it!",
