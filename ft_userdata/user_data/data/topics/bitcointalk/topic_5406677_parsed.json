Not only with Bitcoin Core but also with other non-custodial wallets.How to sign a message?Stake your Bitcoin address here. Sign first, stake it there.QuoteI want a way to verify the ownership of my address by signing a message with its private key / wallet password. You misunderstood it. You sign, others will verify it and confirm your ownership.Of course, you can try to sign a message and verify it too.QuoteHe might agree to send few Satoshis for me but might not sign a message for me. (so, signing message using bitcoin core would be the best choice, if that is possible)Your friend can only sign a message if you share your keys to him. It is risky because you will no longer the only ownership of that wallet. You and your friend co-own that wallet.",

As I said the standard already exists and even if it didn't, everyone is welcome to propose any standard and implement it either on top of core or any other implementation of the protocol.That's not to mention that bitcoin core as the reference implementation of the protocol is not supposed to have every single optional feature.What you point out about other wallet developers is inaccurate. I personally categorize them into two groups: competent and incompetent.- Competent developers like the Electrum devs, don't copy code or wait for someone else to implement things for them to copy. They implement it if the standard exists which is why you can sign a message from SegWit addresses in Electrum.- The incompetent devs are the ones you are talking about, if you look at their code it is horrible and is mostly copied or translated which is why they don't have options such as message signing if it is not found in bitcoin core. These are the same devs who reuse k values and leak users' private keys. In other words such wallets should not even be used let alone for you to talk about whether they've implemented message signing!",

(and lets now welcome brink, the 2022 sponsors of core.. oh. and same mother company(dcg) back-end funding it as blockstream))great thing about history, and data. .. it exists. so go researchgood luck with your research though.. you need it. seems it was once step forward 5 steps back for you. .. you couldnt even last a day going against your fandom...anyway.. back to the point of topic.just use legacy, so much easier. it just does what its suppose to do without cludge. .. i do.. and even the segwit dev that coded segwit does. he uses legacy addresses still",

(and all the other stuff average joe have asked for since 2015 with hundreds of topics from thousands of people wanting it, that are still not available today)for anyone that has tried to make a REFERENCE client of a full node thats not part of the 'core' dev branding, they get treated like outsiders, competition, threat. thus everyone ends up relying on core.. like zombies(note events of 2014-2017)core has become the central CORE of the protocol evolution where people no longer just make their own wallet to then offer the community an opportunity to upgrade the protocol or have a standardised feature all wallets follow. ..instead an upgrade to the protocol requires proving to core devs that they should implement it in core because everyone follows cores lead. its why they branded themselves 'core' to be at the CENTEReven your buddies are unfortunately indoctrinated into the \"trust and adore blindly' mindset. by saying the usual crap of 'if you want a feature, fork off, make an alt and see who follows it' rather than thinking there should be multiple reference clients on the bitcoin network offering protocol upgrades that become standardised across all wallets... so now everyone just ends up using core software. and ontop of that just blindly trusts core, 'cos fandom'so when core devs make decisions to ignore users wanting features and treat any bip thats not part of the core devs roadmap, as a threat or whatever excuse they find. then that is where the devs are not doing their job properlyyes core devs do add features. but not the ones average joe want. they add the ones corporations want.people want cheap fee's and the ability to use BITCOIN without being told that their transaction is not worthy or that only the elite should have the blockspace and where the 2billion unbanked should not get to use bitcoin because they simply dont earn enough to pay the fee. thus all the 'unbanked' features promised of bitcoin to average joe in the early days have gone. the corporations wanted new opt-in tx formats to use as locks/pegs to bridge to other networks. guess which features take priority. and which features are forgotten about once the corps get their basic features addedyep segwit got implemented so that LN, liquid, and other sidechains can then lock bitcoin. to then reference those locks for their altnet pegged units of measure. but because message signing was not part of the corporation requirements of the sponsored project, core devs didnt add that. and so normal average joe that doesnt need to use segwit for locking up funds, but may want just an address that has all the stuff legacy has, finds segwit lacking, because its incomplete in comparison to legacyand no dont BS me with the 'segwit offers fee discount'. no . reality is the cludge of pushing segwit in, came with  making legacy 4x more expensive not the other way round(not to make segwit cheaper). thus users didnt get the discount compared to their 2015-16 experience. when devs and their fangirls tell the unbanked and average joe \"bitcoin doesnt want you, so here try this different network the corporations created, its better\".. you should wake up to see that its the devs that are the problemwhen devs and their fangirls tell average joe \"bitcoin doesnt want your feature go fork off and see who follows your altcoin, we are not interested in your feature\".. you should wake up to see that its the devs that are the problemwhen devs dont admit their own human laziness and arrogance and greed of sponsorship for the roadmap. and instead put in limits and then blame the code (which they wrote) pretending its a code problem and not a dev politics problem. you should wake up to see that its the devs that are the problembut when you(as i have seen you and your buddy group do) instead want to call out bitcoin as being limited/unable to handle users/[insert other nonsense]. and then go straight to human trust obedient loyal ass kissery to protect the devs(humans).. you are not thinking about bitcoin(code). you are social drama kissing humansyea i your group mindset pretending to protect certain things with \"devs should not be told what to do\", pretending its about keeping devs from implementing bad things.. but here is the thing.. they are paid by corporate interests to do what they are told to implement features even though those features are cludgy and unfinished for the normal user experience. where the user experience is not what it seems or as promised/promoted to themand no dont even try the BS about the low level devs that just review, spellcheck, or add comments.. as your rebuttal way of trying to pretend core devs are 'decentralised'  im talking about the actual maintainers and main committers and merger devs that make the actual decisions of what gets in who are all sponsored by the same main corporation",
