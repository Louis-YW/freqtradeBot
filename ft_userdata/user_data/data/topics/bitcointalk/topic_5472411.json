I have some challenges blocking my way. 1. I heard that Asic miners like s19 are not capable anymore, not very profitable I meant, buying such right now won't bring better profit after the halving and even in a bull market. 2. I was told that to stay ahead of the game when others will be probably selling their s19 it's better to go for the best top asic miners, which Asic miner is the number 1 now?3. For someone from a country with unstable grid power can we still mine Bitcoin and still be in profit? My last question,  is this the right time to buy Asic miner or when the bull market beginnings? Which way will you prefer and why?",

What is the average electricity costs KW/h.Have you calculated the costs of the lost opportunity, which means that if you purchase bitcoin now, will you achieve better profits than mining?I advise you if the taxes are not high in your country (here mining may save you a lot of tax money), it is better for you to buy bitcoin",

I'd assume when the bull market happens the price of mining rigs would also increase, although it is probably not as big as how GPU prices inflated rapidly in the last few years. I've seen some news saying major producers are giving discount when the market is not that good, so I'd assume the opposite could also happen[1]. On the other hand, even if you buy now (and you have an ideal condition of everything), you still need time to mine to break even. I guess it depends on your risk profile most of the time.

      "body": "Instead of deciding to mine based on where the price of Bitcoin is or how the price of Bitcoin may change in the coming days, you should make a decision to mine based on how much it will cost you to mine. Electricity is a very important and essential element for mining so first of all you need to make sure you are getting your electricity supply at low cost. Or if your country has rules that the higher the unit of electricity you use, the more money you have to pay per unit, but you will have less chance of making money from mining. First select a place where you will get cheap electricity supply and good electricity supply system. If the electricity consumption is low and the electricity supply system is at a high level, then you can decide to start mining now.",

I stay in a country with very bad power supply, unstable and unpredictable at the same time. The cost of electricity has not reduced under these conditions, but in fact has increased in price, the cost of gasoline and diesel to even run generators is very high right now too because the subsidy that the government pays for these products has been withdrawn. To have constant and a steady supply of electricity, you have to likely operate off grid with like solar panels, and that will cost a lot to set up. A stable and cheap source of power should amongst the first considerations of someone who wants to start mining bitcoins.",

As a starter, I would have suggested buying used to rig to start your journey but if you start before the halving, that may not be profitable. Power to reward ratio is not going to be as efficient as before and you may not make any profit at all. Instead what I suggest is, whatever you are planning to invest into mining, you should consider buying Bitcoin with it and hodl. Because the Bitcoin halving is near and as history tells us, we will see a bull market. By doing this, you are increasing the chance of profit with less risks. And if you wait there will be more advanced miner available in the market in the future. You will have more to invest and better equipment to start your journey.",
