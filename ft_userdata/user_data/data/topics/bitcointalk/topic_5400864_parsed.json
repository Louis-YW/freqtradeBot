Or are you talking about the NFT marketplace? There is a large marketplace for NFT their website is https://opensea.io/ but the problem is the ETH network gas fees are expensive compared to other networks.You can try Binance they have an NFT marketplace not a large marketplace but you can pay a cheap gas fee you can find their marketplace here https://www.binance.com/en/nft/home",

Don't be greedy because losing is usually because of greed. You can stay with binance because it is popular and you can easily get help here about it if you raise an issue that needs contribution.

Because I'm pretty sure trading returns will totally depend on your performance, not necessarily the exchange.Also, if you're talking about gas fees(Ethereum), then every platform is guaranteed to have $10+ withdrawal fees because Ethereum fees are expensive.",

I was reading an article on https://detailsnreviews.com/crypto-exchange-okcoin-launches-a-free-trading-nft-marketplace/ , do you think it is good to start with 120$?As some people have stated if you buy your coins directly from an exchange then you can save yourself the miner fees and you will only have to pay the trading fees as long as you do not get your coins out of the exchange, and even those can be reduced if you choose to withdraw your money with coins with a very low transaction fee, with that being said it seems you are interested in the NFT market, I would recommend you reconsider your decision as the NFT market is not really a place of newbies to invest as most likely you will lose your 120 dollars relatively quickly if you decide to invest in that market.",

Then later on you can start investing using your metamask or buy a Trezor wallet for added security.This is the best and secured option, though of course your safety will still depend on the knowledge that you have so if you are a newbie, better to limit your trade transactions first while you are still learning about the market. Trading is not easy, and with that capital you should not expect something big in return in just a short period of time. If you already have background in trading then Binance is really good for you.",

Better create an account in binance or kucoin or other reliable exchanges, at least they are the reputable ones in the market and you know they won't run away with your funds. If the exchange is small and never heard of, better stay away from them before they screw you with your funds. They may be offering the lowest trading or withdrawal fee, but your problem that you may encounter will be like the liquidity of the trading pair and it would take long time before you can withdraw your funds.",

One of the aims of the platform is to remove the complexity from trading. It has trading tools and it is very easy to navigate. You can place your trades with a Binance account connection. You can check it out by just signing up also and it is free. It allows you to create your entry and exit conditions by just typing, and defining your size in any way you want, set and manage multiple stop loss and take profit and modify it on the chart so all in one place and requires one click and you are able to manage everything in one place, replaying your position history on the chart in real-time so that you can see what is missing on your trading strategy and how to improve them, which conditions are fulfilled and how they are fulfilled etc.",

It is easy to maneuver without much stress on what to get familiar with it. There are other platform you can use to start your journey into the crypto world which are just like Binance. One thing that makes Binance easy to use is because of it app that has both professional and starter interface where you can easily get things done. One of the major problem is Binance is a centralized platform that requires KYC for you be able to buy and sell.",

Your $120 might not last long if you are going to use the ETH network or something because it's going to be expensive. It's not going to be worth it unless it's going to be a steal. For the part where you are going to use an exchange, it's going to be better I think if there are low fees to begin with. Maybe you can start there.

If I am not wrong they do have the stock market pairs as well? I heard somewhere but not 100% sure.One exchange I would strongly suggest staying away from is Bittrex, their support literally sucks. I had to send them 20 emails and almost always got a botted reply or the person communicating had no interest in solving the problem and even now it's unsolved for years. Not going to go into details but I would never suggest anyone trading at bittrex.Binance, FTX, KuCoin, Okx are some of the decent exchanges I have used and/or heard good things from my friends who I know are not paid reviewers.",
