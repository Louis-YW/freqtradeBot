I think even nuetral tag is unnecessary for that, no scam allegation (which is 100% worthy of negative tag), no shit post allegation (which would have been better to even be reported for deletion), no other reasons seeing worthy of negative tag. But only Timelord2067 can remove the negative tag. @Gencecikmen, the best you can do is to contact Timelord2067 and dialogue with him. I believe he will be convinced enough to remove it if there is no other reason you are tagged.Edit: But, I did not see the negative tag showing on your profile, I do not see any reason you are so bothered about this yet.",

So the negative feedback will appeared on the trusted feedback.That's correct.  If you want to see what Gencecikmen's trust looks like with default trust settings just add \";dt\" to the end of the url for his profile like so:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3377868;dthttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=3377868;dtAny page on the forum can be modified this way.  Adding \";dt\" will display the page as if you had default trust settings.I agree that this seems like harsh feedback.  I think Timelord2067 might have made a mistake.  The reference shows that the campaign was open when Gencecikmen made that post, and another member who didn't get tagged made an application just a few minutes later.  Hopefully Timelord2067 will see this and remove that feedback.",
