His ideology is not bad at all since we are already using sign message as last resort to recover our account here. We can have an option to manual login using username and password or use a web3 like method to login like what he suggest. I think his suggestion is possible in the future due to Ordinals since there’s already some development in there in regards with web3 wallet on Bitcoin.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ordinals-support-comes-bitcoin-based-212544478.html#:~:text=Xverse%2C%20billed%20as%20a%20%E2%80%9CBitcoin,NFTs%20onto%20the%20Bitcoin%20blockchain.Looking on the current version of the forum,  I think this is not possible but I’m not a developer so correct me if I’m wrong here.",

Safe to say this forum would be unwelcoming to users who do not have any Bitcoin wallet if we have got something like this in place, so no.I think OP want the members to see it clear and possibly discuss over it here as this board is very important in respect to the development of the bitcointalk platform. Maybe this Idea could be feasible if it is properly debated on and members being convinced as to why they would need it to sign in their various accounts from different location if the need arises.My take on this, most of private and personal hacks are possibly from compromised web browser which were not detected early enough. Do you not think it would not be different from others if bitcoin follow such steps? It would be obvious that it could result to massive compromise of data and funds as the case maybe.",

Signed message is only needed to recover your account if it gets hacked or lost, the recovery team needs it to prove ownership.You also don't need to post your bitcoin address publicly (if it's private), but you may need to do that somewhere like a private PM or something. This can also help more than nothing. Also forum don't need your main address to sign messages, but just an empty address completely controlled by the user himself is more than enough.",

This forum is probably slowly dying and you are right about what you say, this process will just kill this forum even harder, why will someone newbie register here when he has to do something difficult in first case to ask a question? On another hand, here we have reddit where you can sign up with one click via Google or Apple account.No, no, this will kill the forum!",

Maybe the forum is not interested on logging in to the forum by any means other than the bitcointalk.org for some security measures, my thoughts anyway, having a web browser designed for the bitcointalk login will have to be on the google or any centralized app stores which the forum may also kicked against, the only means is to access the forum through the host address the bitcoin admin manages, anyone with a case of lost or hacked account should follow the normal procedure for the recovery if they are truly the owner of such account.",

I don't think any newbie writes too often; that may give them a time frame limit. Even if they post multiple times in a short time frame, I doubt the post quality. Getting banned due to plagiarism is not too harsh. Especially forum moderators are giving more chances to users. If they get caught doing plagiarism multiple times, It's justified. If you see some newbies doing plagiarism, You report them, and they never know why they were banned. An excellent idea could be if you see someone plagiarizing, warn them and refer to the rules thread. If you find them for a 2nd time, Give them a temp ban. The 3rd time they should be banned permanently. I agree that getting permanently banned for first-time plagiarism is too harsh. We don't know how many chances someone got. So, it is up to moderators to find out if they were given an opportunity. They may have a log of users' activity. Quotenot many users welcome newbie etc. I see this one as the biggest problem. At the same time, I don't blame everyone. Some of us always try to help newbies, while some of us constantly being attacking to them.",
