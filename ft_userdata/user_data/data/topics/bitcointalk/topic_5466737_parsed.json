Not only bitcoin is getting attention, but I also see many new fields and industries appearing that completely change the way they operated before. However, in this forum, when we know about bitcoin, we all believe that the positive impact it creates, I personally am not completely sure but what it has been doing is almost Exactly what we all expected.",

So if we really want to survive we have to adapt to these changes that are evidently coming. Aside from the obvious of holding on to bitcoin and focusing more on my investments, I'd probably put much effort into keeping an eye on the market and doing research on what the best business will be and if it will be a good time to launch one or to just hold off for a little more. In times like this it is best to do informed and always be updated as each decision may lead to consequences, both positive and negative.",

I think it's no brainer that everyone has to prepare for any major downturn economically and like saving as much as we can, and it is possible that many will have to sell their holdings if it turns out that they have no choice left but to sell their very last bitcoin even we're not yet in a bull run. Anyway, that's an event that's okay to sell those because if you have no other option and that's your major choice since minor ones won't help you to cope up. There is nothing that much that we can do, it's hard to stack up when you've sold already because you'll feel that you're cheated by the market of how it's going to be expensive soon. Personally, I'd lessen my spending into nonsense things although I don't know what nonsense spending I am doing right now since majority of my expenditures are all essentials. Maybe downsizing from there would be the start and adjustment.",

Btc would also be a good choice in this environment. Since the dollar is a currency and bitcoin is both, when the dollar loses its intrinsic value, every other commodity will go to infinity against the dollar, btc too. However this is not going to be a friendly environment for any of us so it will be too dangerous to make trades. I would rather prefer the dollar to survive through this mess but I also know it is not possible anymore.",

For a situation, where even you money might not be able to save you, it's best to create new strategies. as bitcoiner, we might just be as lucky because even in times like this, we have this belief that Bitcoin might just be a way to survive of which it is.

You can see that without electricity, internet connection, your Bitcoin holdings could become worthless.

These alternative investments might help you during times of crisis.",

It's just that the economic hardship is only getting worsening on a daily basis.And we as bitcoiners if it get so worse as some economic experts has speculated then I am sure our bitcoin holding would save a lot of us because many holders would be forced to sell to feed and settle some other hefty financial challenges. Investing in agriculture will be the best life saving in those harsh times because what everyone will care for most importantly is foodstuffs. So if you don't have high amount to invest in agriculture you can still have a small farm for subsistence farming to cushion the effect.",

We are heading  into a major economic shift and I feel like when the tides are turning like this there should be a conscious effort to land on the right side of that shift!!! Am I right?Of course that's true. Because we must always be ready and always alert to face all economic conditions that may occur. Because current economic conditions are very difficult to predict. Because as we know, war between countries and inflation have hit several countries. So it is not impossible that all of these things will happen to the country we live in. So thorough preparations to face all these conditions must be made from now on. Just like having investment assets such as bitcoin, this can certainly be said to be a very good first step. Because if inflation occurs, having investment assets such as bitcoin will at least reduce the impact.Quote from: tread93 on September 14, 2023, 02:49:17 AMWhat should bitcoiners be doing right now to prepare for a potential global economic hardship other than the obvious which is to hodl and accumulate as much as you can...I personally will definitely save on expenses and will continue to put my money into the investment assets that I own (bitcoin and also gold). Apart from that, I will also develop the business that I have established well. Because if now I am not serious about developing the business I founded, I am worried that the global economy will suddenly collapse without warning and if it is like that, the situation will definitely not allow me to continue actively developing the business. So the important point for now is, you must be able to make the best use time, as wisely as possible, and as productively as possible.",

But isn't there more to the key than just accumulating?First, think about cash flow. In times of trouble, liquid asset are the most important. Can BTC be quickly sold off if needed? Second, regulatory environment. As the economy fall, countries might change the crypto laws. It's crucial to keep an eye on that front. Lastly, knowledge.

Because all the activities related to Bitcoin can be conducted through mobiles, people who use Bitcoin have lived a good life at that time.

Bitcoin will not flourish when the economy is bad because many people will not have money to invest in it. Even if you hodl bitcoin for a long time and make a lot of profit, it will have less value if the country is going through hyperinflation. This is because after you have converted your Bitcoin to fiat, it will not have much value. My expectation is that my country's economy should flourish and let the price of Bitcoin keep rising and let adoption keep spreading. With less inflation and the rise of Bitcoin price, hodling will make a lot of sense. When more people adopt Bitcoin, the decentralization feature such as P2p will increase.",
