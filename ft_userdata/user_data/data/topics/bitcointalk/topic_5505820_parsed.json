  "content": "Maximalism is the mindset that your project is the only valid one. This approach leads to a refusal to consider new information. It is dogmatic and somewhat intellectually limiting, in my opinion. And I have encountered it several times in this forum.Bitcoin maximalists tend to dismiss the perspectives of those outside Bitcoin. While I respect the economic tenets of Bitcoin, such as digital scarcity, the superiority complex should not overshadow technical discussions. Bitcoin is not inherently superior to other cryptocurrencies like Monero or Litecoin; it simply has its own trade-offs.However, there's more to consider. Bitcoin embodies the free-market ideals envisioned by Austrian economists, who would likely support a market of competing currencies. To me, that means Bitcoin embraces this variety of cryptocurrencies. Being a Bitcoin maximalist is actually contrary to the spirit of Bitcoin, because it involves unwavering support for Bitcoin, when you should be skeptical and rigorous in examining its potential weaknesses. We move forward in life by addressing our flaws, not by celebrating our achievements. As Charles Darwin said,Quote from: Charles DarwinIt is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.Don't be myopic and dogmatic. Say no to maximalism.",

Undoubtedly bitcoin has been the best when it comes to investment so far especially in the case of long term investment.  However for a couple of other things like fees especially in times of congestion bitcoin wasn't the best option. The fact is everyone is condemning altcoins because too many of them out there are simply pump and dump schemes.Many persons are unable to differentiate these pump and dump coins that's why they end up losing funds to them . Bitcoin has actually proven to be the best at long term returns and that's just fact coupled with decentralisation. Altcoins too have their own applications like in cases of more frequent and light weight transactions.",

      "body": "Perhaps I'm not a bitcoin maximalist but I do encourage people to maximise every opportunity that they have in bitcoin and any other investment, it's better to maximise opportunities than make some rigorous thinking that might end up obstructing your opportunities. It's quite unfortunate that here in the forum we have some bitcoin maximalist squad that are not ready to compromise their beloved but I think they are more obsessed with the currency and anti altcoins but perhaps altcoins are not irrelevant as they deem it to be but they have their own values that they add to the space but more for advance coiners. But one thing I will have to address is the fact that bitcoin is a paradigm or a paradigmic currency that just shifted our knowledge or thinking but it's not a cult, I see people try to make bitcoin seem like a cult or a thing to worship but in all I wouldn't discourage the act because it's perpetual to them. Fact remains that we can't change people's beliefs, everyone is entitled to what he or she wants to believe... for me, it's just stay real.",

Well, I think one major reasons why we have so many maximalist(if there is a word like that), might be because of there personal financial experience with other crypto outside Bitcoin. They might have lost heavily or fall victim of failed projects, and other things we can think of as far as alts are concerned. While, there are others who don't even have any personal experience with things outside Bitcoin, but assume or end up becoming a maximalist because of what others proclaim.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on August 11, 2024, 11:37:27 AMthe superiority complex should not overshadow technical discussions. I don't really know the level of maximalism when it comes to technical discussion, because I have always focus more to learning about the technical aspect of Bitcoin and nothing else, which I don't know if it's the right thing to do. Maybe that is even a sign of being a maximalist, or maybe it's because of the environment(space) i found myself, which I think might be different if I where to in another.",

Bullshit simply not true.Stop the fucking argument Stop wanting to use a tractor trailer to deliver a single lunch.thus at a minimum you need to accept sha 256 and scrypt. or you are simply delusionalSorry to rip you but I am right and you are wrong.Oh wait sound like I am practicing crypto inclusionim is that as bad as BTC maximalismup to you to decide. not me.  my mind is made up",

When Bitcoin maximalists somehow dominated the social media, they also claimed to be maximalists themselves, Bitcoin-only people. They're not genuinely maximalists by principle though. They seem to be simply parroting what's popular. And they're easily swayed by opportunities that one could get from shitcoins, airdops, DeFi, staking, meme coins, and other garbage. But they aren't a special group of people. Even popular so-called maximalists are hypocrites themselves. They're Bitcoin-only but they'll readily make use of stablecoins whenever convenience calls for it. They're maximalists and yet they've developed centralized platforms and custodial services. They claim to be solid Bitcoin advocates and yet they're supporting KYC. This goes on.In reality, Bitcoin maximalism is but a mirage.",

Bitcoiners tend to ignore the obvious to push the narrative and their refusal to try to address or acknowledge Bitcoin's shortcomings is laughable. There were instances, specifically recently where I've been engaging in several discussions relating to Bitcoin as an investment, Bitcoin's \"HODL\" mindset and volatility is good just to name a few.Tons of these threads are literally circlejerks with repeated parroting of the Bitcoin is the best narrative, or whatever the topic was about. Threads like these are frankly rather pointless and don't encourage any discussion or critical thinking.

The horizon for what is considered long term is far beyond Bitcoin's current lifespan, and that the fact that we've been through so many volatile periods practically proves my point. If you argue that Bitcoin is good because it has experienced XXX% growth in the past 5 years, then it cannot be considered the \"best long term investment\". This is a good example of Bitcoin maximalism.",

I feel we've got to know that nothing is irreplaceable as long as people aren't enthusiastic about it. Part of what makes Bitcoin what it is now is the fact that people believe that it's the best digital asset that is and that can possibly ever be. It's left for those involved in another project to put in the required effort in promoting theirs.Except I'm getting it all wrong if not I don't think it's a bad thing to be a core Bitcoin enthusiast who speaks and defends what he knows about Bitcoin that propels him to consider it an asset to invest into. Even in the sports niche, Real Madrid fans believed that the club is the best in the world even though there had been instances when other clubs did better than them. It's not that they are maximist but rather they are just enthusiastic about their club. Though not too old in the bitcoin ecosystem, I'm yet to find an alternative digital asset that's as strong and resistive as Bitcoin and if I'm being bullish about it in my views about it, it's based on this ground.",

What I mean is that the protocol lacks a strong focus on privacy. Sure, you can take advantage of the way transactions work, and build things like coinjoin, but the network, given as is, does not come with anything apart from coin control. Coinjoin is an interactive process, which is a significant drawback. The ability to seamlessly pay anyone without any interaction beyond broadcasting the transaction, as in ring signatures, is vastly superior to coinjoin. Not only does it offer greater robustness by eliminating the need for a coordinator, but it also provides an anonymity set that is orders of magnitude larger. (Since you can pick decoys from outputs of past transactions.)",
