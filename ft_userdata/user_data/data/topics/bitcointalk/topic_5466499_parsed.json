  "content": "Hi,I've been helping to build a suite of AI driven tools for crypto traders with GNYRR.com over the last year. Our site is FREE and will always be free.  However we will be launching some premium paid for features in the future such as algorithmic trading and alerts/notifications.Our site provides AI powered trading indicator and technical analysis for the 12 most popular tokens (measured by trading volume).We are looking for beginner to intermediate crypto traders to look at our site and provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.We have a small number of paid for testing slots still available (please DM if you are interested). To take part in this you must meet various requirements and be happy to be recorded using the site to help our UX design.Please do visit gnyrr.com, have a look around.  Any feedback or suggestions are most welcome. We're trying to build tools that are useful to traders and to do that we need help from the trading community.Many thanks,Dan",
