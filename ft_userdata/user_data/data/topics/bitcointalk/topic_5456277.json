  "content": "I want to give a huge shout out to Polymerbit for making his debut in Stacks Bowers tomorrow with this amazing PMG graded \"cold storage document\" note. Wow! So amazing man, I am so pumped to see what this ends up going for! Here is a link to the auction:https://auctions.stacksbowers.com/lots/view/3-134S4P/unfunded-2020-polymerbit-bitcoin-cold-storage-document-firstbits-125gnk7s-serial-no-a000061-series-2a-u-nd-gem-uncirculated-66-ppInfo from link provided about Polymer's note: LOT DESCRIPTIONDesirable Unfunded Polymerbit Bitcoin \"Banknote\"Gem Uncirculated 66 PPQ (PCGS)Unfunded 2020 Polymerbit Bitcoin Cold Storage Document. Firstbits 125GNK7s. Serial No. A000061. Series 2A-U (ND). Gem Uncirculated 66 PPQ (PCGS).Unfunded and non-loaded. This specimen represents the very first of the type to be offered by our firm. It functions in a similar way to the popular crypto coins by Casascius, Lealana and others, featuring an associated public address that can be loaded to a custom amount and a private key hidden behind a security seal that can be used to redeem the value. Polymerbit claims that this issue is \"the culmination of four years of security design and production improvements. The design efforts on this note alone have exceeded 100 hours..\"Though officially labeled as cold storage \"document\", the format generally resembles the banknotes printed for circulation in the United Kingdom. This undoubtedly makes them desirable to the passionate community of world paper money collectors as well as crypto enthusiasts. Public Address: 125GNK7sVfHRcvm8Rw8Aw22WCxdsyXCzNE.PCGS# 1132633.Click here for certification details from PCGS.PCGS # 1132633",

Clearly a lot of uneducated buyers getting into the space which I guess is good overall for the market.Yeah, mixed feelings, if the buyer finds out later on and cares much about money it could lead to negative feelings regarding crypto collectibles. My guess is these are mostly very wealthy bidders and some of them just throw a few (hundret) bucks at the \"smaller\" items listed while also bidding on some of the big Cas and Lealana coins, so probably no harm done.Seeing all these rare and partly unknown items on Stacks Bowers always makes me quite happy. Finally some more recognition!",

Sure, it's easy to dismiss most of art and collectible markets as overvalued. If you see it that way, then outside forum prices for crypto collectibles are probably overpriced.But our forum isn't frequented much, many auctions aren't recognized by more than a dozen collectors, so how does this represent a \"realistic\" price? I guess the \"real\" value of most collectibles is somewhere in the middle of forum prices and high bids in Stacks auctions.Long run, when/if Bitcoin becomes mainstream and more and more collectos become aware of this field, current prices will most likely still be peanuts compared to what will be called normal then.Quote from: MoparMiningLLC on June 19, 2023, 07:00:34 PMQuote from: krogothmanhattan on June 19, 2023, 06:48:02 PM Mentioning Satori chips....I would love to place an entire roll and see how that would do on this auction site...but then again they would want them to all be graded first...Can't see myself taking apart a roll just for the grading.  I think the roll in itself is a collectable and would leave it the way it is as its worth more that way than broken apart.  Just my two Sats on that subject  agreed! do not break open the roll!Good point.

Even if you didn't personally profit from that sale its an honor receiving the recognition from Stacks Bowers in this niche cryptomatists space (crypto + numismatist- did I just coin a new term? lol). I also couldn't agree with you more on the subject these collectibles are simply undervalued, as more and more people from the newer generations are introduced to Bitcoin and crypto the demand for these types of coins / notes can only go up I would imagine.  In 10 more years we will have a whole new set of adults making disposable income that will be educated on crypto and bitcoin,there is no telling what another generation and 10 more years of advancements and awareness it will bring!",
