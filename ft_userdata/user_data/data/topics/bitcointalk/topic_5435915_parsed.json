I made a post on here a while ago about how someone could teach a child about crypto and I think the same strategy applies: find something they're interested in and go at it from that angle or wait for them to learn about it themselves. With the second one, for older people, you might be able to change the media they focus on to do this as a lot of mainstream media include news segments on cryptocurrency (right wing media doesn't afaik) and economics or business related media don't. If your grandparents don't have any interest in investing, business or technology, it might be a lost cause unless you can find a way to make them interested in it...",

You can keep doing what you are doing and keep your business more private since it is likely remote. Their skepticism and lack of interest means they could talk leisurely about your bitcoin activities to others and could attract undue attention.Quote from: Vvang on January 18, 2023, 03:52:00 PMHow do one educate the illiterate about digital currency? Literacy is not a prerequisite for learning bitcoin. If they have the willingness and interest they can learn very fast, and if not they would never learn despite how educated.N.B. Never force one who is disinterested to learn about bitcoin.- Jay -",

I understand that one might not need that in our world these days but, your guardians as they stand now need some securities on your head and they aren't far from the truth on that.Perhaps if getting a job is some worth difficult, you can run a business.Good enough your doing great with cryptos and you've explained to them just what your into but, you could as well diversify with other fields as well.",

There is also a participant among us who, at 47, believes that it is too late for him to invest in bitcoin; at least he asked this, which means he doubted it.If your seniors are very old, then just don't waste time on them. For these people, the computer is a worldwide evil, and everything that is not felt in their hands, namely money, is fraud and a waste of time.But if they can help you with your investment, which I think is your problem, you need to explain it in very simple terms. There are participants among us who are now at a very advanced age, and these people are desperate Bitcoiners. Therefore, if you personally have an interest in telling your seniors about cryptocurrencies, do not despair; you can do it. If you don't need anything from them, don't waste your time.",

I also don't think this is a age issue, there's plenty of examples of people who don't understand Bitcoin, and that's not exactly their fault. Bitcoin isn't very accessible, since it's a new concept, and does take some research to understand, which not everyone will be willing to do.",

It does seem difficult for you to explain about Bitcoin to your grandparents who are illiterate or illiterate about cryptocurrencies. But that doesn't mean there isn't a solution, because if you are lazy to argue or are lazy to explain in detail to them, you can find another place that is more comfortable and invisible to them on the grounds of work. And the place also doesn't need to be too far from your house because you also have to go home when you have finished all your work.But if you are still patient and still want to explain to them, try making a show on your laptop or PC or smartphone and show them so they can learn from there and start to understand little by little. Because if you choose other people or close friends of your grandparents and uncles to explain this, of course it will make it more difficult and stressful for you because they receive explanations through intermediaries.",
