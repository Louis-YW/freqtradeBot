      "body": "Your post is perplexing in more than one way. Nobody knows who you are yet you are a newbie that claims to have made groundbreaking leaps in crypto blockchain technology and for that reason it is very difficult to believe anything you say.Starting with the obvious, if you have been deeply researching blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies and that the journey you were on led you to develop a practical and groundbreaking concept that forms the foundation of a new technology called QuantumChain and QuantumLink, why have you not explained in graphic detail what QuantumChain and QuantumLink are?Moving forward, you have mentioned what they do but can you show a demo?Can you provide graphs?Can you provide side-by-side documents using Bitcoin or any crypto as a comparator for speeds, blocks, security and scalability?Quote from: Orleans19 on June 18, 2024, 06:51:08 PMHello everyone,My curiosity and passion for technological innovation have brought me to this platform. Over the last few months, I have been deeply researching blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. This journey has led me to develop a practical and groundbreaking concept that forms the foundation of a new technology—QuantumChain and QuantumLink. This is blockchain reimagined, a complete revolution in decentralized technology.I am here to learn from the insightful posts of Satoshi and others, as I work on my highly decentralized system. QuantumChain and QuantumLink are designed to create a massive shift, providing a parallel system that enhances security, speed, and scalability beyond current blockchain capabilities. I believe this technology has the potential to reshape the digital landscape and bring about unprecedented advancements.I look forward to engaging with this community and gaining valuable insights as I continue to develop this revolutionary technology.",

      "body": "The fact you will not share anything means yet make bold claims give the air of delusions of grandeur. You cannot be taken seriously because the reasons you give for not wanting to share more details yet you want to discuss it shows the contradiction on your part. From experience, many members here can simply read what you wrote in the opening post and determine that you are not someone that is both serious and be taken seriously. You should lock this thread and return when you become a multi-billionaire as a result of your double quantum-named products and are willing to share whatever it is you imagine you have created.Quote from: Orleans19 on June 18, 2024, 09:00:20 PMHonestly, I don’t feel comfortable disclosing too much yet and, to be honest, I’m a bit scared about sharing all the details prematurely.",
