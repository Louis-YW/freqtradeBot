It's just a rise in relative market cap. As chaotic times come, people prefer gold. In the crypto world, believers regard BTC as gold, and \"bear markets\" are equivalent to \"eras of chaos.\" When the crypto world prospered, BTC was the ballast, and when the chaotic era came, BTC was the lifebuoy.",

This is very normal when the market is dumping, I also consider that there are a lot of people converting their altcoins to Bitcoin for now.Since the Bitcoin dominance is increasing, the volume on the altcoins is decreasing. People are also expecting that the percentage of dump on Bitcoin is lesser compare to altcoins that's why some of them are converting to Bitcoin for now.",

It should work otherwise since the Bitcoin demand is increase. I'd think many people are prefer to convert their both altcoins and Bitcoin to stable coin.",

Yeah nothing new in the crypto but once bitcoin was reaching the floor and then altcoin will be trying to follow that. Altcoins will try to take its dominance when bitcoin is doing side way or bump again.",

Looks like another panic selling is on the way to avoid further loss and this is the time when risk-takers do their work. How I wish I had enough money to buy from this dip for long-term holding.

Right now I am waiting for my extra “not beer” money tomorrow or 2 days from now to buy Bitcoin again. Yes I am at a loss because last month I have bought BTC when it was still around $30kish. But it’s something that I can afford losing, but technically I wouldn’t call it a loss because BTC will eventually bounce back just like the old times. If we endured the great Bitcoin crash of 2018 and eventually skyrocketed in 2021, how much more for this one.

As you already said, it is absolutely normal that Bitcoin itself is losing not as much as almost all other coins during a bear market. I am following the crypto market since around 2017 and so far the behavior and the movement of the crypto market has pretty much always be pretty similar during bear and bull markets. In a bear market the altcoins are suffering the most, especially the ones that are pretty new and small. My portfolio mainly consists of small and new projects so don't even ask me about my portfolio value  .During a bull market, bitcoin is usually the first coin to rise and it takes some time until the other coins are rising too. Then it is possible though that those coins are rising even more than BTC itself.",
