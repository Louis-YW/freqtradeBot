  "content": "Maybe this was already known but in case you ever wondered why your ICG grade(s) came in lower than expected for your coin(s), see below. Â It appears holo's are considered a part of the coin and things like centering as well as bubbling, wrinkling, or scratching of the holo's are really taken into account and can pull your grade down, significantly in some cases. Â Coinmakers, please take notice too.",
