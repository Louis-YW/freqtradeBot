From what I saw in the link provided and if that is the website the op is asking of the template then I advise the op to keep that template and focus on the structure and as you said the functioning of the site and not a template again. But I will like him to use horizontal instead of vertical because the scrolling down is too long. So I will want the features to appear on horizontal formated and some marquee on the home page.",

Resolve what actually? Is it not obvious that newbies who come up with such an idea without even knowing anything about it are all in it to make quick money from victims? That's all I could get from it. Based on my calculation, the OP might have seen and imagined how much crypto casinos are making out there and thought of making out its own casino to share some of that money, not knowing that everything is far above what it might look like to him. Real coding experience is required; paying someone entirely to do something that you have no idea about is, at some point, also dangerous, as the programmer, if not a trustworthy person, might be the one who steals the site without the real owner's knowledge.",
