  "content": "So I created a thread about people who say they sell all their fiat, whether it's money in the bank and their house and stocks for btc and many people say very few people do that.  And people agree it's an exaggeration as it doesn't even make sense since when someone says they sold everything for btc, well obviously they need fiat in the bank to pay for expenses like food and rent.  Most people do say it would be ridiculous to sell your house and stocks for btc as that is risky.  Now what about the opposite?Shouldn't the goal at the end be have cash in the bank so you could invest it?  Whether it's putting all the money in a CD and earn interest or put it in some safe stocks that average 7% a year?  I mean let say someone invested in crypto and it could be $5,000 or $10,000 or $50,000.  If the investment is an amount to where they could sell all their crypto and then after paying the taxes and put all that money in a CD or savings account and earn interest from it and live off interest, would't that seem to be a good idea for most people?  The thing is if you are in the US, well you need a lot of money to retire especially if you don't own property since you would have to pay a lot in rent.  Now let's say someone has 1 million dollars in crypto.  Let's say after taxes, they get back $650,000.  This number probably should be higher right if this is a long term holder correct?  But when you factor state taxes and those things, wouldn't long term capital gains for higher amounts at 20% still mean their total tax would probably be like 30% total or so at least?  I used 33% tax as the higher amount for someone with long term capital gains.Now if someone has $650,000 in the US and has let say $25,000 total in the bank and owns nothing... by that I mean no house or car or stocks or anything... well that person certainly isn't rich at all especially if this person doesn't earn an average income at their job.  Like if this person lives in a cheap apartment and they don't work anymore, well that $650,000 isn't going to do much if someone does nothing for years.  Their money in the bank would only go down.  Would people agree on this?  Now if that person puts $500,000 in the bank and earns 5% interest on a CD, well that is $25,000 a year.  That could even be more income than this person makes a year as their job for example.  But obviously that isn't enough to live off of.  But if someone has 2 million dollars in crypto.  Let's say they have 1.3 million after taxes.  Is that even enough to live off interest in the US?  If they already own a house and paid it off or an apartment, certainly yes right?  But if not and rent, then certainly not?  If that person doesn't work their job anymore, well they still have living expenses.  But if you put 1 million dollars earning 5% interest on a CD, that would be $50,000 a year.  That is more than enough to live off of in most states in the US but not enough in the major ones.  Like you are not going to retire and live in a nice area and earning 50k in interest income right?  But for someone to not want to work anymore, how much money would one need to have the bank after taxes?  I recall the number they used for Americans to be wealthy was 2-3 million dollars or so.  That number seems right?",

      "body": "So say someone has 2.5 million dollars.  The then buy a house for 1 million and now have 1.5 million.  They could put 1 million in a 5% interest on CD for $50,000 a year in interest income.  They still have 500k left.  Even though they don't have to pay rent, well they have to pay property taxes and other things so it won't be as much as rent.  But if they are not working any job, would this person still have enough money to not work again?  Now if this same person rents a portion of their 1 million dollar house... Let's say it could be a 3 family house and not one where they have it all to themselves, well this person could collect rent to from 2 people and well that would easily pay the property taxes and everything correct?  Or what about buying 2 apartments that are 500k each?  Then live in one and rent the other way?  However, I always heard apartments aren't as good for buying for rental property compared to house?  However, it would seem apartments are easier to rent?So it would seem as an American who wouldn't want to work, they need to have at least 2 million dollars in cash total after taxes but it should be higher?  When I look at it... I mean someone could put 1.5 million dollars earning 5% interest and earn $75,000 a year which is more than your average American income.  So now they could rent an apartment for 1500 dollar apartment but that would not be a good apartment if it was in a major city though.  And this person wouldn't even be able to rent a 2000 dollar apartment since they would need to earn 80,000 a year right?  Since rent and income in the US seem to be 40x?  So if this person rent is 1500 dollars, well their expenses everything else assuming they are not a big spender probably shouldn't be more than $32,000 or so?  So this person could basically live off the interest?  However this was only recently the last few years interest went up to 5% and back few years ago it was like 1% or 2%.  So wouldn't it be hard if interest rates for savings and CD go down?  However, I always heard the average returns for putting money in the stock market was like 10% and around 7% adjusted for inflation.  With 7%, isn't 2 million dollars more than enough?  I mean sure this person wouldn't be making a lot of money but they can still live off the interest right?  Obviously the answer to this is much different if you don't live in the US or in 1st world countries.  I mean some countries you can have $200,000 and you would be considered rich there.  But for Americans, how money money do you need?  And if you had that money, wouldn't it make sense to put it all or most of it in the bank and earn interest?  I know there was one poster that said it was stupid because if btc earns on average xx percent, earning 5% interest in the bank is stupid which makes sense.  Of course you can keep the btc or sell some and then the btc can go much higher.  And obviously if that happens, someone having 1 million dollars in crypto could have 5 million or even 10 million or more.  And with anyone with 5 million or more, well that would be enough to retire and do things you would never be able to.  If you have 5 million in the bank, you could put 2 million in the bank and earn 100k and that is more than enough to live off and do pretty much most things you want right?",

Keeping it in Bitcoin would grow your wealth soooo much faster.I mean it makes sense to eventually diversify into income generating assets, so you have high growth bitcoin combined with income generating assets. But like...a CD would be a pretty bad thing to do. And certainly selling all one's Bitcoin to put into much slower growth assets just to get some income wouldn't work out better than just holding Bitcoin.Ultimately holding hard money fast growing Bitcoin along with something like dividend paying stocks or rental paying real estate would be the best combo. But it wouldn't make sense to sell ALL one's Bitcoin to go completely over to the other investments.I put all my money into Bitcoin, retired a few years ago, and probably during the 2030s I'll diversify a bit of my bitcoin into income generating investments, while keeping Bitcoin the core of my wealth. What I would never dream of doing is selling ALL my bitcoin for slower growing more risky investments just for the income.",

I don't know about reinvestment but that seems a good idea but it's going to depend on your situation and the amount you're hodling at that moment that you're seriously pondering this question, if you've got enough bitcoin stored that you can retire if you sell it then go for it but if you're not then reinvestment might be a good idea but choose the next investment wisely.",

Of course the answer is that no one knows. Quoting your statement above, if we have 5 million in the bank then put it in 2 million and then take the interest, that guarantees everything will be finished, of course not. To help, yes, to guarantee overall safety, I don't think so because in the future there will be many points that can change our decisions someday.Maybe this step looks good but in my opinion a smart person is someone who knows how to read the situation. And, because of the nature of Bitcoin, you can take control of your retirement accounts and move them overseas easily if something urgent needs to be done.",

Consider this: fiat, especially in savings or CDs, consistently loses to inflation. Its a slow loss of buying power. Diverse approaches are what I support. Keep some of your money in crypto, knowing that it has the potential for high returns (and high risk), and balance it out with investments that are more safe.Your idea of living off of interest is interesting, but its not a good plan. Even if you have $1.3 million, you cant live off of interest from a CD alone in the long run, especially when you think about inflation. My perspective? Crypto should not be seen as the end goal, but as a part of a bigger financial plan. There should be a balance between high-risk, high-reward investments like crypto and safer bets. Diversification is not only a good idea, its necessary in today's economy.",

You have to be sure that you won't become homeless. If you have two houses or something like that, then you are on the safer side but you have to be mentally ready and prepared that you'll see lows during the bear market that will motivate you to sell your coins asap and withdraw cash to not lose everything but you have to realize that it's temporary and shouldn't start panic selling. If you do the opposite, e.g. sell your Bitcoin to get cash, what are your financial plans? I would only do that if I was going to start a business.
