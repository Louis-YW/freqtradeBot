But you must to use third-party software?What exactly the software is calculating during mining?",

But you must to use third-party software?What exactly the software is calculating during mining?mining via software only is an old outdated method, these days you need a physical ASIC device tht has its own software/firmware inside the device.also there is no singular \"bitcoin website\"",

Bitcoin is decentralized, so there's no thing such as official website for Bitcoin.Quote from: GoldenSnowMan on February 01, 2025, 02:48:26 PMWhat exactly the software is calculating during mining?SHA-256(SHA-256(block header)) operation.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on February 01, 2025, 02:52:34 PMTake a deep breath and start studying in here: https://learnmeabitcoin.com/.Also consider this book, https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook.",
