The competition in the market is making more investors not to invest more capital on Bitcoin.If we use our fiat banks as an example, imagine we have only one bank in the country every citizens will want to open the bank and starts using it but if the banks are more people will spread and use other Banks.If there's only Bitcoin in the market more investors will invest in Bitcoin because there is no competition. Although the price rate is much more than other coin, but people will still invest on altcoins because that's how Bitcoin price started so low.",

If there are no alts, many investors will move their money to Bitcoin. But we must remember that if people truly believe in the Bitcoin mechanism, even if there are alternatives, they will always invest in Bitcoin. And we must admit that there are some instances where alts benefit Bitcoin.",

It's not about the competition at all, it's all about getting rich as quickly as they can and most investors think and believe that if BTC will rise, alts will rise much higher in terms of % which isn't wrong at all but it's not the case every single time. So I'd say that BTC is for those who want their money to be parked in a safe haven asset, other altcoins are just clowns and will surely make you lose big if they won't follow BTC when BTC rises, this happens when institutional investors want to bring BTC's dominance higher over alts.",

No! i think you have made some mistake in understanding the potential BTC have. And what's the benefit of competition if there will exist no ALTs. As then the market dominance of BTC will become 100%. And there will be no competition which is less exciting. And investors will always find another way to diversify their portfolio. If they will not find any ALTs to invest in.In short, your question needs to be upgraded with information of dominance of BTC. which is increasing from its origin. Like if we see in 2019 the dominance of BTC was around 70% if i am not wrong and from then it is keep getting low indicating that the investors are moving in other directions. like Defi, NFTs, etc. And now in the current phase many investors are moving towards AI. To increase their portfolio.",

It's good that Altcoins are there as well, so that no one would say that they never saw another alternative, which was the reason they had to invest in Bitcoin. Even if it were only Bitcoin we had as the only crypto, there are still some people who would not invest because they don't believe in it. Most people that are even Investing in Altcoins are only doing it for the short term, so they can be lucky for a quick profit if the token luckily gets pumped, but Bitcoin is still what people are holding for a longer time because they believe in it, compared to every other altcoin.",

We all know that we're having the same thoughts of what if most of those market capitalization that are being spreaded in the altcoins goes to bitcoin.It's going to be enormous and the price of Bitcoin will surely get a huge bump.But that's okay, competitions are everywhere in every market that's why you can't think of the best of it. In the end, the best will still be prevailed and that's why many retail and institutional investors are always choosing the best which is BTC.",

And the Bitcoin price will also not be able to increase to as high as yesterday and will be even higher in the future. People also don't pay much attention to Bitcoin because they haven't been able to see the advantages of Bitcoin for them.Maybe the number of Bitcoin investors wouldn't be as many as it is today if it was only Bitcoin because what makes people interested in using Bitcoin is the big profit factor they can get. Meanwhile, the presence of altcoins gives people hope to benefit in the form of more Bitcoins through trading.But forget about the competition between Bitcoin and altcoins because altcoins are not comparable to Bitcoin. Maybe the competition is between one altcoin and another because each altcoin wants a good position in the market.",

If there were only Bitcoins on the market, then there would be no difference.If in each country there is only one fiat bank, then people will not know which bank has a greater profit when making deposits.With alternative coin (Altcoins) other than Bitcoin in the crypto space, it makes it easy for investors to choose the best type of investment to make.The convenience that can be obtained by investors who don't have a lot of capital, they can invest in Altcoins when the ability to buy Bitcoin is not enough money even though these investors recognize Bitcoin as the best investment asset.TBH, it won't be a big deal when there are Altcoins and there won't be competition because Bitcoin is the single best coin out there in the crypto space.",

Nonetheless, even if there is no competition for bitcoin, I don't think that the price will go this high because without competition, there's no notoriety that bitcoin is experiencing right now and even if there is, I don't think it's going to be the same.",

It could be, but as humans there is bound to have some sort of competition or at least there will be options, and that's why altcoin market was invented in the first place.  It's an \"alternative\" to BTC.At least though we are still in the 40%++, so it means that bitcoin dominates the market even though there are like thousands of altcoins out there. So that is good enough to hear that and obviously, bitcoin has a lot of investors, including government, institutions and retail investors just like the majority of us.",

In some way or the other, opportunistic humans would definitely make their own and start something that could change the world for the better or for the worse. This is also the reason why I think BTC won't' be topped because of the people/person behind it, Satoshi, built it anonymously and made it into a game changer and none is going to take that away. And creators who have their names all over the project could have some different look on the purpose of it or something. That's just my take. The price of BTC is dictated by the market. Starting low is a good start because it's just starting and not a lot of people are into buying it yet. But when it did, it's just boom and I think it would never change.",
