Is the free fall over or this level won't hold for long either?.*strong support of $29K*As usual, there are mixed predictions on bitcoin. Some charts I've seen predicts BTC bouncing back to $36K before dropping to the 2022 bottom at $22K (falling wedge). There are no exact months before that pattern is completed but 2023 will probably be the next recovery phase until the next bullrun.",

Probably a recovery or yeah another bulltrap was coming again. I remember when bitcoin is only recovering a little bit but it was dumping so hard again. Im sure that bearish trend will come again soon. This recovery was just temporary. If there will be another massive sell again and we are in another disaster. Quote from: YellowSwap on May 10, 2022, 06:36:33 AMIs the free fall over or this level won't hold for long either?.It's not over yet. This may recover slowly but i doubt that if that has become the bottom for this dump. People are still in the extreme fear. Terra luna was making it even worst",

Is the free fall over or this level won't hold for long either?.looking at last year's situation, bitcoin should have fallen to 28k before the pump. so there is still one more resistance point, and the bearish trend is still very strong. most likely there will be a repeat like last year. and if this resistance point is broken, the market situation may be worse than last year.",

Is the free fall over or this level won't hold for long either?.I think the current bitcoin price movement will remain stable at a price between $30,000 - $35,000 because of the down trend and bad news often circulates that can make bitcoin price movements weaker and do not have the strength to make more price increases, hopefully there will be good news could trigger a return to rising bitcoin prices.",

Is the free fall over or this level won't hold for long either?.If you can buy and hold it for the long term, don't worry too much about current or past developments, because we all see opportunities in the future for you to be happy with I see the problem people see when it comes to using technical analysis to apply it, but overdoing it and not being able to keep up with the short-term changes. Honestly, even though BTC is falling right now, I still see opportunities for losers to find a little something to keep from getting too deep into debt, I'm pretty optimistic after many years in this market. The price is just deceiving how you think to invest. Let's look at the facts 1BTC = 1BTC, don't just see successes with prices via fiat or life tools.",
