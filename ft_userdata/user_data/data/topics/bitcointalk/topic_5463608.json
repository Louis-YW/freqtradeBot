I guess the forum is still the same as always, just with new faces, and nothing much has changed. 2019 is not that far away.It's good to have some old forum members back and I hope to see you around again. For the record; Your account creation date is showing 2012 and not 2011 üòè¬†But I don't think this topic is best suited for Bitcoin discussion. Maybe reputation or some other board that permits self-introduction, and all of that can be done.",

We are delighted you returned to the Bitcointalk forum; surprisingly, you have been away from the forum for a long time, but you remember your log-in information correctly. According to your post history from 2019, you have not been very active in the forum, with less than five postings in 2020.Now that you're back, I hope you've gotten back into the flow of things on the forum, because I believe you still remember the forum's rules and regulations. Welcome back once more.",

I asked that question because I just head the news someone just transferred 1005 BTC today after 13 years and so I thought that might be you because you said you are here since 2011 and people who are old here mostly have that much BTC.Whether you have or not, I am not interested, hehe. And you do not need to say yes too. But welcome again here I hope you will find some interesting things that could engage you here.",

Yeah, Bitcoin has come a long way but nothing really has changed much, price still as volatile as ever. The forum has more new faces which indicates growth and I hope to see more input from you.

I remember my first bitcoin purchase with Jeb Mcaleb (sp?) on mt. gox before ¬†Karpeles purchased it. It was pretty cool, email and paypal, thats how I bought my first btc, lol. then i mined the shit out of them for years..Im a hard bitcoiner now. Damn near a maxi now...no, Ill say it, Im a bitcoin maxi,. Sure, Ive been into a lot shit coins, worked for wagerr, and Beaxy.. so, Bitcoin has been pretty good for me over he last decade or so...I just learned that if you trade or buy anything but bitcoin, youll only get burned in the end. I was in the ETH ICO and Tezos ico, list goes on..bitcoin will always be king. there is no second best. Took me too long to figure that out..Thanks",

I hate scammers, etc..¬† I have been a target of scammers and hackers since the end of Silk Road. If I can help one person, it will be worth it.. but yes, I CPU mined, GPU, FPGAs and as you can tell by my posts was one of the first to receive and mine with ASICsIf you need more verification that I am who i say i am, just let me know.. or dont, lol.

Well that's not accurate and it's just assumptions, there are many people who hold lots of Bitcoin that has not even yet joined the forum or are just joining in on it. The age of an account does not determine how much Bitcoin the account owners own, correct that mistake because some ideology can get you scammed.",

Bitcoin's still going pretty strong and has been steadily increasing in value since 2012, and a couple more. coincidentally though your logins coincided with the times that whales transferred large sums of bitcoin in between accounts, I'm not really sure if it's any cause for concern nor if it was you (which I doubt you would come forward if it was really you anyway but whatever) but I guess it's good to know. Anywho, welcome back to the forum, take yourself to a little tour. It's still pretty much the same thing although new pioneers have come up who imparted awesome stuff to this site and to bitcoin as a whole. hope you'd stick around this time to share your own stuff with us, be it knowledge or stories!",

I believe you are back here with a good, better and stronger perspective to add more to the forum as a high rank member you are but I was wondering if it was typo or something else that you mentioned 2011 but I am seeing 2012 on your profile. However, I will advise you edit it and make corrections there so as not to get people confused or possibly doubt your authenticity here. Good to see an old member back onboard.
