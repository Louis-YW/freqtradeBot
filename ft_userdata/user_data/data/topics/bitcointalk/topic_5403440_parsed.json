  "content": "Traders can change decision at times, I prefer to use USDT for trading, but this is no more bear time, if it is still bear time, the price downturn will not be so much more significant than what has happened before. This time, I have prefer to use bitcoin for future trading, this can only be by two means:first, the coin marginsecond, the multi assetIn this period that bear market has lasted for long, which one do you prefer? I thought both are like the same before, that you are still using unstable coin to trade, unlike the USDT or other stable coin margin.What I noticed recently is that the liquidation price is lower in multi asset than in coin margin. Have you tried both before, which one would you prefer to use when the bull market started? You know that people will prefer not to use stable coin like USDT or USDC to trade because they will want to earn more.",

This is self-explanatory. I haven't been keen on the liquidation price, but if there is any difference, I don't think it's big.",

Imagine the headache on would have to track PnL for unstable assets in case the market was dropping. I would rather swap off some of those assets for USDT, move them to my futures account and the do isolate margin on single asset mode. Whatever profits I would get, I could swap back the USDT to BTC in no time",

Don't lose more of your capital by making stupid trades in this kind of market.Thanks, I understand, but traders do not have to stop to trade in bull or bear market, though traders can hold more of their assets during bull market. What traders are mostly concious about is a less volatile market to make profit, it can be during bull or during bear. Traders always continue to trade, using low leverage is better and having risk management plan.

Whatever profits I would get, I could swap back the USDT to BTC in no timeI understand the risk, the highest margin I use to trade bitcoin is 3x while 1x for altcoin, I am not use to open position with altcoins though. But it will be like I am holding bitcoin while having the opportunity to trade altcoins anytime I want, which is not usual for me because I even mainly open position using BTC/USDT, but I will have the alternative option anytime I want to open position with altcoin, though the risk increase, I understand.",

Traders always continue to trade, using low leverage is better and having risk management plan. Traders actually like more volatility, up or down, because that's where they can make the most of their profits. That's why many young people made enough capital during 2016 and 2017's bull cycle, and reinvested again and became millionaires during 2020 and 2021's bull cycle. Markets that don't move much, won't make you profits much because the price movements are small.",

At one point, I almost closed the position, but it paid off just 24 hours later when BTC price dropped towards 20K  Quotewhile 1x for altcoin,Not sure about x1 for altcoins though, At least do a x3 or x2 for top cap altcoins with good risk management techniques... x1?

This is a good advice, I am not using unstable coins to trade like that, I used it on special occasion and not often at all, like when I know there would be bull run in crypto market, but it is true, using USDT or other available stable coin to trade is better. But there are some reasons a trader can go for unstable coins at times.

It does not make sense to me… lol.Traders have different approaches to trading, but you are not wrong, I can see some altcoins like ethereum, binance coin, litecoin and few other very high marketcap coins to be less volatile, but I just meant altcoins generally, but still referring to good ones like qtum among and not shitcoins.",

      "body": "Maybe their goal of trading is to collect more coins than to collect stable coins, especially for those who use future trading. By using unstable coins to trade, their chances of being able to get more of that amount of coins can be obtained but that will depend on how their analysis results. It also works the other way around where if you use USDT or USDC the returns you get in USDT or USDC or other stable coins can also add up. This will return to how your strategy is in trading because each person's analysis will be different. Apart from that, there is a convenience factor that will be connected with what coin they use.",

If you use leverage or future trading, you won't have that chance as you will be forced liquidated anytime.
