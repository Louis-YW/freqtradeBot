This farm.xyz doesn't add any new features or innovations to thisYeah, no doubt but the new project has a very high chance to be another scam project. This thing was an old thing that being repeated over and over by scammers. There's no need to use the new platform like this. He was mentioning to fix yield farming and what a non sense thing. The creator of the garbage site like that can't even think a good idea to be developed. The fact that if these days so many new platforms were act as money grabber only.",

      "body": "Personally, I do not trust projects that do not make promises other than making a quick profit or the possibility of helping to achieve this quick profit by providing liquidity and others, especially if these projects are central and dependent on depositors' money.As for the story of being layers, and so everything can be done centrally by updating the database, and therefore the money will remain in the hands of the site. When he makes profits, he will give you a portion of them, and when he makes losses, he will steal all your money.",

It's worrying that there are many of them that are being hacked, I'm not a skeptic but I just don't feel the urge to put your money into these new projects.They're sketchy thus, they're not really that strong in terms of security because they can easily breached.Another problem is you don't know who the devs are or if they'll do a backdoor job on your funds.",
