It even took down the Bitcoin Wiki and my website.https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/ (still says implementing a fix as of UTC+0 07:14, but it looks like its done now)Some of you may still encounter those blasted DDoS checks though, occasionally they interfere with my ability to post in the last few minutes.I can't post at all though Lynx because of those 503 Cloudflare challenges. Might want to look into that admins. Fixed.",

I think the first was a \"503 error\" but in today's outage, it displayed a \"500 internal server error\". These are simply codes for some likely disruption in Internet connectivity and a quick search on this code on Google search engine produced results that described it to be a disruption that occurs on HTTP and could be related to new plugins or update on a system.I might be wrong but, is there updates been carried out on the forum as its rumoured, with we looking towards the new forum software. Could this error account to some integration been done on the forum to ensure its maintenance. Anyway, it didn't take up to 30minutes to come through so there isn't a reason to be alarmed.",

I don't know how long the site was down but imagine how powerful cloudflare is becoming by collecting all data from their clients.The forum itself is a centralized service and has a centralized server being hosted somewhere. In terms of reliability, cloud flare is a net benefit, as it has the ability to stop/mitigate ~all DDOS attacks and is generally reliable. There are factors unrelated to reliably, such as privacy and the potential for CF to execute a mitm attack that are a negative to using cf",
