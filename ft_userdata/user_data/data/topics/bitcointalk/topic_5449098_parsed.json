The latter is the son of two very famous characters: Shiba and Shina.Parents always want their children to succeed, and I believe this community is truly dedicated to making this token the success it richly deserves.You will judge for yourself, but for me it was essential to come here among you to talk about it.Here is their website: www.shuggitoken.comGroup chat link: www.t.me/shuggitokenTogether, we will always be stronger. If you are a cool kid, you already know.Ad Astra Per Aspera",
