      "body": "The three lined represent three different efficiencies of miners.More efficient miners are more expensive because they use less power (so are cheaper to run). You'd generally not replace old hardware if it's profitible until you have to or use the components of old hardware to replace the components of new hardware (in cases where there's compatibilities and it doesn't involve the actual mining chips - such as the fan or the case).It's hard to compare them with the other charts as they only have 2 years of data for the other charts. From my experience, miners go up in price around the halving (when price goes up and there's a reason for it, and they'll normally keep going up until they can't anymore - such as miners not expecting to be paid back and impulse buyers disappearing). I've seen mining firms release a new miner, put a big price on it and drop the price if they don't all sell within the time they expected.",

Could you help me to read the chart, please.And does it have any correlation to miner capitulation?Because I see all three lines are falling down.According to my research, this was I discovered try to find out by yourself. The blue line is Under 38 joules/TH (38 J/TH)QuoteUnder 38 joules/TH (38 J/TH) includes the latest generation Bitcoin mining ASICs like Bitmain’s Antminer S19, S19j and S19 Pro units and MicroBTC’s Whatsminer M30s, M30s+ and M30s++ models, among others.The red line is 38-to-68 J/THQuoteincludes mid-generation ASICs like Bitmain’s AntminerS17 and T17 series and MicroBT’s Whatsminer M20, M21 and M32 series models, among others.And the Green Line is  Over 68 J/THQuoteincludes old-generation ASICs like Bitmain’s Antminer S9, T9, S11 and T15 series and MicroBT’s Whatsminer M10 series, among others.Hope this will answer your question anyway, Good day Referrence: https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/asic-price-index",
