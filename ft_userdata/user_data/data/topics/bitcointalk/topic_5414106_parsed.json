  "content": "What is Diversified?Diversified is a crowdsale platform for physical assets. Our ambition is to revolutionize personal investment, beat inflation, and do it legally!What problem does it solve?Crypto markets are a great investment opportunity and the best way to support the projects you love. They are also sometimes a source of concern during a bear market when volatility puts your gains at risk. Stablecoin staking yields have also dropped significantly in 2022, and the Terra/Luna episode has caused many to fear a flaw in the strength of some Stablecoins. At the same time, inflation is skyrocketing in Europe, the US, and many parts of the world.Founded by a team of crypto-enthusiasts, Diversified aims to be an efficient and original diversification solution for investors willing to decouple part of their gains from crypto markets. To Diversified investors, we offer a platform for fractionalizing high-yield unlisted physical assets. Those assets will be available to purchase on the platform via a crowdsale smartcontract. When the community crowndfunds an asset, ERC-20 tokens representing shares of that asset will be issued to every investor in proportion of their participation.Thereby having Diversified tokens in your portfolio allows you to gain exposure to counter-cyclical markets and become co-owner of fine wines, art pieces, luxury watches... and even high potential start-ups!In order to outperform both the inflation and the average stablecoin yield, we have chosen to only list assets with a potential minimum APR of 12%.Diversified PromiseMake your savings Free, Profitable & Liquid• Free: Invest from $1• Profitable: Target an average annual return of over 12%.• Liquid: Resell your tokens at any timeWhat is the status of the project?We have solid legal grounds and partners backing us in the wine and watch market and we plan to address new markets soon after launch: private equity, real estate, art and other luxury items. We're raising capital (equity) from BAs and VCs at the moment and we'd like to get feedback from the community as we develop the product. No token sale is planned until after the product launch.Who is Behind Diversified?Vincent Bourdel → Creator and Executive directorTugdual de Kerviler → Software Engineer, senior developer in Web and Mobile developmentOur advisors / part-time:Kramer Levin - Law firm in Paris and NYC, experts in financial regulatory complianceDany Rakotopara - Tech advisor, engineering manager at LedgerThomas Roche - Finance advisor, bank and finance expertBenoit Bourdel - Strategist advisor, CTO of LukoWelcome to Diversifiedhttps://getdiversified.app/web3The litepaper: https://getdiversified.app/whitepaperDiscord: https://getdiversified.app/discordContact Us: hello@getdiversified.app",
