Suggest starting at 25 BTC if anything, but you’ll probably be hard pressed to find anyone who would risk shipment from France. Curious what insurance you’re referring to, as I’m not aware of any carrier willing to insure the loaded value of a coin. Also, I suggest any prospective buyer to only use a trusted escrow like Minerjones on a transaction of this amount. Too risky otherwise. Best of luck.",

That being said, nobody with 35 BTC would burn 10 BTC to own a coin made of cheap metal. We’re probably entering a period where buyers and sellers will drift far away in price until either enough coins get peeled that the premium rises, or sellers get old and want to cash out and move on with their lives.",

I was asking 33BTC. My highest offer was 28.3BTC. I peeled it, consoling myself that i didnt need to deal with delivery risk, and that i get to keep and enjoy it, and can sell the peeled coin easier and quicker. Have a gander at this thread, for its sentiment/s regarding high value funded coins, exactly like your Cas.....  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5463281.msg62735257#msg62735257Its showing that high funded coins have little or no premium value, even when traded at established venues.If you are offered 27BTC+, get on a plane and bite the arm off asap.",
