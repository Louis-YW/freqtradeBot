  "content": "Filter the noiseEvery morning you wake up, check the prices and wonder what has happened overnight in the market . While making your morning coffee, you load up CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, Crypto Youtube, Crypto Twitter, BitcoinTalk and Discord to find out what the sentiment is. Before you know it, you have multiple browser tabs open in multiple different windows and things are a mess. (sound familiar?)AboutLead by the frustration of existing services, a group of friends got together to work on the challenge of making a cleaner, faster crypto information portal. The goal? Present information to visitors in a clear and transparent manner that would be easy to access, fast and intuitive. Our goal is to become the homepage of every crypto investor.We launched beta a few months ago and are now ready to show off the features we're proud of.Our landing pagePrice information is what a majority of users want, and that is exactly what they will get when visiting our homepage. Compare us to other services you currently use and let us know how we are doing.Click here to see our homepageNews pageCategorized news. In one click, filter all of the Bitcoin related news across CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, Twitter and YouTube. Simple, clean and quick. We categorize across the top 50 coins and search terms.

We show the largest defi platforms helping you perform due diligence on where to access the most trusted sites. Yes that does include where to stake your WBTC!Click here to see our DeFi pageWhyServices like Coinmarketcap are not designed for the best user experience. They are often designed to increase browsing time to show more adverts. At DefiDive, our design focus is to enable visitors get the information they want and need as quickly as possible.The team & who we areI’m Seal, a long time supporter and member of BitcoinTalk since early 2012. We launched our first Bitcoin startup in 2013, one of the industry’s earliest trading platforms. During our 4 year life, we brokered US $250 million in Bitcoin trades (accounting for 2% of all bitcoins in existence at the time) for over 30,000 users. In 2018, in part due to the profits we made from our crypto investments and the uncertain regulatory landscape we decided to close the trading platform making way for decentralized finance and Ethereum based apps to succeed.Our co-founders come from backgrounds in FAANG and Investment Banking. Watch this space and follow our socials for more. DefiDive is seed funded by its founders and has the goal of becoming the homepage of every cypto investor.Here's a snippet of my post history and involvement in the community:Bitcointalk’s longest running signature scheme (back in the day)https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=233434.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1315122Automated trading systems I programmed and ran during 2012https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=114351.0https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/02/meet-the-bots-that-let-you-trade-bitcoin-in-your-sleep/DefiDive Socialshttps://www.crunchbase.com/organization/defidivehttps://twitter.com/defi_divehttps://www.instagram.com/defidive/Help and contribute to DefiDiveWe've found the Bitcointalk community one of the most supportive communities in the space.

We're also working on caching some of the data for faster response. USDT is a tricky one as it requires us to have a fiat currency to peg against.

Either way we are committed to the challenge because of how much time a properly implemented news feed aggregator can save people.It is also on our todo list to check out google alerts and news but I'm not sure if we can make that data useful.

For certain coin/token, the page always show indeterminate progress bar rather than price chart.And personally i'd rather separate category for coin and token.

If there are any developers who want to contribute to what we are doing then let us know.You can generate RSS from Google Alerts, and customize it to get only the most \"notable/reputed\" sources.This is especially beneficial for the person working on the site.Instead of adding dozens of RSS, and doing data manipulation (to avoid duplication for example), the dev only needs to add 2-3 sources, and google does the work for him.It also allows having 'neutral' sites (forbes, bloomberg,...) instead of the always pro-cryptos (coindesk, cointelegraph,...)Considering that your team has to do it for each crypto, the dev saves time. While adding many RSS, the worst is when you have to deal with a ton of market analysis blog posts. That's horrible to deal with",

Using it, you can navigate the whole website without using your mouse. In the pipeline are many additional features all designed to save you, the user time.
