  "content": "A few months ago I setup a CC for stacking sats off swan. I generated a watch only wallet from the CC xpub QR code, and began sending my sats to the addresses generated from that watch only wallet. Yesterday I decided to switch to blue wallet. I exported the skeleton from that same CC to my blue wallet and it shows zero balance so I scanned the CC xpub QR code with the blue wallet and it popped up my balance. I can not sign transactions generated from the watch only wallet. The CC says something like \"can not sign with out the leys. Need 'XXXXXX' keys\". I'm sure I'm missing something here so any help but much appreciated.",

I suggest you follow the guide on blue wallet youtube video on how to use coldcard with blue wallet here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF2MyDB0nno",

I did export the psbt to the sd card and insert it into the CC and hit \"Ready to sign to which i get this msg on the \"none of these keys belong to this coldcard. Need \"XXXXX\" i verified the wallet number is the one that was created in blue with the exported CC skeleton wallet as well. The skeleton and the watch only wallet came from the same cold card. I have the leys the addresses with the btc just dont show up in the skeleton wallet.So I was able to fix it using thishttps://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/112667/sent-funds-to-coldcard-bip-32-address-how-can-i-transfer-them-out-to-a-differenWorked perfectly.

I know it's derivation realted but I'm so new to this level of tech stuffThe majority of wallets create a master private key, either from scratch or by deriving it from a seed phrase, and then use that master private key to create a branching tree of further private keys using hash functions. Some wallets follow what is known as BIP 44, 49, and 84 with the tree they create. The standard derivation path for a BIP 44 wallet (which creates legacy addresses) is m/44'/0'/0'. This means you take m, your master private key, and derive the next key using the hardened index (denoted by the ' symbol) number 44. You then take that key, and use it to derive the next key using the hardened index number 0. You then take that key, and use it to derive the next key using the hardened index number 0. This key is then the extended key for the wallet account, and again goes through a number of derivations to generate your individual private keys. This will be /0/0 (non hardened index 0) for your first address, /0/1 for your second address, /0/2 for your third address, and so on. Your first change address will be at /1/0, your second change address will be at /1/1, and so on.Other wallets follow different derivation paths, the most common alternative just being m, meaning you wallet just takes your master private key and appends the /0/0 for your first address directly. So instead of m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 as you would end up with above, you now end up with m/0/0.Accounts, keys, and addresses at different derivation paths are completely separate, and for the sake of signing transaction might as well be considered as entirely different wallets. A key at any given derivation path cannot sign for a key at any other derivation path. And because they are derived with hash functions, it is a one way process and you can't work backwards up the tree (except in some rare cases which are irrelevant here) - meaning you can't take a key at m/0/0 and work out the key at m which produced it. The process is deterministic though, which means that if you start with the same master private key then you will always derive the exact same child private key at the same path.Essentially, all you did was tell your wallet to derive at the path m instead of the path m/44'/0'/0', which was the same path your initial wallet used, and so they matched up again.",
