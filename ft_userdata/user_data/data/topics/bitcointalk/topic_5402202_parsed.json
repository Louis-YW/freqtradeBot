The big Tech guys aren't autonomous , their information and messages aren't self willed they too have regulatory agencies that decides on what information the want the public to have and share. Building a social network with censorship-proof protocol can be achievable but it might be more expensive than the proof of work algorithm.",

The amount of data stored, and transferred in a single day by YouTube is orders of magnitude greater than the total size of bitcoin's blockchain since the geniuses block. I agree completely with the public square comment. At some point, when a platform has more than 100M users, getting deplatformed from these things stops becoming a private company making a choice but banning a user from self-expression / freedom of speech.If a platform or venue is \"small\", as in under 10M users, I'm much more sympathetic to a platform doing whatever it wants for censorship to curate things how they want to curate things.I disagree that a censorship proof protocol is impossible. It depends on how you want to build it and what kind of trade-offs you want or don't want. Or using what's out there.I think money (Bitcoin) and finance (Ethereum) have been two proven winners in the game so far, but another one (information / socials / identity) will prove to be a third winning blockchain at some point.

One idea might be to crash the money system so that the Big Shots won't see any value in continuing their changing of history. But if we do that, how will people even live? Bitcoin with an actual encrypted, real, physical, coin working with it?Just like the Ministry of Truth, Big Tech is seizing control over HISTORY and rewriting it to suit current regimeQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-06-12-big-tech-seizing-control-over-history-rewriting-it-suit-current-regime.html# A writer and political activist by the name of Danny Haiphong was suspended from Twitter for questioning the official story about the Tiananmen Square massacre incident of 1989.It is apparently now an offense to speculate that perhaps the mainstream narrative about historical events such as this might be inaccurate, which Haiphong learned the hard way when he was told by Twitter that he had violated the platform’s “rules against abuse and harassment.”About a year ago in conjunction with the Biden regime’s ongoing censorship efforts, Twitter quietly put new rules in place that prohibit “content that denies that mass murder or other mass casualty events took place, where we can verify that the event occurred, and when the content is shared with abusive intent.”In a statement, Twitter added that the rule applies to references that insinuate a historical event was a “hoax,” or that its victims or survivors might be “fake or ‘actors,'” the statement said.“It includes, but is not limited to, events like the Holocaust, school shootings, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters.”NewsGuard and Wikipedia also function as Ministries of TruthHaiphong is hardly the first person to dispute the Tiananmen Square incident. Many have presented contrary evidence and asked poignant questions about this and other historical incidents – and this is a good thing because it helps refine our understanding of such events by either verifying or debunking their details.A free and open society is built on this type of inquiry, and yet the Biden regime with the help of Big Tech seeks to dismantle this American value and bury it in the annals of rewritten textbooks – or make it disappear entirely.Silicon Valley really is doing all it can to act as a Ministry of Truth on behalf of the regime, which will in effect stamp out the First Amendment if we let things continue down their current course....",

It is attempting to do indoctrination of its viewing audience. To be honest, all websites have to do is make a section for stuff they don't agree with. Then find out what the people think by what they view.I agree with this sentiment completely. But the problem is more so to do with core technology/infrastructure. Many websites I believe started out with the best of intentions like YouTube, Twitter and Reddit. And look at them now, they are steaming piles of horse shit.Why is that?Because their core infrastructure allows them to be taken over by governments and corporate greed. You need a fair protocol that cannot be altered that things are bootstrapped off of.If you have a platform based on promises using the identical technology as Big Tech - an example being Rumble vs YouTube, I'd argue that Rumble is doomed to fail one day, sooner or later, because promises are useless in this world.",

You're correct but that's kind of a self-defeatist point of view. I think as of say the past 6 years or so, it's not a question of giving all of your information to powers that do not care about you or going completely off the grid, but rather one of limiting information when possible and within your tastes.For example, if 1/10 is living in the woods and 10/10 is putting a literal human tracking device on your beaming every single action you make directly to your government and Big Tech, you can choose to say be a 3/10 or a 7/10.This can be done through multiple different actions. Perhaps someone chooses to use a cellphone a lot but uses a quality phone with quality apps. Or perhaps someone else avoids Big Tech and uses open source options when possible. At least they have the option to do whatever. How much of an impact does that all have? It's hard to say, but it certainly can't be bad.And if people don't stand up for decentralized technologies, then you eventually lose the ability to even discuss optionality like this. Money has been fought for with BTC and ETH. But social media has not been fought for. And I hope that that barrier is crossed one of these years when people start waking up to the nonsense brought on to them by governments and Big Tech.",
