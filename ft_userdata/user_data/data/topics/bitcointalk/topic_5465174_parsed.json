What I only see as very strange and weird are these people who are trying and hoping for such airdrops even though they are not like they are wasting a lot of their time and some money just for trying to hope that there could be some airdrop in the future.Well, it's their time and money, I'll leave it with them.Among the list, I already tried layer zero, starknet, Zksync, and base, and overall they are good, cheap transaction fees which are common goals or benefits of every layer-2 network.What I observed is volume is still low and UI or some platforms are almost identical with other layer-2 platforms which you can use in another chain already before even not using these new layer-2 networks.",

L2 projects really attract attention when they focus on topics that interest the community in this market, and sometimes there is also FOMO, when I see some opportunities to receive money, I think people will find it.Some of the prominent names that I witnessed such as OP, ARB,... all had huge airdrops with people who are active on their ecosystem, I think this is not difficult to join just a contest take time to make sure you research the features you need to use to get a good position on the snapshot list.",

Do you know about any other layer 2 projects? Layer 2 projects trends is on the top nowadays and all mentioned project are progressing. Aptos was first project gives a very good airdrop to Its early supporter. I was also among these lucky early member and got 150 tokens worth more than 1k that time. from that time I started to take parts in other speculation airdrops. I had missed Optimism before but did lot of transaction on Arbitrum and also got airdrop from it. now for future I have made lot if transactions, NFT  and other possible criteria for Base, Zksync, Linea, Layerzero and Starknet. I think the list has all possible layer 2 which has possibility to give airdrops to community. Quote 1. Layerzero(End of September)2. Starknet (End of November)3. Zksync(Q1 2024)4.

These L2's would really be sharing up on the same principle on which trying out to solve and make something more better compared into those layer one type of coins in the market but doesnt mean that they could really be able to beat up in terms in overall demand.We've seen that L1's would really be that still highly be that supported despite of those lackings and flaws that they do have.",

What these rollups do is they execute transactions on their own L2, batch (“rollup”) these transactions into a single block, and then send that block to the L1 as a single transaction, so technically transactions still happen on L1. However, due to current limited blockspace on L1 this is limited and so far we have arbitrum on top with ~1K TPS  (https://ethtps.info).With Ethereum updates rollups will be given increased and separate block data space, so L2s will be able to rollup more transaction data into one before sending to L1. This will scale even further with 'Sharding' where Ethereum will be divided into multiple shards each shard having it's own data space which could possibly give Ethereum 100k TPS. This is based on my understanding, feel free to CMIIW.",

Zksync does not have a DAO part yet(2024).Which network STRK contract has been deployed? I do every week Layerzero task. My wallet first transaction is six months old and I hope that if Layerzero has any idea of giving airdrop My wallet will also be eligible for it. Normally all new chains airdrop eligibility is to make more than 10 transactions, more than 3k$ volume and interect wallet in different week(sometime first and last transaction gap should be one month) and I did all tasks.I think Aptos and optimism airdrop will be not best because amy users recieved only 10-50 OP in second airdrop which is very low than first. I think interection with dapps and nft will be required for second and third airdrop. What do you think criteria for second airdrop?",

Stake $APT2. Provide Liquidity3. Bridge into Aptos 4. Number of transactions(Over months, weeks, days)5. Volume of the transactions6. Aptos Twitter tasks(Optional) - Live7. Aptos domain name service(This one in the Aptos website)8. Buy and sell NFTsOptimismThe next one is optimism round 3. If you checked the vesting schedule of the optimism, There is another 13% for the future airdrops. Also, that should be distributed to the community before the May of 2024. It will be a 900 Million value airdrop for the current value of optimism. This time will be the biggest airdrop from the optimism. They did not check arbitrum-like conditions in previous rounds.
