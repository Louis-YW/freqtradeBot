  "content": "Recession? How to face It?Recently, the economic news media has always been busy with discussions regarding inflation and recession. Because perhaps this is indeed a global problem or a problem that is being faced in many countries.Actually, news like that has two impacts on news readers. that is 1. Panic and fear 2. Be more alert and make preparations to face the recession itself.Personally, I am actually sometimes influenced mentally, namely panicking and a feeling of fear that arises after reading a lot of news related to the economy which is experiencing a prolonged crisis which is causing inflation and is approaching recession. Several countries have even been declared to be in a state of recession themselves.But I realized that panic and fear will not solve any problem. So I changed my mindset, namely making more effort to study the recession itself and how to deal with it if it also happened in my country. Because after all, I want to continue to have a strong economy even when there is a recession.What I understand about a recession after reading several references is a prolonged decline in economic activity over a certain period of time. Which then causes the following things:1. Unemployment Increases2. Consumers are decreasing because they are becoming more thrifty and reducing their daily shopping allowance.3. The investment zone also experienced a decline, especially from large companies who became more careful.4. The increasing difficulty of running a business or what is usually called business uncertainty.5. Financial instability on a large scale, such as many banks experiencing bankruptcy and the like.6. Panic arises in the market as prices begin to become highly volatile. An example is the many price increases that have occurred irrationally recently.We need to know more about what a recession is so we can make preparations to face it. Because if we are not ready then we may have difficulty maintaining our own economic stability. Because this recession can also increase poverty rates due to decreased levels of social welfare and even mental health problems can also occur. Like many people who are depressed when facing an increasingly difficult economic situation.To face all of that, I think we need to make preparations in an effort to face a recession, namely with small steps like the following:1. Start planning to prepare emergency funds for us to use when unexpected situations occur.2. Start reducing expenses by adopting a frugal lifestyle.3. Start looking for additional work that can make us have additional income.4. Increase our insight into financial education. So that we can be smarter in managing finances.5. Start preparing yourself to face a career change. By learning more skills in fields that we haven't even mastered before. So that we can be better prepared to work in any field that we can use to get more income. Because looking for additional work will not be easy if we don't have many skills that we can use in competition in the job market.5. Maintain physical and mental health.6. We have to be more patient and also have to push ourselves to become people who can adapt more quickly in difficult situations. Because people who cannot adapt are the ones who will lose in competition in a market that is more volatile when a recession occurs.But we also shouldn't push ourselves too hard which can make us mentally exhausted and experience stress or depression. And we also have to realize that recessions are a natural phenomenon in the economic cycle. So don't panic and keep doing your best.Hopefully you all can survive when the recession comes. Be the person who wins and can still maintain financial stability well. Good luck.",

But sadly, too many citizens don't prepare for such situation because all they think is that they're living a happy life and tomorrow's gonna be fine. And there's no need for them to worry about tomorrow's situation. Then pandemic came and everyone starts to look for some survival strategies especially those that don't have jobs and have been laid off. This is the importance of having an emergency fund of at least 6 months and more. Before it was like okay to have 3 months of EF but then when things have changed, it should be more and prolonged. What's being lowkey on a recession is the emotion effect and impact that it brings to everyone that's having tough times. Yeah, you can all of that money and savings and needs but when you're hit mentally even having those, you'll have hard time to get up.",

Example you're a reseller from X company, X company sell a product to you $10/each, but they're also sell it to other people $10/each. It's mean you need to sell higher than $10 to earn profit, how it's possible to compete against the company that can sell $10/each and still earn profit?",

Because looking for additional work will not be easy if we don't have many skills that we can use in competition in the job market.Actually, this point is one of the things I am working on. I'm learning more things at the moment. Because I realize that one skill alone is not enough if we want to win in today's competitive job market.It's just that the most difficult obstacle to face is feeling lazy and always putting off work. Even in the learning process, this is the case. So one of the things I'm currently facing is feeling lazy. Sometimes in the initial period I am enthusiastic about learning new things but then I always stop halfway due to being lazy and inconsistent. I know this is my weakness. And I'm trying to fix it now.But then I found out an easier and more fun way to learn new things. Namely by studying business opportunities in the fields we like. For example, I am a person who likes taking videos in real life. And I developed it in a direction that could produce results by learning to become a video creator on social media. Even though I'm still learning. But I'm sure someday it will pay off.",

In our country, we are not in the stage of recession, but our average unemployment here is actually very high. And many degree holders here accept jobs that are not suitable for their completed courses in the hardships of life instead of just hanging out at home.How can it be that if our country has entered this recession, there will be more and more people who will find ways to survive in situations like this? I think that two sources of income will probably not be enough for sure at this time. Our source of income should be at least three or more.",

Some emergency funds are good, but if your currency is likely to experience hyperinflation, it's important to think of keeping those funds in something else (a more stable fiat or perhaps Bitcoin). As for reducing expenses, I wouldn't do that because it's that kind of attitude that makes the recession worse, actually, as people reduce expenses and stall the economy this way. On the contrary, I spend when there's something nice or useful to buy, and think of it as my contribution to trying to stimulate the economy by keeping the money circulating. As for education and additional income source, it sounds reasonable. Maintaining health is always a good thing to do, and being patient should be a part of that.",

It could have been a little more concise.No matter what the media says, you should always act on the opposite principle and should not take their words as the truth. This talk about a recession looks like a way to instill fear into people's minds. The crisis of 2008 comes to mind, when all the media around us shouted that everything would be fine with us, but in the end everyone screwed up with their forecasts. The media is empty chatter and is not at all a source of correct information. Their goal is not to convey the truth to listeners, but to attract people's attention in order to monetize it, for example, through advertising. That’s why hype topics are most often used that touch people’s emotions, and this is the best way to attract attention.It's too late to prepare for a recession if it's already here. It was necessary to prepare for the recession long before it began, when the economy was on the rise and to accumulate financial resources. This is the same as “it’s too late to drink Borjomi when the kidneys have fallen off.”Not everyone will survive a recession. And that's a fact. \"Weak hands\" are doomed. And these are the rules of the “game”.",

      "body": "When defining recession, there are two types of recession in economic terms. Technical recession and real recession. Real recession definitions are based on NBER (National bureau of economic research) data.Based on NBER data, for a real recession to occur, there must be a contraction in production, employment, consumption and income at the same time. A technical recession can be defined as a contraction in GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in two consecutive quarters.Based on technical recession data, a technical recession is related to national income, while a real recession is long term and has a much larger impact. In a real recession, monetary policies are seriouslythere are interventions.The 1973 oil crisis, the 1997 Asian crisis and the 2008 crisis are examples of real recessions. In the US, the 2020 crisis was a real recession as production, employment, consumption and income contracted. As soon as historical peaks are seen after the great recession, all stocks, commodities and derivatives are exited because very large corrections take place. In this case, I think there is no need to exit commodities and derivatives because the recession continues. If you are in a recession, i would not hesitate to invest. If you are dependent on one income during this period, you should definitely look for extra new businesses that will increase your income before investing. To be prepared for everything in life, you should invest when things are going well.",
