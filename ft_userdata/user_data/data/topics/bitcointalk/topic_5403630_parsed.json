  "content": "On this topic we will talk a lot, first why did the crypto market collapse? what are the factors here? and let's also talk about the topic of Do Kwon terra luna issue in binance. And what was also the problem with celcius crypto lending? those are the things we will discuss one by one.Do Kwon of Terra Luna So far, LUNA does not seem to be in a good position, especially since there are reports of some investigations saying that the founder, Do Kwon, cashed out a lot of money even before the big drop in its price in the market. Around 80M $ in 33 months and in total of 2.7B $ and according to Do Kwon it is not true and he did not get such a large amount, besides that he is also under investigation in Korea even in the U.S. SEC, and another problem is the dissolution of Terra form branch branches in Korea before the cash out happens, supposedly an exit scam allegedly.But according to Do Kwon, it was just a coincidence and it had been planned for a long time. And they are now relocated to Singapore. And it also seems that Do Kwon's plan for the revival plan in LUNA did not succeed. Because it still does not return to its previous value. If we look, there are so many problems in space. And another of these is the problem of Celsius Network users, and this is that they prevent customer withdrawals and transfers to stabilize liquidity in the network. They did this since many users withdrew their crypto because of the situation that crypto is collapsing and also because of other markets. And because of this, their native token CEL dropped quickly by 50%, and because of its rapid collapse, many also played here and that FOMO for a while and pumped for a while, But it is also undeniable that the factor is also big its the collapse of the crypto market because many users are unable to release their assets. These 10B worth of customer crypto assets in this company could go into bankruptcy because of the action they took. Now for those of you who don't understand the Celsius Network what has been its big impact on what's happening now, It's like a bank where you can put your crypto assets and you can lock them in, and eventually, it will grow, same with a traditional bank which always has a higher interest here in celsius. And at some point with a high APY versus its competitors, it’s a way for investors to be safe possibly just by holding their crypto assets here in celsius. But right now we can't say it's safe because it's not accessible because users can't release their crypto assets. And the collapse of space also had a big impact on the Celsius Network. Although celsius guarantees high rates for stablecoins like UST. So when it crashed (LUNA) and also affected Celsius. and also one of the falls in celsius is due to LIDO finance.Cashing out 2.7B$ from LUNARefference: https://cointelegraph.com/news/do-kwon-dismisses-allegation-of-cashing-out-2-7b-from-terra-luna-ustLuna Investigation under South KoreaReferrence: https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/south-korea-launches-investigation-into-lunas-parent-company/Terra Luna Investigation under by U.S at SECReferrence: https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/05/27155124/sec-is-already-investigating-terras-stablecoin-ust-reportOne of the reason of crashing Celsius Network is Lido FinanceReferrence: https://www.theblock.co/post/148642/lido-finance-refuses-to-support-terras-new-blockchainWill there be still a chance now for the users to recover their losses after what happened to this bad circumstances in LUNA or in the collapses of the cryptocurrency in the market?",

      "body": "We cannot say that the recent collapse was caused by Luna’s problem only, but rather the market was saturated with liquidity and the investors’ need for that liquidity, so they seemed to withdraw it in a crazy way, especially since a lot of this money was pumped at lower price levels than today, and therefore all of them are profits despite the small value of these profits.In short Luna makes bad things worst.Celsius will not be the last, as some companies and platforms will start to realize some losses, which means that it is time to withdraw your money from them.",

And I agreed also that the truet they've build before will be hard to gain it again. But if the Do Kwon will change again the total supply from Trillions of Luna coin or LUNC possible there is a chance anyhow to recover again the trust of their investors to invest again to their own native token once more, but if not, for sure LUNA will be a dead coin in the future I guess.Quote from: Tony116 on June 23, 2022, 04:04:54 AMQuote from: Mr. Magkaisa on June 22, 2022, 01:13:40 PMWill there be still a chance now for the users to recover their losses after what happened to this bad circumstances in LUNA or in the collapses of the cryptocurrency in the market?In terms of investment, users cannot recover losses with these two projects, Luna is truly dead, and there's no way for Luna to gain investor confidence.
