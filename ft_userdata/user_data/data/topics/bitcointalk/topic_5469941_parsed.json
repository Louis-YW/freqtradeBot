I don't know if they think it's a smart move from them or a dumb move from them. I don't know many things about wallets yet. But since I learned about Electrum, I have been using it and I am satisfied with it.

Your transaction should not be \"partially signed\" online. Indeed, transactions can only be partially signed if you are using a multi-sig set up. With a standard single-sig cold wallet, the only thing that happens on your online machine is you create an unsigned transaction. That unsigned transaction is moved to your cold device to be signed, and then moved back again to be broadcast.Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on October 11, 2023, 08:19:11 AMI've been wondering myself why hardware wallets are necessary, and the impression I get is that simply using Electrum leaves you vulnerable to getting hacked, which wouldn't be possible when using a HW wallet (or at least much harder if you're paying attention when doing transactions).If you simply install Electrum on an internet connected device and use it as a hot wallet, then yes, it will not be as secure as a (good) hardware wallet. But you can also use Electrum as a cold wallet. What this means is that Electrum is installed on a computer which is permanently disconnected (airgapped) from the internet, meaning the device can never download malware and never be attacked via the internet since it is never connected to the internet. This airgapped computer stores your private keys, and your private keys never leave this airgapped computer so are never at risk of being exposed to the internet. You create unsigned transactions on your usual internet connected computer, move the unsigned transaction via a USB drive or QR code to your airgapped computer to be signed with your private keys, and then move the signed transaction back to your usual computer to be broadcast to the network.",

This is the chip that is used in passports and credit cards. Ledger uses Secure Chip to generate and store your private keys. In past, Ledger has said that your private keys never leave the Secure Element chip, that means, it's almost impossible to extract private keys from your wallet. Then they appeared with Ledger Recover news and this is the moment when everyone understood that ledger has been lying about its claims that keys never leave secure chip.If you read Ledger Recover FAQ, you'll find paradox:Claim 1 - No access to your private key was made to enable Ledger Recover to work.Claim 2 - Ledger's Operating System allows access to the private key stored within the Secure Element, but only after you manually approve and confirm it.My logical question is, how is that? Answer is, Ledger is a liar.Quote from: seek3r on October 22, 2023, 08:17:53 PMAbsolute no-go and another reason why you should never trust Ledger anymore.

      "body": "First off, one aspect of this entire thing that seems to barely ever be discussed which bothers me far more than the concept of a recover feature is the fact that Ledger seems to be quite comfortable attending WEF retreats and rubbing elbows with the same people who want us to own nothing and be happy. I don't feel safe leaving my keys in the hands of a \"trust me bro\" CEO who attends WEF conferences and refuses to fully open source firmware that's possible of extracting keys from their devices via USB cable through a PC and over the internet. Secondly, they keep beating the drum about how these shards are encrypted, but if anybody can restore their keys on a brand new ledger than clearly the encryption keys to these shards reside somewhere within Ledger. Where? Who has them? If any device can restore with 2/3 shards then that means it only takes collusion from 2 of these companies that store the shards to have access to every single key out there. Thirdly, the idea of \"just don't use it\" may not be that simple as I recall seeing somewhere (I think within the other large thread on this topic) that the claim that you always have to physically press the buttons on a ledger to initiate an operation like sharding and sending your keys via recovery service is actually false, as the device can be updated via firmware to drop this necessity with ease. Somebody (sorry I can't remember who or where) posted evidence that proves the physical button press is not technically required for such an action to be engaged. If anybody knows the technicalities of this or can prove it true or false please reply with such info.Edit I think it was this post I'm referencing.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on May 18, 2023, 09:03:05 AMQuote from: Pmalek on May 18, 2023, 08:34:21 AMIn theory, unless you update to the newest firmware that unlocks seed-share and approve it physically by pressing the buttons on your Nano, the feature won't work.Which is completely irrelevant. Given that a simple software update means the secret element can now export private keys, then a simple software update could make this feature mandatory, or could remove the need for any physical button presses, or could take everyone's private keys without their knowledge or consent. The whole point of the secure element is moot. The entire security of the device hinges on non malicious software.It's probably worth pointing out that this is also the case for Trezor devices, which everyone on Reddit seems to be keen to move to. If Trezor implement malicious software, then the same thing will happen. The only hardware wallet I would even think about touching right now is a Passport - permanently airgapped and completely open source - but as I said before, airgapped, encrypted, cold storage on an old laptop or similar is far preferable.So really the fact that its technically possible for Ledger to do this - that isn't the real issue (although their communication and prior marketing was abysmal) - any HW wallet can technically access the priv key if firmware demands it. The real issue is that there are a million things that haven't been answered on a technical level in the excruciating detail necessary for anyone to be able to feel good about this.",

The required button presses are a firmware update away from not being needed at all. Which means that change could be made with or without your knowledge. \"We promise we won't\" Back to trust me bro. Ledger keeps repeating that \"all hardware wallets require trust\" and people get lost in this because while on one hand it's true to some degree, not every wallet requires as much trust as one that's closed source which also has the ability via firmware to split and send seeds through your USB/Bluetooth connection, through your PC and then stored elsewhere. \"Oh but the shards are encrypted!\" This only sounds good until you realize that Ledger themselves say that any device can restore the shards. So the encryption keys are either specific to ledger Hardware (meaning anybody with a Ledger has them) or they're stored at Ledger headquarters (meaning they have them and you have to hope they aren't leaked the way all those addresses and emails were). Any way you slice this it's frightening.",
