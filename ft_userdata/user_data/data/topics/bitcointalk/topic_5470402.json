It's good that you distinguish between them. Even though, I doubt if any of the Bitcoin Enthusiast would be confused with these two terms. There are many newbies (and experts) who think they know everything, for example, many don't know tokens and coins are not the same things in cryptocurrency. Even they are experts. Topics like these are good reminders for those who already know about it and good pieces of information (eye-opening) for those who take it wrong. Quote from: ColdLava40 on October 15, 2023, 09:03:22 AMThe two main phrases in both definition states the big difference between them. Halving helps to reduce what's entering into circulation, while burning helps to reduce what's already in circulation.We should note that halving is an automated mechanism that would occur when every 210,000 blocks have been mined. It is practically used for bitcoin. While burning is intentionally done by the developers of that particular coin.Well, just to clear things out, Halving was also implemented by the founder, which means, it is created or developed or integrated (whatever you can say) first in the BTC blockchain and then afterward it is programmed as automated and the burning could also be automated after implementing it first (intentionally). So, the difference of automation and manual seems not right. Quote from: ColdLava40 on October 15, 2023, 09:03:22 AMThough, they both have little similarities such that: both mechanism helps to activate scarcity. After burning, there are possibilities that the specific coin would increase in price or not, but what do you expect when there is scarcity ?. The same goes for Bitcoin halving.That's not what scarcity means in the context of BTC. Like in BTC supply is fixed but if you are burning some tokens (ALTS) then the supply can be changed there (means can be increased), other than this, burying and halving did reduce the supply in circulation and had a positive impact on the price, but nothing resembles BTC. Even the hard-forked BTC version which also follows the halving paths.",

The first I have heard of it. I guess it will be more common in those who are approaching the \"crypto\" market for the first time giving them the same Bitcoin as shitcoins, and not understanding the essential differences.Halving is unique to Bitcoin while crypto burning is very much like buybacks of shares that companies do and take them out of circulation. I think although they don't call it \"burning\" it is essentially the same thing. Here you can clearly see how shitcoins are securities, as the management team of the company or shitcoin does and undoes as they please on the supply.",

I did not know what they are but a simple effort to search can help me understand what is Bitcoin halving and what is an altcoin burning event.I also have never heard anyone confused about these terms.Altcoins are centralized and many altcoins are EVMs with smart contracts that can be used to seize coins in an address, burn it, mint more. Burning events with altcoins are easily but similar to Bitcoin, if you want to burn an amount of coin in circulating and total supply, it's easy.Create an address, throw away by burning the private key physically, then sending coins to that address, it is burning. Burning is to reduce supply. Bitcoin halving and some altcoins also have their halvings too, are to add more coins in circulating supply. The biggest difference between halving and burning is here.",

      "body": "Those who look at both terms the same way, I believe, don't really understand it well, or it's based on a misconception. Even the words themselves appear to be self-explanatory. That being said, bitcoin halving helps reduce the reward for miners, as we all know, and this will continue over time until the last block is mined, and there is nothing to be mind out of the block again and no reward for miners as they will have other sources of earning. For the main time, the amount that's to enter into circulation is what's being reduced, but it does not stop there, as they will still enter the same circulation over time as the blockchain continues. But for token burning, which the altcoins use to convince their holders and investors that scarcity is being created, they move a certain amount, which they intentionally created from the very beginning, and they know it's too much for a project yet they created such an amount. At the end, to convince people that it has been moved out of the market, they send the agreed amount to be burned sent to an address that no one has access to. This is token burning, and this same project developer can still mint tokens from no where most times and add them to the market, or sometimes they can do a contract swap and from the old token to another, which will give them the chance to create more tokens. These two are not in any way related, although some newbies might also have the wrong idea about them, which will help enlighten their minds a little bit.",

It's solely marketing initiative.Thinking about those programs like their developers are free to code and set any amount of token total supply they want for a token. No restriction on what is the maximum total supply when they code so if they want their token looks to be scarce in total supply, they can set it low. If they want to make it is not scarce, they are free to set it high.There are two strategies: set it low at start to make hype that if investors are slowly, they will miss the train to get rich; set it massively high like Shiba Inu and many tokens, then use Buy back and burn programs to burn tokens later.The second strategy looks odds in my view.Yearn Finance with its total supply is only 36647 $YFI tokens is an example for a first strategy. You zoom out the chart and will see its price was about $40,000 in 2020 and $70,000 in 2021. It's a most scammiest and most successful scam token in history.What is the benefit of buring $SHIB?Yearn finance.",

Yeah, most likely those who are familiar with 'crypto burn' might be dealing more on the altcoin side (no offense to them). But for members here who started with bitcoin first, they know what bitcoin halving is and most likely experience it recently.So I guess if we are in this board, then I don't see any confusion. On the contrary, those bitcoin enthusiast might have heard this term for the first time. But I doubt that they are going to be confused by it. But thanks to the OP for bringing that up.",
