So now I want to say that I think In 2010 some people might make 1 or more BTC per day through PC. During the 2010 days, it was quite easy to acquire or mine BTC both and any individual could get 1 BTC without spending much for the hardware. 3.39 million BTC was mined in 2010 alone and at this point in time, an individual could still leverage a central processing unit (CPU) to mine bitcoin up until mid-2010. Anyway, thinking about mining these days is not worth it if you are totally new since there is a difficulty increase of more than 145,317,112,385% since 2010 (numbers maybe not exactly accurate but close). Using a basic computer wont work anymore.Quote from: fennic on November 29, 2022, 12:34:48 PMAnd so what was the first time if you have minded btc?Guess you mean mined ? (not minded lol). Btw, didnt pay much attention to mining in the very early days of 2010, wish we all could hah!",

Imagine using a pc you can mine bitcoins. I remember when I was just starting in this industry, my friend used to download something on his pc and once he did that, I wasn't sure if he was mining bitcoins or altcoins, but I think it was altcoins it can be converted to bitcoin. It's free, he doesn't take anything out of his pocket.That's why the first time I heard about bitcoin, even if I liked it, I didn't fully understand bitcoin at that time.",

The beginning of my work in Bitcoin was around 2015 by chance with faucet sites. I knew a little about Bitcoin and started working on faucets, some of which in those days gave about 20,000 satoshis by solving captcha only. I worked on many sites and managed to accumulate about 0.2 BTC in just months.But unfortunately the price of bitcoin at that time was only about 300-400$, I never thought at that time that the price of bitcoin could reach these numbers one day, so I sold it very cheaply.The summary is that there are many people who owned several bitcoins in the past, but sold them cheaply because they did not think that it would multiply hundreds of times.",

If a faucet didn't even give you that much then nobody would use them. It is not limited to BTC, new altcoins do the same and get the same thing with mining and faucet.If OP is worried about people controlling a large amount of Bitcoin because they mine a lot in the past, he should probably follow the market in real-time and see who is selling in large amounts and at what time it usually happens. It's been around 8 years since mining 1 BTC is easy, pretty sure the majority of them already sold their BTC at previous highs. I'd be more worried about hedge funds dumping on retail instead of miners from 6 years ago selling their BTC right now.While there is a report stating that 2022 put a lot of stress on miners to sell their BTC, the fact that the hash rate is still strong likely means most miners keep mining BTC while believing that BTC price will recover or reach a new high later[1]. CMIIW. If you're just curious then I believe you can find the answer in detail easily just by googling it. Lots of news websites posted one or two articles every now and then regarding this.[1] https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-btc-miners-sell-most-in-5-years/",
