Instead of writing the story behind it, I believe this piece of art can speak for itself. As I envisioned the feelings of our guy Laszlo, who famously bought a pizza for 10,000 Bitcoin, I was inspired to create 'Bitcoin Pizza Day 2022.' It's a work that came to life hour by hour during my therapy sessions. ‚ÄîMX12Bitcointalk strong together ¬† ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîFeel Free to visit Mx12.Art Bitcoin Art Threadhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5362071.0‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîor‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîSALE Threadhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5400193.msg60223973#msg60223973",
