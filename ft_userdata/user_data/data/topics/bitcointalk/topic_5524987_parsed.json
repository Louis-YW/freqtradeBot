They already have the private keys and you don't need to generate any. All you need to to download the wallet from their official site and create your wallet. You write down your seed phrase on a piece of paper and make three duplicates, where you are to keep them in three different locations very far from each other.",

Also about the transaction fee, wallet developers are trying to make sure they use the best algorithm for fee estimation. Most people do not know about memepool. Just let them know reputed wallets.

Take note that backing up your seed phrase offline does not really have much to do with the wallet or wallet UX you are talking about, that is just how to use BTC safely and be your own bank.I.e. i expect newbies to have problem setting up an airgapped wallet, but newbies don't have to do that from the off, they can use Electrum or BlueWallet and use a hardware wallet for cold storage, which is newbies-friendly.

From managing private keys to understanding transaction fees, there's a steep learning curve.I think I had too many questions on something like this in my early days.As a beginner, I think one major thing we look forward to having is that easy/friendly user interface that will make us navigate easily through wallets, but at some point, I realized that security matters most when using a wallet.  In as much as I wasn't too comfortable with the wallet I was using at first, I had to get used to it due to it's level of security.And not just that, I have also learned how to keep my seed phrase, which I believe every wallet must prompt a user to keep safe. Keeping a seed phrase does not require a master degree or technical knowledge, because the words are very simple. And when I say \"keeping\", I don't mean trying to memorize. I believe your friend knows it's importance. And as for tx fees, there is also an easy option to select which one to use. QuoteDo you think crypto wallets are doing enough to improve user experience or is it still a major barrier to mass adoption?Like I said, in as much as user experience matters, security is far more important, and that's what I think reputable wallets are trying to improve. I didn't find it convenient at first, but I had to adapt. I believe wallet developers are not developing wallet to satisfy one person's taste.Quote from: ABCbits on January 02, 2025, 09:12:00 AMOut of curiosity, what wallet used by your friend? After all, many wallet these days expect you1. To backup 12-24 recovery words rather than managing private keys manually.2. To choose TX fee option (such as fast/slow or cheap/expensive) rather than entering fee/fee rate manually.That selective option makes it simple for users to choose, though I have noticed that a particular wallet doesn't accept manually inputted tx fees, even though there is an option for that.",
