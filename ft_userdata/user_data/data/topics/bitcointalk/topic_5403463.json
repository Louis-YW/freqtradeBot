El Salvador is what interests them the least, they [the media outlet] are not interested in what happens to our economy, they are not interested in what happens with our people, what happens with inflation.”Quote“I have said it repeatedly: A supposed loss of 40 million dollars has not occurred because we have not sold the coins.”We all know that the second  quote is true, 1 BTC is equals to 1 BTC, if El Salvador has not sold bitcoin, this is not loss. Some holders will see the price falling, only what they think about is to wait for another years for all-time-high.How do you see people that are criticizing El Salvador government as bitcoin price has decreased? As for me, I see them as someone that will only panic and sell, thinking they have lost money, but latter regret this in long term when the price of bitcoin reach all-time-high.

They haven't lost anything. Sure, they could have acquired MORE bitcoins if they had waited until now to acquire them, but there was no way to know that with any certainty back when they made the exchange. They also could have acquired less bitcoins if they had made all their echanges at the higher exchange rate.",

This is a long term game and everyone understands it. It would make sense for them to be purchasing more, at the current market price their averagebuy price will be drastically reduced and obviously the option to sell does not make sense.My Opinion - There is less than 2 years until the next halving, we all know whats going tohappen following and there is a big chance the market will start rising 6 months before the event,so if they can weather the pressure of the bear market and are able to DCA in the meantime itwill be all good.Its nice to see support for El Salvador",

It's monopoly money for him. He's a narcissistic douchebag, pretending to care while he gives zero shit about what's going on in the streets of El-Salvador. It's all a ruse. His police report fake numbers, he pays off gangs, fires whoever criticizes his policies in the government, and replaces them with his lapdogs. I am glad that bitcoin crashed, that fcker deserves this humiliation",

If this is the case, there is no need singling out El Salvador to criticize their investment in bitcoin with that idiomatic expression, when in fact the current situation is not a case peculiar to them but affecting everyone who has invested in bitcoins. Although no one could have accurately predicted bitcoins to get to the low price it is at currently, the Analyst(s) who the El Salvadorian president may have consulted with prior to the decision to adopt bitcoins must have indicated that there is a possibility of this current market situation.On the positive sides of things, if El Salvador can survive these times, I don't see another situation threatening their bitcoin adoption that they can't survive.",

Today did have a bear market but imagine when it's next ATH El Salvador will laugh with pride for turning a bearish moment into a big buy and the next day El Salvador stands taller with broad chests saying we surpassed other countries finances in just a short time.

As the more he looks at the chart, listening to the criticism, the more it brings him down. It is a fair decision to leave for the market for a while, encouraging not to buy yet.
