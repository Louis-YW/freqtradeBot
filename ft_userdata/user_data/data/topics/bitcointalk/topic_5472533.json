Keep on doing what you have been doing and in a couple of months you will become a Full Member and you can again celebrate your accomplishment. For now,  you should move this topic to the Reputation board as this board is to discuss the forum and not about personal accomplishment. I can see both Cantsay and 348Judah have already advised you about it. I am the third one on your thread informing you of the same, it won't look good if others after me advise you about the same thing.",

Don't get me wrong as I also enjoy raising a glass to one or two celebrations but i don't think the earth will stand still if we stopped creating threads for every rank we get to because tbh the forum's not like a competition that requires we announce everything.

Quote from: Riginac111 on November 02, 2023, 04:53:58 AMToday I'm a member and I'm excited to see myself to this rank, I will stand to celebrate another milestone in the forum which I know very well,  so when I looked at my ranked up I get more courage, I want to everyone to not lose hope in what they are doing, because their is some things that will stand as obstacles when you want to know what you don't Earning merits and unlocking new activities is not everything in this forum, your contributions is all that matters so I would ask you, if you eventually achieve the highest rank here which I believe is your goal here so what’s next? What will you be doing in the forum, how will you feel when you finally achieve your goal. If you still have challenges of identifying the best suited board for a post by this time then you still have a long way to go. As others mentioned, please move this thread to the Reputation board it is best suited there.",

      "body": "First of all I congratulate you on achieving member rank because only few people can achieve that rank as it's a difficult thing to get merits without putting a lot effort on your posts. I hope that you'll continue improving yourself and also your posts so that you may rank to even higher rank levels in future.secondly, I recommend you to be careful when logging in your account on someone else's phone because you really don't know if that phone is compromised or not and you also don't know that if that who else can access that phone. The privacy of your account is very important and for that reason I recommend you to only use your account on your own up-to-date devices so you can safely rank up without worrying about being hacked.Finally, I believe that it's a really celebrating worthy thing to share your ranked up journey with other members so they can get inspired from such stories. I know it's hard to rank up in this forum for new members but if you are someone who believes in hard work and gives proper time to this forum then ranking up isn't an issue.",

It’s definitely a milestone even if it’s just 3ranks up as not so many could be prions of such. Congrats to have made it this far and you’re not quite far from your Full member rank either. Keep being encouraged in don’t defray from the goods your doing and could do on the forum.",
