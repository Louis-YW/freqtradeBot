  "content": "Bitcoin has solved multiple problem from the users, it will continue to help countries, governments, city, town and villages to solve their problems if they are willing to embrace it like the way it solved the problems of other countries, governments, city, villages that embraced it. I have heard and seen how Bitcoin has helped people to became rich by building estates all over the country, establishing businesses all over the country, driving good cars in the community, sending their children to the most expensive school in the country with the help of Bitcoin.HERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS BITCOIN SOLVE FOR THE USERS:1) Problem of divisibility: you can divide Bitcoin up to 8 decimal point like 0.00000001 bitcoin2) The government cannot reach up it's bum and pull because is a decentralized currency.3) Bitcoin as a decentralized currency solve the problem of the need for a corruptible third party from the central bank.Let us continue to spread the good news about Bitcoin until the whole world make it legal.",

The common man in the sense that no third party which also implies if the government must key into the system they too operate as common men where we all operate in decentralised network of an existing public ledger. So it hasn't solved any problem for any government not even El Salvador the Bitcoin city who are currently on 60% loss of its total value can say Bitcoin has solved a single issue for them yet. Individuals, businesses and co-operations who invested earlier might have Bitcoin work for them but they own it independently",

Satoshi's plan was perfectly successful even though people now prefer to store value but still, the purpose of Bitcoin and why it is created was still there.The main problem that has been solved and the main purpose why Bitcoin was created is just because of the alternative payment system, a digital currency that can send across the border without third-party control.",

They don't need to come to urban areas to carry out business transactions because Bitcoin can serve as a very potent means of exchange. There are also restrictions or benchmarks on the maximum amount that can be withdrawn from physical banks. This has really affected so many individuals and businesses because they have to pay high bank charges to withdraw above their limits. Bitcoin serves as a veritable tool to bypass these restrictions without paying more charges or violating any financial law.",

If you only talk about the positives without warning people to be careful about using bitcoin, you will have many opponents who, having experienced the loss of their deposits, will take the opposite side. The post is very pompous. I can not say that bitcoin solves all problems. It all depends on the person. You should not turn bitcoin into an idol of wealth. A poor person can become richer if he can invest in bitcoin correctly, and it is not a small amount that the poor usually do not have that matters, and it also takes time. How many years of life have you measured for yourself? OP, by what age do you expect to become rich and live without problems?",

It is well designed.How about cross border payments that are cheap with bitcoin. And making remittance easy and cheap to people in countries it is accepted like El Salvador.

I believe the best is its decentralized nature and the investment side, ROI. Investors in Bitcoin over the years have noticed this is unarguably one of the best investments you can take considering your ROI after a few years which is more than other sectors.",

I will put it that BTC can do what fiat does (which is for payment,) with many other additional things inclusive that fiat can't do.Quote from: Desmong on October 17, 2022, 11:56:10 PMThere are shillers, influencers, programers who are earning big from the crypto market.All of these have nothing to do with bitcoin in itself, or what it can solve.Quote from: Hamza2424 on October 18, 2022, 12:09:34 PMSo I think BTC don't need us but we need BTC as Satoshi knows everything he might be a genius in Economics.Satoshi is no more a part of the network. You are not correct, the BTC community are too important, since the tech doesn't have a central organization, it has to be run by the community: Miners, nodes, users, investors. These are the people involved in the growth and protection (through mining) of BTC. If people didn't trust Satoshi's creation and supported it BTC may not be where it is today, if people like Gavin Andresen didn't give out free BTC in 2010, and the other devs who supported in one way or another, who knows if the network would have come this far. TL;DR: BTC needs BTC users to grow.",

Not only are they at risk of being hacked through phishing, clipboard malware or exchange hacking, but at any moment their funds can be frozen for any reason.Even if you set things up the right way (non-custodial wallet), you can still depend heavily on the central system if you can't buy anything directly for Bitcoin, or if you are a client of a bank that is not crypto-friendly. In an ideal world where Bitcoin would be accepted everywhere, we could say that we are free in the financial sense - until then, someone can find himself in a situation where he has a certain amount of Bitcoin, and literally be hungry because there is no way to exchange Bitcoin for anything.",
