They don't see the importance of having some stoppage and taking rest or intervals with your trades.That's why for them it shouldn't be stopped but as you've said, it's important to know to stop. Like when you have no wins at all and you keep pushing but don't restrategize. Flee the market for a while if the trades you've been doing don't even favor you.",

I don't think so. its just a matter of confidence and methodology, If your trading and you find yourself losing you don't have to find a quality trade because all trades are trade there is non higher than the others it's about your risk management and your decision making. high quality trade is more like a term used by influencers to keep you motivated. Generally, trading is like gambling your winning is what the determines your quality and it can be a lucky move at times since it's all about profiting anyone whose losing should take a break and re-strategize and find the faults in the failed trade then correct and make better trading. It's good to take a break but quiting is not an option in anyway, just keep pushing gradually and understand better that's the rule.",

Quote from: Barikui1 on December 16, 2023, 11:36:18 AM the market is what it is, we as retail traders just have to react to what is playing out in other to be successful, not what we think.You are right, we can not make market to move in the direction where we want unless we have the resources to pump and dump the prices. All we can do is wait for the right moment and should not hesitate to take entry when our gut tells us about a good entry. Always make strategies and never stick to them just because some other dude is making profit out of it while you are not and in good hopes you are still using it. Always do your own research. Over-trading will always wipe your wallet and you will lose the upcoming opportunities that would have the potential to recover your all losses. Waiting for the right opportunity is the main thing we all should adopt as retail traders. Because in trading we have the opportunity to trade in thousands of trades.",

Risk management is one of the things that a trader must master. No matter how professional or how great a trader I'm sure they will apply it. In addition to making us more comfortable in trading, this also makes the risk we will receive at least smaller than not applying at all. When experiencing profits it will be the same thing, we must be able to commit to our profit plan at the beginning, do not become greedy, because usually that's where the destruction will start. Greed can destroy the profits that have been in sight, because the market is very flexible and therefore we must get used to sticking to our targets at the beginning.",

Emotions can be positive or negative and you shouldn’t allow any of them to get into you too much without finding a way to control them. You can’t get back at the market immediately when you lose in the market and at the same time you won’t be too greedy to take only what you’ve set for that day as profit when you’ve achieved that, you’ll become greedy and could blow up the account again together with the profit you’ve made earlier before.

If we are trading in real time and suffer a loss, it is tough to take a break since we really want to recover our losses, especially if we are new to trading. Most traders think that if they learn a strategy from a mentor, it would make them instantly profitable since their mentor is profitable, but this is not the case. Why can't we become profitable with the same strategy? It's because we have different market executions. So, after the mentorship, backtesting the strategy is essential in order to determine which structure is profitable.",

Traders should know when to pause trading in times when they notice that they are experiencing many losses and not just getting things right. Pausing and giving trading a temporary break will help you understand why you were losing, the mistakes you were making and errors in your strategy. It will also give you some time to find a new strategy while your capital is saved. If a trader does not know when to pause from trading, they will lose a lot of money to learn the lesson.",

The point is to learn to wait for the right time because it's always best to just wait than feel like you are unsure about your trade. Like you said it's not gambling that its all about luck.You have a strategy to begin with.

Once a trader trades frequently, he will gain experience and will eventually make good decisions with it. Still I have seen many traders getting carried away with emotions. Hence you need to control that also in order to make profit. The optimal solution for this problem can be setting smaller targets. Once the target is achieved, just take exit from the trades. In this manner you will make little profits and losses can be reduced.",

Although some people allow themselves to trade with emotion, this results in them making the wrong trading decision, which can cause them more losses.A trader also needs to be mentally prepared to face any losses that they may encounter while trading; otherwise,  they could just make some mistakes.",
