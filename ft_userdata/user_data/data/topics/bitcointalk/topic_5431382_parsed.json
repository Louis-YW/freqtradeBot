  "content": "Current altcoin STAKING PER YEAR - Cosmos ATOM 10% - Zilliqa ZIL 13% - ICON ICX 10% - Band Protocol BAND 13% - Atomic Wallet Token AWC 20%. But it is not possible to exchange instantly to Bitcoin or other more popular altcoins. So it is just time waste. You can hold your Atomic wallet tokens in your wallet or exchange and nothing more, there are not interested buyers. Â P.S. I invested 0.01BTC in Tether USDT staking, it is something complete different, I always can exchange Tether USDT instantly to Bitcoin, ETH, Stelar, EOS, Ripple, Doge, TRON, Monero etc. PM for the link, if interested.",

Why would anyone PM you for a link. Why don't you post the link here, and we all see it?Also, the idea of staking is messed up. It's just a huge Ponzi scheme.",

It's just a huge Ponzi scheme.He is obviously trying to push his referral link to people, and since it's against the bitcointalk rules to post those, so OP decided to go this way.But what you said about staking, i can see how staking usdt is unsustainable, but when staking is about securing the chain, it really doesn't differ from PoW in a way it would be more any more ponzi. And word Ponzi doesn't really apply this any more then trading anyhting would be a ponzi.",

Seeing that your thread is self-moderated I hope you ain't trying to delete any post that points out the obvious.",
