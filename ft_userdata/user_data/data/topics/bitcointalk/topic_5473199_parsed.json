      "body": "welcome to the forum, maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me that the casino has already been operating for a few months, I say this because the TOS was changed a few months ago, which means that the casino has already been operating for a few months. But it's strange that there aren't many comments from people on the internet talking about this casino. I searched on trustpiloto and casino.guro, I only saw one comment on casino.guro, although it is a positive comment, still only having just one comment, shows that people don't have much interest in this casino, maybe that's why they They decided to create an ann thread on the forum.but it seems to me that they have no intention of creating a signature campaign, knowing that there are options to have a copper account to allow newbies to post photos, it is strange that they have not chosen to create an account, buy a copper account and post in the ann thread . Well, I'll wait for someone representing the casino to come so I can post the questions I have. I wish the casino much success. congratulations to OP for the ANN Thread designer",

The announcement thread as we all know was posted by Royse and I believe that Royse is going to be the campaign manager to manage the signature campaign of the BitUbEt.I warmly welcome BitUbEt on our forum and I hope that soon they will launch their signature campaign in order to get exposure on this forum. Their site seems good to me and with some promotion they will get some good players on their platform.",

The announcement thread as we all know was posted by Royse and I believe that Royse is going to be the campaign manager to manage the signature campaign of the BitUbEt.The fact that the domain name was registered a long time ago does not mean that the service has been available since that date. Searching online, there is not much about this platform, and it seems that throughout the past 200 days (since the date of domain registration) they have been working on further development. There is no clarification anywhere about the actual launch date, since the platform did not launch an official announcement on any of the channels, until today’s date of publishing the announcement here on the forum.Quote from: SamReomo on November 07, 2023, 10:55:29 PMI warmly welcome BitUbEt on our forum and I hope that soon they will launch their signature campaign in order to get exposure on this forum.

No one knows about the platform’s promotional plans, especially with the absence of an official representative who can answer these questions. The announcement was not designed by Royse, and he indicated that he was only asked to publish it. Overall, I think it's good that they chose Royse to help promote here on the forum. I think this is the best thing any platform can do, especially in the beginning stage.",

Signature Campaigns at this forum are the best medium to promote the sites provided Bitubet has sufficient budget for this purpose.",

Signature Campaigns at this forum are the best medium to promote the sites provided Bitubet has sufficient budget for this purpose.Totally understandable basing up on the current arrangement that we are seeing that if Royse did get the job on posting their ANN thread in behalf then it would be most likely that ads or marketing would really comes next. So it is really that safe to presume out that signature campaign would comes next and of course he would be the ones who would really be handling it out. It would really be that understandableor likely to happen.Recently, new gambling platforms are really that making up some launch and they are quite good looking. This one is really that been dealt up by one of the knownmanagers of this forum then i do already expect that this one would really be making up some noise.Its not really that bad looking either.",

And it's just proper that it will be in this great community. Yes, there are a lot of competition out there and for sure BitUbet.com knows it.But we will have to wait and see if Royse if going to handle it, as he put a disclaimer that this ANN thread is manage by the team themselves, and Royse responsibility is to post this thread. Although they could have been advised to buy a copper membership and they can post it themselves.In any case, welcome to the community and hopefully you will stay here. Best of luck to your new casino.",

And perhaps there is no need for it at all.All I can say is that BitUbet team is capable of launching a promotional campaign with a high success rate. Their choice of Royce's services could demonstrate their interest in building a good reputation in the gambling industry and consequently in the crypto market as a whole. Any cryptobased gambling site will receive satisfactory results if it launches a promotional campaign on Bitcointalk. With good management, there is no doubt about that.",

With good management, there is no doubt about that.Yes, we've seen a lot of new casinos this year going on that route, a signature campaign, regardless of who is going to handle it. But most likely if BitUbet wanted to run a campaign, they already have their choice already, and with that just a matter of time before they drop it here.So first off, welcome to the community. We get excited to see a new casinos here, because as gamblers, we wanted to have more options to play or at least there's a alternative. Because as gamblers, most of the time we wanted to try new specially if you have been playing on your favorite casinos and you have a string of bad luck. So better try another one.Second, this is a very competitive niche and so each and everyone would want to promote it and we gamblers are going to benefit if lets say first deposit bonus, or there will be competitions, etc. So it's good to have them and even it's a very competitive niche, it's not that saturated as there are a lot of gamblers around the world.",
