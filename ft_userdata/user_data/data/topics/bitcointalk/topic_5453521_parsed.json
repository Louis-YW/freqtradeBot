Instead, I'm more interested in the 2.7 million banned accounts since that number is far too big to ignore.

It's subjective, but as long as the newbie doesn't talk about shitcoin in strict moderated board e.g. Development & Technical Discussion, Bitcoin Technical Support and Meta, they wouldn't get criticism.2. Red more than green was happen since long time ago, it was harsh than nowadays. If you're a spammer, exchange your merit with alt, ask no collateral loan, you obviously will get red tag. But now spam and exchange merit will not get red tag, some newbie didn't get red tag for ask no collateral loan.3. Nope, more and more merit flowing is increasing. There's no merit deduction, theymos always distributing new sMerit to merit source.4. Nope, there are many cases users are plagiarism and still not get banned.5. People who interested with Bitcoin, don't need to join this forum to start his Bitcoin journey. I don't have data to back up my words, but I'm pretty sure the total number of high accounts were because of easy way to make money in bounties. People can join a bounty even the account is still a newbie rank.It's decreased because they can't make money without any effort.",

      "body": "It is natural for forums. You can't grow all the time. Besides that we can remember what was in pre merit times. When I came here already was a merit system but one line posters were still here (and old-timers said there were much more before that). Some can say that there were more users before, but it wat totally impossible to talk to anyone as any post went away pages ago immediatelly and all the pages were of one line posts. Now we have much less bots. Of course there still are some, but not as much.Other reason is not a \"low Bitcoin adoption\", but its growing popularity. Time goes and there are more and more places you can talk about bitcoin and get some info about it. Different kind, different quality, but very many places. So Bitcointalk is competing for users attention with multiple other places. Of course if you want to get most professional info and to communicate with a big number of knowledgeable people you should come here, but there are many who is glad with much much less.And I guess when there will be next bull run there will be next surge of interest to Bitcointalk as well.Quote from: Igebotz on May 21, 2023, 12:27:40 PM...Is it a good or bad business if you had 3.5 million but lost 2.7 million?

Majority of those who sign up forums post nothing, the next biggest part leaves 1 post once. And total minority leaves more messages. I saw many forums and it is a regular situation which doesn't mark a problem by itself.",

I agree, you may have a point here. I would however like first another opinion whether all of those 2.7 M are indeed banned.An extreme example is satoshi, archived, but because it's inactive for too long. Maybe (I don't know, I just hope) that huge number of archived accounts also contains long-inactive ones (i.e. abandoned, not banned).If you're right, then indeed, a discussion on those numbers may also be relevant.Quote from: jokers10 on May 21, 2023, 12:37:56 PMthe next biggest part leaves 1 post once.

Newbies are reprimanded for not being very knowledgeable of forum issues, even though that's what's expected of newer members and if they do try to gain a bit of information before joining, they are suspected of being alts.• The merit system is also a barrier cause newer members see their time here to be unproductive as the bar for progress keeps getting higher, and the chances of your quality post being seen (outside certain boards) keeps dropping. There are fewer members sharing merits around these days. This issue could be helped with more merit sources being added to ensure quality posts gets rewarded.• DT oppression is relative and should not be much of an issue to newer members who have no reputation yet, except they planned to be scammers of trolls.",

DT members, merit system, moderation rules and bitcoin adoption has nothing to do with bitcointalk's popularity. This forum has the best rules, moderators, educated and professional users, etc but the problem is that forum has no clear goal, if any, and probably the owner has no motivation to do something with it, he just hosts it and that's all.This forum doesn't meet the average standard that people expect. It has an old and outdated user interface, features, doesn't have a mobile application, epochtalk is abandoned. I think it's pretty clear why this forum loses people and it makes me really sad because I recently discovered this amazing forum with amazing history and amazing community and I don't wat to see it vanish.",

I was new in here, it was not so easy to get merits and I decided too keep some smerits for the newbies like me to share.

Yeah, I have introduced a few persons to this forum and when they couldn't get merit for a few weeks after making some posts they all abandoned their account. This forum is for the patient, tolerant and meek. If you are not patient enough to wait and learn about the operations of Bitcoin and the forum but expect to get merit just like that after a few posts, you might get discouraged. Some people also think the forum is like another social media platform so they want to post uncontrollably. When they are cautioned, they become offended and leave. One of the people I brought to the forum was angry that his post was deleted. Anyone that is not willing to learn and improve will not last here. I have also observed that patience, tolerance, and meekness are gradually disappearing among my peers.But it will also be good to see more merits on other boards because newbies need time to learn about the technical or more complex parts of Bitcoin. They shouldn't be expected to post like others. These newcomers also need to be encouraged because they think that merits are only given to higher members.",

He had to temporarily quit his job which he had no intention of quitting. His health condition forced him to stop working, so I think until that time comes I think every user will stop using this forum regularly regardless of the reason.May we all be given health and longevity to always do activities here until our fingers have to give up to be used to type every letter on the keyboard.",

Simply making inquiries constructively and being consistent in replying to your thread responses is enough to get a merit for a newbie.",

      "body": "I think one thing that's decreasing the number of active participants, which can actually be linked to spamming, is that since every account that is being created with or without a post is being accounted for, most of the recorded accounts out of the 3 million or more might actually be accounts that are linked to Ban Invader, which in one way or another might actually also get banned. This might also be the reason for the ban account to record higher than active accounts.Most people actually lost interest in the forum because of intimidation and an unfriendly discussion environment. I can use myself as a living example. I created my account months ago without being active on it because of the fear of not getting banned or insulted by the superiors, but I came to realize that the forum was actually not the way I perceived it to be.Another reason I also assumed would be the cost of this is that people will create accounts that they don't have access to, and the limit on account creation based on location might actually tag the user with evil that he or she did not commit, which lots of people might not just pay for or have the idea that they could actually apply for a whitelist, which they will just continue trying till they get it right, which will increase the number of account creations on the forum.Quote from: UchihaSarada on May 21, 2023, 12:56:32 PMQuote from: Igebotz on May 21, 2023, 12:27:40 PMIs it a good or bad business if you had 3.5 million but lost 2.7 million? (From a business standpoint) and won't you be attempting to figure out why and what needs to be done?Bitcointalk is not a business.He never said Bitcointalk is an open business place, but it is. It's just an illustration that is used to describe the situation at hand on the forum",

      "body": "There had been a time when users made multiple accounts just to defraud giveaways and campaigns. Those farms of accounts were shut down by the actions of many members, you can assume every 1 person controlling 50 accounts, so that factors in a large number of account that could get shot down at once. They eventually come back as new users and new bitcoin addresses though.Eventually this came to be known as \"DT Oppression\" which would be normal because this forum is similar to a democracy. Although at this point of the DT system, I think users agree that it is much more decentralized.Sockpuppet accounts have been created for many reasons as well. To bump own threads, sale trash others, fake reviews etc.Ban button? No, bans done here are in majority of the cases justified.Quote from: skarais on May 21, 2023, 01:34:33 PMMay we all be given health and longevity to always do activities here until our fingers have to give up to be used to type every letter on the keyboard. Amen to that!I think if the KYC April Fool that theymos had used at one time became a reality, then the real number of users here would be much smaller.",

Most people preferred convenience from social media which forum can’t offer such as group chat which is popular now due to the rising popularity of shitcoins among newbs investors.Also the troll message is highly moderated here while most user in crypto interact that way. We categorized them as shit poster and set standards on posting which probably makes them leave. Wall Observer Thread is only free thread here which user can interact freely which shit post or trolls is allowed that will not gonna give a negative impact to reputation.In my humble opinion.",
