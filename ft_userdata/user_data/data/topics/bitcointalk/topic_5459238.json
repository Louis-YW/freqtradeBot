Only if all those lost bitcoins are made available for sale on exchanges, then they can effect the price. With growing demand of btc even if all 21m BTC are available for sell even then price can stay at current level or goes up. That said, it is nearly impossible to recover those lost bitcoins . Imagine someone has lots of BTC in his wallet and he forgets is recovery Passphrass Or he lost his hardware wallet, then in this and many other such situations, coins are lost for good.",

If they could be recovered then they would not be lost. However, answering your question would mean that the developers had done something to recirculate coins that havenâ€™t been touched in some time, resulting in a loss of faith in Bitcoin itself and causing the price to crash to nearly worthless.",

The loss of your Bitcoin wouldn't significantly impact the price, as it would be an insignificant amount in the grand scheme of things. Therefore, you shouldn't worry unless you manage to recover all the lost Bitcoin, which is unlikely. The price of Bitcoin is determined by its circulation and demand, not solely by its supply.",

Whether there will be lost bitcoins or not that will be up for sale and it's a huge volume. There will be for sure an effect to the price of Bitcoin. Not just that, there will be more force if the media is going to publish these sell offs as it's gonna put pressure to many retail holders.And from there, the news that's disseminated will impact to everyone that's also gonna feel bad about it. But let's take the reality of these lost bitcoins, they won't be called lost if they're not lost entirely. It's good that there's this take that these lost bitcoins are lost forever and instead of a drop that it will contribute, the value from each of those will be retained.",

There are a lot of factors that add up to the overall valuation of bitcoin, and available supply is one of them. Say for instance, the lost coins were to be found, would those owners want to let it go at the current price? Would they bring those coins into the market ready for sale? If not, then nothing changed, basically. They are still artificially limiting the available supply of bitcoin in the market by keeping those at their disposal.",

He said that lost Bitcoin should be considered a donation to the Bitcoin technology or network.For your question, it depends on the amount of Bitcoin that is being discovered. If it's a huge amount of Bitcoin that is being discovered and all is being placed on sale, then it definitely will fall the market a bit but not the Bitcoin network, after some months or a year, the market can still begin to recover again. Some months ago, there was a huge amount of Bitcoin discovered from a hacker; I can't remember the figure accurately, but I guess it was about 50,000 Bitcoin, and then the price of 1 Bitcoin was still trading below $30k, but look at Bitcoin today; the price is up again.Cheers ðŸ¥‚, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘º",

In terms of price, if they sell, it will affect the bitcoin price in the short term, but in the long run, it will have no effect. Supply affects the price of a coin, but it is not the only factor, most rely on demand for pricing. Look at ETH it has an unlimited supply, but its value is not small.",

Â Panic in the crowd is biggest effect. People who get access to old bitcoins that are considered as lost bitcoins will not be stupid to dump all their bitcoins in one sell order on the market. They will do it in OTC market, not at centralized market and will not do that in a single day.With whale alerts from on-chain trackers and quick speed of new circulation on social media, the crowd will feel very panic when they see massive amount of old bitcoins on the move from old address to new addresses or read speculation and fud that those old bitcoins will be dumped on market soon.If I own very old bitcoins and recovered my access to those bitcoins recently, I will do my research on how to sell those coins with less effects on market price as possible. It will help me to maximize my profit so I will spend time to think about selling strategy.",

But it is not wrong to assume that the scarcer the supply of bitcoins, the higher the price of bitcoin will increase, and if in case those lost bitcoins are recovered, it will definitely negatively affect the bitcoin price. But in my opinion, that effect is negligible in the long run as we still only have 21 million bitcoins for 8 billion people.

Let me correct you a bit, I think this lost coins are already in circulation since they are mined, they are actually part of the 19 million plus coins in circulation. So in logic the only way they say it makes others bitcoin slightly worth more is because it is not sold off and the only way a price is affected is when the coin is sold off, as more of it is sold off it would reduce the demand which will Also affect the price. So if a large amount of bitcoin is recovered today and the institution or investor decides to sell them off then would shake the price. This too will just be a temporary shake just like those that happens when a big exchange runs into problem and people start selling off their bitcoin. This price dump will only be for a short period because ones the buyers of these coins, save them up and hold on to them again, then they begin to go scarce again and the price will return to normal price",

But we need to recognize that Bitcoin's value proposition isn't based purely on its scarcity. It's also about its security, decentralized nature, and potential as a hedge against inflation. Being assertive here, I want to say that the wretched loss of Bitcoins is unfortunate, but not something we should celebrate. Lost Bitcoins don't \"donate\" to the network; they merely reduce the circulating supply. So, being skeptical about your theory, I'd say let's not cheer on these losses. Instead, let's use these incidents to remind ourselves of the importance of secure storage practices. After all, it's better to be melodramatically safe than to be painfully sorry.",
