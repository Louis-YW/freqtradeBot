  "content": "I came across this image below on a Whatsapp status and I had to screenshot because it got my attention because I saw how much punctuation really workedMost times, i don't punctuate my writings and when I do, I really don't do it well because i don't want someone reading my post with a different meaning from what I wrote.So I had to brought this issue to the forum as a wake up callÂ  for us to punctate our writings, as this will go a long way, for better understanding of our writings by others.N/B: I hold no right to the image and I got it from a Whatsapp status and aso tried searching for the original post to get the link to it but couldn't find it, so you guys should bear with me please.",

This forum is full of smart people so Iâ€™d say we donâ€™t see too many dumb people here but the internet is full of them.We have a saying in this part of the world that goes \"Who English help\"Â  to an extent it's true because of the lack of white collar jobs after school but the thing is being able to speak properly has an advantage too,Â  you might be opportuned to chair an occasion and bet me if you can't speak correctly when it comes to English u won't want to be given that position, so apart from the aspect of no job after school speaking correctly it's very important because you might be called upon in Church, meetings and any other social events and if you are not able to express yourself correctly then you won't be happy with yourself.",
