Most traders are losing. Just accept that, because it is the truth.I think your statement regarding trading is a little too bold. Indeed, trading can lead to capital loss, which is expected with any kind of investment or trading strategy. However, trading also provides great opportunities that can yield unrealistic results, depending on your trading style, in a few days, or you can go the safer route of choosing more trusted and established coins. As you've also briefly mentioned, it's certainly not suited for everyone. Personally, I'm way too anxious and can't stand the whole scenario; thus, I decided to stop after a while. Truth be told, I made a decent sum of money in a relatively short period of time.From my point of view, I believe that it's an experience that everyone should try at least once or twice and judge for themselves if it's worth it.",

How many years did you learn to trade and what are your successes now?What exchanges do you use for trading and do you have enough income not to work offline?",

I strongly advise anyone who is going through a terrible time in their life to learn to trade since it provides them a clear sense of purpose other than waiting for jobs. So, which is better, online or offline?Well, to be honest trading is far more dangerous than those offline jobs. If someone is not aware of the risks of the trading then that person can lose the full capital without any warnings. In spot trading most of the exchanges don't even warn the users even if their capital is 99% down. I remember the time when Terra Luna went down more than many 1000's of percent in value. People who were holding the coin at the time lost everything and their money went form 100's million into few thousand dollars. Trading and holding of crypto-currencies is a very risky thing and those who aren't aware of such risks would end up trading the coins that can go down anytime.Many people fall into the trap of pump and dump coins, those useless coins are pumped just to create greed in the minds of the traders and once a trader spots such unbelievable pumps they fall badly into such traps and end up loosing most of their portfolio. Aside form the risks., I also agree that a good trader can earn substantial income from trading. The skill is hard to master but once someone learns is very well then it can be a path to riches for the best traders. Someone live a happy life with the earnings that they generate through trading.",

So, which is better, online or offline? Trading has certainly its own advantages and disadvantages as well. Though it’s giving us a great income every time our trades became successful but always know that there is no guarantee that you’ll be making the same profits everyday. You’ll be trading and make significant profits today but maybe by tomorrow you’ll start losing them again slowly. So the risk of losing is still high most particularly if you’re a beginner trader that lacks knowledge and skills in trading. For me, trading is a good side hustle but it can never be reliable enough as your main source of income.",

Losses will be more visible than gains. So never trade if you have this state of mind.

So, which is better, online or offline?It is correct to say that crypto currency trading makes us to get acquainted with the reality of life. A good trader should know how to manage his emotions, also a good trader should be patient and should know how to handle failure. In as much as trading teaches us all these attributes and we use them in our daily endeavour, but the major purpose of venturing into crypto currency trading is not to test our emotions, our ability to withstand failure. Its sole purpose is to make money. Then, while making money, we can leverage on the other benefits that trading give to us to shaping our life. Coming back to the title of your article. It is not every online earning that is better than offline. There are some offline earnings that are very steady and reliable than online earnings.",

So, which is better, online or offline?On what source or proof you are making this statement? i am not objecting to your statement because it's totally legit and i totally agree with it, in fact, i recently wrote about the importance of BTC for youth, and how BTC made poor ones millionaires in less time. While those who work daily and work from 9 to 5 can not become millionaires as Traders can make. Because it provides us with the luxury of independence and sovereignty. We can earn while enjoying our life. We can think out of the box which we can't do in offline jobs because there is less room to grow. But still many intend to join that offline job life. Even sometimes i also thought it as a necessary part of my life. Why?Reason depends on many factors, like in my surroundings, most of the people focused on real work (offline work) (i am not saying it they say it). Even, they will not support you or encourage you to shift to this online work because they think of it as a time waste until you started to make money, they change their minds. But, i also agree on one point that if we have succeeded in any way of earning money and living our life, whether it is from online or offline sources, we have to grow and diversify our investment, Because, recently, there were 5 to 6 days internet breakdown in our whole country and we have faced hell lot of loss in IT sector, even the freelancers have faces hell lot of loss even the most famous freelancing platform Fiverr has disabled the GIGs for Pakistani which has left us jobless and helpless too. We can't do a thing we are all dependent on them. In these cases, physical work comes handy, you know you have a backup job to do which will make you enough money so that you don't have to worry anymore. This mindset will take you to the heights of mountains because Plan B is necessary with Plan A.",

They can make $1000 - $5000 every month depending on how central their business position is.But of course things like this can be compared from job to job and it also depends on who they are.
