  "content": "INTRODUCTION... in the ever-evolving landscape of Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, bitcoins stand tall as the pioneer that sparked a revolution. As the first Blockchain ever created. Bitcoin has not only given birth to countless other cryptocurrencies. but has also foundermentally changed the way we perceive and transact with money. in this view we delve into the world of Bitcoin exploring it's main feature, market value, dominance and it's profound importance in today world.DISCOVERY.... for me, 2021:marked a pivotal moment of introduction for me into the world of Blockchain technology and it's served as a gateway for as , it was the first ever Blockchain and cryptocurrency I interacted with and first owned ever since then it's been an all profitable experience so far.I have interacted with so many other Blockchains and protocols, like Ethereum, cadano, polygon matic, Arbitrium etc. However aimid this diverse landscape one Blockchain stood out as the bedrock of innovation. Bitcoin was not just a digital currency, it was a groundbreaking technology that introduced the concept of decentralization.MARKET VALUE AND DOMINANCE..... Bitcoin influence transcends it's technological innovation. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin boats the highest market capitalization among all cryptocurrencies, it's value is determined by factors such as scarcity, demand, institutional adoption,macroeconomics trends. Bitcoin market dominance, measures it's market share compared to other cryptocurrencies. Despite the proliferation of thousands of altcoins Bitcoin continue to maintain a significant portion of the total market.THE GLOBAL SIGNIFICANCE.... Bitcoin importance extends beyond the real of cryptocurrency. it's decentralized nature offers an alternative to traditional individuals with greater control over there asset's and fostering financial inclusivity.CONCLUSION......My view in the world of Blockchain technology stands as a testament to the power of innovation and decentralization. Bitcoin did not holds significant market value, but also serves as a symbol of a paradigm shift in the way we perceive and interact with money and technology. As we move forward, the influence of Bitcoin on global finance and beyond is understandable, shaping a future where decentralization and digital assets are integral components of our modern world.",

The best of all is that bitcoin can be used to overcome inflation because it serves as a store of value for investors and can be used beyond boarders without an intermediary. You have only discovered bitcoin 2021 and you haven't known much about bitcoin. Continue learning and you will enjoy to have known and invest in bitcoin. The financial freedom bitcoin brought to the world is what is making the government get scared of it because they know that it is a threat to their government since they will have limited power to control the citizens.",

You can see the dominance of BTC only is half of the overall crypto dominance and market cap of BTC is also more than all other ALTS. Then BTC do mean is the super man, Spiderman or any man or the king of ALTs. If BTC loss price then ALTs bleeds. BTC is everything for crypto future. Quote from: Sim_card on August 13, 2023, 11:09:58 AMThe financial freedom bitcoin brought to the world is what is making the government get scared of it because they know that it is a threat to their government since they will have limited power to control the citizens.I would suggest to not use rude words like threat to governments because this is not a atomic bomb it's just an alternative way of finance which provide more features and fast and secure one to transact your assets from one place to an other without giving your personal information to some central authority or getting into lines to get permits etc. Or you don't have to pay huge fee etc. Such things do impact the earnings of banks but not of governments directly but indirectly it does. This is the best way to explain things. That's why Governments are trying hard to provide such tokens that could have the factor of decentralization like ETFs but they could control them too. Dumb people will buy those (nothing personal just sharing views).",

Well, for me, I think the reason why Bitcoin is being given a pass while other altcoins are labeled as securities by the regulators is simply because, regulators have discovered that they have absolutely no power over Bitcoin since they they don't know who the founder or creator is, and they have no access to the code which keeps bitcoin running, so there is clearly nothing they can do aside banning bitcoin which is a not a good plan, as banning bitcoin still wont stop people from using or investing in bitcoin.But for the altcoins, they label altcoins as securities simply because they have some access to it, for example, even if an altcoin blockchain is decentralized, they still have access to that altcoin through the creator, whom they can easily go after if they want, i think this is why they seem to have abandoned bitcoin to face altcoins.",

Yes. it looks strange but true. and this is obvious. One thing is for sure, Bitcoin has a bright future and it is currently the most eye-catching, especially investors and financial institutions who have big collars because they have taken their time to look at the facts with an open mind and finally they are in awe of blockchain technology even though it is still there are also those who are skeptical Bitcoin is just a scam currency and that is normal due to lack of understanding.",

Yes, I totally agree with you, friend. For now no one will be able to ban bitcoin absolutely and significantly. Because the system that exists in bitcoin is indeed very well designed and difficult to stop. Even those who have authority, such as the government, cannot restrain and cannot completely ban the use of bitcoins. Maybe according to the rules and laws, in countries that prohibit bitcoin, it has been made and legalized. But still, bitcoin users are still annoying and cannot be stopped by these rules. Because basically, owning or investing in bitcoin is not too detrimental to the government, so bitcoin investors in countries that have a ban on bitcoin, continue to continue trading and investing. So at this point the governments in countries that reject bitcoin, will definitely be confused to find loopholes so they can stop the adoption of bitcoin which is growing day by day. That's why the act of controlling the market has become a new way for them, to at least put a brake on the continued adoption of bitcoin.And in conclusion, if bitcoin continues to survive, surely other cryptos will continue to exist and survive. But if bitcoin loses and disappears, surely the other cryptos will also fade and disappear. Because even though bitcoin and crypto(altcoin) have different systems, for example bitcoin is decentralized and crypto(altcoin) is not. But still, bitcoin is the heart of cryptocurrencies or the parent of cryptocurrencies.",

The notion that only Bitcoin can fend off regulators is, to put it mildly, absurd. There are numerous cryptocurrencies with thriving communities, cutting-edge technology, and practical uses. Do you really believe they'll surrender and admit defeat?I wanted to ignore your post initially because it seems we are not on the same planet and it's certain that what I say might be difficult for you to understand. Many like you live only in the present while a few people live both in the present and future. It shocked you right? It's a mystery and don't let us go there because you will never understand even if I explain from now till tomorrow.Let me go straight to the two points that called for my attention, and they are; the top-secret and crypto community is powerful to defend itself.Top-secret - It's not in the defence and national security alone. Also, as it's in politics where we only see the surface but the true reason for some actions will always be hidden while they pursue their agenda bit by bit, so is present in governance and regulations as well whether you agree or not.The crypto community is powerful to defend itself - As much as I want Bitcoin to remain forever, don't think many governments want that, the true decentralization of Bitcoin should tell you a lot of why they are not happy about it which also applies to many countries that still allow it. Now, if they are successful in separating it from other cryptocurrencies, which crypto community will defend it? It will by then be the Bitcoin community defending itself. It would have been thinner by then which is what the regulator want. Always remember that what government could appreciate in cryptocurrency is blockchain technology and not decentralization. As you know, many cryptos are no more decentralized even if they preach such to you, that's regulation working underneath, it's those cryptos they would prefer then, and if they are successful in splitting Bitcoin from crypto, I see more issues coming, it will be easier for them to perpetrate their evil.Mind you, the government's power can't be compared to the Bitcoin community as you wrongly believe, it's more. If top nations agree and start clamping down today, it will be almost total. Imagine no domain hosting anything BTC, no exchange could associate with it, and OS bringing down any app related to it. What do you think would happen?My conclusion remains that, if possible, it's better to stop the government now or not support them from separating Bitcoin from other cryptos for any reason. People think the regulator is doing Bitcoin good, but in the end, they will realise that the government is for no good intentions.",

It is any supply like the premined coins that never enter circulation or any coin that the centralized authority of a centralized altcoin can print out of thin air at any moment if they wish to without releasing them to the public.So when we talk about market cap, it makes sense for bitcoin because the bitcoin supply is all real and was entered into circulation as the reward for the work that was done by miners. However when you are talking about it in a comparing scenario and you get altcoins involved things start falling apart. For example the altcoin with the biggest market cap has 72 million premine and at this point it is being printed out of thin air artificially inflating its market cap.QuoteBitcoin market dominance, measures it's market share compared to other cryptocurrencies.With the above explanation you can understand how what you are referring to as \"dominance\" is a falsehood and is actually market cap ratio or a battle of supplies.",
