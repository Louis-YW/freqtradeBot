  "content": "Remember Remember the 5th November for freedom of speech is not free!!DragonX will be the world's first Zcash Protocol coin using RandomX an ASICS resistant Proof-of-Work and will be launched as a Hush Smart Chain (HSC).Unlike ZCash it will have privacy by default (z2z transactions only) with an additional Monero like layer of obfuscation pioneered by Hush called Sietch giving DragonX one of the fastest growing anonymity sets available. Not only is it the most secure  messaging with Signal Protocol-inspired encryption but also linkability is nonexistent since shielded Z addresses are used instead of phone numbers or email addresses.The 36 second block time also makes it the fastest message available using shielded transactions. The messaging feature built in, is based on HushChat https://git.hush.is/hush/hushchat\"        There is no Premine.There in no Dev Tax.There is no Tail Emissions.Emission Schedule Inspired by Bitcoin with a faster block time but nearly identical output.36 second block time. 3 coins per block.Halving at 3.5 million blocks. (Roughly 4 years between halvings)Total supply 21,000,000Mining will be Solo Mine until pool's are established.  This is a fair launch!Mining to start November 5th 2022https://git.hush.is/dragonxhttps://git.hush.is/hush/hush-smart-chainshttps://t.me/+buXjVDFKJk05OTg5",
