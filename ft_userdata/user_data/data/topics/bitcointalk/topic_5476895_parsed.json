  "content": "But the performance is known, albeit for the whole node: from 256 GFLOPS to 1 TFLOPS. Here, unfortunately, the details are again unknown, so it is unclear for which mode the performance is indicated, but even if it is FP64, the figure is quite modest, since modern monsters Nvidia and AMD offer 50-60 TFLOPS or more.At the same time, Loongsonâ€™s solution is a GPGPU, that is, it supports general-purpose computing. Unfortunately, there are no details here yet.Separately, we can recall that Loongson promised next year to release a video card that can compete with the Radeon RX 550 , whose performance (FP32) is just over 1.1 TFLOPS. It is possible that the LG200 will be a direct relative of this adapter.https://phonemantra.com/loongson-introduced-lg200-ai-accelerator/Soon we will mine on Chinese GPUs",
