      "body": "deflationary assets value trend upwards to hedge against an inflationary assets loss of value that goes downwardsvalue: how many loaves of bread can you buy with X value. deflationary increases more loaf bread amounts. inflation decreases loaf bread amountshowever. timing is crucialif you buy a deflationary asset when its own market is at a premium (bubble/ATH) then the 'lock in' of value is lessEG say bitcoins true deflation value is $10k in 2021(it was by the way)and the market price was $70k when you bought bitcoinyou are only locking in 1/7th of your wealth.~14% and having ~86% 6/7ths at risk of loss..however 2022 store of value is about $15k this year. (thanks to deflation)so buying in at $16.5k means your wealth has a deflationary hedge lock in of value of 90%..this is important because waiting for the store of value to rise to $16.5 is sooner than waiting for store of value to reach $70kyes forget the market price. and understand the market price is the PREMIUM above value.it will take a while for the VALUE (below market) to raise up to sustain and protect $70k fullso remember. its important to BUY LOW, to lock in more of your wealth so your not risking losses whilst waiting for the value to increase to cover whatever premium you bought in atin a real estate market where the market prices are bubbling.. smart investors buy plots of land in area where comps are Xrate. where they can buy square metre land cheaper and then build to net a finished home thats below the X rate compsthey also buy run-down/fixer-uppers below X rate of local comps to \"buy low\"never buy a house at its premium, else your waiting alot longer for the value (below market) to increase to match your initial perchase and ongoing costs....for me. buying bitcoin is just that. buying and hoarding. no ongoing costs. i just write my paperwalet key on paper. and move on with life. no need to have ongoing electric/computational costs for me personally to maintain my valuehowever real estate does come with ongoing costs of maintenance after purchase. which means you endlessly adding to the initial costs. waiting for the markets to outpace that costbase to then profit.in short. bitcoin if you are smart to buy low. can see gains faster. and have a better hedge protection",

If this sector starts to make an impact, then other sectors will follow.QuoteParts and components are declining in supply, due to restrictions imposed by the recent USA vs china trade war.China will always be a competitor to any country, because they are able to control the industrial and economic sectors, although sometimes the quality of the products they produce is far different from the quality of products from the United States. That's why this sector has contributed to China's success in building stronger industrial and economic power, so that the strength of this country is increasingly taken into account by the world.QuoteGuns and ammunition supplies could decline due to newly introduced gun regulation, lawsuits and restrictions.This sector is still quite controlled by several countries, such as the United States which is a strong superpower in the field of weapons and technology, so that it becomes the largest contributor and exporter in this sector.QuoteWater shortages are becoming a bigger issue globally, due to drought and a number of other factors. The relationship between water availability is also inseparable from the area of the agricultural sector, both of which have the same function in meeting human needs, but if nature begins to be damaged, wood is cut down and forests are used for development, then the availability of water is quite influential and there will be a drought that will make people loss of clean water.Quote from: Hydrogen on December 16, 2022, 10:30:44 PMWhile it is unfortunate that many of these negative trends are contributing towards overall reductions in standard of living for people across the globe.Personally, I pay more attention to the agricultural sector, because this sector is the most decisive for the sustainability of human life.1. The occurrence of war \"Eating is a need that must be met\".2. Natural Disasters \" Food is also urgently needed\".3. Recession and Inflation cannot be separated from the power to fulfill increasingly scarce food, causing uncontrolled increase in food prices.",

It is necessary also to consider the technology advances which could contribute to the supply of those commodities.A recent example would be the development of the hydraulic fracture for the extraction of oil and gas, I recall that in the beginning of the deployment of the technology the oil prices decreased because of the increase of supply in the USA, some oil wells became economically exploitable.Water and food are also under the influence of technology, the agriculture yield tends to increase by the use of fertilizers and other more advanced technologies like genetically modified crops. Water can the filter, purified and recovered. Keep in mind that fossil fuels are expected to compete against green energy, if somehow major industrialized countries managed to replace a good percentage of their oil importation, the price would drop regardless of the limited reserves.",

There is always a conflict around the world that will require new armaments and other military supply. And even if we could end all the conflicts in the world, countries would never give up their military. Also any major war like we have seen this year is going to increases the budget countries will allocate to the military.Water seems like the one trend that should keep going upward in my opinion. Every human needs at least 1-2l of fresh water every day and there a few factors that will reduce supply and increase demand. First of all, the world population is constantly increasing which means that we will also need more fresh water every year. Then we have the effect of global warming which increases the occurrence of natural disasters. Whenever a big disaster happens there is a huge demand for water as most local wells will be polluted and not useable. That is why I would consider investing in companies that sell water directly, or in companies that offer filter systems to purify contaminated water.",

They are going to vanish and ther wouldn’t be anything left to dig out of the earth. In short its an asset which will become zero for sure. Now some of you might just say that there is still plenty of resources for our generations to come. However, those plenty of resources are so abundant now that you will use more energy to dig it out rather than making it viable asset for investment. I think we should understand it’s not investment option, it’s just last resort burning fuel and nothing more. With more purer energies getting researched I think fossils got least shot at it.",
