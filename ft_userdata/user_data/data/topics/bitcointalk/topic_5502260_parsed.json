However, a judge ruled in March that there was overwhelming evidence that Wright is not actually Satoshi nor is he the author of the Bitcoin (BTC) white paper, the original thesis behind the digital asset.Wright had sued McCormack, host of the What Bitcoin Did podcast, for libel after he called Wright a “fraud” when challenging the computer scientist’s claim that he was the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.That's it guys, he's done. BSV is also finished.",

He is the reason why Bitcoin.org had to remove Bitcoin Whitepaper for UK people, he abused the court's process for so many years. He is a fraudster who wanted to gain access to Satoshi's Bitcoin by getting approval from a judge and forcing Bitcoin Core developers to help him reclaim those million Bitcoins.I hope not only his assets gets frozen but every asset that he held and moved on relative's names would get frozen too because it's cheating that people like him often do.

Craig had enormous wealth and he delayed what's coming for him for a very long time. Some people though, probably deserved it for supporting BSV but I don't think all BSV supporters were lunatics like Craig. Some of them were probably just innocent fools. BSV has $721 million market cap at the moment. (bsv price: $36) Soon it will be much lower. It is as good as dead. BCH played this smarter than BSV. At least it is above LTC in terms of market cap at the moment.",

There's no doubt he is wealthy, even if he is only a millionaire and not a billionaire as he alleges. Still think about, imagine deciding to sue others for defamation and try and destroy them in legal fees to claim that you are the creator of something you didn't make? Is it really still all just for money? The dude must have mental health issues to even do something like this.",

Just recently, COPA won a case against Craig, with a UK court deciding that he isn't Satoshi.This asset freezing case isn't a major one, as it is just to get the legal fees out of him for another court case, but it became possible thanks to the former UK court's decision against Wright. What's lovely is that the legal system in the UK is that of precedent law, so it will be harder for the next Faketoshi to conduct similar activities.",

If, I am correct with the news I am following about him. The first time was in March after a court battle where he claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. However, the judge didn't believe him and ordered him to pay much. I am not certain about it, but it was a big! To ensure that he pays, the court froze some of his cash. Then, his assets were frozen again in July due to a separate lawsuit. A podcaster he sued for defamation is concerned that Wright may be unable to cover legal fees if he loses, so the court put a hold on his assets again. Essentially, these freezes are like putting a lock on his wallet until these court cases are resolved.",
