  "content": "Despite the fact that Bitcoin since it's invention has made young billionaires, made transaction fast and change the lives of many who grabbed the opportunity investing at it's early stage, there are still some out there who can't afford at least one square meal a day, which is unfortunate as these people could be found around us in our various communities/cities all around the world. Because I have seen a lot of threads emphasing about \"educating people about Bitcoin\" but never did I find any going an extra mind on checking or touching the lives of the people they have educated, because of what benefit will it be trying to educate hungry people who can't afford at least one square meal a day? Or are you trying to say we should exclude these people simply because they are poor? No no no... Because I think both the poor & rich deserves the right to know about Bitcoin, because nobody knows tomorrow, as a person's condition in life is never always permanent, of which Satoshi will be very proud of this very act of kindness.And that's why in this new thread of mine, I decided to take another dimension by offering aides to the less privilege and most especially the poor kids in my community, to put smiles on there faces by offering a Bitcoin t-shirt and a catton of Indomie Noddles worth $19 each to any random poor kids I happen to come across on the streets in my community.So let's ride on as I explain in detail how I was able to make this little act of kindness successful by touching the lives of these poor kids with all my 3 weeks campaign BTC.Actually, WinTomato was my very first campaign as a Full Member on this forum, of which we were been paid $25/wk, and I always had in mind to sow seed with my very first campaign payment, of which the idea of \"touching lives\" came into my mind, and since my first payment wasn't enough, I had to wait longer working on my plans till this very moment that it has been made a success.AIMS & OBJECTIVESThe aims & objective of this thread were as follows;1. Touching lives:I decided to touch the lives of these poor kids because looking at the current economic situation in my country, I knew that there were people out there who needed this BTC more than me, and however, it was actually my first signature payment, so I used it to sow seed into their lives.2. Promote Bitcoin: ¬†In other for me to promote Bitcoin in my little way, since it is ban in my country, I decided to use these kids who are below the legal age to help facilitate my promotion by offering them a t-shirt with a Bitcoin phrase written on it, such as Bitcoin is real, Bitcoin is not a scam, Bitcoin has come to stay and Bitcoin is a digital currency. (You can have a look at the t-shirts below).Below are the Bitcoin t-shirt 1. 2.3.4.What I actually did was that ¬†I bought 4 white plain t-shirt and gave it to an artist who wrote those Bitcoin related phrases as you can see above (Bitcoin is real, Bitcoin is not a scam, Bitcoin has come to stay & Bitcoin is a digital currency) which cost me $9 each for the t-shirt and artist fee. And after that, what I did was to ¬†buy 4 catton of Indomie Noddles (One of Nigerian favorite Noddles and breakfast meal) worth $10 each to be given to any random poor kids I happen to come across on the streets, which you can see all the pictures below.Below are the moment when I gave the Bitcoin t-shirt and catton of Indomie Noddles to poor random kids 1.2. 3. 4. MY POSSIBLE FINDINGS1. I was able to find out that many people out there in the society are suffering, and you don't have to be a Sr. Hero or Legendary Member of this forum to be able to touch someone's life with the little campaign money earn from this forum in our own little way, because it's simply an act of kindness and an act of kindness always get a ¬†bountiful reward.2. I was able to find out that thou Bitcoin is banned in my country, there was a way I could subconsciously promote Bitcoin into the minds of people in the society, which was by designing a Bitcoin t-shirt and given to kids so that when they wear these t-shirts and walk on the streets in the community they will subconsciously promote in the minds of people that Bitcoin is real, is not a scam, has come to stay and is a digital currency.CONCLUSION:In conclusion, you actually need to see how happy these 4 kids who I gave the Bitcoin t-shirt and catton of Indomie Noddles, and I too was also happy, for being able to touch their lives through the use of my campaign BTC. And how I wish I could touch more lives, but that was all my rank and campaign payment could afford, and I am so much grateful to WinTomato signature campaign for making this a success..So I have just done mine, and now is your turn.. let us touch lives with be our Bitcoin and I'm sure Satoshi will be proud of you. Thanks üôè",

Although it doesn't seem like much, people who are at the bottom of society appreciate such gestures much more than those who live in relatively good conditions and receive expensive gifts.I try to help people who are in need in my local community, but also through some international humanitarian projects that I know really make a difference when it comes to children and what they need in life, namely food and education. One of the best projects that I personally support is Mary‚Äôs Meals which currently provides around 2.3 million meals a day for school children in various parts of the world. A donation of just $19 provides food for 1 child for the entire school year.",

Basically i would point out to you about Bitcoin not banQuote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on August 19, 2022, 08:06:18 AM2. since it is ban in my countryIt is not ban but rather restricted us from associating our local account with bitcoin transaction, there are some shopping mall that accepts bitcoin including gas station in the country so if it was ban there wouldn't have been a way for them to be accepting bitcoin.Secondly i must commend on your love for kids. It is a thing of joy help out kids by the street this serves as means of reducing criminality and hunger among kids growing in hard country most especially Nigeria.Thank you for love.",

And if you, OP, bring those smiles to them, they will definitely come back to you in the future. The only person who is never guilty of being poor is a child. Giving them a good mood, giving them direction that the world is not so cruel and there are ways to change their future, will be a good motivation for these children, and maybe those around them. I have great respect for these people, and I understand how many difficulties they have to overcome. And I really hope that the knowledge of bitcoin and the possibility of using it will somehow improve the lives of these people, and indeed of any people who are currently praying not only for their wealth but about how to let their children survive.",

At least the carton of Indomie can sustain them for one week and the T-shirt will advertise Bitcoin for the community. But according to a saying, \"I will not give you fish but I will teach you how to fish\". Now those children you gave the indomie are still in poverty but if you would have teach them and give them devices to use bitcoin then you would have helped their families. Although you helped them but for temporal, probably one week. Please also teach them how to fish...",

It is a good ting that you have done and you will be surprised how far this your little act of kindness will go. I like the fact that you made some branded t-shirts as well, that will contribute greatly to the awareness about bitcoins and far outlive the carton of noodles which is still great. keep up the good work.",

And by now I'm not surprised that this project is in Nigeria because, at least from this forum, it seems that Nigeria has many amazing people who want to boost their country's economy in responsible and meaningful ways by promoting Bitcoin and engaging with local communities. The kind of passion I see from the posts about Nigeria is unparalleled. I believe that eventually, all this strength of the people willing to work on making their country a much better place will become way more known, and Nigeria might even become an example to many others.
