Just use through your Telegram app this notifier bot \"The BitcoinTalk SuperNotifier\" by @TryNinja and activate the topic that you want to track and give notification, the link of the thread given above, that thread is very active regarding the signature campaign that will be posted. However, it's far different from the bounty campaign which you will not be notified when someone posted a new campaign thread.But Bitcointalk has a feature to notify your account when someone created a new topic, just click above the button \"notify\".",

After all, there might be not so popular campaign managers out there who suddenly come out of nowhere with a new signature campaign or bounty. Also, there are campaigns that are managed by members of the team. So if you are looking for a new signature campaign or bounty projects, you might missed a lot by limiting your choices to several campaign managers.",

The problem is that anyone can be a manager, and that there are no standards that everyone should respect, and that is why we have so many problems with failed projects that leave unpaid participants and a bunch of spam that remains on the forum.I have been on the forum since mid-2015 and I do not remember that in some so-called bad times there were problems with the lack of good sig campaigns for members who are considered active and recognizable members of the forum.",

Any Rules for Bounty Manager? he didn't pay his signature participants after working for 6 weeks and his excuse because less of legit participants. I'm also surprised by this assortment of managers. Someone simply leads a bounty and someone solely by the company's signature.But the fact that Murat got on this list only means that the OP is completely indifferent to participating, and it doesn't matter that one day he will not be paid. Quantity exceeds quality.It's odd that the OP missed out on a few managers whose company signatures are by far the highest-paid.Not his level?",

Sometimes you can see them replying to threads like casual users, what I mean with 'casual' is those that are not managers of any campaign.Better just go on the Services/Bounty Board or on: Overview of Bitcointalk Signature-Ad Campaigns.",

It is easy to also use this method to see the signature campaigns on this forum but I use it to track new campaigns as I am not new to this forum anymore. For altcoins, according to this thread topic, a littler way to find good campaigns, I see bounties as poor campaigns that does not worth my time.",

I wouldn't tie myself to this list either. The OP there basically promotes his website, which otherwise deals with promoting bounty campaigns, it is all completely legitimate. but what I‚Äôve seen from his last several posts, where he presents a new bounty, most of them are from the rise manager. I can't say for him that he and his campaigns are good or bad, I never cooperated with him, but since the list, you have given is rather biased, it cannot be considered relevant.",
