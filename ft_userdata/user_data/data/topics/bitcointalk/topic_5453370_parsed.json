Yes even though I obtained my funds I am still recommending AGAINST Rollbit because of their shady practices that I’ve seen reported. I believe anyone that has a withdraw being withheld against them would form some sort of “paranoia” as you liked to call it but it really isn’t fun to experience.",

This is exactly my purpose of this post. No one cares unless I wasn't actually able to retrieve my funds. Yea I was fortunate enough to get them back but clearly with similar post Rollbit indulges in shady practices that I never knew about until it almost happened to myself. For others it is not as easy and simple as it was for me. People with way more funds than I had stuck had theirs completely ripped from them. It wasnt as quick as just contacting support either. I stated this whole process took a little over 2 hours with no update or reason besides \"standard procedures\" which makes no sense. I've gambled on numerous sites and have never ran across this situation. I'm not trying to attack Rollbit I'm just suggesting people do their research or atleast have other peoples history with them so they don't end up with a situation like mine or others for example.",

I'm sure some people here would actually appreciate me posting my experience with the site for future knowledge. With those 2 hours I had of not receiving my funding I was able to decide that I never want to play on Rollbit again with the amount of issues other users are facing. Hopefully this can maybe prevent other people from having to go through those situations.",

Let me note thats my deposits and withdrawals were in SOL so they theoretically should've been instant (all of them were except this last one) which is why I knew something was up right away. The reason I'm saying 2 hours was a little crazy was because take for instance someone like me that's never ran into and issue with deposits/withdrawals and suddenly am met with the only option being contact support. When contacted support their only response is \"normal procedures\" now what took 2 hours for them to clear my money? The first thing I searched was Rollbit holding funds and I'm met with tons of post on this forum and people having similar situations. Also I wasn't solely relying on this withdrawal but thousands of dollars is still thousands of dollars I'm sure anyone would've been upset.",

      "body": "Hey there, Rollbit handles thousands of withdrawals each day, the majority of which go out almost instantly with only a small amount of these requiring a manual review This manual review requires a higher member of staff to manually process the withdrawal. In my personal experience this can take between a few minutes to a few hours and depends as to when the relevant team member can get to the users case. Sometimes withdrawals may also require an external review, requested by the provider eg; PragmaticPlay or Evolution. For these cases, withdrawals may take a slightly longer period of time however as soon as we receive an update and everything is clarified, Rollbit would be able to process the withdrawal. Good to hear you received your withdrawal, just wanted to clear up any concerns!",

      "body": "I am not sure I understand you correctly, because I am sure I read your situation wrongly, I read it as follows:You signed up and played on rollbit for three days, made multiple deposits and withdrawal within that relatively short time span, all successful, and at one point on that third day, your supposed-to-be instant withdrawal because it's in SOL got delayed for two hours, two, with a message telling you to contact support, of which they replied that it is normal and asked you to wait, and they delivered exactly that, namely after two hours, it went through.Despite the multiple withdrawal in short time span etc., they didn't ask you for KYC or anything, they only asked you to wait, and not for days or even 24 hours. Two hours, as in one, two. And when it went through, you decided that you want to create an account on this forum to warn people to not playing on that platform? Who delivered their words?I am sure I understand all or at least some of those points wrongly, as your thread is the antithesis of a scam accusation.They promised you that everything is alright, asked you to wait, and it happened exactly like that. If you've been playing for years, you'll came to an understanding that two hours delay is a simple issue, if not a non-issue. I can't see why you feel the urge to create an account and warn people just because they made you wait for two hours. If I may be an ass --which already on my personal text, by the way, so I spare you from the need to point it out at me-- I can only think of two possibilities. One, you're an alt of someone who currently have an issue with rollbit and tried to stir the pot even further with an non-existent issue. Two, and I pray to anything divine that it is wrong, you're a special kind of... human who happens to be on Astaroth's speed dial because you two are BFF.Purely curious if you have ever bought something online. Seeing that the goods' status is being delivered but you need two days for it to arrive in your hand must be... tormenting.",
