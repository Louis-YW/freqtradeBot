Either they will join NATO or show clear support to Russia just like Belarus did. Otherwise surviving in Europe without taking any proper side is going to be a difficult task in coming decades no matter how much diplomacy you try to do, atleast until Putin is in power.",

Quite symbolic.https://tvpworld.com/61432874/president-duda-signs-sweden-and-finlands-accession-to-natoThe idiocy of the Russian leadership and \"concepts\" has given rise to many \"shots in the knee.\" Among them is the extremely fast decision on the accession of Sweden and Finland to the WTO. At the same time, if Finland was a vacillating country, then, as you know, Sweden occupied an openly neutral and non-bloc policy! But the \"great politician\" Putin did something that NATO leaders could not do - in fact, he pushed him out of NATO  Although he moaned and squealed that the THEORETICAL entry of Ukraine into NATO would be a terrible tragedy for Russia. Now NATO will be EVEN CLOSER, and its total power in Europe will increase by many tens of thousands of troops, a huge number of weapons and, of course, a real expansion of the area of ​​​​NATO countries around the borders of the Russian Federation.\"It's easy to be an idiot - just repeat everything after Putin\"",

Trump will win in 2024 and denazify the US, thereby making NATO to be of little significance.",
