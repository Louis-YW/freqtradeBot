I would treat my investment as just something I threw away in my backyard and forgot 3 years later that it grew without my knowledge, it would lessen my expectation and would avoid triggering my desperation (like you mentioned) to just gain a cent of a profit within seconds. I can even recall coping up with my losses wherein I was keeping on refreshing BTC to USD chart in CMC.",

If a beginner reasons to make crypto as a source of income,  then such person will be full of expectations,  so desperate to make profit all time.The answer depends on what kind of job it is. \"Crypto as a source of income\" is a very broad term that can include all different kinds of work depending on what you can do. Crypto is an exciting field to be in, and something we predict will continue to grow in the coming years. The technology is developing fast, and I expect that more jobs will be popping up surrounding it as people realize just how important this field is to the future of many industries. For example, if you have programming or other technical skills, there are plenty of websites where you can find short-term jobs working on cryptocurrency projects. Or if you have a service that other people are willing to pay for, then it might be worth starting your own business and reaching out directly to those customers (and charge for it directly in crypto). All we're saying is that you should consider crypto-related business beyond just trading. In the end, there are many different kinds of jobs out there, both in and outside the world of crypto. You just need to find one that's right for you.",

Because if you are thinking OP that it was not a good time to start but for me, I'd see this bear season as the perfect time to do it. If you are investing in Bitcoin now, you are making your way to earn more in the future. Maybe that is the only best option we can do but, of course, you are right in talking about it not relying on this as a single source of income because we know the risk and it takes time to earn profit. Beginners will just focus on learning crypto first - investing/trading until they are ready to face the possible consequences.",

I never doubted that fact but, I asked a question and she wasn't able to answer me, it was: what y'all trading? she began to mix up points and I blocked those mails ASAP.

That's best for starters, although it will prove to be the best for veterans as well. But they will have to realize that sooner or later because, as beginners, they are usually curious and very eager. There are just so many things to try and venture on. But pending enough research and knowledge, they could quench their eagerness by buying Bitcoin and HODLing them. Of course, they also need to know the basics of purchasing and storing their first Bitcoin. This is more or less enough to keep them safe.",

No matter how harsh or amusing it may sound, many of us have made the mistakes you describe. Sometimes it is useful to learn everything on your own, albeit from bitter experiences. Having made a mistake once, we have a signal that shows us a red flag of danger.I remember all these enticing videos from YouTube where supposedly successful people, talk about themselves, and call for investments in various crypto projects. \"I did it, and you can,\" and all that blah blah, has a very strong effect on the psyche of desperate people who urgently need money. It exists even now. And there's a good policy here on the forum to warn newcomers not to trust hysterics, but we can't warn everyone.

You really should know as much about whatever it is that you are getting into; otherwise, it can be disastrous! However, there is no such thing as ever really knowing everything. You don't have to know everything from the beginning; the key is identifying what you should learn and what you can ignore.It would be absolutely insane for me to try and say that I know all there is to know about what I am doing. I don't. I don't know everything about marketing, I don't know everything about design, and I sure as hell don't know everything about entrepreneurship. But I know enough to get by, which is all you can ever ask for. Be realistic with yourself, but most importantly - don't make excuses. If you're committed to doing something, do it right or don't even bother. It's just that simple.If you do your homework, it can be an incredibly rewarding experience. You'll have the advantage over other people in your industry and you'll know exactly what you are doing when it comes time to make decisions.",

Most social media platforms or forums focuses on the profit side of it and that's what has actually lured people into. People coming to it still sees at as somewhat an investment where everything pumps that's why the rate of bitcoin adoption increased around 2017-2019. Because it was the period where early adopters got large profit so those coming do not know the patience it took before the pump and thought it was all smooth. If you try to warn them off it by telling to gain its knowledge they feel its time wasting and the opportunity wouldn't arrive anymore. That's why as the number shitcoins increases more people still go ahead to invest in them. Its all greed and that's one area that is hard to eliminate from humans",
