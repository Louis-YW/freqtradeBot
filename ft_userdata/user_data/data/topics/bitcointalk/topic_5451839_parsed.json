Why read books, skydive, play games, meet others, when you can put your savings into a shitcoin with a capitalization of nearly $ 1 billion. $ 1 billion for a meme...

Look at the same GLMR. They initially set a high price, and now they have been selling for several years. You need to be able to understand tokinomics.
