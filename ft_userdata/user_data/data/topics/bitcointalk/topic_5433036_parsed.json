Generally most people tip at the end of the service. Those words stayed with me. It’s a new year, while most of the businesses usually give gifts at the end of the year. I thought it would be cool to start the new year bearing gifts. As I recently started accepting bitcoin payments, I figured it would be cool to customize to give them a constant reminder of bitcoin. I bought 50 water bottles, had my business name printed on one side and on the other side a customize “hodl” with bitcoin logo. I do this with hope that this gesture will fast track the bitcoin experience for them and also create value for my business.",

I was looking at CNC laser cut business cards and wedding invitations awhile ago. Some are very intricate and beautiful with elaborate scrollwork and filligree. They are also somewhat low cost to produce considering they only require paper and electricity at the low end. With the power consumption of some solid state CNC lasers used for engraving purposes being 10 watts or lower. It is possible that is a decent option for producing business cards and promotional material.Google search, something like: CNC laser business cardI wonder if anyone 3d prints business cards, keychains or other random items to promote their business? Could it be cost effective and feasible to do so?",

Many of them must be curious on why it's written \"HODL\" on the bottle of water, but they must know it's something related to Bitcoin, because that logo is well known worldwide already.The \"HODL\" slogan is a good start point to introduce new adopters to bitcoin, because it basically tells everything they have to do as adopters: to hold bitcoin for the future, so they will be caring for their money against the depreciation of the local fiat currency.",

I remember your first story on how you have begun accepting BTC payment in your beauty shop, it is great you are giving us a follow up on how things are going after BTC's inclusion as a payment option in your shop. Those water bottles look beautiful, and i am sure most of your customers would want one for themselves even without paying you in BTC, while it is up to you on how you wanna give it out, you could make it an incentive for people who pay with BTC.You haven't told us how many people have been interested in paying you with BTC so far, what is the awareness like for now. Lastly, you might have to do some explaining on what \"HODL\" means, it would seem senseless to people who aren't Bitcoiners  .",

The bold print will raise some curiosity and questions from the people who are still completely ignorant about bitcoins, they may think that the printer made a mistake in the spelling of \"hodl\" which some may believe should be \"hold\". In trying to debate and find out why it is spelt that way, many people will get to understand.Nice idea, proud and happy that you have thought about this sort of promotion since I also manage a branding/printing company and know how effective in promotion and powerful branded items can be.",

People give sentimental value to gifts, it’s a thing over here. I still have at home souvenirs from weddings and birthday parties that I really don’t need, I don’t get rid of them because I subconsciously have placed a sentimental value on them.
