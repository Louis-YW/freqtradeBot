  "content": "Happy new year friends, it's been a good start of another year, while we are distracted by many problems about the market; hacks, bankrupcy etc, we forget about the fun the community had in the early years of this decentralized currency. It seems to me that there are lesser fun facts of bitcoin in this era compared to the early days of bitcoin. Though they is no source to the claim that a man, 12 years ago, offered to change his name to bitcoin for 2000btc, it's just quite too funny and reveals how people made fun out of bitcoin; they had happy memories of bitcoin. Unlike today where people are surrounded with sad news about bitcoin and it's not just fun anymore, thinking about the Pizza day and the hodl thread those were some good moments. However, I'm not saying we are not making progress, yes we are, but then it's quite a difficult journey without fun. I'd ask, 12 years ago 2000btc was nothing compared to now, would you do such a thing? Hence many users on twitter accepted that they can change their name to bitcoin for such amount",

If you ask about that amount compared to today, probably people will say no but back then 12 years ago, people probably thought that the BTC price will not reach this at the same time. I will probably do the same as others like Laszlo and this man, it is awareness to other people that now BTC becomes successful.",

Changing the name is no more a big thing, in my country people are much used to it. 2000BTC isn't a small number.Once after the purchase of pizza with bitcoin, things started to change. This change have now made an evolution in the financial system. More to happen in the falling days as bitcoin is getting legalized in different countries around the world.",

Back then you could have made 2000 BTC telling jokes on this forum… It’s this sort of value transformation that makes Bitcoin an absolutely horrible method of valuation over time. Makes sense. Some people would say they're down for it simply because it is the present. Before there were even people trading huge amount of Bitcoins for a pizza, that was how bad the situation of this industry way back years ago. So I guess I won't do such thing as well. It is just the fact that we saw already how high the market price could be at the present which is why mny of us are backtracking the possibility of investing before in relation with regrets. But in reality you'll never know unless you were on the situation. Perhaps something promising as well. The present's Bitcoin price vs the future. Since we know there is a tendency for its price to double or more in the future, why are we not buying huge amount of it (except for being incapable)? same thing was with before.",

Changing your name won't be so important, life now matters how much money you have and how your life compares to others.

Bitcoin with its magic had many peeps to use it and trade it just for \"fun\".This tweet, its interesting and has just added another funny incidence in my memory about the bitcoin.  Yes, I would do it now but may be I would have thought hundred times doing it back then. lol",

I find it funny when many people say 1BTC = 1BTC, but meanwhile they wait for bitcoin to drop in price to buy them instead of buying at high prices, and they say they don't care about the USD value of bitcoin.If I'm getting you right, I think you are saying it wrongly. 1btc is 1btc, and nothing would change it except the people who wish to amend product prices to suit the current evaluation of 1btc. It's like saying; 100 dollars is no longer 100 dollars because it can't buy as many groceries as it did years back. These are just market changes that have no meaning to the status of the currency. If one bitcoin is worth 60k today, you won't expect 1btc not to purchase a product of 60k because 1btc was 16k yesterday. That is why product managers, including the signature managers would have to adjust the price according to the worth. Yet it doesn't change the fact that 1btc = 1btc. People only get confused about this, as everyone is here to make profits out of the volatile nature of bitcoin, which is pegged to the dollar for easy market evaluation. If bitcoin was not pegged to fiat, it would have been a hell of difficulty to make trades, as nobody would be able to understand the bear market and bull market, it would have no volatility in dollar price too, but on product price; in a world where only bitcoin is accepted. How then will people know the actual worth of bitcoin when they want to purchase it with cash? wouldn't it be difficult to determine using products as a determinant? So, Fiat, indeed, is crucial to the existence of bitcoin in determining the worth of 1btc to the market.",
