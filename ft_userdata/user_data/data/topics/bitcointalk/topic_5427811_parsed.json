Will you return them or will you change your fortune  It's actually a very tough question. At some point I was thinking that best solution is to send back the funds to the originator address.But I was convinced that such a move can easily turn out to be stupid/bad. For example, what if that address is an address from a CEX completely unrelated to the person that has sent me those funds?So... I would probably keep those funds untouched until I'm approached and convinced beyond doubt that the person approaching me is the one sending me those coins. If that happens I'll send them back. Of course if anybody is asking about that address of mine, I'll answer, helping the conversation take place.While 10 BTC is a life changing amount for me, it's probably the same for the person that has done the mistake. I could not live with that on my conscience.",

Let's say Bitcoin is sent to a DEX wallet, of course, I save it first because there might be a dust attack if I exchange it immediately, afraid that the sender will take my other coins on DEX, which means we have to make sure whether BTC is genuine or fake.Even if it was genuine, I would not take it but would wait for the person who sent the Bitcoin whether it was intentional or not, because that much money would have been announced in the media if he had made a delivery mistake.From my parents' upbringing, I have to give it back, however much I want it, it still doesn't belong to me.",

I think that in the end it all depends on how a person was brought up, someone who steals, lies and appropriates other people's merits would certainly not return anything to anyone - while some others simply do not want something that does not belong to them.Also, maybe one such \"mistake\" is not really that, because those 10 BTC could theoretically be part of coins that are part of some hack or some other illegal activity. Someone who chooses to keep them could end up with the bitter taste of greed.",

But they say there are only two types of people, good and bad. If we are the kind of people who hate doing bad things and believe in karma, there is no doubt that we will return it, but if we are the kind of people who are wild and greedy for money, of course, we will not return it first. Now, if you are the type of person who is in the middle class, you can think twice, because you can think that this is God's answer to what you are praying for, and you can also say that it is not your fault, and because of that We may not notice that greed has entered our thoughts, but in general if you have a good heart, you will give back to the person who sent you.This situation, we don't know, maybe God testing and measuring the good character that we have. Because if we do good we will reap good and if we sow bad we will also reap bad results.",

Will you return them or will you change your fortune  10 BTC is a lot of money and even with the current bear market's price, it will settle me for good. I might be good and settled with that amount but I'm sure that it will run out if the source is unknown because I'll just spend it immediately because I didn't work for it. But with moral values, I don't know how I will return it or maybe just send it back to the sender's address. And I believe that if it's not my money, I won't touch it even though it's going to be a life-changing amount of money. It'd be good to have the money I have that came from my hard and smart work rather than have that fortune that might affect not just even my family and me through karma.",

There’s a possibility that the crypto is just a decoy of hacker that stole huge funds on certain project. You might be on a huge trouble in case authorities track your address especially if the receiving address is your personal wallet because your using it on exchange transaction that will lead chain analysis track your identity. It will be very hard for you to deny the accusation in case you spend already the crypto.",

Will you return them or will you change your fortune  I think your approach to the situation is reasonable. If you are unsure about the origin of the funds, it is generally best to err on the side of caution and not spend or move them until you are certain that they were sent to you in error. If the person who sent the funds contacts you and provides convincing evidence that they are the rightful owner, you can then decide whether to return the funds to them. In the meantime, it is also a good idea to keep the funds in a secure location, such as a hardware wallet, to prevent any unauthorized access to them.",

Since you have returned the question to me as what i will do , here is my response.Well, I need to be honest here. Right now no one send me 10 bitcoins in my wallet, so i am very clear that i will return that amount back, whether it be sending the money to the sender address or if by any means sender approach me and ask for his funds (which is unlikey to happen). I think i am a honest person  But when i have 10 bitcoin in my wallet, i don't know what my reaction will be    It will need a very big heart to return that money.Also this is not about 170K$, think if you can keep it for next bull run, it will be 8-10x this money. You can move to any country, live there for the rest of your life without doing anything.For a moment, close your eyes, think you have got 10 bitcoins,  Ahhh, this is beyond my imagination. I can't tell you honestly what will i do.",

Some would ask \"will you really do it in real life situation?\" ofcourse. I have accidentally sent an amount of Bitcoin before but not as big as with the given scenario. But I was upset when the person did not initiated to give it back so I just don't want other people to feel the same, especially with that huge amount. Also, I believe if all people would be kind, it would be a great world right? And starting it from yourself would be the best thing to do. Am I hoping for reward? Nope but if the person would insist, ofcourse I'd accept that but won't ask for it. That's just how simple life works.",
