  "content": "Focusing on living systems such as mycelium and the stock market for reference, I have been working on a new approach to decentralized consensus(not based in Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, cryptographic randomness). I am building an equal opportunity protocol that mimics adaptive mechanisms found in mycelium and throughout nature. Instead of utilizing a node selection function (POW and POS) all proposals are evaluated using an algorithm that quantifies current network participation and propagates the most ideal/efficient proposal for the next network state. The network becomes marginally slower at scale with higher use, however, if nodes are comfortable utilizing additional sockets this can be mitigated. Initial distribution will be distributed broadly based on Satoshi's original vision with true decentralized value exchange being an integral piece of a free digital market. Current digital currencies not only fail at scale but also when it comes to inherently encouraging network use. Current consensus methods are partial solutions that will not scale favorably for maintaining freedom how they are currently designed. With a global recession and economic collapse pending, the coming years are essential for implementing a true decentralized solution. It is imperative this system is launched in a broadly decentralized fashion so the network can maintain functional fairness and accessibility at scale and long term. For this reason I am looking to build a founding network of people who are interested in dividing the founding ownership of something that I believe will become fundamental in building a free and sustainable digital economy. Anyone that believes they may have something to bring to the founding network or knows of someone who might please message me. Also, if you have recommendations on what you believe is the best way to launch a decentralized protocol please also feel free to message. In the coming weeks I will be publicizing the white-paper followed by the protocol documentation and reference client. I will be developing and releasing all of these on my own accord at which point the network/protocol will become community run. When the white-paper is made public I can post a link on this thread for anyone else that is interested.In the meantime I am willing to answer general questions about the protocol and what it aims to accomplish as well as any others you may have anytime in my personal discord. Please message me if you are interested or have any questions.",
