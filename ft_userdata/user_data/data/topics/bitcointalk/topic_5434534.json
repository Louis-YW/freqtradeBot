After months of accumulation and with a trend of bullish from stocks, gold in early 2023, Bitcoin joined the trend with its pump recent hours.Adding a Bitcoin icon to her costume is not a Bitcoin adoption. It is a marketing noise, not adoption.Adoption is when there is an agreement between buyer and seller to use Bitcoin as an exchange mean for their trade. The girl did not make any trade with her costume in the show.She could do it by her idea but she could do it with a request from her President Nayib Bukele who strongly loves and supports Bitcoin. He put his nation to a bet with Bitcoin investment, Bitcoin bond (Volcano bond) and I am not surprised if the Venezuela Miss got a request from him.",

It is difficult to know what causes a price spike because there are so many players interacting in the market. I think a price recovery is within the normal range for this 2023 once most of the leverage garbage is gone and we are getting closer to halving, although there is still more to come.The Miss promoting Bitcoin is fine with me, as is anything that helps popularize it, but I think it is extremely unlikely to have anything to do with the price rise.",

In other words this is an upward trend that has nothing to do with such small news like this but rather a market reversal that may or may not be temporary (depends on whether it breaks $20k or not).",

Yes, a lot of the people watching from El Salvador must have seen that and it might have sparked some marketing affect, but it is insignificant in a global context. I think we are in a slow recovery phase, after all the spending happening over the Holiday season ....and people are returning from their holiday and trading again as usual. (They made profits during the year..... rewarded themselves with a good holiday.. and now they are back at it again.... working to save up for the next holiday)",

Now we will gonna observe what will gonna happen next because if my speculation is right, this is the start of the price recovery. Still, we need to be careful on bull trap and we need to hold our horses because this hype might be the cause for other investors to backout.",

Not unless Elon Musk will buy bitcoins and I think that's a different story.Well, I think the Consumer Price Index news released yesterday triggered the market. It went 6.5% from 7.1% last November. This is the highest BTC price since it dropped last November due to FTX news.Well, let's see if it will break the 19.1k line and experience some major restest to enter the mini bull run this 2023.Reference :https://qcp.capital/market-updates/market-update-cpi-preview-12-jan-2023/",

It's like saying that Bitcoin price went up because today is Friday the 13th. We can see some small price pumps on the Bitcoin charts, which means that Bitcoin is still alive and kicking and the crypto winter might have a few small bull waves here and there. Anyway, FUD news are coming from the big crypto company Nexo being accused for money laundering, terrorist funding and operating without a license in the USA. Maybe this FUD will cause another short term BTC price drop.Will Nexo become the new FTX? We will have to wait and see.",

All it caused is for the crypto related media to take the image out for a spin and splash a bit of accompanying text, and for bitcoin haters to have an excuse to fill the social networks with criticisms towards the dress used in the National Costume catwalk (though representing history of the country, is not typical in the traditional sense though).In light of the criticisms, dress designer had to step forward to defend the idea, claiming it was based on history, with no political claims.",

She is carrying the now defunct fiat on her back, representing the past, and even older than that cacao/cocoa which was a unit of monetary value at points in history. She carries Bitcoin with her hand, perhaps signaling the country's adoption and spreading the message.So its like someone sponsoring a sports team and stamping a Bitcoin logo in their shirts. It may not be \"adoption\" but it is promotion and public awareness. Maybe it was Bukele's idea? Who knows, but it is great in my opinion. There are people watching who have not even asked what this Bitcoin is let alone learn that a country adopted it as legal tender (which was said by the announcer).hd49728 Venezuela has no relation, it has the worst fiat of the world, and also the first and failed cbdc (Which was/is a State scam token), their leaderships cannot be worse compared. One puts an end to criminals while the other protects them. And there was some major scandal about Miss Venezuela that dissolved the organization locally or changed hands sometime ago so who knows how that ended (the old fashioned sex for favors).",

I don't follow pageants of any levels, but Miss Universe allegedly has 500 million viewers (according to Wikipedia), which is huge if even a part of this audience saw El Salvador's candidate with a giant Bitcoin. I don't know if that's the reason behind the jump, but it could be. In any case, it's a huge promo of Bitcoin for a potentially very fresh audience. I mean, it's not some tech event where most have already heard of Bitcoin before, and I don't think there's a big cross-section between the crypto community and beauty pageant audience, which opens a possibility of wider adoption.",
