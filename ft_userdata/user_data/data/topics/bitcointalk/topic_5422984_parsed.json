Maybe it’s because he donated lot of money to Biden’s campaign. I dunno, it just feels weird, why isn’t he being questioned by the FBI for his leading role in one of the biggest frauds in the 21st century.",

What the authorities should do right now is just arrest him, do a fair investigation and let him rote in jail just like those scammers and big swindlers that we have before him.And for the NY Times summit, they should be ashamed of themselves for letting a guy like SBF speak on behalf of them. And this might damage their reputation, anything that SBF will touch in the future should be be ashamed and not associate themselves with this criminals.",

Many people still ask for his responsibility, I still not sure he is enough brave to come to public as speaker. when he does that, he looks crazy and being to be mad. That possible when happen, SBF will act like lament full drama, cry and tell the sorry to ask forgive him. He is a politician, he will try to make people pity him very much and try to get love from victim. Please, do not be affected by his acting.",

Imagine how many people have lost their money because of this and that means we are talking about a situation where he would not be considered a person who is liked at all, and he could be in danger. Someone who lost all his life savings could end up doing something dangerous.Knowing where he will be is a risky thing, people who are too upset could do something silly because they know exactly where he will be, can even plan it beforehand. So, I would suggest him to cancel this, if he does go through with it, at the very least he would be booed off the stage and worst could be something I don't even want to think about.",

He is painting his side of the story for the world to see before he goes to trial. This is where one shouldn’t innocent till proven guilty.

They are going to make a victim out of this fraud and tell everybody who lost money that they should forget about it. NYT also must have gotten some of those \"donations\" from SBF. In the end, they need to protect their investments.They stole people's money and they are now making fun of them.Hopefully everybody who lost money on this was a democrat party supporter.

He isn't that wonderkid that articles are talking about.  So yeah, except from his accomplishment of making FTX investors lose money, I think there is nothing excellent he did.",

To belong to an influent group is everything a criminal needs to not suffer the consequences for his acts. I think it has been like this since a long time ago, maybe since always. I just had the illusion in a country like USA things worked different, so I could understand why they are the greatest nation of the world. But I was wrong and now I don't have any more illusions. Reality is harsh on us, but better to see the truth than live in an eternal lie. The good side of scandals like the one involving SBF is that we become aware of how dirty the justice system is and how politicians manipulate it at their favour.",
