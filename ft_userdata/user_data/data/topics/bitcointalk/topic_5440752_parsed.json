  "content": "Quote from: Jack Mallers, Founder and CEO of Strike“Remittances are a broken system and Strike delivers an incredibly empowering experience for people to send money around the world in nearly an instant,”Strike is helping millions of people by simply reducing the cost of moving money around the world. They do that by using Bitcoin as the money transport layer, and then once the money is in the target country, they simply buy whatever fiat they use there and deposit it in the person's bank account. Strike's \"Send Globally\" feature, which started a few months ago, allows you to send fiat from the US to an increasing number of countries:Quote from: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230131005380/en/Strike-Expands-%E2%80%9CSend-Globally%E2%80%9D-to-the-Philippines-Bringing-Lightning-Fast-Money-Transfers-from-the-U.S.-to-One-of-the-World%E2%80%99s-Largest-Remittance-MarketsStrike launched Send Globally in December 2022 starting with transfers from the U.S. to Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana. The user experience and ability to bridge communities in the U.S. and Africa in partnership with Bitnob have been transformational and the opportunities for Strike in these and other markets are developing fast. Recently, Strike partnered with Pouch.ph in order to add The Philippines to that list:Quote from: https://beta.strike.me/faq/global/who/All verified US Strike users can now use the Send Globally feature to send to recipients in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and the Philippines, where funds can be received as local currency. Strike doesn’t operate in those countries, but engages with third-party partners to facilitate Send Globally transactions.Of course it would be better if they simply use Bitcoin natively, but we're not there yet. This is the beginning of a huge transformation worldwide, happening in countries that rely on remittances first, then the rest.This is just the beginning, foreign exchange fees will be a thing of the past next when you could simply move around money with Bitcoin all around the world. And then, you won't even need to convert Bitcoin anyway.",

      "body": "^ that's probably the most disruptive way BTC can be used right now - as a transportation layer between different financial entities. I hope more platforms consider doing that approach, and then we can start talking about \"send bitcoin instantly\" features for these platforms where the user sends and receives BTC without any service fee it might take to cover the tx fee itself.",

Include also the Filipinos who are considered Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) who are working abroad and sending money from their families to the Philippines, this is common here in the Philippines, I asked some of these people who are getting money from family members who work abroad and most of them are using money remittance and what I observe is money remittance is worst, we all know that it takes a lot of fees and sometimes you need to wait for a very long time before you get the money. Huge W for Filipinos!",

Yeah, there's a lot of things going on with the Philippines as far as Bitcoin, they have the beloved local exchanges coins.ph and there are competitions as well.

The point is that there's a new way of doing international fiat transfers, using Bitcoin.Also, since you mentioned fees, here are WU fees:Quote from: https://www.westernunion.com/us/en/web/send-money/start?ReceiveCountry=PH&SendAmount=200&ISOCurrency=USD&FundsOut=BA&FundsIn=BAIn addition to the transfer fee, Western Union also makes money from currency exchange. When choosing a money transmitter, carefully compare both transfer fees and exchange rates. Fees, foreign exchange rates and taxes may vary by brand, channel, and location based on a number of factors. Fees and rates subject to change without notice.I haven't seen a direct comparison from Strike, Western Union, and Transferwise, but at least it's another option to consider. Also, there's the waiting time to receive the funds. With Bitcoin this can be done much faster.",
