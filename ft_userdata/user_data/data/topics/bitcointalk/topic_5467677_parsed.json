  "content": "I was reading the latest Coindesk stories and this one was quite interesting from the historical price movement of Bitcoin. So the story says that the Bitcoin Price on Binance US dropped back in 2021 from $65.5k to $8k, almost a drop of 87% on Oct. 21, 2021. Initially, Binance reported that it was a technical bug in the order book algorithm of the institutional trading. The arbitrage traders took advantage of this opportunity. Back in time, I have a couple of questions about it.Those who booked profit on this opportunity were allowed to move funds (Withdrawals)In the same story on 20th September, this is what was reported.. According to the reports an EX-employee reported inside news that actually it was a fat finger act where by mistake the order was misplaced by the decimal point error. Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda caused this drop. Obviously, Baradwaj said Alameda lost $millions. Â A Second question did Alameda offer a refund?To follow more on the story you can have a look here",

Multiple Arbitration cases initiated by Alameda frequently ventured into legal territory, leading to Ellison and Wang, the CEOs of Alameda and FTX, losing public trust.Reportedly, they incurred losses of tens of millions of dollars due to the incidents outlined in this thread, but their fraudulent activities extended far beyond that. Alameda must face judgment and legal proceedings to restore the funds of investors that remain in their possession.",

      "body": "Binance US propblem is not a small matter; thats a huge drop. Now, I think the \"technical bug\" explanation is too easy. When you work as well as Binance does, these kinds of problems shouldnt happen. So, a former worker pointing to a \"fat finger act\" seems more likely. Big players like Alameda, which is run by Sam Bankman-Fried, could move the market by accident. How can a wrongly placed decimal point cause so much chaos? As fragile as it sounds, it really isIn answer to your questions:- Whether those who made money were able to move their money. The real litmus test would have been this. When mistakes lead to a lot of money being made, exchanges often stop payments. If they were allowed, that raises even more suspicions.- Did Alameda return the money? Given how big the mistake is said to be and how well-known Alameda is, they should have. But honestly, since they have been shut down, I really do not know",

Such events do not cause losses. It is a big deal for the platform, which is easy to compensate for, or it could be an opportunity for some to evade paying a tax, but it is a rare occurrence and does not occur in a manner that would cause huge losses to the platform or lead to them being accused of tampering.",

Same with the BTC drop.So you want the crypto market to be regulated only for stability (Really I cant understand), Bitcoin's Volatility is its beauty it would be a dumb decision to make Bitcoin stable. I do consider that there is market manipulation what you really think is it never happens in the stocks even more widely it's reported with the stocks that stocks are malted. In every open market manipulation does come in handy but it on your responsibility to save your funds with your decision-making.Dear, the Bitcoin regulation may decrease the volatility but it can never be eliminated. I also support that volatility should never be eliminated. (Why I'm so general because buddy you were quite general so I'm responding in a informal, friendly way.)",

I canât say for sure but, based on the quote below, QuoteBut because it had been an honest mistake, there wasn't much to do except to implement additional sanity checks for manual trades,â Baradwaj added.Itâs seems all was in agreement for them to have their withdrawals in peace as should be the case.
