Most software allows you to edit the paths but it's not really advisable unless you note down what you've done as you might lose your funds.Trust wallet also uses different derivation paths to load different coins while metamask just uses the eth one to load everything (as TW has a lot more support for alternate blockchains).",

What is the trick behind this? Trust wallet is a multi-coin wallet while Metamask is mainly for ethereum and similar chains (which you have to add manually). But what you described is a bit weird and not supposed to happen because both wallets use the same derivation path to derive eth addresses which is \"m/84'/0'/0'/0\".If you export the seed from one Trust wallet and import it into Metamask, or vice-versa, you are supposed to get the same address.I just tested it and can confirm that I got the same address on both wallets.",

No, it will not change.Check the transaction history if there is.QuoteFor example coming from Trust wallet and importing to Metamask you will get a new address, do these crypto wallets work differently? What is the trick behind this?Yes, they are, but once your wallet is imported, it works in different features and it's kind of a very tricky step.Just read this article and it will help you a lot.https://decentralizedcreator.com/import-trust-wallet-to-metamask/",

What is the trick behind this? Not really. I always do this when importing my seed phrase vice versa between metamask and trustwallet and it seems that no changes in the wallet address. Maybe for btc as it really secured. If it does change then there is something wrong on the new configuration. Or it depends on the app.",
