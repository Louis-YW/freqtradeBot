I would like to notify the owner about it so they could transfer the coins.You cannot find the private key. There is no link between the private key of the actual address and the address you ended up with by performing RIPEMD160(SHA256(address)).Further, it is incredibly unlikely that by performing RIPEMD160(SHA256(anything)) that you end up with an address which is already funded, unless you are deliberately reusing a string (which should be a public key) someone else has already used. I suspect there is something else going on here.",

The only other option is that you have stumbled across the world's first RIPEMD160 or SHA256 collision, which is exceedingly unlikely.Quote from: digaran on March 01, 2023, 08:54:48 PMFirst I want to know if it is possible to derive the private key from the 2 hex strings that I have or not, then I'd post everything publicly once I'm sure there is no risk of theft on the address.No, it isn't. Even in a normally generated address, knowledge of SHA256(pubkey) or RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)) (or indeed, just the raw pubkey itself) is not enough to derive the private key.",

      "body": "Quote from: digaran on March 01, 2023, 11:23:34 PMSo do we perform ripemd160 on public key or private key?Neither. RIPEMD-160 algorithm is usually applied on hash of data, not data itself. You can't convert a bitcoin address back to public key because both RIPEMD-160 and SHA256 are one-way functions. No matter what you do with these raw hashes and strings, it is unlikely that you will ever find a collision that would give you an option to spend coins of someone else. According to Bitcoin Wiki, \"because the space of possible addresses is so astronomically large it is more likely that the Earth is destroyed in the next 5 seconds, than that a collision occur in the next millenium.\" QuoteIf it's the public key then if you do sha256 on bitcoin addresses you can get the public key of some other addresses, and somehow I can get the public key of some addresses by doing sha256 on them. Don't know if I'm misunderstanding the concept or I just stumbled upon a bug.You need a corresponding private key to spend from public key-address, but you will not get a private key by simply converting someone else's address to another address. What you need to do to find a collision is generate every possible private key, convert each of them to public key, apply SHA256 and RIPEMD-160 and check if it matches the address in question. There is no shortcut because any garbage can be converted to a valid bitcoin address.",

I would like to notify the owner about it so they could transfer the coins.You can't, and I highly doubt that there's an owner of that address. (someone who owns its private key)If there's someone who claims it for some reason, ask him to provide a signed message.",

You can enter any checksum and it will still find the corresponding BCH address with the correct checksum listed as \"Legacy address format\", while showing an empty (and invalid) bitcoin address.",

I have a lot to learn.I think this site might help to answer your questions here: https://gobittest.appspot.com/AddressIt shows quite clearly the individual steps involved in moving from a private key, through a public key, and finally to an (uncompressed P2PKH) address.To answer your specific questions above, you perform RIPEMD-160 on the output of a SHA-256 hash of your public key. You must then add an 0x00 network byte to the start of this result and the checksum to the end before encoding it as an address.",
