Throughout history, money has taken many forms, but money consistently serves three functional purposes: a store of value, a unit of account, and a medium of exchange.Who has led you people to believe money cannot be an asset? Is it because the value of fiat currencies never appreciate anymore? because they just depreciate? A currency can also be an asset. Gold for example is a currency and it's also an asset. If you hold dollars, pounds, yuan or euros to appreciate so you can sell and make a profit from it then you have made those fiat currencies an asset. It's the same with bitcoin. It's an asset and also a currency. It is mostly used as an asset doesn't mean it is no longer a currency. They are not mutually exclusive, it can be a currency/money and also an asset.

It is the most superior form of cryptocurrency. Saying bitcoin is not crypto is like saying the dollar is not fiat. If you want to separate bitcoin from other cryptos then you should use \"altcoins\".",

Yes they digital currency Are they useful? Yes to scam many of their capital and other extrinsic uses.  I wasn't keen on joining the other discussion over there before now, as the op literally is a shit poster, a hater and someone who doesn't understand what he speaks of... What I think will be best to describe Bitcoin is just very simply as a digital asset. It's not something that can be held or seen but then it retains its value in the physical form.Bitcoin also exhibits characteristics of both money and assets I just wonder why some people keeps making things complicated for them selfs. What distinguish BTC from all other currency or digital asset is that it is decentralized, it isn't controlled by any person or owned by any country. Thats the first fun fact making it an even better asset and form of money. Now, to be considered as money, it should be able to facilitate transactions, and have a standard unit of value.. Bitcoin meets these criteria, serving as a medium of exchange, with its own pricing mechanism and ability to store and retrieve value, despite volatility...as a digital asset, Bitcoin represents unique digital ownership, offering potential value appreciation over time. Again, its total supply is capped at 21 million, giving it the last attribute, scarcityI'm not the type that likes writing a wall of text but I just tried to see how I can use my common knowledge to explain why BTC is both a digital asset, a better form of money, and why it was created as an alternative payments method. Its value changes due to market factors, making it  akin to an asset like gold or stocks, which also fluctuate in value.",

It’s debatable that the top ones are actually with value but the rest are just pump and dump coins or tokens that if you keep them for long time they will rug on you and never come up again.",

Crypto is centrally controlled and created to generate quick profits for its creators or early investors. It relies on strong marketing of lies, deception, and fraud;Please don't get confused.  In terminology, cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses cryptography for security.[1]  You can read more about cryptocurrency below[1]  and Bitcoin is part of these so called cryptocurrency meaning Bitcoin is under the umbrella of cryptocurrency.  Even if you believe that crypto is not Bitcoin (which is wrong) but altcoin, they still have in common.  They both runs in blockchain, the difference is that some are running in centralized blockchain and others are in decentralized blockchain.  Both can be transferred and use as either currency or asset depends on the belief of the holder.  And both uses cryptography to secure its network.Given the things they have in common, it is obvious altcoin and Bitcoin falls under one umbrella the cryptocurrency.Quote crypto is like fiat money, where a small group of people controls monetary policy.Another thing, other than CBDC (if this is considered a cryptocurrency) cryptocurrency can't be like fiat money in terms of issue since fiat money are issued by the government while Cryptocurrencies are not.Quote Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a far superior form of money without a central leader or group of leaders. Its users do not have to trust anyone, making it truly peer-to-peer and resistant to censorship or control.Bitcoin may be superior in terms of security but I do not think Bitcoin outperforms fiat digital transfers.  They both have advantages and disadvantage so I think whether Bitcoin is a superior form of money is debatable.  Certain issues like scaling, time confirmation, volatility, and use case is attached to Bitcoin so I think we cannot fully say that Bitcoin is far superior form of money. And decentralization might be the strongest feature of Bitcoin but it also serves as the greatest flaw of Bitcoin to those who are not fond of it, especially the centralized authority and this impedes the adoption of Bitcoin[1] https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp",

Can the nature increase the size of the earth? No, that isn't a possibility. Other assets such as metals and precious minerals, can have an unknown supply, of course, no human being can determine how much oil or gold exists in the whole world and whether or not more of its supply can come into circulation in the future because more can be found. Oil is a different thing as well because it's consumed and it vanishes after that.Talking about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, if we say that Bitcoin is an asset because it has value and can be used to carry out transactions then I would say it's arguable that all cryptocurrencies that exist in the market right now are assets because they all can be used to carry out transactions and they all have a value, for the time being.Quote from: Iranus on September 05, 2024, 09:52:05 AMIt can be said that it depends on each person's needs and each person will use it in different circumstances.
