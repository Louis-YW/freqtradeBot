  "content": "I have been developing gambling bots in the past years and what I have learned is that we will never have an always-win bot, doesn't matter the method, you will always lose in the long run. But I have learned other things too... Like variance is the worst enemy for casinos (Big bets winning while low bets losing), and streaks come like waves. So, lose while betting low and win while betting win. I know is easy to say but we don't know when the next good wave will come. That's why we should add some chaos to our strategy. I have been talking about my weird betting methods in the past:Chasing a x330,000https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406456.0My new favorite betting method.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5461882.0Both of them are good chaos examples, on the first one we have a bot who was making 20bets/sec. until hit x330,000 and the second one is a bot that gives you x1.5 of the lost amount after a hit.But this time I decided to take the chaos to another level, I made a bot to hit x3300, and these are the rules:1.- Divide Balance / 15002.- Bet on: x3300, x8.25, x3300,x8.25.... until hit x33003.- Random Hi/Lo4.- When the balance get's down to 75% bet amount goes x24.- When the balance get's down to 50% bet amount goes x4Proof of hits: https://just-dice.com/roll/6141329807https://just-dice.com/roll/6140238438UPDATE: Here is the source code.Code:var chance = 5.8; var a = 1; divider=1500;var balance = parseFloat(document.getElementById('pct_balance').value);var target = balance*2;var b = ((balance/divider).toFixed(8));var mybet;document.getElementById('pct_chance').value = chance;parseFloat(document.getElementById('pct_bet').value = b);function dobet(){balancez = document.getElementById('pct_balance').value;var stuit = document.getElementById('pct_bet').value;var count = document.getElementById(\"nonce\").innerText;    if(count%2==0){        document.getElementById('pct_chance').value = 0.030;    }else{        document.getElementById('pct_chance').value = 12.0;          }if (mybet==null) {mybet = stuit;}if (((balancez*1.25)<balance)&&(balancez<balance)) {mybet = b*2;}if (((balancez*1.5)<balance)&&(balancez<balance)) {mybet = b*4;}if (balancez>balance*1.2) {    balance = balancez;    b = ((balance/divider).toFixed(8));    mybet = b;}if (balancez>=target) {return;}if (a==0) {return;}balancez = document.getElementById('pct_balance').value;parseFloat(document.getElementById('pct_bet').value = ((mybet*1).toFixed(8)));Math.random() < 0.5 ? $('#a_hi').click() : $('#a_lo').click();}setInterval(() => dobet(), 40);",

I wish all bot users cab see this to learn from, because some will emphatically told you that they cannot be fulfilled without going through the use of bot, yet when they give a try on anyone they found out that there's nothing much it has to offer than what they have already been used to, we seems not been satisfied in some cases not until we get some things done in other to get our satisfaction over it be it good or bad consequence on us, for someone like me, i may adopt the use of bot but ot in bettings that i do.",

Having an actual strategy excludes the possibility of relying on random results(or chaos as you say).I agree that big bets that are winning are the worst enemy of every casino, but in the long run almost all bets are losing and the casinos try everything they can to keep the gamblers playing and betting as long as possible. The worst enemy of every casino is the gambler, who wins big, withdraws his money/coins and leaves the casino.  I don't agree that winning steaks come like waves. This isn't statistically proven and it seems more like a gambler's delusion to me.",

What I am only saying is that we should gamble wisely and responsibly.Well, one thing I have always thought about is, if it were possible to always win with a bot, gambling with bots would have become really popular since every gambler out there are all after one thing, and that is, how to beat the casino.And maybe if this was possible, most casinos would have gone bankrupt due to players winning much more than they(the casinos) can pay.But I honestly like ops statement in the begining of the thread, as he made it clear that, even as a bot developer himself, who have had a lot of experience gambling through bots, that it is impossible to find a bot that will guarantee a constant win as long as gambling it's gambling, even bots in trading still lose some trades..But then again, I might love to try ops bots if he will get willing to permit and also share a guideline of how to set it up, I've never gambled with a bot before, will be so interesting to learn this ..",

What I am only saying is that we should gamble wisely and responsibly.In gambling, loses is the most witnessed events at all time, and in most cases a newbie gamblers is welcomed with series of loses before he eventually become strategic to win his or her first bets this is why gambling is gigh risk, and no strategy is free from such happening.I don't believe in bot usage in gambling since gambling is only but a high risk unpredictable activity and at that since the bot is coded to work in a particular way, even though they register some success at first, they will still not record consistent success so for that it a bad idea to use bots to gamble and rather it far better to develop a personal model to analyse the games at all point since that is the only way you record success even if it not all time.",

I wasn't trying to derail by talking about the coin itsself.I would say the profit from this bot is close to 2600, and i have done 20k bets approx with this method. I have been lucky because i get the hit before the martingale gets too high. But still a nice bot, i ran it last night again and hit the x3300, two times.
