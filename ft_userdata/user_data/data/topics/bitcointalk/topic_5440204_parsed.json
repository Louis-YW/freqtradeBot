  "content": "My story is that I registered on this site to place bets on sports events. After registration, I made a deposit of $ 600But when trying to place a bet on any sporting event, an error was issued. The support told me that the sports provider restricted my access to sports betting (why?). Well, then I decided to withdraw the deposit. But it was not there, in order to withdraw the deposit, you need to unscrew the x5 wager. The support didn't give a damn about my arguments that I registered only for sports betting, they forced me to play casino and other games so that I could withdraw my deposit!Well, what to do, I started playing baccarat without a commission from suzuki. And my very first winning bet was canceled for some unknown reason. (although my friend and I were sitting and playing together, he bet on the banker, and his bet was successfully settled with a loss). trustdice blames everything on the provider, and does not solve the problem in any way, my winnings are not paid. And, of course, because of their rule in the x5 ledger, I lost my money, withdrew only $59 in the end...Screenshots of correspondence with support, where my winning bet is visible, I attachhttps://i.ibb.co/Sy1Rhrs/Screenshot-1.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/xzBhBwf/Screenshot-2.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/FYKX2wB/Screenshot-3.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/VBMtLnH/Screenshot-4.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/hYrCH15/Screenshot-5.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/3YkCrt9/Screenshot-6.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/bQJKw9g/Screenshot-7.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/7jFL3S9/Screenshot-8.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/99F5Wj5/Screenshot-9.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/ysX2vkM/Screenshot-10.jpg",

The Casino can't give a statement about the rejected bet since it is on the provider's side, and the game provider had yet to answer the issue as shown on the screenshot.  @OP become impatient and created a thread here about the rejected bet without waiting for the provider's answer.  I think @OP should have waited for the answer of the provider before creating this thread.  I believe the fault is not on Trustdice but rather on the provider.  Trustdice never neglected the case and already escalated it to the provider,  I hope there is an answer from the said provider soon so we can see the reason why the bet becomes invalid while his friend's bet loss is accepted.  That is indeed an act of scamming by the game provider.",

Clearly there was something wrong with the game itself.They probably have it in written in their T&C that they are allowed to cancel any bet and return money to the player. Also, this demanding blackmailing stance where you tell them that they have to settle with you or you'll go to bitcointalk and cal them scammers is not the best line of defense Wait for the provider's answer and let us know how it went.",

I don't see any reason why you won't be able to withdraw if you didn't apply to any promo or bonuses in their platform. If they did and you didn't even apply to any bonuses or promos then they are being suspicious in my opinion mostly a way to make the player lose all the funds like what happen to you instead of withdrawing $600 and you only withdraw $59.",
