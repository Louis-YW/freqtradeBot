  "content": "Lack of education, technical knowledge, and awareness has been the major challenge for Bitcoin enthusiasts, it is high time we kick-start the mass eradication of Bitcoin illiteracy in our society, preach about Bitcoin, but don't force it on anyone,This group of people might not have access to an internet service to get involved in this technology or even funds to invest but for sure many of them want the knowledge to prepare them for future possible investments.In the absence of internet service the diagrammatic explanation of how the technology works can also help locally.Generally, the teaching of system transparency may encourage mass adoption when the example is been shown practically.Some of us never thought of being where we are today in the Bitcoin world, but because of the knowledge we got on how reliable, fast, and decentralized Bitcoin is, we tried and it worked perfectly as we expected.Some people don't care about Bitcoin because they don't understand howIt works and how it is, and I have made it an obligation to help people that I tell about Bitcoin, that has found it interesting to reach the extent of comprehending what Bitcoin is, and also make them know that the technology has come to stay, irrespective of the availability of cash for investment, acquire the knowledge.We know that money plays a major role in Bitcoin investment and adoption, over the time many people have complained that money has deprived them of the opportunity to partake in Bitcoin, after getting the knowledge of how the currency works, please my advice to every Bitcoin enthusiast is that no knowledge is a waste, you may not have the money to invest today, but learning about this technology is the first stage you have to cross in other to get the main thing.So the other stuff which is money becomes secondary, continue pushing, any day you get the funds to invest in your own time, stop limiting yourself by not being prepared before the money comes will be considered as the greatest mistake, be yourself don't be in a hurry more things may unfold before you invest maybe you might be lucky bitcoin for one bitcoin for everyone.",

Maybe in my country Bitcoin and crypto are still given a chance as commodity assets, what about countries that prohibit their citizens from being involved in all forms of crypto and if caught will be given strict sanctions.I always support efforts and efforts related to informing about Bitcoin to all circles with the aim that all humans understand and know about Bitcoin.",

There are only two major factors: religion and government. The government isn't supporting Bitcoin, they would discuss about it and then said Bitcoin is a high risk investment. There are many bad news related with Bitcoin e.g. CEX hack, people lose Bitcoin etc, not to mention the government ban Bitcoin. This make people scared to buy Bitcoin.There's a religion which said Bitcoin is haram, even though you've explain Bitcoin isn't haram, but they will keep say Bitcoin is haram.",

That's different from a few years ago, when people could search and get Bitcoin for free and many people even got it through faucets.We can teach people to start investing in Bitcoin, but we must warn them that they only use the money they can afford. There is no need to go overboard in investing in Bitcoin, let alone to use a lot of money when we also still need that money to survive.People still struggling to think about how they will survive will not start investing in Bitcoin because they will put their interests or fulfilling their needs over investing. That is a normal thing because the necessities of life are their number one priority. But they can even start investing in Bitcoin with small money and regularly buy at the current price.",

So bitcoin adoption by all, it's all a function of time.Educating on bitcoin doesn't necessarily need to be on the technical aspects, in as much as a person can do bitcoin transaction, knows how to secure his private keys safely that's alright. Except for those that wants to go professional with bitcoin in terms of the different areas of specialist concerned with cryptocurrency.",

People who did not get basic internet access should have gotten something more basic instead of a mere Bitcoin education. Bitcoin has nothing to do with a precondition of people who lack primary access to internet connectivity. Besides, we can assume those who did not have access are also having more concerning problems, for example, education in general, or even famine. So, it is ridiculous to increase adoption by only focusing on such kind of conditions.",

Bitcoin is getting more famous because the government are always scared of it and directly or indirectly they are making it more popular by talking about it positively or negatively,also about crpytocurrency regulation. You can also render a service to get bitcoin,buying bitcoin is not the only way to own a bitcoin. Money is everything and those who can't afford to buy bitcoin,if they have the knowledge of bitcoin,they can decide to ask for their payment in bitcoin.

But knowing what you are investing in is also very important, because if you have money and do not know what you are investing in, it is like a waste of money because your investment might fail. Therefore, gaining knowledge first does help in Bitcoin investment.Actually, giving good awareness about Bitcoin will increase the rate of Bitcoin adoption globally; therefore, anyone who is given awareness should understand the entire concept of Bitcoin before being given awareness to avoid being given wrong information about Bitcoin.",

Instead of wasting those money you can keep then to buy Bitcoin through dollar cost average. You don't need that new phone, clothes now, you should use the money to invest in Bitcoin. Bitcoin investment doesn't have to be done in thousands but you can keep the little cash you get and buy Bitcoin slowly.Education without practical is pointless, we need to invest so we can make good use of our education to elevate ourselves from our current financial problem.

My take on this is that you teach them how to improve their lives first, say they are a poor farming community, you can teach them ways to improve their farming aspect of life, that's more helpful to them than just straight up teaching about bitcoin, maybe even put crypto websites as sponsors so in a way, you are still exposing them indirectly to cryptocurrency.",
