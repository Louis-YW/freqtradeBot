It's been one of the hottest topic though in the last couple of years. But me thinks that if ever Quantum Computer will break the encryption then we should adjust and evolved as well.I'm just skeptic of the news though, specially coming from the Chinese as we are used to have a lot of FUD coming from them specially about Bitcoin.Another good thread to ponder:   Bitcoin's latest decline was triggered by quantum computing headlines.",

IF RSA gets broken. BTC is going to be the least of the issues. The credit card industry would implode, followed by the banking industry followed by everything else that relies on encryption for transactions. BTC is such a small part of that to make it not worth mentioning.-Dave",

I couldn't find it while I was skimming the article and those keys are already huge because of how weak the algorithm is. 128bit is considered fairly easy to crack afaik and that's not even considering if a medium sized tech firm was interested in cracking them.If the US or China crack quantum proof encryption, they're telling no one before they make a profit off it and sell it to a Russian/South American cartel or some random government they think will profit them. At the moment it would be a leap considering how volatile quantum bits seem to have been made so far (I thought this was the main issue research has faced so far).

As said by another user if it happened that a quantum computer break AES encryption, the problem won't be only for Bitcoin, the NSA, card company, and others government intelligence agency will be affected. AES is quantum resistant, much like Sha256.The elliptic curve encryption bitcoin uses isn't considered to be quantum proof but it's not hard to change algorithms and only addressed that have spent funds are vulnerable (a lot of people should be unaffected by that unless you're using wallets with only a few addresses - after spending from an address, your funds are often sent to \"change\" addresses too).",

The minimum recommended size for RSA keys is 2,048. They weren't even close, even to older 1,024 keys which are still in circulation. The RSA-100 number, which has 330 bits, was factorized in 1991, and can be factorized on a modern computer in a matter of minutes. 48 bits isn't even close to this number either.The whole thing is a clickbait nothing burger. The difference between 48 bits and 2,048 bits really can't be understated. It would be like newspapers in 1969 announcing we had colonized the solar system after landing on the moon.Quote from: jackg on January 09, 2023, 10:50:37 PMand only addressed that have spent funds are vulnerableThat's not quite accurate. There are also millions of coins in old style P2PK outputs which are vulnerable, and since taproot no longer hashes public keys then coins in P2TR outputs are vulnerable as well. Not to mention all the public keys which have been revealed through other means, such as SPV wallets, watch only wallets, payment processors, signed non-transaction messages, etc. And obviously the public keys which will be revealed as soon as a transaction is broadcast. Relying on the public key being hashed is a poor defense against quantum computers. Rather we will implement some quantum resistant scheme when the time comes.",

They can simply update their back end, as opposed to needing to hard fork an entire decentralized network. Further, they don't have to care about some of the same considerations that we do. Take Lamport signatures as an example. They should only ever be used once, as each subsequent signature makes it easier and easier for an attacker to forge a signature. For bitcoin this would mean a huge overhaul of how wallets (or even the whole network) works to prevent anyone from using the same address more than once. For a bank, then can just generate new keys as needed. Or the fact that Lamport public keys and signatures can be dozens of kilobytes in size. Irrelevant for a centralized service, but catastrophic for bitcoin blocks.While quantum computers pose no risk to bitcoin at the moment, and won't for many years to come, we will have some of the most specific demands when it comes to selecting a quantum resistant algorithm to use.",
