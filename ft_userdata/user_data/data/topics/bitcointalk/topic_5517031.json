  "content": "After months of Trump promising various things and getting involved with crypto, even as far as getting endorsed by Elon musk himself who is also a popular name within the crypto realm, He has now won so let us talk what could happen in the next 4 years with Trump as president.SEC ChairFirst of all, it is guaranteed that the SEC chair will be replaced by a new one. Trump has said that he will fire Gary Gensler if elected. The question now would be, who would replace him? Surely the SEC chair that will replace Gensler is someone who has the same plans for bitcoin and crypto as Trump. We will definitely see less restrictions within the crypto market which would lead to more innovations.Bitcoin ReserveTrump hopes to make bitcoin as the country's reserve and treat it like a national gold reserve. If this were to happen, countries that are already holding bitcoin will find themselves at an advantage while countries without bitcoin might scramble to keep up.TaxesBitcoin or crypto transactions will be taxed less. This can definitely boost more interest in crypto especially in the US. Trump hopes to make the US as a bitcoin capital and gaining interest from other countries due to their bitcoin friendly policies could lead to that.Of course, these things can only happen if Mr. President actually follows through his words but if he does do the things he has said, where do you see bitcoin, specifically in the US, 4 years from now?",

In his previous term, things were exactly the same. I did not see any particularly important matters that he spoke about in front of the whole country.

When that happens, the net effect will probably still be small since most of that job is determined by Congress.QuoteBitcoin ReserveThis is not going to happen. It's simply ridiculous. And besides, how many people here would like the price of Bitcoin to be at the whim of the US government? That's what they use the national oil reserve to do, although that is only a small portion of the supply. The US could actually buy all of the supply of Bitcoin if it wanted to--and even 20% of it would allow the US government to manipulate the price.But if they proposed this, when Apple would lobby the government for a \"strategic AAPL reserve\", and holders of ETH would demand a \"strategic ETH reserve\" and so on. This idea is simply idiotic.QuoteTaxesBitcoin or crypto transactions will be taxed less.Bitcoin and crypto transactions are not taxed in the USA. Repealing the capital gains tax is something Republicans have wanted to do for a long time, but they would do this for all assets, not just Bitcoin. But this would be such a transparent giveaway to the super-rich that I suspect the Republicans would never even try it.Quote where do you see bitcoin, specifically in the US, 4 years from now?[/b] I see it as one of many major digital currencies, but maybe not even the most valuable one anymore. Bitcoin doesn't scale to mainstream transaction loads, and the future of digital currency is mainstream transactions.",

Bitcoin will continue to be here, and even grow up its adoption more. Bitcoin lifespan in my opinion will be longer than one or two Presidential terms that equal to 4 or 8 years. Trump will be allowed to be President of USA for only 4 more years, and effects from his policies on Bitcoin will be only one of many contributions from many people in Bitcoin history.If he brings good policies to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry next four years, it's good but if he won't, other people will do it later years. The world doesn't stop spinning and Bitcoin won't die any year between 2024 and 2028.People need to understand that in any market cycle, with bullish and bearish years, there will be a lot of fud in this market. Trump won't be able to prevent all fud to appear next four years.https://endthefud.org/",

If he could elect Elon Musk as the new chair, he might just do that. Who knows? But I know that Trump will never put someone against crypto if he is really serious about his plans with it. Without SEC breathing down exchanges and wallets' necks, there will certainly be more interest in crypto since investors/traders will not fear against laws anymore. Quote So, could the new chair help push Bitcoin to be recognized as a currency rather than just property in the US?I would hope so but it will be a long process and certainly not something that can be done over night.

The United States dominates the world by forcing every country to use and depend on the US dollar. If they legalize a currency that they do not control, it will negatively impact the dominance of the USD and that means it will directly threaten their power. Bitcoin is becoming more and more popular around the world but we can easily see that governments tend to accept it as an asset, no country wants to turn it into currency and use it to replace its own currency. Only countries without their own currency think of legalizing bitcoin as legal tender but most of these countries are small countries.With Trump being elected and maybe his administration will be more friendly to bitcoin but don't forget that governments are centralized entities and they will put their own interests first, they don't like decentralization so we should have realistic expectations.",
