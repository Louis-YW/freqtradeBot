  "content": "On Venezuela and Zimbabwe's linear and after the federal raised the main interest rates by five percentage points over the past months, the Argentine Central Bank raised the main interest rate on Monday by six degrees Celsius to 97 % in an attempt to treat high inflation that reached its highest level in 30 years.QuoteArgentina’s central bank is also hoping the rate hike will incentivize investments in the country’s currency, according to the central bank’s statement released Monday. The exorbitant inflation resulted in large outflows of investments held in the Argentine peso, leading to a 23% decline in its value against the US dollar this year.Ahead of a presidential election set for October, Economy Minister Sergio Massa is focused on avoiding an even bigger devaluation of the currency and containing inflation. He has been seen as a potential third-party candidate since incumbent President Alberto Fernandez announced last month that he won’t seek reelection, and Massa’s success is likely to be tied to the result of this inflation-battling plan.But the new rate hike is unlikely to bring any real change to Argentinian markets, analysts said.“The feeling is that the government is completely losing it against inflation,” said Miguel Kiguel, a financial adviser and former deputy manager at the Central Bank of Argentina.source: https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/15/business/argentina-interest-rates-inflation/index.htmlIs it really with a feeling of siam and raising interest rates is the solution to reduce inflation? The interest rates strategy is good to combat inflation in the long run, but when a recovery does not occur in the market for two consecutive two, the more interest rate will put more fire on the oil.What is your recommendation to countries in such cases?",

But it is like tackling inflation from the top or middle, not from the root.The main cause of inflation is because a country is depending on other countries too much, depending on their services and products. The countries that is having inflation use more of their foreign reserves to buy from other countries and they increase the price of the local currencies to make the foreign currencies stronger and higher in price. Turkey dependent on other countries in Europe and other countries is the main cause of their problem. Increase in interest rate can help reduce inflation for sometimes, but as Turkey still far more depend on other countrys' imports, they are solving nothing.",

But more realistically, just flee the country, it's doomed to be in a perpetual loop of crisis.Quote from: Oshosondy on May 20, 2023, 11:54:18 AMThe main cause of inflation is because a country is depending on other countries too much, depending on their services and products.

Turkey dependent on other countries in Europe and other countries is the main cause of their problem. Then, why is Japan not experiencing inflation despite being dependent on imports and why is the US having inflation when, d'oh, they can just print it?Besides, how could Turkey be 20 times more dependent on imports than all the countries in Europe?Inflation is simply a cause of more demand and less offer, we have just entered a period of consumption after the lockdowns and the industry with the broken logistics chains can't revamp production as easily as customers decide to spend money.",

In addition, people who have come to another country do not have the right to vote in elections because they are foreign citizens, so they are not the ones who can change anything, except that they can irritate the local population with their behavior.I say this from the perspective of a small man who is not part of the ruling elite, and all his life he is told that he must make sacrifices and that he will get better - but in fact his life is getting worse, and the only way to change that is to go to another country.",

Argentina's been in recession for years now. The inflation crisis's been around and was made worse since COVID because they printed too much money to fund social programs while their economy was neutered.If they were so inclined, they could let the economic crisis playout without government intervention and let things stabilize on their own. Once new currency units are introduced, there isn't much you can do to control inflation but allowing prices to increase. Taking money out of circulation is just about impossible which is why they shouldn't be generated in the first place.",

I'm not an economist so I can't really think of any ideas for reducing inflation other than raising interest rates. Raising interest rates is a solution that has been used for many years to control inflation and has been effective many times. As we can see, the US is adopting it, and their inflation is falling, but I don't understand why other countries like Argentina or Turkey raising interest rates isn't working for them.",

A further increase in the key rate has an extremely negative effect on the economy, effectively killing all commercial production; at a rate above 20%, only short-term trading and speculative activities can be profitable. If the Central Bank raised the rate to 20% and this did not help defeat inflation, it is necessary not to continue raising the key rate, but to use other methods to combat inflation, for example, control over the export of capital. In general, the fight against double-digit inflation should be comprehensive. The situation in Argentina suggests that absolutely incompetent people are working in the Government to solve the problem (or the Government is engaged in sabotage), and the Government should be immediately dismissed in its entirety.It is also possible that Argentina has become dangerously dependent on the IMF, which is often fond of issuing loans in combination with destructive political conditions.",
