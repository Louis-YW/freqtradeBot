This approach follow the rule of investing an amount you can afford to lose.If you have a stable source of income, such as a job or business, it might be a wiser choice to start investing in bitcoin gradually. This way, you can keep aside a small portion of your regular earnings and Start to DCA in bitcoin. This approach is generally considered more prudent than selling valuable assets solely to invest in bitcoin.What is Dollar Cost Averaging?",

I agree with you that borrowing money to invest into bitcoin or any investment is actually not the perfect way most especially a volatile asset like bitcoin because it mounts unnecessary pressure on the holder. But I will say there are cases where people actually do well with borrowed funds or sold items. First instance on borrowed funds is when you have a strong collateral to pay back or you’re expecting a certain amount of money which you had worked for and plan to invest in bitcoin but you see an opportunity to buy maybe the market is low then you can actually borrow since there is a another means to pay outside the bitcoin itself. Example is Microstrategy borrowing to invest into bitcoin.Another case is selling off abandoned properties that you think will depreciate with time since no one is using it example is maybe a car or an old house. Or maybe you have extra properties, you can actually sell some off to invest into bitcoin like jewelries Some of this are actually possible for bouyant individuals, so just as you said someone without extra income shouldn’t do any of the above",

Remember that bitcointalk.com is not an office and so you should find other sources of income and then you will appreciate the forum and your holding will not become the nearest option to consider whenever an emergency sets in.According to this theory, it is far preferable to invest money you don't want to use right now rather than borrow money or sell a valuable asset to invest in bitcoin. If you must sell something before investing in bitcoin, you must examine it and ensure that what you are selling is worth selling in order to invest in bitcoin. Some assets become a liability at home or are difficult to maintain; in such cases, selling will be the best option, and investing in bitcoin with that money should be the best step to take if you don't have any important things to do with that money. The concept of DCAing is still the best and most effective method for accumulating bitcoin. It is not stressful to work for and does not require you to be distressed before investing in bitcoin. Lump summing is also a good idea, but it is not something that many of us can do. Of course, the wealthy can still DCA, and the less wealthy can lump sum whenever they have the opportunity.",

How can you invest into a new venture for not having your own money? That's why it's not all about how much you can invest but how well planned you are into investing in Bitcoin. Is the money you have ready to invest is yours? Invest. Is that money okay to sit for a very long time? Invest.Is that money okay to lose? Invest. That's what we're talking about when we invest in Bitcoin.

Loans simply carry a pay back policy and in most cases, it’s got a period to it and attracts profit. Loans means a third party and with that comes some sort of pressure that requires you to at all times, make the right decision. Anything outside what is the right decision would mean, your steps away from not fulfilling your loan promises and can end badly for you and the investment.Now that’s a whole lot of pressure and being pressured alone don’t put you in a very good spot for making good decisions.",

In theory it is true and taking loans to develop a business is not the right choice because people never know how the business trip process can produce results. But if you learn further business people who dare to take risks by borrowing a lot of money and they are also successful. What can we learn from these two issues?1. Can take loans when you know the business developed has the potential to be successful and a survey may have been made before starting.2. Don't take a loan if you don't have a strong skill, support and network to build a business because 70% of people will fail if you take this approach. It is important to make previous planning so that we know how the business trip process that we will develop.3. I do not agree with some people who take the loan and then invest the money in Crypto/Bitcoin. It will be quite risky and the worst cases that will occur we will experience problems at the loan site that we take and in the end everything is lost and we have to pay the loan every month.",
