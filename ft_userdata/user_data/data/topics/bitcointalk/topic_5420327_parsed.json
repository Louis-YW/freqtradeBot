Um, is there some other one???That said, I've actually read many of Einstein's papers as in actual published books printed in the 1950's and there is ZERO mention of him doing that.And just *who/why* did the supposed removal of it's mention in all books/papers/etc? Aliens?",

The reasoning behind it was that no showed up and that proved that travelling back in time is not possible.
