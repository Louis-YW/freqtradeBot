  "content": "Well, straightforward a member of our local section (Arabic section) started this thread hereHowever, after reading the whole topic I was surprised to find out that a member of our section got banned (ulven), and he is not just any member but someone from whom I learned a lot and who shared many useful informations in our section or else where in this forum. So because of that I really had to look into this matter. What I found out about the accusation against him where he is being accused that he uses an AI tool to create  his posts which means the same as facing plagiarism accusation that goes against the forum's rules and any member should get banned because of that.When I see the tools used to build the accusation against him I noticed something might be wrong and that these tools are also created by human beings and the same who created AI also thin thinks the same. Shortly and how I think is that, both can be detected and anyone can understand how both tools work after some uses so If there’s a detector simply because someone understood how AI were programmed not how they develop their self because there no such thing.Anyways a simple comparison of the same text with commas and points beside another text without them will show entirely different results.For more information that I have already gathered from the topic I shared the first time, some users accused one of our local board have shared some results accusing others of using AIs through certain tools. So we only compared some of their posts using the same tool they used to compare their own posts. Does this mean they are also breaking the rules and should be banned or is it just how the tool detectors are programmed to work: Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on September 28, 2023, 10:15:47 AMWho do you think is easier for scammers to deceive? Who often suffers because they do not know their rights? I think you already understand what I want to say. The more educated a person is, the more protected he is. Yes, it is probably difficult to get a well-paid job right away, but there is always a difference in who and what you can do. A person without education can be used in any direction, knowing that he will still not be able to stand up for himself since he is not educated. He can be paid less, and because he is in a hopeless situation, he will be forced to agree to all types of difficult and poorly paid work.But you, having several degrees of education, will never allow people to behave inappropriately towards you, firstly, having respect for yourself. Therefore, you should not think that people who strive for self-improvement will always remain at the bottom of life. There should always be a chance that should not be missed. It's always better than sitting and spitting at the ceiling and complaining about your poor life.This post is from lovesmayfamilis, is being declared as 100% fake : here  by the same AI detector used to accuse the user ulven, Im very sure that this post is 100% made by you but it’s only how the detector works…I might be wrong in what I said but what The informations I shared are accurate and can be verified. Plus I’m not accusing anyone I’m just trying to clarify things.So is it the fault if the AI detector or members in your opinion?",

There's no rule or a moderator said if using AI will lead you get banned, using AI might make your post contain someone else words, but based on my observation I don't find any user reported Ulven did plagiarize, CMIIW.2. Using one tool to detect someone using AI is still a weak proof, that's why nutildah mentioned several tools in his post. So only relying with sapling.ai to accuse lovesmayfamilis or anyone else did using AI is still a weak evidence. Remember there's always a false positive in programming, not to mention there's will be a \"fake site\" claimed to be as AI detector.I'd say case by case basis is still the best to assume someone is using AI, but using several tools might help you to make decision.Quote from: digaran on September 30, 2023, 04:47:41 AMWhere is the post/ thread accusing him of using AI? Someone reported him before, but as I said above \"there's no rule using AI will lead you get banned\".",

Do we even have autoban for AI detected content?Sorry this is the accusation first post is made here the user who accused ulven used a known AI detector tools which been used many time in our forum I believe, and because of this what I have done is just to try edit the text users posted and see why and how these detectors works. So I think it’s all before of some commas and some words that been used alot with AIs these detectors decide if it’s a human text or bot text. Which will be unfair of course in case there is a coincidenceQuote from: Plaguedeath on September 30, 2023, 04:54:31 AMThere are few things need to break down here.1.

We have known for years that you are a brilliant inspector, and we trust what you wrote.Of course, anyone who violates the rules of the forum deserves to be punished, and the two-month ban was a big lesson for this member, and he admitted his mistake. After this, he remained in the forum using his main account and published many valuable posts and topics to enrich the forum and benefit the members.Frankly, I do not rule out that these AI detector tools show Theymos or Satoshi as having plagiarism content/writing from artificial intelligence. I think that most of these detector tools, in my opinion, do not provide any correct or close to accurate results.Despite the fact that there is no rule preventing this in the Forum. Still, you can report a member by using these tools who uses AI and get his weekly payment in one of the signature campaigns that ban AI.Source: https://sapling.ai/ai-content-detector",

I think that most of these detector tools, in my opinion, do not provide any correct or close to accurate results.Right, there can be false positives, but if you'll try to go through big enough amount of posts on this forum with several most accurate AI detectors, you'll find out that nearly all posts are detected as written by human, 99,9% of all recent posts. It can also be false detected, because some little edited AI written text can be detected as human written, but well, not the hugest problem.So when you point that AI detectors are not a 100% guarantee, we know that already. But if you have a bunch of posts in a row which are detected by several best AI detectors as AI written, it will be highly unlikely that it is just a coincidence.And as for this exact case: how many human beings have a \"knowledge cutoff in September 2021\"?Quote from: Ulven on July 19, 2023, 08:33:17 PMIt is accurate to say that Daniel Ricciardo currently competes for McLaren and not AlphaTauri. For the 2021 and 2022 seasons, Ricciardo is under contract with McLaren as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. Future changes to a driver's team are speculative and subject to a variety of conditions, including team decisions and contractual commitments. Which team Ricciardo will eventually join is hard to foresee.",

This makes it 1000% obvious he is using AI to write his posts.I for one am of the opinion that copy/pasting AI-generated text is akin to plagiarism -- the poster is taking credit for something they didn't write. If they clarify that they used ChatGPT to write the post and put it in quotes, that would be another story. But they don't -- they just want us to believe these words are coming from their own brain, and they clearly aren't. Seems a little dishonest to say the least.",
