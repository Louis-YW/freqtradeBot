  "content": "Well, it's that time.  I'm ready to sell off another one of my Antaui's.I know this is BTC, but I've long been out of cryptocurrency.  I'd prefer USD, but feel free to make an offer in BTC.  If I feel it's worth the hassle (to me), I might take it.  You can find this specific coin in the linked Imgur gallery.If you have questions, or would like to validate my reputation, feel free to DM me and we can discuss other ways to connect. I know I use this old account of mine 1-2 times a year now, mostly to keep it alive and unload the few crypto assets I have left.Oh, and all of the stuff in the Imgur gallery is for sale.  However, the 5 WDC Antaui is the only thing that's crypto related.  Regardless, if somethings caught your eye, feel free to enquire about that too.Gallery: https://imgur.com/gallery/lGZlPYz",
