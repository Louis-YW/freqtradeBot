HD wallets use a single seed to generate an unlimited number of public and private key pairs, which can be used to generate new addresses on demand. This can save time and effort, while also reducing the risk of storing a large number of keys.Alternatively, if you provide more context on why you need to generate so many wallets, we may be able to suggest a more tailored solution that is both efficient and secure.",

This still poses a security risk that the code can be malicious and generate wallets non-randomly or send a copy to authors server, so the code should be independently verified or OP will have to just trust that they won't get robbed. But this isn't very different from typical crypto jobs when someone asks to create a service involving receiving money, and there's a risk that the developer will put a backdoor.",

Are you using the bulk wallet tab?What OS and browser?i7 11th gen that is having others issues is getting me 1000 every 90 to 100 seconds with windows 10 & firefox.Running vanitygen64 with 3 threads and dumping into a text files is getting about 30000 addresses a minute. -> Extrapolationg from that you should be able to do 10 million in about 6 or 7 hours. But that is just address and private key. You really can't pull them into any know wallet.-Dave",

FASTEST Way? Each wallet must be created with complatly a new Private key.You must be clear.What do you need?Wallet or address.You can create one HD wallet with a mnemonic seed, then create many receiving addresses. Each receiving address has its private key.Increase the gap limit in Electrum when you create new addresses.Code:wallet.change_gap_limit(100000)[wallet.create_new_address(False) for i in range(100000)]However 10M is out of capacity (not responding). You can try with smaller number, repeat it a few times. I try with 100000 and it works.You will get receiving addresses, then if you want to get private keys. Choose Wallets, Private keys, Export, and choose File format (JSON or CSV). Click Export to finish.",

But then again the details depend on the type of the service. What you would do for a custodian web wallet is different from non-custodian web wallet and different from an exchange and also different from if you want personal wallet for a service receiving payment (last one needs a single wallet with many \"child\" keys).In these cases you would need to discuss database (what to use and how).I can keep going but I think you get the gist. The other replies here are also all over the place because they don't know your purpose.P.S. Although with \"10 mil/day\" I'm guessing your goal is the first thing I said!Quote from: BlackBoss_ on May 12, 2023, 01:25:45 AMYou can try with smaller number, repeat it a few times. I try with 100000 and it works.Electrum wallet is not designed to handle large number of keys/transactions so I seriously doubt it can perform well for anything beyond a couple of hundred keys.",

I'm not just exactly sure if you can get this at onceon this, because 10M is too big for it. What are you going to do with the 10M address anyway?",

FASTEST Way? Each wallet must be created with complatly a new Private key.It's not an easy job to do. Something that is difficult if done alone, means that other people's services are needed to complete it.The services of others need to be valued according to the complexity of the work. I mean, if you want your job done but you can't, then you have to pay people to get it done.Because you don't want to convey what it is for, then try to go to the service section and make an offer. If anyone is suitable for the job, hire and pay according to the agreement.",

FASTEST Way? Each wallet must be created with complatly a new Private key.The simple answer to your question is do it yourself. Learn computer programming and then write your own scripts to generate that many wallets a day. You'll definitely need a beefy setup to create that many wallets a day. You should also keep in your mind that the thing can only be achieved if you know programming very well. If you are not good at programming than your best bet is to find a good programmers on freelancing sites and let them do the work for you. You must remember that the programmers will take a lot of money to create such programs for you. You can get some inspiration from bitaddress.org as that will be a helpful site for you.You can also try some Bitcoin wallet generation libraries as they will be helpful for you. You can use BitcoinJS library as a base for your script and if well programmed then you'll be able to generate 10 million wallets a day without a problem. It's not worth it to ask you that why you want to create so many wallets a day, but I would warn you if your intentions are not positive then you'll be responsible for the harm. If you intentions are good and you're doing it for development purpose than it's okay.",

Anyone with a bit of programming / database knowledge can setup a small block explorer that could with sufficient hardware keep an eye on 10m addresses. But there is no wallet in the world that can import them. But, since they could not even figure out how to generate them there is no way they could even be able to figure out the programming. -Dave",
