Is DdmrDdmr using which programs to merits numbers of people at same time, I received a merit from DdmrDdmr early today and I checked it's profile and I see almost hundreds posts merited by DdmrDdmr same time but with different minutes that's not above one minutes, does DdmrDdmr use bolt?? This is surprising, I have not seen someone who merit numbers of posts same time before, does it copy all the posts link that he wants to merit and past before meriting them? or it highlights all the user's he wants to merit, to be sincere this is confusing to understand how he does it, if you have knowledge of sharing a bunch merit at a time please explain.",

It’s obvious that is doing some kind of script to merit all the post that he bookmark in the past.

(v 36.0).Explanation @DdmrDdmr.Quote from: DdmrDdmr on July 13, 2019, 09:51:51 AMQuote from: fillippone on July 12, 2019, 10:13:26 PM<…>What I did was prepare a list of the last post I merited per active 2019 profile (at the time). That gave me 256 posts from distinct users to re-merit, although the toll was 250 in the end since 6 were deleted posts. The lists was pretty easy to draft up from my merit DB (if anyone wants a similar one I can provide it). That was the easy part. I then used a Firefox addon called Open Multiple URL and started the mechanical process of pasting batches of 10 to 15 URLs to the addon (it opens one URL per tab), meriting each post, and closing the tab. Sometimes an opened URL would give and error message (for trying to query Bitcointalk too many times in a short period of time), and I’d have to refresh the tab to get to the post. Pretty manual that part.The overall idea was to re-merit profiles I had merited before, and since I tend to perform mainly 1 sMerit TXs, it would seem fair and conceptually similar to being a bit more generous for once …Quote from: killyou72 on July 12, 2019, 11:57:18 PM<…>0,2K (started off with an eighth part of that, but upgraded during some Merit Source adjustment procedure).Quote from: philipma1957 on July 13, 2019, 12:15:10 AMThis is a good idea I have 323 merits still sitting I will go back to people I gave 1 merit and bump them.Using my same exact criteria, I make it 146 people you would re-merit (profile active in 2019 and selecting each one’s last merited post). I can provide you the list if you want (in a Google SpreadSheet or alike). Quote from: sheenshane on July 13, 2019, 03:32:16 AM<…>I’d still take human over artificial … for now …Quote from: DdmrDdmr on July 19, 2019, 10:56:42 AMVersion 2.0  - 19/07/2019 ( 278 profiles merited (by me) in 30 minutes)I gave it a rethink, and have decided to go on a second sMerit awarding spree from my personal batch. As before, my intention was to re-merit some posts that I had already merited previously (thus no need for me to review the post’s content) in order to get rid of my personal sMerits in a coherent manner. Since I normally award sMerits in TX of 1 (for the most), this allows me to lose my close to Ebenezer Scrooge complex when awarding sMerits, for a short interval of time at least. I have currently merited 513 different profiles. Since my personal sMerit batch is a bit under 300, I’ve had to trim the candidates to something reasonable. Criteria (based on merit data as of this morning):Award an additional sMerit to the last merited post (by me) of any profile that also meets:-   The last post merited by me has only been merited once by me (this allows me to not re-merit a same post both on spree v 1.0 and spree v 2.0).-   Regardless of the rank.-   The post was posted in 2019.-   The post has not received more than 10 sMerits, adding up all those received from anybody.That trimmed my list of candidate posts from 513 to 286, which fits my sMerit budget. Eventually, it was down to 278 posts that I merited, since 8 were either deleted or on ignore. I was faster this time than last time ...P.D. Holidays will leave me on halt for a week or so now.@DdmrDdmr, human is just like you OP, only he uses some special futur taps to waste S-merit.",

One thing I am sure is he merited those he merited before as I received merit in one of my post before where I received merit again with the same post (as stated on the thread).

This is not rocket science to understand that he used Bot to send merits. It's impossible for a human being to open thousands of posts and keep meriting them until his sMerits turn zero. Indeed, he never said in his thread that he uses a bot. I didBott check fillippone's thread to see if he responded there regarding using a bot. But, as he always uses some criteria to filter eligible posts, he must use his own made Bot or other secret services that he owns. You and I won't have access to those things because it's not for everyone. This particular thing is exclusively for himself, making him more exclusive. Quote from: Not your key not your BTC on May 28, 2023, 04:44:46 AMTrue, but he use bot, that should be complicated than manual, because he must know the quality post  Look at the quoted part belowQuote from: DdmrDdmrHave received merits from at least five different people since january 2023He used this criterion to detect quality posts. If five different people merit a post, this post must be worth meriting. So he uses this method to find quality posts. He also uses other criteria like re-merit his last merited posts. Sometimes he Manually merits users' posts and then re-merits those posts with his bot. That means he knows the quality of the post he is meriting.",
