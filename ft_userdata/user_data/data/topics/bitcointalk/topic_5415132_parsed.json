It is better that way. There are 2 reasons people buy accounts here. One is they want to earn money posting, which is why he wants Sr+ because full members are rarely picked by signature managers. The other reason is they want to look more legit to run their own thread, usually scams. Like when they launch an altcoin or an NFT, they want a high rank account backing them. It really doesn't matter if the account is being bought for the first or the second reason. If we say that it's ok if they want to buy an account to make money from signatures who's to stop people from buying 4 accounts and shitposting all over the forum with them, because he won't consistently make 100 good posts a week. At least half of them will be complete garbage.",
