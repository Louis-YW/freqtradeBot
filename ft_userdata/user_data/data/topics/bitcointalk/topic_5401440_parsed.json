In support of every other person's suggestion, bitcointalk is specifically meant for extensive contribution of cryptocurrencies especially bitcoin in quote and sub branches of bitcoin as lovesmayfamilis has said above. So will like you to pick note. And if really you want to agitate for this file against fighting of scam bounty projects in meta section or reputation and gather your opinion from other community users.",

Thank you.What exactly are you expecting moderators to do in situations like these? It seems like you have misunderstood what this platform is for and why it even exists in the first place. This is a platform for discussion and exchange of opinions, and the main duty of the moderator is to moderate such discussions and make sure that a user follows the forum rules. If you want to stop scam projects from being promoted, it would be better to urge bounty hunters not to apply for such campaigns. Obviously, this will never happen since the vast majority of bounty hunters do not give a damn about anything at all before joining a campaign.",

So what did you expect from those bounty managers that mentioned you above?  They even don't have enough reputation, so it does matter to them if they will promote scam projects as long as someone paid them and they will generate profit.  If you have joined a scam project once, stop bounty hunting if that is the same bounty manager.",

If we had the forum moderating scams I'm not sure I would've got burnt before learning my lesson. Now that I've moved away from bounties, there are other greenhorns who are obviously moving to it. There's never a shortage of inexperienced people there. Hunters unknowing supply to scam projects can be cut short if there's moderation. That's the point I'm making.",

In the real sense of the word, impossibility doesn't actually exist. It depends on who is handling the issue. Let me quickly draw your attention to something I (I'm sure several other members didn't know too) never knew could be done here – A user could've their username changed. I know a user who has had his moniker changed; not even once but twice. Before now I would've said that was impossible. So, on the issue at hand, once mods set their act on doing it; it's done.Quote\"feed a man once by giving him a fish, and next time give him a fishing rod.\"There are even some who will appropriately tell you to show them how to fish from the onset and never to even give them a single fish.
