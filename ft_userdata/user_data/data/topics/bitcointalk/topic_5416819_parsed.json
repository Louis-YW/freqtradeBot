  "content": "Hello. Yesterday I received BTC to my electrum wallet that I’ve been using for a year now. Then an error with electrum appeared, when I tried to send these bitcoins to my another address, new window opened on my Mac and told that I have error with electrum and whether I want to inform electrum about it or no. I clicked no and reloaded my laptop. When I tried to open electrum once again, it said that default_wallet (my wallet) doesn’t exist. It was shocking as I’ve been using electrum since 2018 and never had such issues.After that, I restored my wallet with seed phrase, but there is a problem: I had almost 500 addresses and only half of it restored. The last history of transaction is in December, but I’ve been using this wallet until 11th October. Bitcoins are not gone and are on blockchain (only received), I also could see this transaction in watch-mode after putting my BTC address of receipt. But unfortunately, I cannot restore this address and see my balance. (Increase Gap limit etc didn’t help). Would appreciate any help.",

There are 250 missing addresses, most of them were paid. I made transaction myself to this address, so I’m sure money are there. I also checked by the address on electrum (watch mode, money was there), on blockchain there is no sign that it was withdrawn, so wallet wasn’t hacked as well.Also, as you can read in my first message, money was there, I tried to withdraw it and then the error appeared. So I’m sure money is on the wallet.",

Even to 2000, nothing changes with the balance.Hmm, I can only guess that you had two wallets, one is your default_wallet and another, either one has 2018~Dec2021 txns and one with the latest.Since you have about 500 addresses, it'll be hard to monitor if you're actually using the one from 2018.Is there any chance that you've created another wallet with the same seed phrase but with \"extended words\"?In case, restore another wallet but enable the option \"Extend this seed with custom words\".Or different seed phrase?",
