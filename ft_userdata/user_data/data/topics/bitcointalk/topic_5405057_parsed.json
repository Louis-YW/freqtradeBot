It does hurt one's privacy but it does not matter to censorship. If a service wants to block you or an address it will. They will have an easier time if you keep using the same address but all you need to do is generate a new address or a few thousand new addresses. 2) Nope it does not work this way. There are always people talking about it, but it's not something to worry about.3) A has nothing to do with B. If quantum computers ever get to the point of being able to do something like that (probably not in our lifetimes) the entire encryption of BTC would be broken. Would not matter if it's one transaction or 1000s of transactions to and from an address. And Roniis is a side chain of an altcoin. Has nothing to do with BTC.-Dave",

Quantum computers could extract private keys if these addresses are re used.I think the Author is somehow misleading, if I want to re-use a wallet address multiple times for transactions, it doesn't give me any security harm to my private keys, also we have not seen any computers who have done that currently except for Quantum computers that have been making news but it is still hypothetical, nothing has been done so far. However, address reuse is a big concern when it comes to privacy, you cannot preserve privacy by using a single address for incoming and outgoing transactions every time, the chain surveillance are watching the network, and the moment you do that, you can easily be detected as the owner of the address and the big problem is that you wouldn't be able to combine it with other UTXOs as soon as that address becomes expose to chain analysts.So, technically, don't use an address more than once.Quote 2. It can leave one open to niche attacks and one becomes vulnerable to these cyber thieves who will extract private keys from signatures after a transaction has been made.A node can carry out a transaction Malleabity by changing your transaction ID on the network but they don't have the strength to extract the signature from a transaction, this point is kind of too off.",

If there were any risks then it would make the whole system obsolete not just reused addresses. The only serious issue with reused addresses is a privacy related one.Perhaps, the author is refering to the problem described here: https://web.archive.org/web/20160308014317/http://www.nilsschneider.net/2013/01/28/recovering-bitcoin-private-keys.html ?   As far as I understand, when the same address is reused, signatures are created with the same private key. This private key can be calculated if, and only if, the k-value (random integer) is either not-so-random (deterministic or weak entropy) or the said k-value is also reused. We are interested in the latter case because the former case doesn't require the reuse of addresses. So, if the wallet software in question is compromised, malicious, flawed, or outdated, or the user himself is trying to sign a transaction using a custom, poorly written ECDSA signature algorithm, it may result in a private key vulnerable to theft. If a wallet uses the same k-value each time it signs a transaction, an attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability and steal all the coins that still are on a reused address.",

Quantum computers could extract private keys if these addresses are re used.On the count of 1 as at above, talking about privacy, of course. The public keys were never to be private, that's why its called a public key. It was made to be opened to checks and verifications on transactions done on it but still, remains private as per the identity of whom is behind the address. Although, it puts it directly in the way of an attack to use an address way too often as the loads of coins on it makes it a target for hackers. This you can mitigate by simply generating new address as the need arises.On the count of 2&3, there isn't a way for which, private keys or seed phrase would be extracted from the public address nor the transaction signatures as these are just a means to the authenticity of transactions done on the blocks and have no links to the keys of the addresses behind.About quantum computers, of course they've got high processors and are relatively very smart but not up to the task of generating or guessing private keys just yet.",
