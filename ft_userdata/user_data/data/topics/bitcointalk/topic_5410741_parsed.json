After affording food if their is enough money one will  think of getting things thats makes him to be happy and live comfortable. It impossible to be rich and only spend money on food. Sometimes  you can even spend money on things that people will see as not important.",

But for me, money is for survival and if you can provide your basic needs, you are rich.    I fancy good life and I think that's the essence of working hard to make more money so that one can have an investment that will multiply your money in time to come so I see no wrongs if people work and make good money and buy whatever cars or luxury life they want to live. I don't like the word contentment because it will make you think you have gotten to your final destination when you have nothing to show for it.Money is used for survival when you have little or nothing but it is used for luxury when you have above the required amount for an average man which is for food, clothing, and shelter. So do not consider yourself as a rich person when you only have what to eat because your investment determines your level of wealth or financial capacity.",

But for me, money is for survival and if you can provide your basic needs, you are rich.    Remember that there is difference between poor and hungry. Poor means, you have money but it is not enough to feed yourself and the immediate family, but hungry means you don't have money to eat at all. That is there is no money to feed yourself and the immediate family. So someone that has money is also a poor person if you are not eating to satisfy yourself. Who is a poor man and who is a rich man is unknown base on disease diplomacy ideology. A country's president is classified as the category of a rich man but disease still kills such magnitude of wealth. In my own understanding or in my field of study, wealth is not measure by the things you acquired in life but by the lives you touch (helped). How many people have you raise up to become somebody in the society. Luxuries lifestyle is also part of the characteristics of wealth or rich because when someone has gotten money the next thing is to spend them. In the process of survival which the necessary part of money or rich, you also luxuriously enjoy yourself but do not forget to help the needy.",

It is sad, very sad, what we are currently witnessing, in my country, for example, young people want expensive brand things, they want expensive drinks and the most deplorable thing is that they steal, prostitute themselves in order to have these things. the person just sleeps and wakes up and suddenly he will only see your neighbor showing up with a luxury car, luxury suits even throw a big party with dozens of guests, they stay making noise until dawn, the crime of kidnapping has increased a lot in my country, because young people don't have a job and they want expensive things.

I wouldn't consider being able to simply fulfill your basic needs as being rich, you're simply getting by. Sure you are not poor (which meant lacking in certain needs) but you're not rich either. The problem is not the luxuries per se but if you put all your efforts for chasing after luxuries. You can only get so much joy from something before it get stale and then you'd have to move on to the next thing.",

My aunt lived in socialism in the 50s and she had no running water. Every day they'd have to go to the well, bring water, boil it on a coal stove in a giant pot and that was their water for bathing, laundry and washing dishes. There was almost no cars, people were riding bicycles or horse carriages. You were lucky if you had a motorcycle. As an adult she worked hard as a teacher and was able to afford a normal house with 2 bathrooms, running water, central heating, a garden. This was luxury for her as she had a washing machine, an electric oven, even her own car. That's all she wanted as a child and all her mother wanted but could never afford. I have even more than that. A computer, a mobile phone, fast Internet, a big, flat TV... I don't feel like I need my own jet, a Lambo. An expensive car is just another thing to worry about. I also don't need a bigger house. Cleaning this one already takes a full day if you want to be thorough. I don't want to be a slave of my own dreams.",

You may be poor in others' eyes yet you're rich within your soul. Rich in material possessions yet you've got a very poor way of living. So, that's a very subjective thought about being rich and there's even a difference between being rich and wealthy. It's a mindset that will make you look into things whether you treat yourself rich or not. You survive everyday for a living and for the less fortunate, they're already rich by having that.",
