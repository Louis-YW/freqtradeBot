My question is , what is best price to buy ? Buy now or wait to down 600$?What? Imho, best time was ages ago and 600 is highly unlikely. But anything you can get under 2000 is good. Also you can't time the bottom so you might be better of buying slowly during next year and dollar cost averge your price.",

      "body": "Don't go for the bottom or best time but instead focus on buying as much as possible while the price isn't in the ATH yet because once you missed buying those prices, you will regret why you didn't buy them when you have the money or time. I'm just saying this because nobody knows what will be the future of the coin we want to invest.What I'm trying to say is to focus on less risky than risk it all just to wait for the right price because there's no such thing as right price, you just have to earn the profit that you want.",

Buy now or wait to down 600$?Maybe you are the one who passed up the opportunity to buy ethereum for $900 because then you were waiting for the price to go lower and now you regret that eth did not decrease but increased and now eth price is x2. If you don't dare to buy for $900 why would you want to buy for $1900. I don't know if you are newbie to the market or new to this forum, but you should take the time to learn more before you want to invest in crypto.",

Best time to buy ethereum is already pass the most convenient or less risk is investing on ethereum during the year that it is not very well known and it is in a very low price same with bitcoin i think it is on year 2010 if im not mistaken. For now i think it is still risky though the market is slowly recovering we still dont know if it is a bull run or a bull trap keep searching for good.",

But honestly, the best time was years ago like one and two digits on 2016 and 2018. For someone who's long term, you buy now and set a selling price in the future that's higher than your bought price.Quote from: rhodelmabanal on August 17, 2022, 04:03:41 AMBest time to buy ethereum is already pass the most convenient or less risk is investing on ethereum during the year that it is not very well known and it is in a very low price same with bitcoin i think it is on year 2010 if im not mistaken.

Buy now or wait to down 600$?The best price to buy is the price you can accept because even if it drops to $950 but you can't accept that price and wait until the price drops to $600, it's not the best price for you.You have to rethink if you want to wait for the price to return to $950 because it may not come back again. After all, now the price of ethereum is $1800. But really, no one knows whether the price will stay at the current level or go back down sharply and we can only wait. So to find the best price to buy, you have to do your own analysis and not follow other people's advice.",

My question is , what is best price to buy ? Buy now or wait to down 600$?Unfortunately, no one has the crystal ball to see if Ethereum will still go down to $600 or not. So maybe the best approach is do to DCA. I know your frustrations, we always wanted to buy at the lows, but it's hard to time the market as it is.And I would say that there are traders that got lucky to be able to buy < $1000 because they have profited already. Or maybe you are not that late because next month we will have the merger in the mainnet and it is schedule - Sept 15/16 as this news could trigger another Ethereum run.",

Buy now or wait to down 600$?Just wait as you please if you want to buy ethereum for $600 which I don't think is possible, and if you look and compare with current prices. And the difference is huge and it takes quite a while for the price of ethereum to drop to the price you want.it's good to buy anytime as long as the price is still below the previous high of ATH, and hold it for the long term, and buy with money you can afford to lose before the price of ethereum continues to rise.",
