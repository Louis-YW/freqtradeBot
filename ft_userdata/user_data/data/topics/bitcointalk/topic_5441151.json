      "body": "I thought that you'd be giving us some image on how to determine these useful chart patterns that you're saying.But it seems that you're directing us to telegram channels where you've published these courses. But looking at it, you've got a lot of views from there. If it's just a course then I'll check them out but it feels unusual for me if the course is on telegram. I think it's more relatable if you put this thread on Trading Discussion.",

      "body": "All these lessons are in most of the time related to technical analysis which most of the time is in short term.By following patterns or watching courses on trading I still don't know anyone or a majority of people who made a decent substantial win from these lessons which can be applied to any tradeable market stock or asset and this to me means that trading is the same as gambling,as even in gambling there is not a majority that have made a substantial profit,sure there are very few people who have hit the jackpot (which unfortunately have lost it all after some years) but the majority are not winners,same as if we follow patterns.I only believe in the long term prospect of holding crypto to win more after some years as that is what history has shown us so far,lastly I also agree this is more in the Trading Discussion section.",

If you can give a more useful links to discuss these patterns it can be a big help, to beginners this is good if you are still learning trading and still learning how to use these patterns.",

Now I found this topic here and understood that you are seeking to increase the number of followers on your Telegram channel, and the main goal is not to share knowledge.If your goal is to spread awareness of the basics of trading, it is better to publish these analyzes here on the forum, and make sure that a larger number of followers of your Telegram channel will benefit from it. Or to publish an official announcement for your Telegram channel and update it periodically with new lessons or even direct links to the lesson on the channel.",

Because it covers intermediate to even advance trading pattern that can all help us.As for the OP, hmmm, it's better not to direct anyone to your Telegram group. It has been frown upon by the community, specially coming for newbies. So the better approach is to just post everything here in the beginning. And later just put a disclaimer about your Telegram, IMHO.",

      "body": "Indeed this is a good lesson. But obviously everyone here might thinking that you just needed views and followers. Not sure if this is a violation on forum since OP doesnt have any form of referral but attracting viewers in a very subtle manner. Anyway I suggest that it much better to post the content even with images and explanation rather than luring some of us here. It could turn to a beautiful tutorial instead of us thinking of beung used as a viewer for probably paid content on your telegram.",
