What? I'm lost.I guess that you've badly mixed up some things.Kleopatra is great for verifying your Electrum download, to make sure you won't be using a malicious clone.If you use Electrum, it's easy. First step is to pick an address from your wallet, for that you should start with View->Show Addresses and pick an address from the Addresses tab (maybe label it too, to know which one you've used). Then in Tools->Sign/Verify message you will fill the address and the message you want (usually containing your bitcointalk name and the date of signing). Press sign, you'll obtain the signature.The format to post it is in the previous post.Edit: an image for you, maybe it helpsQuote from: https://intercom.help/bity-help-center/en/articles/4574980-how-do-i-sign-a-message-with-my-bitcoin-address",

TL;DR solution: Electrum > Tools > Sign message.Yeah most of user sign message with Electrum wallet to verify it and you are right on the part that the app is available on play Store and App store where you can download it easily rather then falling for scam links in order to scam you of funds.",

All of the staking method are unique and we must make sure that we are using a corresponding wallet and how that will work on your case. Also use non custodial with related to dex and thats much better than centralized exchange. It can be compromise if the exchange wont work well.",
