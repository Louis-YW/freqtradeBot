It is not only that there is not emotion in demo account like real account. In real account, you can trade with just $10 on many trading platform. There are even many trading platforms that you can trade less than $10, even with $1. So why the need for demo account? It is totally not useful for me and I did not use itnwhen I was learning how to trade.When I started to trade futures, my first position was opened with just $0.25. see how low in amount of dollar it is. So why demo account when you can go that low in the amount of money that you can use to open a position to study the how trading works.",

Trading is a long journey, you should not think about making money instantly, because in trading anything can happen and losing are more possible if you do trade without having your own analysis. If you want to learn the process and feel the hype or fud, better start trading small and you’ll learn more from this.",

The biggest component of trading is emotions, without real money, there are no \"real\" trading emotionsDemo accounts are only good for newbies if they are trying to learn how to make orders, create stop losses etc. Besides, most demo trading platforms are illiquid and do not depict the actual trading environment. A good example are the Binance and bybit demo trading platforms. They suck in every bit, especially if you are an experienced trader.",

What do you think?It's pretty difficult to continue using a demo account for a long period of time, because it will get to a point where you'll no long feel any zeal to keep on using using it because you really don't have anything to lose. You might even see it as a game. It better to just try it for a little while once you get familiar with everything there's for you to know then switch to a real trading account where you can experience the real thing, and not some demo whatever.",

Demo account is good when testing a strategy on the current market movement to eliminate the risk.

I know that actual trading is different on demo trading because of emotion but this emotion is negligible if you have a strategy that being followed like a rule book on trading.",

You need practice to test your knowledge and adjust yourself. If you code your trading bot, you can use demo account to test it just like developers use testnet to test their code before they deploy it on mainnet.Demo account and trading with it is good but it is different than real trading with your real capital. If you don't use trading bot, trading with real capital will cause you to be more sensitive with your emotion which can lead to trading mistakes, bad order decisions. You won't have chance to practice and control your emotion with demo accounts.",

Learning the basics is important which demo account is good. But if you don't risk some kind of real money, you won't feel the pressure to win which if you keep playing the demo, you might not learn until you lose some funds. ITs why losing is important also",

What do you think?Demo account serves as a trading training only.  And this is an important aspect for beginners. For those who don't know how to buy and sell a coin and other training details. They can only train them from a demo account.  Moreover, there is no value in the demo account, there is no benefit even if there is a profit or loss. So people who can trade and trading experts I don't think they use demo account and waste there time.  It is used only by those who are new to trading.Quote from: Coin_trader on March 31, 2023, 01:03:58 AMQuote from: Davidvictorson on March 30, 2023, 08:12:33 PMWhat is your honest review of the Demo account?I use it when I’m not confident on the market while I still want to trade without losing my for my self satisfaction.

Many people go to trade with large amount without understanding well about training, in this case they face big loss if they take wrong entry due to not understanding well about trade.  So in this case it is very effective to test your strategy on a demo account",

Do not use it for too long and consider it as a place where we will have experience for actual trade later. There is a huge difference when using a demo account and a real account. I bet that even if you win on a demo account, you will soon lose on a real account. Psychology and emotions will be completely different. As for me, I never use and encourage anyone to use a demo account, it will very easily lead us to have wrong habits and actions when using a real account.",

After this, you can also consider copy trading as a part of your success while gaining experience from demo trading at the same time copy trading will guide you from trading, copying the trades of more experienced traders would be a great idea IMO.",
