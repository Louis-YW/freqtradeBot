Adopt the use of DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) strategy in acquiring your bitcoin4. Study the chart daily and make a night watch on the candles5. Make sure you learn everything about bitcoin and be independently satisfied with what you have, know when to sell from when to hold.As long as you didn't depend on anyone to make your decision, but instead you take time to make discoveries on yourself then bitcoin still put you on a best opportunity plan against the future with your investments.",

In addition, exercise discipline in all financial decisions, just as you would in any other area of the market for investments. And more importantly, improve your security and privacy to protect your hard earned money.That is how you stay in the long run.",

If you are not able to hold your bitcoins about four years, risk to have loss would be higher.To hold bitcoins, you must not use all money you have to invest in it.

Financial freedom and the possibility to be your own bank, and to make transactions 24 hours a day, 365 days a year with anyone anywhere in the world without having to ask for someone's approval is the real value that Bitcoin has.There are few people who appreciate Bitcoin for what it is, and most of them are interested in the possibility of providing them with profit, but this is a reality that needs to be accepted. For all those who think like this, there is no simpler method than to buy in a bear market and then start selling when the bull market is at its peak or when they are satisfied with the profit that the current price brings them.",

Because when you diversify your portfolio, you spread your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions. This means that if one investment performs poorly, the impact on your overall portfolio is minimized, because the losses from that one investment are offset by gains in other investments.And last but not least, always invest money you are willing to lose! In summary, investing always carries some level of risk, and it's important to be prepared for the possibility of losing some or all of your investment, but it doesn't mean to invest all of your money without a plan or research.",

Success in investing in Bitcoin depends on how you do it. In addition to needing capital, you need to prepare mentally to face the worst that might happen.You can collect Bitcoin in stages, don't forget to do a Bitcoin price chart analysis when you want to buy. Chart analysis can give you an overview when you want to buy. If you see the chart has broken above the downtrend and the lows are starting to climb higher, it is a sign that the bear market is showing signs of ending. In this condition the market will turn into a bull market which is likely to occur, your mentally will be tested here, whether you want to enter or not.",

Sometimes we can't keep it due to financial constraints even if we want. First of all an investor must have a stable income of his/her own to fund. Bitcoin's current price is now about 74 percent lower than before. I think this is the best time for buying bitcoin. The most important thing is to buy bitcoins at low prices and hold it patiently until the right time. Since investors are aware of the potential of Bitcoin, success is guaranteed by investing in Bitcoin at this time without any hesitation. But here only those who can hold the patience will get success.",
