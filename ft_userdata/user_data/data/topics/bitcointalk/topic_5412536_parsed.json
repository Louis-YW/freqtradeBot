  "content": "Web Intelligence is a software network project created to focus on solutions to problems in the Web3 internet world. It aims to provide developers with DApp modules and ready-made software that have been further developed and presented with increased efficiency in addition to standard programs and software. It can offer community solutions for developers by offering ready-made modules that can be used with many software. RPC systems are one of the main advantages of open-source Typescript software.Advanced DApp CommunityGet access to open-source Typescript and React software optimized for developers.Market-Based PlanningAll work is focused on growing the WEINT Token market. WEINT Token strengthens its role in software and DApp development. Check out our Marketpaper for the complete marketing map.Live CommunityOur community is constantly up to date and active. You can be informed about all the developments by following our social media accounts.Proactive SolutionsWe act to instantly evaluate and improve the systemic errors and requested/anticipated improvements indicated by the community.Advantages for DevelopersAll developers aim to develop DApp programs for Web3 and blockchain technologies and to build a new Web3 structure by synchronizing DApp systems they developed with Solidity foundations with smart contracts. This process is quite difficult and requires research. Developers without experience and resources may make limited developments with limited resources in the development process.Web Intelligence, or WEINT project, aims to create a community-supported library by addressing the power of the developer and developer community and making this library available to developers. Developers can have content created with many WEINT bases such as Yield farming, Swap Frontend SDK, TypeScript-based open source studies, Ether.js, and Solidity studies prepared as examples in this library. Developers must have WEINT Tokens and use WEINT.DAPP systems to gain access to the entire library.Advantages for HoldersThe number of people investing in Web 3.0 in blockchain and crypto money technologies, which are constantly growing and developing, is increasing. Web3 projects, which are primarily the focus of big technology companies and large crypto money investment groups, manage to prove themselves in the crypto money market. As an investor part of the WEINT project, you can witness growth of our community.You can take part in a project that grows with us by witnessing all the developments from our Telegram and Twitter accounts. Of course, the only advantage of holders is not to grow together with the community, but also farms, pools, Airdrop, etc. that will be created within WEINT Token in the future. You will be entitled to participate in events.Software UnitOn the GitHub and WEINT.DAPP repository systems that the Web Intelligence project will create in the coming weeks, many developers will come together in a common module pool to provide mutual benefit. This business model was created in a way that aims to provide mutual benefit and evaluate the WEINT Token market. It will not be possible to use any other cryptocurrency in Web Intelligence modules and software. All developments, shares, and events will be carried out exclusively with WEINT Token to increase market growth and community-added value. Within the Web Intelligence repository files, all WEINT Token holders can use the software of other developers and upload their own software into the repository as they wish.ImportanceWeb Intelligence did not want to build its foundation on a selfish and caring ecosystem. Almost all the projects that exist in the crypto money market take a share of 30% - 40% for themselves under the name of the ecosystem share and spend this share unnecessarily. Web Intelligence, all aiming to benefit, wanting to grow with the community, and for itself, bought WEINT Tokens to provide the 7% initial rise share, placing the remaining 93% share on the market via PancakeSwap. The more the community grows, the more WEINT Token holders have faith that they will grow together.WEINT.DAPPUsing the WEINT.DAPP TESTBOARD system, Web Intelligence DApp developers will be able to use their development in a synchronized Remix.Ethereum online platform. The WEINT.DAPP TEST BOARD system, which is compatible with Typescript and Reacts, will require WEINT Token to maintain the market balance and provide market making. Expenses for the tests will be covered by WEINT Token. Amounts spent will be provided with very low (LOW GAS) payouts using BSC network foundations. Developers can move the Repository workspaces they have created on TEST BOARD to Public MAINBOARD. RPC Support will initially be available for ETH and BSC networks.Start-UP Phase (NOW)Community launch and early access development of the project.Initiation of small-scale marketing strategies as stated in the “Marketing Plan” document.First activity of social media accounts and promotion of WEINT project on all social media platforms.Trending of the WEINT project on the most well-known voting sites.Q&A live AMA event about WEINT.

Based on Bitcoin, the volatility in the market can cause high losses and high-profit rates. Most investors can make a loss with a very large percentage of their money. Please consider all your risks before investing. The Web Intelligence Network (WEIST) Project is a GEM (New Project) project created in the crypto money industry and its main purpose is to become one of the cryptocurrencies called Major. Of course, since the market volume is low and it is a new project, pool activity, and transaction sizes may cause sudden increases and decreases in the project. Please consider these risks! Note that the amount of liquidity in the pool is temporarily not locked and the community project will be locked for 12 months after the GitHub repository and WEIST.DAPP systems are opened! Until our WEIST.DAPP and GitHub repository domains are open to the community and we create the DAPP. Solidity system compatible with our own LP Smart contract, it is not possible to extend the lock period at this time! For all your questions, you can send us a message through our community channels.",
