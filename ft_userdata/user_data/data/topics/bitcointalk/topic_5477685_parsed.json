Thanks in advanceWhy?Web wallets are the most vulnerable wallets that you can see today. Do not use any of them. For small amount of coins, you can use Electrum, Sparrow or Bluewallet. For large amount, you can use a hardware wallet like Passport if you do not have a device to setup a wallet on an airgapped device. Or you can go for a multisig wallet.",

Thanks in advanceWeb wallets are not popular these days because they are not secure and we have better options, so I think you need to learn more to get a better option to store your bitcoins. If you can't get your hands on a hardware wallet yet, you can also consider some of the suggestions people mentioned above. Among them, I am also using bluewallet for my iOS devices and electrum for my desktop. Those are the two wallets that in my opinion are the best and easiest to use for those new to this market. Both are open source wallets, no KYC required as you requested.",

      "body": "I used to have Blockchain.info, but it's considered less safe than other options. Honestly, though, my primary reason for switching to a different wallet wasn't that: it was an occasional bug with 2FA, locking me out of my wallet for some time because of confirmations not arriving. Like many others here, I don't understand why you're looking for a web wallet, and I support the recommendation of Electrum that a few other people made here. There's no ID required, no KYC, no other private information. It's free, it's non-custodial (so you're the only one who has access to your money), and while it is a bit less used-friendly than Blockchain, in my opinion, it's not hard to switch to it and get used to its design. Just make sure you keep your pass phrase and password safe because if you lose the phrase and the password, nobody will be able to help you get your money.",

And there is a difference between the 3 wallets you mentioned: only the bluewallet wallet is an open source wallet, while the other 2 wallets are non-custodial wallets but are closed source wallets and are not recommended for use. You should stay away from custodial wallets and closed source wallets. But the OP also makes me curious because web wallets aren't talked about much these days and aren't used anymore, why does he keep looking for them when we have better options?",

Why were blockchain.com, and bitpay booted out of bitcoin.org? What web wallets do you recommend other than those on that list there?OP is still looking, even after 5 years the same question bothers him  For those who wonder why and give him suggestions to use a non-custodial desktop wallet, I can say that he is already familiar with Electrum, which he used, but some things were obviously not clear to him then, and it seems not even today. I just hope that in his search (if it's true at all) he won't find that online wallet that has \"free\" in its name, and because of which many were left without their coins.",

I won’t recommend to store these valuable coins in any web wallets available. They don’t give you complete access to the coins that you store there.
