This game is already under trading which gambling casino already not interested anymore to compete on exchange since that is not there main area of games. Options, Binary and Leverage trading is the activity that you are looking for that has this kind of mechanics. I hope it will helps you.",

Although they don't allow you to bet on bitcoin price on shorter time frames. Rather they only have the option to bet on bitcoin monthly price prediction. Besides bitcoin, they give you option to bet on Ethereum as well as their own native Fun token.https://freebitco.in",

All gambling sites have their freedom of options to choose which games or things people can bet on on their platform, there is no fixed rule that all betting sites must feature the same things, hence the reason why only a few of them eg \"freebitco.in\" feature betting on bitcoin price.",

Betting the price is fun as well, but on this option it can be more predictable since you can analyze the price just like how trading works and this could be one of the reason.",

But be careful, I do not like binary option, I do not know how trustworthy those sites are, do more research about the sites.I think this is different from trading because in trading, there are pairs or two different coins which are involved but in gambling you will simply double your money if you win but you will still end up with the same type of coin. Trading is also faster while betting on the price will end on a specific time but I know it wasn't instant.Trading can still be linked in gambling because of its high risk but trading is more on skill because you have different features to apply on your trades not unlike to betting on the price where you can only choose a price or input your desired price and do nothing after that but simply wait for the results.",

Binary options are still a thing although it's not something you can find on a gambling platform anymore. It has been on dedicated trading platforms and I think it's best to be that way since the focus of gamblers are not on the price of bitcoin anyway.

Prediction is short period of time might be more easy, many site don't have this feature. Many are still used to bet in sports and other gambling games, the interest for price prediction is quiet low because for sure, it requires a lot of work before you are able to bet and predict the right price.",

Binance is a popular exchange that introduces \"Futures Trading\". For more info, you might want to check out the Futures section in the Binance platform. Just be careful as even how wonderful profit in Futures Trading, if you don't play it right, it can wreck your funds. Just to clarify, Binance is not a gambling platform.Regarding the suggestion of others to check Freebitco.in, I think the betting about Bitcoin price there is more of long-term prediction like what the price on the specific date etc. and not the usual binary options that OP wants.",
