But as played (a phrase we use a lot in poker) I would use the snowball method: pay off small debts first, regardless of the interest. From smaller debt to bigger debt. It doesn't make mathematical sense so much as psychological sense, and that's the important thing.",

I know that paying up the debt with highest interest rate would look better, but I just feel like if I can remove the number of debts instead of amount, I would be able to focus easier. So, I would pay up the one with $500 and least interest first, then move up from there.However, if I have this much debt and only 80 dollars to pay them, that's a problem, we are talking about 30k+ dollars debt and only 80 dollars per month to pay it, banks would not allow you to keep paying them with this little amount of money, they will ask you to pay a lot more per month to cover this for sure.",

Credit cards commonly charge 10, 20, 30% or even higher - not fractions of a percent. If you wanted to pay the least amount in interest then you would simply pay off the highest interest rate card and work your way down the list, it's not a difficult concept to understand. The amount owed on the card is pretty much irrelevant in that scenario, as you have to pay back the borrowed capital and just want to seek it increasing by paying off the highest charging card until the balance is all cleared. It is not a complicated calculation, although in other circumstances with a card or two with mega low balances, you might want to pay them off first just to consolidate and have a little more peace of mind that there are less cards outstanding.",

That is less than 1k per year, besides I do not know if the numbers on the interest column are wrong because it is impossible for a credit card to have such a low interest, I could believe 9% per month but not 0.09%, if that is the case then that 1k per year would not be even enough to pay the interest rate of a single month from the fifth credit card, so someone with that kind of debt and such a low amount of money has probably ruined their life already.",

I hear you could stretch your credit amount whenever you use it frequently, so the other cards are unnecessary. The only solution for me if I am in that position is just to give back the other 4.

You could prolly discuss your situation with relatives that are more well-to-do than yourself, if they could help you with some money to pay off some of your debts, they could give you the money outrightly, or even if you are going to pay back it might not come with any interest or fixed payment time.Having said that, even if you don't wish to do this, you might have to resort to selling your valuables, or doing extra jobs, but the thing is that you must do something that will fetch you more than $80 monthly to cover your debt, anything legal that will earn you more, notwithstanding the inconvenience has to be done.",

I learnt in a book I read sometime back, that paying off debt should not be done at once, instead, little fractions be paid off as an investment. What is meant is that, if the bills were incurred because they helped provide a solution to a pending need, it should first be attended to, because it can sure be an open tap to more opportunities(if you know what I mean). Payments from the least, if possible in full. If not possible to be paid in full, it can be divided into fractions and cleared off from the least to the biggest. Big debts can also be paid in fractions, but if one is not careful, more debt can be incurred. Just like the saying, robbing Peter to pay Paul ain't a smart move most of the times.",

Assuming you are \"asking for a friend\", I would highly suggest that you pay off the ones that are easiest to pay. Personally it allows me to confidently be able to pay off the other debts that progressively becomes more expensive as time progresses. Some may agree with me and that's because I also found that stratagem here in this forum, and has tremendously helped me build up good behavior especially when trading and taking up debt. So next time, don't go into debt, at least the ones that you couldn't afford to pay triple, and when you do, which I know you will because we are all human beings here anyway and we need cash every minute of our waking hour, start paying up your debt, little by little.",
