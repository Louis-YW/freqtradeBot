So buddy point of notice here is OgNasty from which depart or I would say school thought you are asking this question is it for the supply, hash rate, mining pools, Nodes Distribution, Market Platforms (Exchanges & Firms, etc), or the development. In a few words, Bitcoin is far more decentralized when it will be compared. That's why it's called BTC BTC. Haha seems like I said something in flow it's BTC because it's BTC.Anway for your question there are some factors that give a point to people thinking for Bitcoin to be centralized which in a theoretical manner can be proved but with the actual resources it's near impossible.Quote from: tbct_mt2 on August 10, 2023, 11:17:29 PMIf Bitcoin becomes centralized, it won't lose all its value.

Is this a point to prove that Bitcoin won't lose it value, What the Altcoins had to do with the Bitcoin valuation or in reverse methodology as well, Do you mean Bitcoin won't lose its value to 100$ because there are other currencies having lower value compared to Bitcoin? Brother, you could have said that BTC won't lose because there is a large community standing behind it, Because it's not easy to manipulate the resources, Becasue Bitcoin always stands on the top because of its market capital, or anything making more sense.Not an offensive motive but really I wasn't expecting such type of explanation from a senior.",

Was looking for this because this was my first thought regarding OP's definition of bitcoin being centralized. I think the reason that this will fail though is that a lot of us would caught wind of this probably and persuade each individual to try and fight that centralization attempt by this malicious entities and I think that there's still more individual hodling bitcoins compared to companies.Of course there are concerns that arise that may cause us to think that bitcoin becomes centralized like a monopoly in mining but as a community fighting actively against it and the nature of bitcoin being decentralized, it's close to impossible for that concern to ever happen.",
