If you're a citizen of Europe and you read the news you should know that Europe is getting in trouble with all the forms of energy.I would not be surprised if shortages and even higher prices will be in place in the next winter. Right now in many European countries the governments subsidize the prices for end users (but not for businesses!!) so you should really-really do very good your homework before investing big money into hardware.",

You said that you had a place in Finland where you could start your mining opeartion, but are you from Finland too or are you from some other country? I have also been fantasizing about starting a mining operation but I have a few other ideas about how to get cheaper energy, namely solar panel farms and other sources. But I have also another thing in mind but I'm stil not sure if singular citizens are eligible for what I have in mind or if I alreaddy have to own a business!",

That means that also in extremely expensive countries like Norway there is very very cheap electricity. If that would be a rule for it Norway wouldn't have the most expensive gasoline either.The best price you could get as an energy-intensive manufacturing business will be around 6 cents prior to taxes, while services price starts at 11 euro cents with the consumer at 13 Eurocents, there are some other numbers about 6-7 for households but that's a subsidy from the Government and you won't qualify by running 10 3kw miners.Also, do not lump all nordic countries into the same model, while Norway might indeed have a lot of hydropower, in both Sweden and Finland nuclear is the main producer of electricity, hydro in Finland for example is just 1/6 of the total.Anyhow, I think that OP just looked over some figures, saw a yearly average of industrial prices at 7 eurocents per kWh and thought why not, then, reality kicked in and saw what the real prices are including VAT, so, back to square one. Trying to set up a mining business in Europe without some solid connections that might be able to grant you a two-year contract on some below-market prices in an already cheap country it's just business suicide right now.",
