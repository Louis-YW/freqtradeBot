With a limited 14 day period to claim 14 activities, it would take at the fastest 480 days or 16 months to get them, except you register during the activity window and claim the full 14 points. It is then down to how quickly you get merited[1] FAQ: Everything you need to know about forum 'activity, account ranks and merit - Jay -",

Out of them:-   194 are currently Hero Members.-   157 have shot through Hero Member rank and are now Legendary Members.-   147 have made it and or surpassed Hero Member rank, starting from Newbie rank when the Merit System was introduced (57+21+33+36 of cells shown on the first link below).If we delimit the account creation date to those created from the 01/01/2020 onwards, 28 accounts have become Hero Members (starting from Newbies), 4 of which surpassed the rank and are now Legendary members.Additionally, there are 1.816 Merited Sr. Member accounts that have the Activity to reach Hero Member rank, but lack the Merits (and have received at least 1 Merit). Out of these, 65 have met at least 80% of the Merit requirement, and are therefore well on their way to Hero Member rank. There is an additional 238 Sr. Members which have [60%-80%) of the Merit requirement met, and the remaining 1.513 have fulfilled less than 60% of the Merit requirement.Doable, but not effortless ...See: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ddmrddmr/viz/BitcointalkMeritDashboard/Ranked-uphttps://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ddmrddmr/viz/BitcointalkMeritDashboard/Ranking-upPipeline",

This means that if you manage to get 500 merit and claim 490 activity points in 17.5 months, then I'm sure you will rank up to hero member. But it's just a basic formula which in reality will not be shared by all users on this forum due to many factors. But the formula worked for all forum users before the merit system was introduced.Take just one example: On October 19th, I will be 2 years old on this forum as a young user. I managed to rank up to Hero members last week when I managed to collect 490 activity points even though I already got 1000 merit faster. But you'll find plenty of other examples that will prove that there were thousands of users before me who were still stuck in the ranks of newbie, Jr members, Members, Full members and Sr members even though they had enough activity points - but they didn't have enough merit. So everything is not the same, everyone will definitely have a different forum journey, there is no right time to rank.",

      "body": "The activity you will gain is fix 14 points every fortnight if you remain active during this time so you can see from the above examples that you can reach Hero member activity in how much time if you calculate it actually so the rest is completely dependent on your merit score how fast you gain,in accordance with activity or slow merit score.Some has crossed the mark of 500 merits but lag the activity and will be officially Hero member when they gain the required activity on the forum while some have activity and lack merits to reach that rank so it's all dependent on you how well you maintain your forum journey.You need 500 merits say which is in your hand as activity you will get despite the merits also if you are active so say you gain 1-2 merits daily you will get 500 merits in 8-9 months or even faster if you contribute more effectively and your post quality is high and helpful to the forum members like @n0nce has crossed all the merits and still a senior rank member on the forum.So there are many possibilities but depends on your merit and activity score.",

Make 1 post every 2 weeks, do that for a few years, then join some bounty spam campaigns and you'll quickly reach 1000 Activity.You'll still be a Newbie though",
