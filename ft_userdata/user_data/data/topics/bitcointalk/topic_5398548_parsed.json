Follow what had mentioned above if this is supposedly an ANN thread.Although this kind of game is really 99.99% based in luck and cant be cheated but using a new website is too risky since theres no account required just sending token to random website and bet with your tx hash.",

They were kind, fast, and speaks English.I hope you can meet all the necessary requirements a player needs.Good luck!",

It seems referral link to me. If the OP is finding it hard to speak in english, maybe he should find other member from the group who is comfortable or can communicate with english here. The gambling site is like an on-chain gambling site, however, attracting players is still a challenge for a new casino here. One of their games is saying they will give you an instant rebate of 2x of your betting amount. I don't know if it is a bait or not, but that is a tempting offer to would-be gamblers on the site. So let's see how far they can attract gamblers here.",

If this is your casino website, I think you should offer some promotion through this forum as it is one of the most highly regarded forums of the crypto community. Additionally, you should buy a cooper account and make a proper introduction and annoucement post about your launch. Let the world know about it. This way you will gain a lot more attention and recognition than just creating a thread without any promotion and /or information. All the major crypto casinos were launched through a forum post, either with the announcement or proper advertisement. If this is not possible, then I'd suggest you contact some of the campaign managers and get an announcement posted. Usually, they can post an announcement for you.Anyway, as I mentioned earlier, welcome to the Bitcointalk. It looks like you have a nice project in mind and I wish you best of luck on your journey. Good luck!",

You might want to elaborate on this because, it sounds a bit sketchy to me.I don't see the promotion strategy to be of its best as, it doesn't point out in one look what the site or project is about.
