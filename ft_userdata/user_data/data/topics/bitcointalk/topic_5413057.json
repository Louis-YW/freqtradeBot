Plenty persons will be excited for this new development, there were too many unresolved issues with their first project, they did not even wait a while for those issues to be sorted out and for people to forget about the thousands and millions that they lost before starting a new project. That's very inconsiderate, a show of greed, and a nonchalant behavior. The bitter lesson Luna thought some persons will forever champion and fuel disbelief against new projects, even the credible ones.",
