The nature of the news can influence people's action in certain ways. A positive news about bitcoin will encourage people to buy, while bad news concerning bitcoin will make people who have bitcoins want to sell, or reduce the demand for bitcoins which then affects the price. The news influences the price of bitcoins.",

      "body": "Of course, positive news about Bitcoin sometimes really does contribute to the market uptrend, But sometimes it might not really be the news but some other things. Some months ago, I think it was during the period when El Salvador approved of Bitcoin as a legal tender, and the price of Bitcoin really did see an uptrend, but some people were really saying that the rise of the price of Bitcoin then was not because of the news but rather something else, which later it was discovered that there were two incidents that took place then and it was not certain the one that leaded to price increase.    Although the price increase of Bitcoin yesterday really happened so fast, I was just monitoring the market that yesterday, and I can say it might be because of the announcement the FED made.",

As positive news results in market uptrends, so negative news also have effect in price downtrend of the market. Some people really take advantage of the event of news to accumulate more bitcoin when the news is negative and the price begins to drop, showing a good sign of buying more. And on the other hand, sell when there’s a positive news causing an increase in the price of bitcoin. In every news, there’s always advantages and disadvantages but one should always trade carefully to reduce the risk of loss.",

The news determines public sentiments which then determines the supply and demand and then the price. They are all powerful factors that determine price direction of the asset but the news stands as the most dominant. The thing with the news is that there is always an after effect even when it has died down. Aside the news, a powerful crypto influencer also plays a role too. These influencers may include Elon Musk, CZ of Binance, Micheal Saylor, and others.",

It can go up like that at any time and we should remember that it is not a big deal at all.It will take some time before people realize that things could be different, but that doesn't mean that we are going to end up with a result like this when a good thing happens, this is just normal and we should be used to it by now. I get that it will take a while before we could do something better and that is what I am expecting right now, it should be considered good deal.",

Nevertheless it is still us retail investors who could have move the price if we wanted too. But let's see, we need to overcome that $30k barrier and make it our support line this month.",

Yes, for sure those who have been in the market, really knows that news (positive or negative), has a affect on the price, even if the news is not somewhat related to crypto, but at least it has something to do with the financial world, then consider it as some sort of effect to us.But if the news is directly related to crypto, just like what we've seen in the FTX collapse, it will put a lot of dent in the market.Hopefully in the last quarter of this year, all we going to hear is good news so that we can at least touch $40k in December.",

It is really that been known that this crypto market doesnt really care about external economical events back in the past on which it is mostly that being that independent or could really move the opposite despite of huge economical problems but now its totally a bit different on which whenever we do see some negative news like those FED interest rate related then it is really that trying out to make some movement which would basing up with that kind of sentiment. Somewhat just like on whats been said that not all the time it would really be making out some significant impact on which it is really that still hard to make out precise predictions if we do just simply basing up with FA and not really some mixing with some TA. If you do really take that seriously in speaking about these events then its not really that bad for some additional on which its always been that normal that every step we would make does have that corresponding risks.",

This is why we, as Bitcoin investors, must have strong hands to keep holding Bitcoin and not be affected by any news.Especially with the condition that the price doesn't move too significantly and sometimes even decreases, it turns out that some people panic and think about getting out of the Bitcoin market immediately.

If similar news was to come out during the bull market it would have had more impact than it did now. The only reason the market isn't pumping is because we're still in the bear market which fear uncertainty and doubt is still in my mind of traders and investors and you can. See that playing out in the market with the price of Bitcoin trying to increase but later dip down. It's normal for the market that when there's positive news, the market will response by a increasing and when there's negative news the opposite happens and this isn't only limited to Bitcoin market but it also happens in other market although it happens here more.",
