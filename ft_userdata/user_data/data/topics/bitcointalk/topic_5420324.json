  "content": "Hi Everyone, Hope it is within topic here.We are looking for bitcoin miners who might want to work out a long term rental of your machines and we will pay above market rate FPPS + x% BTC on a daily basis.We are looking for SHA256d Machines with direct connection and not via proxy/other rental services like Nicehash/MRR etc.This is for a cryptographic project that is slated to last between 6 months to 12 months.Minimum hashrate is 1PH and if anyone knows of any contacts/recommended people to contact do let me know as well. Super appreciated.I know there will be a lot of trust issues etc thus do contact me and we can discuss how to go forward.Thanks.Edit (19 Nov 22) : There have been a few common questions from this post and placing the common questions here.1. What can I earn on this pool? - It will be FPPS scheme + 5% bonus on top.2. Are there any fees? - No fees or commissions whatsoever.3. Compared to Slushpool how will luck or block finds work into the rewards? - No luck involved, you get paid per share regardless of the pool's luck.4. Is this legit and how do you offer this bonus? - It is real and no shady business, the pool works as a regular BTC mining pool with some hashrate used to run some external projects that compensates for the higher payout. Not merge mining or alt coins involved.5. What type of miners do you support? - Most miners that uses the Stratum V1 protocol including Asicboost and non AB miners.6. How can I trust you to payout? - BTC payment is sent daily once it accumulates > 0.05 BTC dust. However, I can always work a risk sharing arrangement for the first week to ensure all parties are satisfied and comfortable.7. Is this a new venture, when did you start? - It has been operating in one form or other since 2019 mining BTC.8. Are you plugged to another larger pool? - No it is not connected to another pool, we mine on our own on the BTC blockchain.9. Are you a pool? - In general terms yes it is similar to a pool but a private one for vetted and invited miners only.",

But based on your requirements.1. We can arrange an advance payment arrangement option to build some level of trust but risk burden will need to be shared thereafter.2. Lets talk rate again however as a ballpark we can see somewhere around Bitcoin FPPS + 5% and no fees.",
