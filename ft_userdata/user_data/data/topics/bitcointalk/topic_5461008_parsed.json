  "content": "What happened::  After XRP's victory over the SEC case, pro-Ripple lawyer Jeremy Hogan's Twitter account was hacked, and now Jeremy's account is promoting fake XRP airdrops and giveaways.Reference Link:  https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1  | Archivedhttps://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1683634538658889729  | Archivedhttps://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1683807049774161921  | ArchivedAdditional Notes: There have been many cases of hacking of prominent accounts in the crypto arena by scammers. It did not stop at hacking Jeremy Hogan's account only, so everyone should be careful and not connect his wallet to any fake airdrop or giveaway, even if it was promoted from a verified or known account. Please, guys, report Jeremy Hogan's account to be suspended so that everyone on Twitter is not at risk of this incident.",

Who on earth, unless those with little scam idea and crypto knowledge, will ever believe that the tweet was not made by the original account owner, considering the fact that the impersonated person just recently won a case for the project that they are claiming to be? Everyone will believe the law, and the team is running the airdrops just to celebrate their win in court. Targeting recognized accounts of high dignities is what these hackers do now, as it helps them get victims who will believe them quickly without those victims realizing that they are not dealing with the real account owner.",

So aside from Telegram, act is right that this scam is common especially in Twitter. I hope that soon there is like one access hotline from these social media and they can retrieve their accounts immediately especially if they've been hacked and offering scammy BS to the people that follows them.
