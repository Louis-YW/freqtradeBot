But bitcoin is not a token in design. Bitcoin can never become a token. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency. It has its own blockchain and remain the only commodity among all cryptocurrencies. Quote from: ajaxtempest on September 17, 2022, 06:51:38 AMI have heard that he mined 1 million btc and was hoping that BTC would have converted the entire financial system in 10 years.Just like olden days, some people got hold of a land they did not buy. Later some people buy the land cheap. As the area is changing from a village to town and to city, the cost of the land becoming increasing.Quote from: ajaxtempest on September 17, 2022, 06:51:38 AMIF his project fails what would he do with those coins?What would you do with something that is not valuable? But bitcoin is never like that because it was adopted by people and it becomes valuable.",

This kind of what if is surely the dream of every crypto user that late on Bitcoin adaption but this will never happened because Satoshi has an important reason for leaving the project anonymously. He didn’t want fame or wealth so will not do such thing like this that will exposed his privacy that he is protecting for a long time since Bitcoin become a mainstream hit.",

Some people made a guess that Satoshi might have mined as many as 1 million coins.Quoteand was hoping that BTC would have converted the entire financial system in 10 years.I wouldn't say convert, he basically revolutionized what money means.

While the future is uncertain, just looking at the present shows that bitcoin has become a hot topic in recent years and has led to a growing demand for bitcoin. Many countries, and companies... are starting to recognize the existence of bitcoin and its value, I don't think it will be a failed project. So there will be no need to think about the problem you bring up.By the way, no matter what happens to bitcoin, Satoshi won't come back, because we can't determine if he/she is alive or dead.",
