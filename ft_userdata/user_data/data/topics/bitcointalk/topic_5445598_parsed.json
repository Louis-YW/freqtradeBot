  "content": "Greetings everyone, I'm Vladimir, the CEO/CTO of Reflecto (RTO). I'd like to take a moment to discuss our upcoming technology release, rather than our token.Last year, we dedicated ourselves to developing cutting-edge web5 technology, which involved creating a robust API (Application Programming Interface) that operates seamlessly. We then incorporated artificial intelligence into this API, resulting in our newest platform. This platform is the culmination of two of the most groundbreaking technologies available today: web5 and AI.With these two innovative technologies, we have achieved a remarkable feat: making blockchain transactions as simple as sending a text message. This technology also boasts two patents, further demonstrating its innovation.Our technology's simplicity and speed make it more accessible than any other current crypto solution. Users won't need to learn about web3, including installing wallets, making connections, or dealing with RPCs. Furthermore, it performs better than traditional payment apps.I cordially invite you to our demo on April 5th. During this event, I will present this amazing tech announcement, which will be available on our social media platforms. You can find the link here: https://linktr.ee/reflectocoin.",
