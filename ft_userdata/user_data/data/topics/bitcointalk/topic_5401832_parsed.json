Ethereum 2.0 has been delayed a few years. However the value of Ethereum is its environment for other projects to build on ERC-20 chain.It is the first blockchain allows other projects to do so. Binance Smart Chain and other chains are followers of Ethereum ERC20. It is a pioneer in blockchain industry, Bitcoin is the first, Ethereum is the second.QuoteBut in recent time there have been some shortcoming from various projects who walk away with investors' fund and abounding the project, but taking into account some new development that has performed well in both NFTs and the matter verse bringing into virtual reality making the proof of stake chain advantage to the environment and so much of what have you. What future can we see from the alternative cryptocurrency industry?NFT projects are only very parts of Ethereum ecosystem and of crypto ecosystem. They are not only part to contribute to success of Ethereum ecosystem. I don't think it is fair to say ERC20 is a chain for scam projects. You can find scam projects, scammers anywhere, from real estate, stock to crypto markets. Scammers often find where they can deploy their scam projects and steal money from naive victims.Ethereum can not protect all investors in crypto market from scammers. Investors are responsible for their money and what projects they invest in. Even in scam projects, you can be a winner if you have good entry and exit price. Even in good projects, you can be a loser if you have bad entry and exit price.",

You see that ICOs have failed because of the scammers that it had made it as their den and the same goes for metaverse and NFTs. It had became the place of scammers although there really are those legitimate projects that have been serious with their development. And once that purge happens, it will be the top altcoins shall remain but bitcoin will still be the king at the top of this entirety.",

Truly some handful of projects may actually do good but these are very few and most often only a dream. Hence the future of altcoins remains the same - pump and dump while the creators make money and the investors keep losing money with every gamble of an investment.The same drama happened all the way from ICO to NFT, clearly nothing has changed with the scammers running them nor the investors getting scammed.",

They serve many different purposes, so it shouldn't be surprising that they have attracted a wide variety of investors and users. And while alternative currencies have yet to go mainstream, they will likely continue gaining traction as time goes on. We'll see many exciting developments in the coming year as more and more projects focus on established and tested blockchains instead of building on untested code. There is still a lot we can learn from these new platforms, and I believe there will be a lot of great new alternative cryptocurrencies to watch out for in 2022.",

Sure we have crashes and increases all the time and that makes it a bit harder to focus on the task at hand, but that is still doable thing for all of us.I personally would love to see the current situation a bit better, and that means we are going to end up with a situation where it is not going to be pump and dump, but more like bear and bull in cycles and those are different things. When it's pump and dump, that is like daily thing, but when it is bear and bull it is like months in between those things before it happens, so that is why I see it as bear and bull and not pump and dump.",

There have been several projects developed and to a great extent non have seems to meet up with the current demands of the industry such as security of funds, with most of them losing everything to scammers and hackers who will destroy their projects leaving out investors with loses.But then Bitcoin seems to be the most secure investment in the cryptocurrency industry today and investing in altcoins is a highly risky move.",

But as a whole and while most of the projects keep being matured, there is a need that some project truly serves their own community, I mean if we look at the current issue, there is a lack of \"decentralization\" within Defi or DEX.",

All they do is gamble and encourage more such scam projects.All coins other than bitcoin are considered altcoins. Altcoins are here to stay. There are some good altcoins/projects that actually has some good potential to offer something new. As long as they keep on trying, it's all good as they will eventually succeed.
