Some people say they only keep what they feel will be sufficient for them per month, and invest the rest of their income, will that not be investing more than you can afford to lose?If i earn $400 for example, and i keep a $100 and invest $300 in bitcoin, with time my bitcoin will grow and i will have so much money in my wallet, but no money in my bank, and this is exactly how people claim they go about things because of inflation, isn't this investing more than you can afford to lose? And if you are in for diversification, and in addition to bitcoin investment you put some of your money into real estate, gold, and the rest, and only keep what can sustain you per month, isn't it investing more than you can afford to lose?How do you go about this personally? I am asking because many people especially bitcoiners do not trust the banking system, with inflation and censorship problem, in that case does it mean that investing more than you can afford to lose is inevitable in this current system? Because your money is somewhere else, either bitcoin or other investment.",

I send a certain percentage to my local bank account and that is for my living expenses. I then send a percentage for my investment, which is steady but little. The remaining percentage will remain in my portfolio as a stable decentralized coin. It keeps growing for projects, other investments. By this, I do not save in fiat and I do not also investment more than I can lose.",

Invest what you can afford to lose on altcoins, because they are more volatile and many are not reaching all-time-high or taking more time to reach all-time-high, many become shitcoins and many become dead. Even many become pump and dump and many are just fake.Bitcoin reach all-time-high in 2013, 2017, 2021 unlike many other cryptocurrencies (altcoins), it can be an investment for many people if it continuously reaching all-time-high unlike many altcoins. That is why you can see some people prefer to still hold bitcoin as well.But bitcoin is a speculative asset in short term while a store of value in long term. Because of the speculative value of bitcoin and volatility, some people still prefer to advice people to invest with the amount they can afford to lose. But in long term, profit will be the result. If someone carefully study about bitcoin price history, bitcoin gives opportunity to be store of value in long term and also an investment asset, but volatility can make novices to fomo and sell in loss at the wrong time.Real estate is a business and people see it not as risky as investing on assets like coins, the rule may not apply. It depends on how risky an asset is, there are some businesses that return are more guaranteed if legit.But we should not forget that in life, almost all are like gambling, but the risks are better in one than another and some make profit certain than another.",

Like others including me, blockhalving is the right time to invest but if you believe in Bitcoin right now you can start investing in Bitcoin and hold them tight for a long period of time but expect for price drop this coming few months. What I would like to learn is that Bitcoin is volatile and you should learn to do some analysis on when is the right time to buy. My tip is read the Bitcoin price history on Wiki you can find it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin then scroll down.",

For me, for the first-time investment, I will only use free money in which I am able to let the money if they are lost when investing. Free money means that I will not use the money for other necessities. that is why as a beginner at that time, I only spent a few amounts of money on the investment. And of course, I will not take a high-risk investment of new coins or tokens.So, when it's lost, there is no big problem. After getting profits, I will use the profits to save, the purpose is that I can collect the profits until at least the capital that I spent at first.So, if later, I get more profits, this is a bonus. But if there is no profit anymore, at least I have got the capital again or I only lose a few. and this is growing with some percentage of profits that sometimes I take to add capital for investment or trading. I know that managing money for investment and trading is not easy, I learn from many mistakes actually. You will also do it later",

While the phrase \"invest more than you can afford to lose\" sounds compelling at first, you must always follow this with proper logic and common sense. Again, investments are investments- meaning you only delve into investing if you have the extra cash AFTER you have paid all of your obligations to yourself or to your family.Â In the example that you provided, you took $300 out of the $400 that one earns per month. While this may be the case of \"invest more than you can afford to lose,\" still, $100 for the whole month seems very impossible for an individual and financial problems would kick in this kind of example. Follow investment with logic- only invest the amount that you are willing to set-aside for future transactions.",

Are you in other words saying there are right times to do so?

I am asking to know how people go about these thing as many no longer trust the banking system, do they just keep buying bitcoin, leaving only what is necessary for their daily expenses in their bank accounts, isn't that investing more than you can afford to lose?",

Bitcoin is profitable if you're willing to wait for the perfect time when the bull trend will come, there will surely be a high return. What I've noticed to gain reward is only sell when your profit was surely there and don't sell under the price where you've bought it, IMO.",

But assets like bitcoin, you can still make more research, being patient, allow bear market to come and invest. As bitcoin has dropoed from all-time-high which was $68900 to $21000, that is a high drop for people not to miss another upcoming bull market, people that invested at $30000, should not also sell because bitcoin can not remain below $30000. In short term, bitcoin dropped but since bitcoin was created, up to 2021/2022, it always reach all-time-high, but it has period for this. The long term profitable assets like bitcoin and very low risky businesses, the rule does not apply at all, people will always want to make profit form such asset like bitcoin, although, experienced people will have a kind of investment regimen that will make them to invest appropriately and at the right time to maximize their profit.",

Or it just seems to me that the more you believe in Bitcoin and lose trust in fiat, the more you take the risk. And that which you can afford to lose grows higher and higher that even if you're 90% invested in Bitcoin, it seems you can afford to lose it because it's Bitcoin, and you somehow feel assured.
