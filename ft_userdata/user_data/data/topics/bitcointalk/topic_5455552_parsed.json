  "content": "At this time, I will explain how to mine on unMineable Mining Pool, and my hardware is : GTX 1660 Ti Mobile 6GB and I try to mine BNB (BEP-20)and Surely, next I will update this thread how to mine on other devices.Requirement at this case : - Device : Laptop Acer Nitro 7 - GTX 1660 Ti 6GB (Windows 10)- Software : T-rex Miner - Download it for the latest one ( https://github.com/trexminer/T-Rex/releases , You should download the \"win.zip\" for windows  )- unMineable Link : https://unmineable.com/coins- BEP-20 Wallet AddressStep 1.Download Software T-rex Miner and Extract the downloaded  T-rex.zip, and then, in the same folder as t-rex.exe, create a start.bat file with the contents :t-rex.exe -a ethash -o ethash.unmineable.com:3333 -u COIN:YOURADDRESS.WORKER_NAME -p xpause- Change the \"COIN\" to be the name of coin what we are mining. example : BNB- Change the \"YOURADDRESS\" to be your BEP-20 Address. For an example of my address : 0xF490DE60d87F6c88f30C8433Ffc317EcEFf7d323- Change the \"WORKER_NAME\" to be whatever you like, but you must not using SPACE or you should be use one Letter word, example : MinerOne (not using space)So here is the Full example of mine :t-rex.exe -a ethash -o ethash.unmineable.com:3333 -u BNB:0xF490DE60d87F6c88f30C8433Ffc317EcEFf7d323.MinerOne -p xpauseStep 2.Start the start.bat by click it twice or you could press enter on it. And here is the example in image :and then while your mining has started in 10 minutes or more, you could check the current mining on the unMineable website : https://unmineable.com/coins/BNB/addressI already make this tutorial in my Youtube channel here is: https://youtu.be/RRQY0r5FrCASo, that is the tutorial of Mining on Unmineable Mining Pool by using software : T-rex Miner, and using hardware : Gtx 1660 Ti 6GB Mobile.if you has any devices that you wanted to mine coin/token, we can discuss it here, and I could help you to mine with it. Note : Currently, You can mining on UnMineable Mining Pool by using GPU that has >3GB VRAM, >6GB VRAM. And also you can use ASIC Miner Hardware and CPU as a mining hardware, but every hardware has different way to mine.",

Graphics cards consume a lot of electricity and in the summer they need additional cooling. But even if it was winter now, the profit is very small on video cards. Interest in mining instructions usually occurs during the mining season, not now.",

      "body": "The only good from Unmineable is that despite being unprofitable to mine almost all coins now you can opt to mine and be paid to the currency of your choice,like Litecoin,Doge,FUN and a lot of other coins and it is ideal for people who don't want to go to exchanges,they would just mine since they will mine anyway even at a loss and take the coin they love more and keep them,other than that Unmineable pool offers nothing more,in fact because of the conversion of coins that they pay you,you earn less there daily in crypto rewards compared to other well known pools like 2miners or Ezil.",
