Share your insights and experiences to help us gain a broader perspective on this evolving landscape.In case of payment gateways, traditional gateways are more stable and efficient. Also they are more secure when you are purchasing from new merchants. If you get scammed by the seller in traditional economy, there's still a chance that you will receive the money back. In cryptos, there no way. I have personally purchased hosting for my business website from a company that offers crypto payments. But there's no refund or grace period had been offered to me just because I am using crypto payments. If I had used traditional payment methods, I would have got 30 days period to check their service and get a refund if I am not satisfied. Crypto has a long way to go!",

Didn't really pay attention to that. I've only seen Bitcoin payments in the past using the Bitcoin network with multiple confirmations required and a fee to be paid. If you say it will be more expensive, it's only a small difference with Fiat payments. Even now payments for Hosting, Domains, or anything else can use the Lightning network which is faster more efficient, and cheaper.

I think this might be a reason that is encouraging people to hold instead of selling their BTC at high volatile exchange rates. The stable coin idea is a good one, but many vendors and merchants don't use USD because their national currency is not USD, which means to meet daily or monthly expenses they have to convert that US dollars into local currency. And to be honest, local currency doesn't fluctuate that much, and in some sight that fluctuation is good.

They might recover the loss by selling BTC into USDT and then USDT into local currency while the rates are now high and you are getting more money in local currency now due to the high fluctuations in the local currency/USDT pair.",

It is that you are limited to a certain time before selling Bitcoin. The best stores can wait a year or two before selling their balance of Bitcoin, and then they may be forced to sell at a loss. For example, whoever bought Bitcoin in the previous period may be forced to sell it at the end of the year at a price less than 20,000.Small stores cannot bear such surprises. They either use a third party that processes Bitcoin and transfers it to the bank account, whether in dollars or local currency, or they transfer part of their balances into stablecoin.",

However, it does have a drawback when it comes to confirmation times. Bitcoin transactions typically require a few minutes for payment confirmation, whereas fiat payments can be processed instantly.The confirmation time also depends on the network, and during periods of network congestion, this can be a weakness of Bitcoin. Unless one can leverage the Lightning Network, which significantly improves transaction speed, it remains superior in terms of transaction swiftness.",
