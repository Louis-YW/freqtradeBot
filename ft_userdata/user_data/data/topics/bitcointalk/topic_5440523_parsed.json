Good luck.I don't know if newbie who has 20 posts and 14 activity who probably hasn't made any major contributions to the forum can convince an admin to change the username. But there's nothing wrong with trying, even The Skeptical Chymist had to wait quite while for it to be approved to change its username from The Pharmacist.I don't think it's the admin's fault if not accepting a user's request to change their username, but for some plausible reason I think it will be considered.",

I'll probably ignore your request if you have less than 50 posts (unless your posts are very good).Quote from: hilariousandco on January 06, 2020, 10:38:23 AMYou can't. You can try PM an admin and they may do it, but they usually don't. You can just create another account¬† with that name if you feel like you need it.If you are not VIP or Donator member, you can not change your username.Admin can change your username without VIP or donator member condition if he sees you have good reasons for your privacy, dox or something dangerous to you.",

You're not just a veteran member, you're also a reputable one. Expectedly and quite understandably too, theymos will have a soft spot for users like that. If it were any different, theymos may not even have given the pm a second thought. If I were the OP, I would just create a fresh account and abandon this vexatious one instead of going through the wait and stress of expecting that the moniker would be changed. However, it's surprising to me how anyone would include their surname to their moniker when it's not a professional career site/forum like we've in LinkedIn.",

He turns 16 on February 26th. He recently registered on the site, and we are already literally familiar with his entire history, including photos and videos. Likewise, he had previously been warned not to be so open, but the boy thought that deleting information from the forum by deleting his account would be a very simple matter. Apparently, when he decided to do this, something went wrong.How often do we see such stories when our children can foolishly tell everyone about us, everything that we have hidden for years? The naivety of children, even if they are 16 years old, can play a trick on them in the future. Probably, the dangers of the network should be explained as soon as the child gets a bottle of milk in his mouth.",

Well, to tell you the truth I tend to take what people say is their age on social forum with a pinch of salt, especially a faceless one like we've here where you don't get to see users' pictures.QuoteHe recently registered on the site, and we are already literally familiar with his entire history, including photos and videos.That's the trend this day with people seeking validation online of whatever they do. It disgusts me and it's worse when you see adults do it. We see these shameless adults display their so called romantic life and wealth on Tiktok and Instagram just to give the globe the impression that their lives are better. What for?",

Consider if you want to change it.Your account registration on 19 Feb 2023 is exactly one day if we count today, meaning that your age on the forum is only one day which is worthy of being considered not to have contributed anything.Before you register, you should first consider the name you will use so that you don't have the desire to change it as you currently want.From various experiences that have been experienced by several other users related to changing names with the age of registering long enough and already contributing quite a lot to the forum is not fulfilled easily like turning the palm of the hand. Moreover, the age has not reached 1 week.My advice, it is better if you consider the input from Rikafip regarding your wishes.Quote from: Rikafip on February 20, 2023, 07:58:00 AMSince you created that account yesterday, wouldn't it be easier to just abandon it and create a new one instead?
