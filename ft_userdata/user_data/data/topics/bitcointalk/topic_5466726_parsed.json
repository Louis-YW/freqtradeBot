A happy, healthy, and satisfied worker will always be a lot more productive than a worker who is underpaid, overworked, and is only keeping the job merely for the reason that he/she needs to eat three times a day. That's regardless of working hours. There have already been numerous studies conducted in many parts of the world, for example, that found out that a 4-day working setup is much better than the usual 5/6-day working setup, not only in terms of the workers' health but even in terms of their productivity. Work-related burnout or stress which affects the workers' health and even personal relationships or social life affect their productivity. They'd be less active, less driven, less critical, and so on.",

Multinationals like Banks and oil companies spend a lot on human resources manager. The reason is to strengthen the mental capacity of their workforce, because they believe those workers are their image makers. The marketing department of any organization, does a lot of training and retraining of their staff, because this staff's go out to sell the companies product to the outer world and as such, they should be well informed.China today is one of the leading force in the manufacturing industry in the world, this is because they have a high level of productive workforce (Human capital) that are well trained in different fields of production and manufacturing. So human capital is one key aspect of an emerging economy or a business that shouldn't be toyed with but rather be harnessed and improved upon.",

Perhaps this term will be heard a lot in religions.I feel that life operates in a fair way, and every result is created for a reason, from success or failure there is a reason for it. Similar to the example of growing an apple, if you want to have a delicious fruit, there are many factors to create it and vice versa, we ourselves as humans seem to be forgetting these truths in life. There is no need for anyone or any organization to do any research, just feel for yourself if the criteria the OP mentioned (not complete), I believe will be part of the subsequent success.",

      "body": "Human Capital is one of the biggest investments a company can have that easily and surely produce many advantages and possible profit for the business. However, it is always best to know (especially if you are an employee) if the company you are working for is not giving value for the things you are giving them (in this case being a human capital/asset for the company). I have seen and know a lot of employees who have great background education, amazing skills, and have such loyalty and dedication to the company that they are either paid less than they deserve or are never promoted. In the case of never getting promoted companies do this to avoid a raise for an employees rate, especially when they know that said employee is already doing more than what they are supposed to do without the raise in salary and position promotion. The point here is that much like the company itself employees should also know how much value they have in a company as they are after all the company's human capital.",

They'd be less active, less driven, less critical, and so on. Working 4-days setup is much better than 5/6-days I definitely agreed with this statement of yours because working tirelessly will reduce the quality of the product, human are not machines they eat and drink and also get tired so given them a little breathing space will allow them to do good quality job and the company will be in fourth front. I am a factory worker, I left my former company due to the abused of Human Capital, in that company work 7am to 7pm with just one hour break, now if you calculate it we are working 11 hours straight without rest.",

This is really helpful to those companies that are wanting success no matter if they are start-ups or established companies because those are the people who do the job just to continue the transaction of the company. It is just sad that even though they already have those assets people they aren't paid well. I'm not saying all that but I've been from a company like that where they haven't taken care of their employees, they always think badly of them and the truth is that if all of those employees resign the company will fail.",

Everything that company do for their employee is so their employee can generate much more profit for the company. All those companies will not hesitate to just dump any employee if they aren't considered as profitable anymore.

Human capital is not necessarily same as workforce or when they say human capital, it doesn't only mean work force even though a means to know efficiency of human capital is either in the workforce or employee (s). So we can talk about human capital even if a company has one workforce. In other words, Al may eat up the work population or labour population but human capital still exist in the remaining staff, after all there is collaboration between employee and AL. More to this is that human capital is more superior than Al because Al is a product of human capital and it takes command from human capital. A more efficient worker is more productive with Al.",
