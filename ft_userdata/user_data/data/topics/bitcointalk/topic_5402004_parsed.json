Everyone is at home and those gamblers wanted to continue so they go online and play and that's why the sudden downturn as far as numbers of gamblers going to traditional land base casinos.But as we go back to normal, casinos are going back live now, I'm going to land base casino's at the start of the year and the last time I check, the numbers seem to be back. It's just a matter of preference now, whether gamblers who play online will go back to their favorite land base casinos because of the ambience, or play at the comfort of their home.",

The rise of crypto gambling is because of the ease of payment and low transaction fee unlike fiat payment that requires higher fee and may not be convenient to access for some people and some governments are harsh to their citizens when it comes to gambling. The gamblers in restricted locations can still play is one of the advantages as you mentioned already.",

Most people are bound to lose anyway so there isnt any reason to chase those players away because they are breaking the TOS",

Since then, the number of people doing online gambling increased year by year.It's just that when the pandemic happened, obviously, the number grows as no one can access the physical casinos during that time and it lasted for year/s. But as the world is slowly healing and recovering from the pandemic, we should see again the number of people visiting physical casinos will be back to normal, and those people who just gambled during the pandemic might return again to being a non-gambler or occasionally gambling since we are now back to the usual normal.",

People who used to play using fiat are switching to using crypto because it can protect their identity. Along with technological developments, crypto casinos are also keeping up with the times by integrating various gambling games into them. The habits of people gambling are also starting to change. They already used to gamble at home using computers; many of them gamble using their cellphones and use casino sites that do not require KYC. Casino sites are also starting to learn about Virtual Reality, where gamblers will only use special glasses that can bring them a new experience in gambling.

Those who are used to gambling in real casinos find a marked difference between real casinos and online casinos and in the end, many turn to online casinos. Especially when online casinos introduce crypto, increasing the popularity of online casinos and making many gamblers love crypto as a tool for betting.",

And they took advantage of the pandemic, pushing for more games, more tables, and the our favorite, slot games. So the statistics might be true to some degree, but with big land base casinos opening this half of the year, this numbers might change at the end of the year. Because gamblers might be longing for the traditional casinos with live music, the sound of a bonus in a slot machines and then the interaction with people you know.",
