  "content": "QuoteNews: Latest Bitcoin Core release: 24.0.1 [Torrent]On the top rightmost corner of the forum's page I see this.  I click on it and it take me to the bitcoincore websiteI have tried to read through about what it is but I am yet to get the hang of it. One of the sentences said: QuoteIt is a direct descendant of the original Bitcoin software client released by Satoshi Nakamoto after he published the famous Bitcoin whitepaper.Does this mean that the original Bitcoin software client released by Satoshi Nakamoto has been abandoned? I observed that there has been a lot of release. Out of curiosity, does Satoshi still work in the background on this project though anonymously?",

      "body": "If I'm not mistaken Bitcoin Core is open source software that runs the Bitcoin network. It is a direct derivative of the original Bitcoin software client released by Satoshi Nakamoto after he published his famous Bitcoin whitepaper. This means the original Bitcoin software client released by Satoshi Nakamoto has been updated and improved over time, but is still based on the same principles and codebase.The Bitcoin Core software is constantly being updated and improved by the development team, including some of the original developers from Satoshi Nakamoto's era. However, it is unclear whether Satoshi Nakamoto is still actively involved in the project. There have been some reports that Satoshi Nakamoto may still be involved in the project in some capacity, but this has never been confirmed.",

Why are you using the pronoun \"I\" as if you were the one who created Bitcoin core? By now i think most of the members should have been used to his annoying way of postings on claiming to be Satoshi, you can verify that fact by his post history oland the numbers of negative tags on him, it is no doubt that he's just here to cause commotion which is a total distractions whenever he showed up on any thread, @Charles-Tim has given the accurate answer, who cares about faketoshi causing nuisance and bugs.",

It was a derivative of Bitcoin QT if I'm not mistaken and the developers picked up on it and made improvements that they see fit, and released it to the public. You use bitcoin core for a couple of reasons, either to run transactions directly in the bitcoin blockchain, build in it, or god knows what else. But yeah, it's what practically powers the whole infrastructure since Satoshi's inactivity, although that last part is debatable because some people still believe Satoshi's still actively participating, just under the guise of someone else but that's a discussion for another day.",

Nobody knows the true identity of Satoshi, so it's difficult to say whether he or she is still working on Bitcoin Core. Personally, there are some people who speculate that Satoshi might still be involved in the project anonymously. It's certainly an interesting thoughtThe identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, has always been a mystery. No one really knows who this person or group of people really was, and this has led to a lot of speculation about their involvement in the project. As to whether or not Satoshi is still involved in Bitcoin Core, it's hard to say for sure. Some believe that Satoshi may still be working on the project anonymously, while others think that they have moved on to something else entirely.While we may never know for sure whether Satoshi is still involved in Bitcoin, the idea that they might work on the project anonymously is certainly appealing. After all, the creation of Bitcoin is a tremendous achievement, and it's hard to imagine that its creators would just walk away from it. Whether Satoshi is still involved or not, their legacy lives on in the form of Bitcoin and the many other cryptocurrencies that have emerged since.",
