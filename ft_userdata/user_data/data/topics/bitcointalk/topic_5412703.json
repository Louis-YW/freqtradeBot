The Trezor team are more than capable of building their own coinjoin implementation and integrating it with Trezor Suite without Wasabi's help. The only reason I can see for the partnership is to give Trezor users direct access to Wasabi's liquidity, but that comes with all the downsides of using Wasabi's coordinator.Quote from: NeuroticFish on September 07, 2022, 01:29:08 PMOh well, I guess that nobody is forced to use Wasabi/CoinJoin from Trezor Suite (although I'm afraid many will do).Better hope Trezor don't start \"pre-screening\" all your addresses for coinjoining by sending them to Wasabi's blockchain analysis partners for vetting.

A popular combination with any hardware wallet is to use it via Electrum rather than its own software (Trezor Suite, Ledger Live, etc.), but all this does is shift the point of failure from the hardware wallet manufacturer to whoever is running the Electrum server, in that the person running the Electrum server can now link all your addresses together.The only way around this is to run your own node, and use your hardware wallet solely via your node. You can run an Electrum server on top of your node and then use your hardware wallet with Electrum, but you can also point Trezor Suite at your Electrum server directly: https://blog.trezor.io/connecting-your-wallet-to-a-full-node-edf56693b545I'm not sure how compatible (or more likely incompatible) all of this will be with whatever coinjoin integration they end up with.",

Sounds like a nightmare partnership for privacy.I read about this yesterday, and I must say I'm really disappointed in Trezor's management team for doing this.  There are other centralized coinjoin providers they could have implemented into Trezor Suite, but partnering with any centralized agency seems like a betrayal to their customers.  If someone would have asked me two days ago to wager on whether Trezor or Ledger was more likely to pull such a stunt, I would have bet the farm on Ledger...I don't use Trezor suite myself, at least not for transacting with my bitcoin, and have very few alts to worry about.  The saving grace for Trezor suite has been that it's possible to assign your own SPV (Electrum) server, and it also allows you to use Tor for network connectivity.  So, even if you are using Trezor's SPV servers there're ways to at least obfuscate your IP address.  If one were to use Wasabi via Trezor Suite, all of these privacy features they've provided suddenly become meaningless.I really would have expected more from Trezor, I'm literally heartbroken buy this news.",

      "body": "While I am not going to use ever again the coordinator that zkSNACKS and their chain surveillance friends control, and Trezor Suite which is terrible for privacy in general, I am somewhat optimistic about this news. Currently, in order to participate in a CoinJoin transaction, you have to have a hot wallet containing private keys to the inputs you'd like to CoinJoin so that a signing process can be done automatically without the direct participation of users. In short, the software has access to these private keys and can use them directly to sign transactions for users. In hardware wallets, however, private keys are isolated from software access, and users need to sign every transaction manually. A CoinJoin directly from a hardware wallet has seemed so far like a pipe dream, but it may be that Trezor developers have found a way to make hardware wallet CoinJoin possible? If so, then other developers will also be able to implement CoinJoins in their software interfaces for hardware wallets, adding different coordinators and implementing different, even decentralized, CoinJoin solutions.",

Previously it was case of Trezor being able to link all your addresses together and link that information with your IP address. Now it's still a case of that, but also feeding some or all of those addresses to a blockchain analysis entity and then associating your entire wallet with whatever nonsense that blockchain analysis entity tells them. And given what we know about how much blockchain analysis entities like to sell data, I think it would be very naive to assume that such analysis will not end up in the hands of other entities and businesses.Quote from: n0nce on September 08, 2022, 12:40:37 AMOuch!

Either you need the owner to sit beside their computer/Trezor device the entire time and manually approve each transaction, or you need to introduce some piece of software which can automatically sign transactions (or extract the private key and store it temporarily in a hot wallet), which defeats the very purpose of a hardware wallet.

If Wasabi announce that they are going to blacklist, then it is only logical that people will stop using Wasabi and warn others not to as well, even if they have not yet started actively blacklisting.Still, given that most privacy conscious users have stopped using Wasabi, and someone is unlikely to broadcast the fact that a specific address/output they own which they were trying to coinjoin was refused, we probably wouldn't know for a while once they do start blacklisting (if they haven't already).",
