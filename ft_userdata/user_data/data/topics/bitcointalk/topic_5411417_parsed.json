Because there is nothing else than trust abuse for this negative feedback.If its because our topic is closed, this topic is not for negotiation, posts and etc.We are using it to update daily prices, miners and stock.We don't need any posts on it, we don't deal in the forum directly, only if customer needs it.We are not here for feedback also, we already have big feedback from most of the biggest sellers in Alibaba.So, kindly explain us the reason of your trust abuse please.Thank you.YCT Matt",

He has photos of some friend he has in China with miners, but is a scam. Several folks have sent him BTC for miners and got nothing in return except for fake tracking numbers. Mods need to do something about this ASAP. He also locks the thread so no one can respond in his thread. Buyer beware guys! Buyer BewareAlthough I don't know how trustworthy YCTMatt, but leaving a negative tag for this case isn't appropriate and his reputation already destroyed. Let's say I offer a service and still doesn't have any customers, then someone accuse me without any proof. How can I prove if I'm legit seller if other users already scared due to the negative tag on my account before they want to use my service?The tag should be revised to neutral.",

Let's say I offer a service and still doesn't have any customers, then someone accuse me without any proof. Yes, I know they are beginners, but there is still reasonable doubt and therefore I don't think that someone's reputation is irreversibly destroyed because feedback can always be changed or deleted. In addition, such a serious company as they present themselves should have at least something more than an ordinary Telegram account if they already refer to professionalism, transparency, and security in business.",

You can explain an issue to human... and of course if they make a mistake they lose trust, it's their main interest avoid any issue .... and for sure escrows (reputable/bigger ones here on forum) doesn't need to SCAM ANYONE  An automatic system can be very well defrauded (example how does the automatic system check that they have sent to the correct address a WORKING miner? ehehehhe  )I think you need to evaluate the chance to have also 1/2 of escrows from forum. People will be assured to made this kind of transactions. You asking me how you should ask Alibaba seller anything ? They have WhatsApp numbers  Feel free to contact them and ask for YCT Matt Also, i am not aware why that is so important consider the buyer will use shop from Alibaba with thousands of feedback and escrow system?You saying automatic system can be very well defrauded ? Then defraud it and get paid for your knowledge so they can make it better, that's what big company doing for people who can defraud their security systems.If you are such a genius who can defraud Alibaba escrow service, i admire you and i believe you should be paid for that knowledge.P.S: I am not interested to use escrow from the forum. Sadly it is known as paradise of scammers way better than Telegram because of the non-moderated scams.Before we register, we read a lot for this forum.I will repeat once again myself, we respect each and any escrow that is legit here from years, and we can only be happy that kind of people exists, but we trust more systems than humans. Because humans are greedy, scamming and they may have serious reasons to scam quit.Nothing against bitcointalk escrows, for sure those who operate from years are proven legit, and we don't say they are not.We are saying that no one ever can know when a individual can be forced by bad situations in their life to do something that can affect both us as sellers and our buyers such as scamming.",
