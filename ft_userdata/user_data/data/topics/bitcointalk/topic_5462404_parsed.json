Not something new or not really that a shocking situation yet this had been always the case of been the standard here on crypto space on which if there's one who would be able to get that popularity or demand,there are also those projects or coins that would eventually die out because of certain on conditions or situations on which there's no way that we could be able to tell on what would really be the thing that will happen yet it could really happen on an instant or sudden on which those people who do make out some investment would neither leaved out on the peak or would totally bag holding some shit coins if they would be able to hit up the rock bottom and never intend to make out some recovery after that. This what makes the market too unpredictable due to this kind of probabilities.If you do like on having that less risky dealing then top altcoins or Layer 1 coins would be the best choice but of course dont bare or put up into your mind that this is risk-free becausethere's no such thing about assurance if we do speak about crypto investment.",

Whenever such projects fails it keeps all newbies investors at a very high risk especially those who don't follow their channels properly to know the latest update awaits the projects they invested into. That is why, is best advisable to invest in Bitcoin or to a top known altcoin just as you mentioned earlier; any new project launching now are basically of deception to lure investor into investing in their project in order for them to prepare for the next bull run.",

Even a top altcoin like LUNA could be a Scam due to a developer error and FTX went bankrupt with its many scandals. I prefer to get into Ethereum because it is the king of altcoins and has definite growth over other altcoins which are not necessarily as good. Or the main investment is of course just Bitcoin, there is nothing better. For the long term, Bitcoin is highly recommended, we will see a halving occur and it will be a moment when Bitcoin experiences a significant increase like the previous halving.",

It is because we never see its market performance yet, unlike these old projects as we can have a basis of their performance in the past that can be used to analyze. We can't just rely on luck or those people that are behind these new projects because we are not certain of what will happen next. While investing in old projects, at least we have a clue as to where it goes as we already have seen their market performance history.

Despite that there have been established ones, maybe you just go ahead and lock in to them. This is the reason that if you're investing, you better choose bitcoin instead. You'll have nothing to worry by owning and investing on it. While the altcoins that are already established, you'll also got have some peace of mind with them.However, you'll never know how exactly they're going to be at the top rankings.

That's not a market trend, it's just something that new projects all have. Investing in well-established coins or in new coins is really just a matter of what you want, if you want more profits, investing in new altcoins would be better since if they were to be say, the next ETH,XRP or something, then you'd gain big if you were an early investor. If you want something more stable and relatively safe, then invest on coins with a well-built reputation, but don't expect insane gains.

There would be always no assurance of everything and this should really be bare up on mind on someone who would really be tending to invest with altcoin or even with Bitcoin.There's no such thing about sure profit because market is always been that volatile and always been that unpredictable. If you are planning to dive with altcoins then always take up some risks factor or considerations about on the possibilities on getting some losing investment knowing that not all new coins that flourished out on the market would really be having that kind of pump situation.Some might be able to hit up and some do eventually die right away and this is why you should really be that having always that risk factor and management on whatever trend that you would be able to face on.Its always been risky and there's no investment that wont really be risky in the first place.",

Well, I guess I'm less prone to get scammed because I'm focusing more on the established coins, and those top coins in terms of market cap that has been there for a very long time, and has survived multiple bear markets already. I will not say those coins, but you already know those altcoins especially if you are in the crypto space for quite some time.To answer your question, new altcoins, or I should say new projects are risky AF. I mean chances of this project to go rug pull is at it's highest when it's still starting. Developers can just run away with the money that they have, and on the other hand, the investors doesn't have any assurance at all that they will get in return of their money aside from their trust that they will deliver a good project that will be beneficial to all users, and those investors. Because of this, the trust is very low when it comes to new projects thus, the chances of these projects to become successful is really low. Though we've seeing many projects being created on a daily basis, the chances of them being there for at least 6 months or even more is low. If you're a newbie in investing, I suggest to just focus on those top coins like what you said in the 2nd part. Just be careful still because there are projects such as LUNA who are in the top, but turned out to be a scam. Or maybe just focus on Bitcoin.",

Of course, new altcoins speak a lot of dangers and even red flags and that is why one has to be so careful - never \"invest\" what you can't afford to lose, as they say. Now, having said that, I am convinced that there will always be a number of people so willing to stake and face the risks looking for that ONE that can be x10, x1000 or even be x1000 or more.",

I have priority with investing between Bitcoin or Ethereum only as long term, but short term could be other altcoin as option but never hold more than one month worry will get the same with Luna and FTX coins.
