Obviously noone is gonna get banned by their request and noone believes anything that DigitalMonk says except himself. People just get bored here and there and look for cheap entertainment.",

I hereby ask admin TO BAN this false prophet and ask all TRUE bitcoiner to spread word of truth.The two of you are just creating a show that is sounding uninteresting to members of the forum, we don't need you neither him to claim a relationship with Satoshi because thousands of people have done that right before you, why are you both constituting unpleasantries of this kind manners, recently someone also called himself bitcoinmoses making his own display from another dimension to be Satoshi, as for yiur request, that may not be possible except the user do something against the forum's rules and regulations he will then enjoy the benefit of being banned, remember this is bitcointalk and everyone talk whatever he feels like, but we discern the right from the wrongs.",
