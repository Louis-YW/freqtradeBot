What OP outlined is more about the investment this year, where you buy at the start of the year and hold until a certain month, likely until September 30, 2024, which is the end of the third quarter. With that presentation, Bitcoin has already gained 49.2% this year, making it the highest in the list. For an investment with such a large market cap, that’s pretty impressive. So, if you’re a Bitcoin enthusiast, you’d see this as another victory for the entire ecosystem.",

Bitcoin is the most profitable investment but its volatility and risk are also the greatest. The higher the profit, the greater the risk and vice versa. Meanwhile, investors' tastes are different, some like safety, real assets, stability...so it all depends on each investor's choice. We don't need to force anyone to invest in bitcoin just because it gives the best returns or criticize someone for ignoring it when returns are not their top priority. Currently, I have invested most of my assets in crypto but when I reach my goal and have the desired amount I will only invest a small portion in bitcoin and will diversify into many other assets. While bitcoin has long term potential, once I have enough money I won't want to risk too much and will instead prioritize safety.",

The more investors investing on Bitcoin is the higher increase of its values.Perhaps it is mostly an investment portfolio which investors alternates their source of incomes upon and not a primary source worth investing more than expected. Although in up to date within the 2024, Bitcoin has resiliently broken over 50% value increase which is significantly potential to overshadow traditional sectors of investments.Quote from: stadus on October 27, 2024, 07:51:11 AM :Dst but who are still doubtful, we can point them to this thread.

My mind is made up that I should be mindful of how much value of funds I invests on Bitcoin due to its volatile and decentralized potentials.Everyone must not invest on this Bitcoin because all mindsets are not made up the same to take the risks surrounding it knowing that we can lost our funds while invested to make more money.Intending to convince anyone to an extend of providing proofs such as this analysis is unprofessional to any experienced Bitcoin investor.

On the other hand, using a 10 year metric also has its flaws, in part of course due to the high adoption growth of BTC in its relatively short existence. (We equities, could also say that every company started at $1 prior IPO and then measure its growth from there. Having said all that, if I had to bet, I would say BTC will almost certainly be the best performing asset class among all those others listed.",

With different time lines for their investments, they will have different exits, assume they have same entry, and different exits at different times will bring different results. Some will get loss, some will get profit more than others.If we only look at 1 year or shorter period, Bitcoin can not be the best and we can find many altcoins outperform Bitcoin in one bullish year. But after 1 year and more years, altcoins can not beat Bitcoin that has been here since 2009, went through many black swan events but still been here and given very high ROIs for anyone can hold it for past years.Ranked: Bitcoin Returns vs. Major Asset ClassesVisualized: Bitcoin Returns vs. Major Asset Classes",

And those who are currently doubting Bitcoin and staying away from Bitcoin They will regret it in future. If we research Bitcoin's past well, we can understand about the high potential of Bitcoin's future. As much as bitcoin has improved in the current year, bitcoin will improve even more in the coming years. Not only next year but bitcoin will always improve, and thus the price of Bitcoin will cross $100k- $250k- $500k- $1M at some point. Just like Bitcoin went from $0 to $73K from 2009 to 2024, i.e. from zero to the top. So no one can be as stupid as those who still don't believe in Bitcoin. Because yet those who are skeptical of Bitcoin after seeing so much growth in Bitcoin, will regret it the most in the future.",

Personally I prefer showing statistics like this for over 4 to 5 years and this also goes to the investment plan time span, because this year and probably next year are bullish doesn’t mean you should do a yearly investment but rather have a longer term plan such that even if the year for the bulls doesn’t come others will cover it up.
