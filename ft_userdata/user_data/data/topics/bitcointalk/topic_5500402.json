  "content": "Hello community! I have always been amazed with everything about bitcoin and I put in some time to know more about it's history. From every event that took place in bitcoin it shows it's a legendary invention. Back 2012 when bitcoin was still around $5 dollars, one of us here, which username was/is Tuxavant, Did a legendary work in the history of bitcoin to teach bitcoin in school. He taught BTC Bitcoin in his son's school, before then he already tipped his kid's teacher with a whole bitcoin but back was just a few dollar but now with the current value i think be gave out a huge amount. Here is the written article which he used for his successful presentation, although some parts are blurred out. To cut the story short, He was invited to teach the kids in about bitcoin and guess what? it was a big success. You can read the whole project here SUCCESS! The First Grade School Bitcoin Project! . When you read the whole project you will find it convincing to award you kids with bitcoins for the future. BTW, @Tuxavant is one of the bitcoin legends. My Opinion about this project - During his teaching I believe there was a lot of criticism, a lot of people would have considered him a scammer then but the future he already knew. - If those kids took bitcoin serious or had it till now, they would have become millionaires with cheap dollars.",

That's true, but as of then, still consider the way things were by that time, bitcoin value, the interest of the participants and their affordability on making investment, though we can still make such an opportunity by this time if we can invest and hold for long.",

What we are talking about here is 2012, 4yrs after invention which eople might still be in doubt of it then someone came up with the idea of teaching it in Grade school which I haven't heard anyone teach bitcoin in class except for the later years.

Hell yeah! we can start sharing this knowledges with kids, working them out for the future, we never know how well things will turn out in future.

Did you read the entire thread? you can literally see people who are even against his idea of educating the kids on bitcoin. You can see that if such people exist in bitcoin community already then people who don't know it wouldn't hesitate to call it a scam. Imagine someone give you a coin that is worth $0.0005 now what will be your reaction? Maybe a scam right? Shitty project right? back then that was how it looked. But finally bitcoin is far beyond what they saw.",

I imagine that the OGs are loaded and have lost interest in the forum because it's so changed. About the Bitcoin haters, I don't know, maybe some changed their mind and bought Bitcoin in time but in other forums you see them predicting that Bitcoin is going to go to 0 because it is a ponzi scheme, people who have had an account for a decade or more. They don't learn.Kids, it's hard to tell a class from 13 years ago the influence it might have had. I would imagine not much.",

You might be surprised that many people still consider Bitcoin a scam currently. There are still people who believe that the coin is a Ponzi scheme that will soon crash.

I guess that some of them might be rich because they kept their coins to date while others might not be because they sold early or lost interest in Bitcoin. We cannot also trace the history of people who mocked them. But I am sure many of them would regret their action because Bitcoin is now bigger than they ever thought. We cannot also determine how the effect of the Bitcoin lesson on those children except if there are testimonies from any of them who attended the class.",

This reminds me of someone who came to teach us about money in high school! Dude was that ideal speaker that spoke and while he was speaking it was as though a Vail was being removed from our eyes and that we were being mislead and thought nonsense in school. Everything was going just fine throughout the class up until it got to the point when he requested that we pay a certain amount of money if we are interested in the masterclass where he will reveal the deep things he hasn't told us yet. Everything he said from that point changed entirely and it almost appeared as though he is trying to extort money from us and even though what he was saying is true, it didn't make anh sense again.Sometimes it's necessary that when you're educating people on a subject matter as this, most expecially the younger once, it's best you just feed them with the information and let it end that way. I bet that's possibly what he did cause it wouldn't even make any sense if he requested anything from them except if he adviced them to start investing into Bitcoin at that tender age or to convince the parents to use there free money to invest into Bitcoin for them.Quote from: Ivystar5 on June 19, 2024, 03:45:11 PM- If those kids took bitcoin serious or had it till now, they would have become millionaires with cheap dollars. you know, it's at this point that we've seen how far Bitcoin has come in terms of it price that we can ascertain that anyone that had the knowledge of Bitcoin prior to now and refuse investing into it made a very bad decision but at the time, we can't tell if they made the right decision or not cause it wasn't all that popular compaired to now.Again, we aren't different from those kind of they didn't invest at the time and there are lots of people who still feel that Bitcoin is a scam and are currently waiting for a moment it will crash. It's partly a function of being ignorant of how the system works and not ready to take some form of calculated risk to invest into Bitcoin.if they had invested at the time, we aren't sure if they would have HODL it till this time or if they would have agreed to buy much of Bitcoin that would have made them millionaires at this time.",

Depending on how I develop this \"intro\", I suspect that this particular school will be encouraging me to to this for other higher grades. It is like a charter technology/science themed school and are hungry to be \"on the cutting edge\". They are asking me to help out with their lego mindstorms club, and get them going with stuff like Scratch from MIT, etc.If the lesson is done on universities I believe it will turn out well since students at this level are hungry for possible earning opportunities so they will more likely take the lesson seriously and possibly dig dipper into learning about Bitcoin.  But whatever the result of the effort of Tuxavant is, it is always great to know that there are selfless people who love sharing opportunities even if it costs them spending their own money.",

BTW, @Tuxavant is one of the bitcoin legends. I'm amazed at how you got to know the legendary @Tuxavant started a class about bitcoin for kids I mean looking from your rank but if you went through some research to find this out that means you are a Bitcoin lover and one who wish to know more about Bitcoin. I assume his teachings helped some children who must have grown now to have knowledge and good understanding about bitcoin.QuoteMy Opinion about this project - During his teaching I believe there was a lot of criticism, a lot of people would have considered him a scammer then but the future he already knew. In 2012, Bitcoin hasn't gotten the awareness it had now because most people were seeing it as some kind of scam projects and we can't completely blame people who think Bitcoin was a scam project as at that time because whenever something new is being launched, it takes time even years before people will become confident about it so that was exactly what was happening those times, but thanks to how far Bitcoin have gone today as only those that doesn't want monetary freedom, or those that don't like it's decentralized nature since they can't benefit from transactions are the only ones that will criticize Bitcoin or go on the news that it will crash but bitcoin has gone above criticism because a lot of investors are coming in to invest. Even though @Tuxavant was teaching those children with great confidence but I don't think he completely knew that Bitcoin will get this far.Quote- If those kids took bitcoin serious or had it till now, they would have become millionaires with cheap dollars. You can't blame those kids because they were under their parents and it will be difficult for them to convince their parents that they want to invest in a genuine project then since Bitcoin didn't get much popularity and recognition then and people believes in something that has gained public attention before they can trust the system so those children can't not be blamed but had it been their parents saw a good future in the project I believe they would have supported those children as at that time.",

He is like Laszlo and others who help BTC to become more known to the world. They are like our heroes here in the BTC world. Maybe there are a few who have invested but I doubt if many have reached this far.I mean if they still have the BTC's up to the preset dates. That is the hardest part there, especially for something that is still unknown to the many. Back in time, we already have the internet and maybe many of us are hooked on it because PC games are already a thing before, therefore you don't need someone to come for you and teach you about BTC but you can just do it your self if you are really willing.",

Considering the time at which the user did conduct this seminar or teaching classes for first graders, I would say the user did such a good job especially with the level of information that was passed approaches used and haven’t got so much influence to have been invited over by the school to teach this new technology at the time. One piece of information I did enjoy from the shared link though was this:QuoteBitcoin is a new kind of money. It's not just digital money, but a completely newway to think about money: how it is issued, how itis stored, and how it is transfered between people.It was simple but, one way to redirect thoughts of the young once towards a more open and accepting of the new era that was to come.While I might not take the users having to teach for a major achievement, the real achievement would be in the students the user was able to win over and what they’ve been able to accumulate over the years after that lecture. The user didn’t just teach them, also pointed means to mine and sites to visit to get Bitcents and Bitcoins.That’s a term I don’t knew to exists though, Bitcent! I suppose that’s where the Satoshi of today comes in to replace that.",
