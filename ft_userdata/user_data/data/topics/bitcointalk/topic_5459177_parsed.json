All the other pages are opening very fast but for some reason bitcointalk is extremely slow to the point of being barely usable.Today there is some issue when opening Bitcointalk account or posting new reply. I saw many users posted same reply multiple times. if you are facing same cloud issue then don't worry and posting new reply don't need to post multiple times. you should check first before making post second time. if first one already posted then no need to post another.Solution:When you post new reply or thread then first of all write post and then copy all post. when you click on post you will see this kind of message:Quote from: salad daging on July 09, 2023, 10:23:56 AMI've had the last few hours, well to go to other pages it's still perfectly normal but when I start posting I always run into issues here.When this message appears , samply go back to posting page and refresh your page. you will see that your post already posted despite of this error. it's mean there no need to post again.

Network failure from the poster's end also caused double posting and also from forum software downturn or mistake from the the poster clicking twice in a post. Like what Happened today was a frequent occurrence which I have noticed for many times so as I saw the issue, I just let it be and wait for the network to restore itself before start posting.What I will say is that when you post and the page took you to the cloudflare message, don't repost again but go and check the thread to know if your post is there or not before taking any action again.",

NOTE: dont double click the POST BOTTON if not you will end up SPAMMING post in one tradeI don't think there is any board that allows users to be able to delete their post immediately after it's been created. Some boards don't allow deleting at all, so why would others want you to allow the post to stay for at least 24 hours?As for comments under threads, I just confirmed today that most of the threads allow us to delete our comments immediately after they are posted. Checking to see if your post was posted or not is an idea that one will get immediately after they have made the first mistake, if not on a normal day, provided you are making your own comment based on your opinion. To me, I don't really look at those sometimes because I might likely repeat this post mistake. If it were how the system usually uses to detect when one has made the same post before and when you try resubmitting, they will try to remind you that you have dropped such a comment earlier, which could be a warning for you to let go.",

But the process that I have devised to avoid double posting is to open my profile on a different tab, then open the tab where I am typing my comment separately.

At that time i was making a post and after i clicked post button it took some time to load the page, i tried to post multiple times but an error page displayed i was frustrated and thought my post was gone but lucky enough after sometime i noticed my post count has increased and the posts i made actually went through So i had to delete the duplicate copy.

I tried refreshing the website when I first encountered it, but it was still displaying the error page. It wasn't until I went away for approximately an hour that I realised my post had been made successfully. When you are in that circumstance, you might want to try posting again because you don't think the forum is having an issue. I think that's what occurred to everyone, which is why they all posted duplicates. Moderators delete duplicate posts that the poster is unable to delete.  Quote from: rachael9385 on July 09, 2023, 06:48:35 PM I haven't been able to login not to talk about posting I was seriously thinking the other way round, I hope this network issues has stop permanently. This was the main reason I didn’t make any posts after experiencing this problem, this is not my first time the site is experiencing this problem and anytime it happens i try not to make a post until after some time that the issue might have been resolved. This can’t be permanently because regular site maintenance is required and sometimes unexpected issues come up so you have to get used to it. Let’s just hope this doesn’t happen often.",
