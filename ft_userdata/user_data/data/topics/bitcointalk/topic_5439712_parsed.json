There is much empathy and sympathy for hurt people among the general populace. It is government that is making it difficult for people to help people in need.",

When there's something wrong with you, you're going to have a hard life and this can be said about any possible disability that is clearly visible. What if you knew a disabled woman? Would you help satisfy their desires? She should be the one to look for a partner, nobody is going to change that for her and a man who takes care of her because he feels for her is not going to be a good partner. Pure compassion is not a good base to build a relationship on.",

You are right women does not have their own spec of men that they desire men is people that have spec the desire because if woman should have expect that means that woman should also have what a text to deceive a man how to make a man to be rich because the advantages of woman in any relationship is higher than the advantages of Man so woman does not have expect or choice of Man during sexuality",

But...People live life and do things for various reasons. There are married people here and there who live in different houses, even.If this guy has been 'bought' by this woman, and if they are compatible, and if they are married, they are benefiting each other. His benefit might be a good place to live, and a few toys. But if he is servicing her needs properly - even if he doesn't really like her disability - he is more or less like a loving live-in nurse. And what better way to be a nurse than than by giving her sexual fulfillment, and receiving the same?... plus a whole lot more between the both of them.People have all kinds of reasons for doing what they do. This might be a good setup for both of them. Of course, you being closer to the situation might know better. But there are tons of people living together, who are married, but not entirely fulfilled by the life of the partner. In some cases there are formal disabilities. In other cases there are simple emotional disabilities that have never been diagnosed. Maybe we all are a little like this.",

In some places, they are seen as second-class citizens.In my country, people living with disabilities would have a robust sexual life if they are financially stable. Our society places more emphasis on money than any other thing. These special people have to work hard to overcome societal stigma before they can attract and get emotional satisfaction.I have had a relationship with someone that is challenged physically and I find them very caring, trustworthy, and loving. Due to the fear and uncertainty, society has put in them, they are always scared of losing their partners. But, I find them very jealous and timid because they always feel you are discriminating against them because of their challenge.",
