But I suggest to do your own research too, we have also a gambling review website that could be a source of what you need to know. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5335097.0",

So you can go have a look at them to see which among the listed casinos I just made sort your style of gambling.Also, endeavour to check its terms and conditions too for further details.",

I never tried bitcoin.com games but if you do so just read their T&C first before proceeding they are regulated as far as I know so KYC might likely be a mandatory. These days KYC is a thing, it's likely rare for a casino to not be regulated, even dApps tend to do so.",

They are NO anonymous book:https://prnt.sc/kld7tXtAWAQ3That’s why it’s always advised to read the terms and services of each and every casino where you make the deposit. Here vave also can’t be blamed, as you yourself violated their terms by creating multiple accounts. To be frank, I haven’t really heard the name of Vave Casino, but the case always favours the casino, if you yourself violate their terms ans conditions.Coming back to OP, then almost each and every reputable casinos now a days asking for Kyc. Some ask for KYC if you make some suspicious activity, and some ask when you withdraw big and try to withdraw. I have been playing at Stake.com for more than 5 years. Made some 2-3k usd withdrawals, but till now they haven’t asked me for any KYC. Give a try at stake.com and tell us here OP.",

Alternatively you can play casino without KYC such as blockchain games or something like Bustabit. Well honestly, I don't recommend playing on a sports betting that is not licensed or regulated it is still much better to play on a bookies that is reputable even if they ask to confirm your identity.",
