And that's all due to corruption and no political will of controlling such so, it has come worse and that's no longer containable. While those societies that you've mentioned, the Nordic ones. It's true that they've got the successful ones not mentioning the others from other continents but they do really click to be said as one of the good if not the best societies where people are enjoying all of those perks and peaceful living, thanks to its people's cooperation and their government.",

But when he passed away, everything changed and we are getting more outsiders and eventually changes the society and its people in that community which lead to mostly raids by the cops all the time and after some years we decided to move and leave that place. If you find a just leader in your community, don't ever leave there because they are rare nowadays in this world.",

      "body": "You've made a valid observation about the role of local leaders and the importance of their intentions and actions in building a good society. I agree that a good society is characterized by equitable access to resources, infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other essential services. The presence of these elements reflects the commitment of local leaders to the well-being and development of their community.Conversely, a failed society can be recognized when it lacks the fundamental components you mentioned. Absence or inadequate provision of healthcare facilities, educational institutions, proper infrastructure, and competent governance can indicate a society that is struggling and in need of improvement.It is indeed true that the smaller structures of societies, such as local governments, play a crucial role in shaping the overall success or failure of a nation. Local leaders have the responsibility to create an environment that fosters progress, opportunity, and the general welfare of the people they serve.When local leaders fail to fulfill their duties and responsibilities, it can have detrimental effects on society as a whole. Inadequate governance, corruption, lack of vision, and a disregard for the needs of the community can lead to stagnation, inequality, and a decline in the overall quality of life.Recognizing the signs of a failed society, as you mentioned, involves assessing the presence or absence of essential institutions and services. When the foundations and structures that contribute to societal well-being are lacking or poorly maintained, it indicates a breakdown in leadership and governance.To address these challenges and move towards a better society, it is crucial to focus on developing competent and accountable local leaders who are genuinely committed to the welfare of their communities. Encouraging transparency, citizen participation, and promoting good governance practices can help in building stronger societies from the grassroots level upward.",
