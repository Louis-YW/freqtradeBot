This also applies to other Python scripts, though I want to concentrate on Electrum. I've submitted an issue as a feature request on GitHub.The logical conclusion to the Python ouroboros is to port Electrum to C.Did i miss something? If you or regular user only want to run Electrum, you could download binary from https://electrum.org.",

      "body": "Correct me if I'm wrong but this sounds like a problem that you have with Python language not with Electrum and I don't see how translating the whole thing to another language like C would solve anything. You should try to improve your Python skills to be able to apply the changes or additions that you want to Electrum.",

Using:Code:python -m venv ~/electrum~/electrum/bin/activatepip install electrum # replace this with the actual file name, of course~/electrum/bin/electrum # Where the launcher will be ocateddeactivateYou can make a venv just for Electrum and free up your primary site-packages for everything else.

They should just run installer or portable executable which already contain all required file. Electrum already does that with installer, portable version and AppImage.",
