Anything to be forthcoming and show my intent and transparency.. price is negotiable looking around 10k each A similar scam was on the VoskCoin Discord not too long ago with a \"seller\" needing funds in order to finish a bigger deal that he was into with some other \"friends” they owed money to which would then release these ones to be sold, lolOnly then to be able to sell \"x\" miners, all vaporware etc. Not a good look OP, do you have any of these miners in hand ready to sell, and if so, please take a pic of the miners with your username and todays date, and your asking price, otherwise you can take this scam to the next forum.I’ll see if I can find some screens and info from that discord, as this sounds way too familiar. (needs money to finish large order, to then sell miners to you at huge discount) , uh huh Thanks!***edit*** Confirmed by members of the Voscoin Discord that this is in fact the same scammer.Buyer/Seller beware!Found a screen from July when they were in that discord (since banned) attempting this exact same scam, at least they should have tried to make an effort and change their name",

Hey, \"my guy\", (jeez) You couldn’t have said it better yourself (well, you did), you have a “sob story narrative\" asking people for money so you can pay back some “partners” who will in turn release some miners to you, so you can then flip them to people here and other places you’ve tried to before (and was called out for), for half  a year now you say? What is the hard part to understand here? No one in their right mind is going to get involved and pay off your sticky debt (if it’s even real) to then hope they can buy something from you after.There are plenty of trusted and well-known sellers here that have products in hand or have proven themselves to be reliable trusted sources, without any of your forementioned drama.You are delusional if you think otherwise.I’m sorry to be the one to inform you (although I doubt I’m the first) If someone wants to buy a miner, then a seller will list it for sale, using the standard format here on bitcointalk, and if all goes well, they will strike a deal. What do YOU not understand?No one wants any part of your MESS; made up or otherwise, do you understand that now?have a good one, NEXT!",
