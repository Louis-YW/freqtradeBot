  "content": "Hey everyone! I am an enthusiast trader and a year ago I had this idea to create a free-to-use website that would feature all the most essential and useful tools/calculators that traders and investors use on a daily basis.Website: https://www.tradingdigits.io/There are dozens of cool projects that provide excellent analytics and tools for the crypto industry, but it was kind of weird to always have five different websites (or more) open in the browser at the same time to get hold of all the analytics/tools I needed. I think there is a lack of some product that provides access to all these tools at the same page. Also, even if there are websites that provide lots of analytics for traders at the same place, they are usually highly specific and therefore look somewhat confusing, complex, and difficult to understand for casual traders.So I learned to code and created it, which took me 12 months. The first sections were made by a developer that I hired whilst I was learning programming, but these days I tend to code all new features myself.Satoshi Calculator: Calculate SAT to USD and vice versa but also SAT to altcoins in real time. Switch to SAT to ALTS mode, choose the crypto of your preference, and calculate how many satoshis is a certain amount of the crypto you chose and vice versa.Funding Rates: Check real-time funding rates for perpetual swaps from Binance, ByBit, OKX, and Gate.io, updated every 15 seconds. We’re one of the only two websites on the Internet that provide access to live funding rates from multiple exchanges and the only website that lets you search for some particular coin by its name.Gas & Fees: This page features both Ethereum gas tracker and Bitcoin transaction fee tracker. Find out real-time ETH transaction fee in gwei / USD (low, medium, and high) as well as the real-time low, medium, and high Bitcoin transaction fees in USD and sat/vB all on the same page.Position Size: Use this advanced position size calculator to plan your spot, long, or short trades with risk management. I tried to make it both graphic and technical, but it’s still in beta and I’m planning to add more features to it soon.Market Cap: Compare the market cap of two coins of your choice and find out what the price of the asset 1 would be if it had the market cap of the asset 2 and vice versa.Fear and Greed Index: Get a clearer picture on the current crypto market feel to be able to catch the tops and bottoms of the market. We're the only website that provides access to the averaged monthly historical performance values of this index.BTC, DXY, SPX+: A chart that provides real-time correlation between the values of Bitcoin, US Dollar (DXY), S&P 500, Nasdaq, TOTAL1, TOTAL2, and Gold to know where the market may be heading next.Exchanges: Discover the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges ranked by highest daily volume and find out which of them provide the lowest crypto trading fees.BTC/ETH Returns: Detailed historical performance analytics for monthly and quarterly Bitcoin and Ethereum returns to find out what time of the year the market tends to perform better.Bitcoin Halving: Find out the exact dates on when the 2024 Bitcoin halving would happen and see detailed analytics on BTC prices before and after all past halvings.Portfolio Tracker: Track portfolio holdings of any crypto wallet on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tron blockchains in real time, without signing up, and completely for free.Crypto Heatmap: Use this multi-category heatmap to find out whether the market's most important coins—TOP 50, L1, AI, GameFi, DeFi & more—are in the green or red today.RSI Heatmap: Use this multi-category crypto market RSI heatmap to track strength of the most important coins—TOP 50, L1, AI, GameFi, DeFi & more—in real timeLongs vs Shorts: Find out real-time ratios for long/short accounts, buy/sell taker volume, and top traders long/shorts for futuresEMA/SMA Screener: Scan the market's most important coins across multiple EMA & SMA pairs, timeframes, and coin categories, also getting analytics on crossoversBitcoin ETF Tracker: This BTC ETF Tracker features the daily inflows (USD) chart as well as real-time analytics on net assets, volume, and price of currently active BTC ETFsBitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model: This Stock to Flow model chart, inspired by Plan B, is used to spot macro tops in every Bitcoin cycle by calculating its historical scarcityOther self-explicative tools include Cost Averaging (DCA) calculator, Percentage calculator, Stablecoin Peg, Economic Calendar, CME Gap, BTC Dominance, and Gainers and Losers. I’m actively working on the project and in the following months at least 5 new analytics tools will be added to the website. If there are some other analytics tools or calculators that you'd like to see on the website (maybe you can't find something you're looking for on the web or you already use some specific tool but it's not made in a user-friendly or modern way) please let me know and I'll include it in the list of the new features to add to the website.Feedback and your opinions would be highly appreciated. Feel free to ask any questions and thanks a lot for your time and attention.",

Coinglass is a similar website, but it's much more specific, bigger, and technical. We'll have both the essential and specific/technical tools (in the near future) on the website, trying to provide it all on the same page. 1. Thanks a lot for the link to https://mempool.space/ website, man, I kind of missed it. I already found out how to implement what you were suggesting using their APIs and will code it in a week or two.Next week I'm launching a new section featuring Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (and it's monthly historical performance since 2018) and I'll implement it shortly afterwards. I think this website also has data that will help me code the Bitcoin halving countdown tool later on.2. Yes, we do fetch data from multiple places that provide free crypto APIs, both official and independent. What do you mean, like creating our own API? 3. Agreed. I will release a couple of new tools first and then handle the UI details. Will try to add smooth transitions between pages and page elements, some animations, and will redesign some UI elements like the calculation results modal you pointed out.",

There may be a small difference in price between ETH/BTC in the header and the calculators/analytics tools because currently we use two different API providers for this in order to avoid double API calls for the same user. As soon as the website is more popular and we can afford a proper API with higher rates or get a partnership from some website that provides APIs with no limits, we will unify it and use the same API service for everything as well as implement other cool stuff with it.When it comes to adding sat/vByte in Gas & Fees tool, I will do this soon using the real-time data from mempool.space. I'm currently working on a new section featuring Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (and it's monthly historical performance since 2018), which will be released in a couple of days. Straight after that I'll implement the sat/vByte for Bitcoin, most probably this same week. I'll let you know when that's done and online!",

Opposite of that, if bitcoin is dumping, then it's showing more fear among investors. If the movements are sideways, the index arrow stays in the middle.The daily values of Fear and Greed Index alone do not really make much sense, but if we average them and take monthly values it may become a nice market sentiment tool and indicator (especially for beginners) on when to buy and sell for swing trades and hodling.What I saw other websites do is to display the today's index value as well as place the historical daily index values on top of a chart, which to me looks kind of confusing and visually overwhelming without really telling anything. What I did was to calculate the average monthly index value and present it in a clean way in an interactive table. For example, we can see that in February 2021 and a couple of months before it the average index was Extreme Greed indicating that it might have been a good moment to sell (Bitcoin was at 60k at that time and then fell to 30k).The same way, the index averaged to Extreme Fear in May, June, and July when Bitcoin was fluctuating between 30k and 40k but shortly after it went up to 50-60k.Also, further from historical data we can see that usually the index can't stay the same for longer than 3 months, which only happened twice since 2018.I am not in any way saying that everyone should use it or it's the only indicator for buying the bottom/selling the top (there's no only one indicator in crypto or finance and multiple of them should always be used at the same time), but it's a nice market feel tool nonetheless.Releasing it tomorrow BTC",
