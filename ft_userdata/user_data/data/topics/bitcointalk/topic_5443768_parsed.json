  "content": "In the news today, we have Binance.US on target again. U.S. since the boom of crypto exchange from 2017 up trend has targeted the binance. Since US's decisions could be alarming to the existence of Binance and is due to the fact that Binance has almost fifth users from the US alone. Binance originally operates from China and Japan hub. SEC has claimed that they only have US domain and nothing else to showcase to US authorities. For example, there is no physical offices in the USA neither there are any such registered entities for Binance US. With that being pointed out, Binance is under trouble of getting warned by SEC for its practices and off shore business is no guarantee since they are not under their jurisdiction. There are talks that Binance might just segregate this issue by having Bianance.com and Binance.US as different domains and in the former one's US people would be filtered out. However, authorities smell fishy practice here since this way Binance would be able to hide large chunk of the business from them. Since the article is very very long, I am just quoting the initial information. Please visit the source provided for the whole news. QuoteBinance exploded onto the crypto scene in 2017 and grew into the world’s biggest digital-currency exchange. It quickly ran into a problem.It largely operated from hubs in China and then Japan, yet a fifth of its customers were in the U.S., where authorities signaled a coming crackdown on unregulated offshore crypto players. Any lawsuit from U.S. regulators would be like “nuclear fall out” for Binance’s business and its officers, a Binance executive warned colleagues in a 2019 private chat.Worried about the threat of prosecution, Binance set out on a plan to neutralize U.S. authorities, according to messages and documents from 2018 to 2020 reviewed by The Wall Street Journal as well as interviews with former employees.The strategy centered on building a bare-bones American platform, Binance.US, that would license Binance’s technology and brand but otherwise appear to be wholly independent of Binance.com. It would shield from U.S. regulators’ scrutiny the larger Binance.com exchange, which would exclude U.S. users.But Binance and Binance.US have been much more intertwined than the companies have disclosed, mixing staff and finances and sharing an affiliated entity that bought and sold cryptocurrencies, according to the interviews and the messages and documents reviewed by the Journal. Binance developers in China maintained the software code supporting Binance.US users’ digital wallets, potentially giving Binance access to U.S. customer data.If U.S. regulators conclude that these links mean Binance has control over a U.S. company, they could claim the power to police Binance’s entire business, which, to many investors, has been a black box since the start. This would also put Binance’s billionaire founder and chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, and his finances under closer scrutiny. Recently, a Texas financial regulator said in a court filing that Binance.US didn’t get a license to operate in the state because it wouldn’t provide financial information from its largest shareholder, Mr. Zhao.The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department have been probing the relationship of Binance, which lists no headquarters, to Binance.US at least since 2020, according to subpoenas and people familiar with the matter. The Justice Department and the SEC declined to comment.On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators asked Binance to answer a series of questions, alleging it had “hidden basic financial information from its customers and the public.” Binance has also been in the crosshairs of some other countries, where it has been accused of operating without a license.Binance is by far the largest cryptocurrency platform standing after the collapse last year of others such as FTX left the digital-currency world reeling. The swift collapse of FTX changed the calculus for U.S. regulators, who now are engaged in an intensive effort to rein in the $1 trillion crypto sector. Binance’s ability to navigate the industry turmoil and deal with regulators in the U.S. is a test case for the future of crypto.Ninj0r [a Binance software developer]: Why did trading start? It’s not time yet!!! Who started trading? We had the trading timers set? Who started trading?Other messages followed, including another urgent one from Ninj0r: someone started TRADING EARLY. Who did it? At 8:56:09.822 someone manually started trading. Who? Why?Eventually, the company founder and chief executive answered.Changpeng Zhao: a guy here in Shanghai, mistake operation.Developers in Shanghai maintained key software functions at Binance.US at least through the summer of 2021, the Journal has reported. The Shanghai developers’ contracts were with Binance, not with the U.S. platform, according to a person familiar with the agreements.The spokeswomen for Binance and Binance.US said the companies’ relationship is governed by licensing agreements, including for Binance’s technology. The Binance.US spokeswoman said that U.S. customer data is stored in the U.S. and that it and Binance never commingled user data.The SEC has also been examining the relationship between Binance.US and two trading firms with ties to Mr. Zhao, Merit Peak Ltd. and Sigma Chain AG, the Journal has reported.Texts From Crypto Giant Binance Reveal Plan to Elude U.S. AuthoritiesThe exchange was intertwined with an American firm portrayed as independent. Now, regulators are circling.",

SEC has been the most corrupt so it's up to harass binance.com this time but like Ripple, Binance will be able to put up a big fight against them since they have the money. But I think they would have to provide evidence first on thier own before they can go on harassing.",

The fact that they are going after the wrong exchanges like Kraken and Binance is ridiculous when they should of investigated FTX, Luna, 3AC, Gemini Earn last year.This always happens when there is some big collapse or scandal. Kind of like after MtGox the regulators in Japan got very tight with regulating crypto. This will keep happening until something worse happens in the macro market and everybody will move on to that issue.",

Well, SEC is attacking Binance since the BUSD issue and this is not the lone exchange at risk, i heard Kraken also have an issue with SEC, why not?

If they do decide to take action against Binance, they will need to provide evidence to support their claims which is what I think they don't have yet.  In any case, Binance has the resources to mount a strong defense, as we've seen CZ the owner is very wise to make a defense towards his business.  It will be interesting to see how this situation develops in the coming weeks and months.IMO, it's clear that there is growing scrutiny on the crypto industry as a whole, and companies will need to ensure that they are operating in compliance with regulations to avoid sanctions.",
