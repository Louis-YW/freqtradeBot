If you neither know what a seed phrase is, read this: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase",

Sure. As a hardware wallet? No.You can set up a wallet on an airgapped computer and then save a copy of that wallet on a USB drive. As long as you only ever connect that USB drive to airgapped computers, then it remains permanently offline. This is not a hardware wallet though. Hardware wallets are specifically designed to be resistant to both electronic and physical attacks, whereas a plain USB drive is highly susceptible to both. While a hardware wallet can be stolen, connected to an online computer, or connected to a computer filled with malware, without loss of your coins, a USB drive in any of these scenarios could very easily lead to loss of your coins.Quote from: Crypto Library on May 08, 2022, 04:09:35 PMMy other question is since I have never used a hardware wallet, that's why I want to know is it possible to recover a hardware wallet if it is lost or broken, or damaged?Most hardware wallets will use seed phrases, which will let you recover all your wallets. Some also support encrypted digital back ups, such as on to an SD card.I think the subtext of your question here is if you can avoiding paying for a hardware wallet and instead come up with your USB drive based system to save some money. The short answer is no. You will almost certainly come up with something far inferior and leave yourself open to attack vectors you haven't considered. You can set up airgapped and encrypted cold storage, and a USB drive could be part of that, but it is not for the newbie and requires a degree of technical knowledge and competence.",

I hope I will get good answer from this community get yourself familiar, u can use a pen drive or or another operating system like linux installed on the same machine.install electrum and see how it works, and once you get familiar, you can go ahead and buy a hardware wallet, it just helps you sleep safely at night is all.as for your second question, as long as the seed is safe and not compromised, any coins held in the cold/hardware wallet are easily recoverable.",

A hardware wallet has your private key within it, never exposes that key, and requires physical confirmation to send a transaction.That is wrong.A USB disk can not function like a hardware wallet that you connect it to your PC and sign transactions but it also doesn't have to only be a dumb storage. You can create your own advanced setup where you can safely sign transactions too. One way would be to install a Linux OS on the USB disk, encrypt the home folder, disable certain options that would allow access, disable network, etc. install Electrum, boot the OS and easily sign transactions offline in a very secure environment.",

That makes the whole process that much easier.This would also be stand-alone OS running without networking or access to disks which sounds more secure to me than an OS that runs inside another running OS (VirtualBox) that may have vulnerabilities.",

IBM also release FHE implementation for 3 different linux distro, but it's rarely updated only available on Docker[2].

LOL) OS could modify the recipient's address shown on screen to point to an attacker's address. Then it would proceed to also intercept the address sent to the hardware wallet (no difference if USB or QR codes are used..) and the hardware wallet will sign the transaction. It will also show the 'right' address on screen (attacker address matching with modified address on computer screen).That's the best attack against hardware wallets I can think of today.

While an interesting read for me, I believe OP should stick to a 'normal' out-of-the-box hardware wallet.Unless he's about to store life-changing amounts of money, in which case he should take the time to learn more about cold storage and fully understand it before putting huge sums of money into it.",

Yes you can recover coins from your hardware wallet BUT only if you stored backup safely, and if you checked if they are actually working and written correctly, including passphrases.It's better to know derivate path for hardware wallet in case they are using something custom.If you lose or break old hardware wallet, importing keys in new device should recover everything, if done correctly.",

You have to define, what is \"trusted\" and what is not, you have to know your \"security model\", let's say. You have to \"tr*st\" something. For example, you cannot fully validate your hardware. Your eyes cannot read text on CDs, you cannot \"switch them to 700nm and read some zeros and ones\" in the same way as you can read some text written on paper. So, because of physics, you have to \"tr*st\" your hardware. Also, if you are not a programmer, but just some user, then you have to \"tr*st\" your software. And then, if you are not a cryptography expert, then you have to \"tr*st\" maths behind all of that. And if you are not an operating system developer, then you have to choose some system and \"tr*st\" that. For example, if your system is compromised and filled with malware, then that sender's address can be replaced by the attacker's address.So, to sum up, Bitcoin is superior to other systems (like fiat), because you always can explore it and get some knowledge. You can ask questions and look for answers. It is not a system, where you have some dollars with some serial numbers and you have no idea, why you have those numbers and not something else. Here, everything is public, and you can always know more, but there will be always a way to attack you, so you have to define your \"level of tr*st\" to separate parts where you know enough to check it, from parts where you know nothing and have to \"tr*st\", until you will learn that.",

I'm confident that almost nobody has ever verified the firmware running on the microprocessor of the USB drive that their Linux Live distro runs on. That's just one concrete example of where 'don't trust, verify' gets harder and harder to perform. You'll always hit a 'brick wall' where you can't verify everything.I don't understand what's the deal with you 'self-censoring' the word 'trust', though?",

They could also call you and read it out; intercepting and changing the words someone says over the telephone will be almost impossible compared to hacking a messaging app and changing the text shown on screen.You could even go as far as using the blockchain itself, for example the recipient could deposit a certain number of coins into this address (like 0.123456789 BTC) that they tell you over a secure or hard to hack channel (such as telephone) and you can verify with your Core node, phone, and various PCs on block explorer websites that this address holds that balance.Just some ideas that don't sound very paranoid if you were to really transfer millions of USD to someone.",

I'm saying that yes, absolutely focus on the attack vectors which are more likely first, but if you have protected yourself as much as you can against common attack vectors, then it is only logical to start considering uncommon ones. All these attacks are possible, and the risk they pose to each individual user will depend on your threat model and the steps you have already taken to mitigate against. The list of vulnerabilities or potential attack vectors against you, ranked by likelihood, is not universal nor static. Perhaps the most likely way for you to lose your coins is by someone finding your seed phrase, which is written on a post-it note and stuck on your monitor. It absolutely makes sense for you to focus on this issue first. But since my coins are in a passphrased wallet with the seed phrase and passphrase stored encrypted and in two separate safes in two separate cities (for example), then this attack vector is much further down my list, and so it makes sense for me to focus on different attack vectors.",
