  "content": "Hi,I sent some bitcoin using Electrum wallet. In the history tab, I got this yellow exclamation mark next to my transactions saying: Unconfirmed ParentHere's the screenshothttps://imgur.com/a/NGDsgS5I tried increasing the fees but then it says: the server returned an error when broadcasting the transaction. Consider trying to connect to a different server, or updating Electruminsufficient fee, your transaction is trying to replace another one in the mempool but it does not meet the rules to do so. Try to increase the fee.This is the screenshothttps://imgur.com/a/901dHx9I've done the following:Connect to another server in electrumupdate electrum to the newest versionuse a free bitcoin accelerator to rebroadcast the transactionsThe original fee is 2 sat/b, I tried increase fees a few time and managed to changed that to 6,7,and 14 sats/b respectivelyBut the transaction still not getting any confirmations",

This is the first time I set the fees higher but still not getting confirmation in 2 days I haven't understood what you said 'Note that increasing the fee for your first transaction invalidates the later (child) transactions'",
