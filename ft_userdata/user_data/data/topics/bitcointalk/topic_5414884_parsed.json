If I agreed with it, maybe I'd play Rambo, but since it's a war, or rather an invasion, which I understand is unjust, I'd try to escape if I could. Quote from: paxmao on September 25, 2022, 10:19:26 PMWhat will be the effect on RF economy?The effects of wars are usually bad for the economy in general, for both sides, and this is something we are seeing in Europe. If the war were to end today, the situation could only improve, in Russia, Ukraine, the EU and the rest of the world in general.",

Even if this happens, there is always the possibility that Russia will import labor from friendly countries.It's 146 total, and only half of them roughly 70 million work, you cut half of them again since the ones working for the government, police,  doctors, and teachers, as well as government-owned companies, won't be sent to the frontline and you have 200k in the first wave and roughly 400k now, that's about 3% and a further 1% of what's left going to the frontline and probably going to get killed or left handicapped for life. Plus it won't be the cashier at Auchan that would be fleeing but the ones that have enough money to flee, the ones with education and experience that know how to get a job, and more importantly who have the money to pay one year of advance on rent in a foreign country, not to mention the 2000E plane ticket  Of course, the effect won't be felt immediately but in a year or two, the consequences will be disastrous, not only was Russia's population shrinking rapidly before now it will be worse and worse in the year to come.Quote from: paxmao on September 25, 2022, 10:19:26 PMWould you run away to avoid conscription?

However, somehow I do not believe that Putler will allow mass emigration, the borders can be closed at any moment, war can be officially declared and everyone who tries to escape will be treated as deserters. Today I read what the President of Belarus said about this while consoling his colleague from Moscow, and that is that it might be good for some people to leave, because what is the use of them if they do not want to be loyal servants of the regime.Although the situation is not identical, I can somewhat draw a parallel with what has been happening in my country in the past 10 years, which is the loss of over 400 000 people (about 10% of the total population), which is not a problem for the ruling politicians, because not only they have reduced unemployment, but they have already gotten rid of the critical mass that was a possible trigger for changes in the country.",

What will be the effect on RF economy?Being fully honest I would probably run away if I would get drafted to join the military during a full scale war. First of all, I have 0 military training and never really shoot a rifle. In my country military training is not mandatory anymore and the military doesn't have a high social standing. The second motivation would be that the news out of Ukraine are very bad for Russia, the front line is collapsing and the chances of winning are very small. Why risk your life in a doomed war? The third problem for me is that it seems there is only 2 weeks of military training before being developed to the front line. That's not enough to get effective soldiers who will be able to fight veteran Ukrainian troops.The effect on the Russian economy will be devastating. I read on the weekend that already 250,000 young Russian man left the country. Together with all the people that are being drafted there will be a lot of people missing from workforce which is going to reduce the economy even further.",

What will be the effect on RF economy?If a global recession sets in, no one will have economic statistics worth being proud of. Perhaps a better question may be what america, the EU and other nations of the world do to prepare for negative economic effects. There isn't much point in celebrating the alleged demise of russia's economy when the economy of our own nation could soon suffer a similar fate. Russia's national debt being around 20% of GDP could place it in a better position to weather economic disruptions in contrast to other nation's of the world.I saw a source which claimed russia's military invaded ukraine despite lacking radio encryption. This is the type of factoid the media could publicize more. If their goal were to make Putin and the russian military appear incompetent or weak. Overall wartime danger for conscripts is not very high at the moment, I think. The ukraine coalition appears to have success based around deployment of HIMARs which primarily targets russian military leadership and supplies. Its not the average russian soldier who is being targeted the most. Life expectancy for russian conscripts could be much better than it is for high ranking officers.While the \"what would you do, if you were a russian conscript\" portion of OP's post might appear hypothetical. It is possible that the united states could launch a full offensive on russia once the 2022 elections are over. Of which conscription or a draft could play a major role. I honestly don't know what I would do if conscripted/drafted. Being a frontline soldier isn't the only option. Militaries of the world have 2x to 3x or greater support personnel for every available soldier. Statistically there is a chance conscripts could wind up being refrigerator repairmen. Or land in a support role. Having some type of technical or mechanical ability could make conscripts better suited to office work than wielding an AK-47. The best course of action might be to lookup which support roles are most needed to support front line troops. Take courses to develop a skillbase in that area. That way if you are conscripted you'll have a decent chance of qualifying for a support staff role, rather than front line combat.",

Even in the whole of the Soviet union and the Iron Curtain the Russian government saw how valuable an income source it created. In just the last two days the Russian stock exchange has collapsed further than ever before and remember that is happening when foreign nationals are not allowed to sell stocks, so it's all locals cashing their stocks out. Almost all foreign businesses which brought vitality to the Russian markets have pulled out and getting hold of vital components will become ever harder. Frankly the conscription will be the only reliable job left in Russia very soon, that is how stupid their government have let them down for a petty war.",

It's different when you're defending your home (thinking of Britain for example, high rate of voluntary show) but I think every country's who'd had to forcibly recruit (or conscript if we want) will always face runaways.

Yeah, working in Russia, getting paid from Russia but, what a surprise spending all their money in the country, let's multiply a simple sum of 1500$ a month by 300k who have left only this wave and you've got 5 billion$, money that was supposed to come back in the economy and fuel growth, instead you have money coming out and helping the former friendly states who are now laughing and spitting on the former wanna be a global power.

I think that this is going to have a deep effect in the economy of the RF.Would you run away to avoid conscription? What will be the effect on RF economy?The reality is a little different:1. 300,000 disposable Russians, this is the first wave, not the most successful mobilization of the second army in the world 2. If the old Kremlin asshole does not return to a more or less adequate state (for example, it dies), there will be only 4 waves, with a total number of 1,200,000 bodies driven to the slaughter.3. That tacit agreement with which they go to death, meaningless, suggests that in the life of these bipeds there is nothing more or less valuable It will not hurt the economy - how can you hurt a dying economy.4. Russians leaving for other countries will receive the status of guest workers, will work at the cheapest job, and send their relatives to Russia 100-150 dollars of income per month",

Why would I leave my family just to sustain a crazy invasion? Why would I leave a peaceful and good life just to support a violence that I do not share and am even embarrassed of. Even if I don't really want to, I'd leave my country with my family and be at peace somewhere else. However, this is somebody speaking who is probably looking at the current invasion with a different lens. I don't idolize Putin. I wasn't brainwashed. I am not subjected to its harsh rules and its implementation from the authorities. I am not living my day-to-day life listening to or watching propaganda from the radio or the television, respectively. To those who went through all this, however, he/she might be more than willing to kill or be killed.If this movement will be massive, then it might indeed affect the country's economy in one way or another.",

Although I am aware that many young men have arrived in my country in recent days, this is a negligible proportion. Polls show that these are people who are engaged in IT technologies, and just by staying in another country, they will not change anything for themselves. While working remotely, they still continue to work in Russia. Among other things, Russia should have the composition of its army, and, frankly, I don’t understand why civilians are mobilized when the number of military and trained people is huge. As for the impact on the economy, I doubt that those who leave will be able to influence it in any way.I see, I guess you are still wearing your blinder. Yes, Its not overblown that Russian Youtubers are not fleeing your country and all of the videos by shared by multiple Russian people are a hoax. Also the amount of trolls on reddit was significantly reduced when the mobilization was announced.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on September 27, 2022, 06:44:42 AMI don’t understand why civilians are mobilized when the number of military and trained people is huge. Are you still relying on your media to discern why Putin is mobilizing citizens?Any general would not risk young men to just give them riffles, train them for about 2 weeks and then put them on the frontline. That would be a suicide which is not logical for a Russian general to do that. The conscription is for people who had been trained in military services before and are put into different departments like for Fire Department or Disaster Rescue Department. They are probably reporting to the military once a month, they are not civilians. If civilians are fleeing, they'd be putting themselves in danger. Not all countries, welcome refugees with hospitality.  One Russian general said something like this: \"If the sons and relatives of all deputies and other leaders are sent to the front lines, then the war will end quickly\"In the meantime, many people from poor families are taken to the war, it will continue.",
