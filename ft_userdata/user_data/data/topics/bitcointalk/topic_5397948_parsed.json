  "content": "Very new to Bitcoin community. I joined the conversation on the CK pool thread. To start the process of learning bitcoin mining through CK pool solo mining. I asked Con Kolivas many questioned in the spirit of understanding and knowledge. Not only was none of my questions answered. One of my post was deleted by Con Kolivas. Very strange right?  A harmless little question. So I dug deeper. Found out that CK pool is  NOT in fact open source like it claims to be.  Don’t trust but verify right? A bunch of people are trusting Con Kolivas with their hardware and electricity but does anyone know for sure what is actual happening to your hash power.  Not sure what I did to upset Con Kolivas . Not the person I imagined he would be though. I imagined a helpful seasoned mentor .Even someone nice enough to answer a little questions from a new forum member here.I did not join this community for this or Drama but here we are…sources from https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool/src/master/has NO mention of 1PKN98VN2z5gwSGZvGKS2bj8aADZBkyhkZ address  in the sourcehttps://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1PKN98VN2z5gwSGZvGKS2bj8aADZBkyhkZThis address has transacted 310 times on the Bitcoin blockchain. It has received a total of 48.67186482 BTC ($1,518,397.18) and has sent a total of 45.08555548 BTC ($1,406,516.49). The current value of this address is 3.58630934 BTC ($111,880.69).Scary when you think about it. Who really gets the 6.25 BTC from this pool? One deflected question and deleted comment brings up a bunch more right?Does anyone have proof of a real person who has gotten the Rewards from CK pool?UPDATE 5/28/22forum admins please delete this topic. My lack of knowledge led me to create this thread . Now that i have learned more .CKpool is in fact 100% open source. Public apology to Con Kolivas for the insinuation. A little communication would have been nice.",

It's usually a good idea to read more and post less when you're new.It seems like you're not doing your research properly because your question is extremely easy to answer.Sledge0001 recently found a block solo mining with ckpool.Have a look at his post and see how grateful he is to the other members of this forum that made the things he is using:Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5237323.msg59084637#msg59084637I really want to thank everyone on the forum for their support and guidance. Particularly thank you to the following:-CK <-- Your pool has changed my world and wallet balance forever.Kano <-- Your software and guidance was invaluable. SideHack <-- You evil genius your hardware although small was extremely effective. Willi9974 <-- I used the funds won from one of your block parties to buy the hardware 419Mining.com <-- Seller of the Compac F's  AsicPuppy.com  <-- Seller of the Compac F'sNote that you're accusing one of the most trusted users here, the author of cgminer and ckpool. There has been multiple companies over the years copying cgminer and close sourcing it. Your post in the ckpool thread looks like a similar thing, wanting to copy the code to remove the pool fee or make your own clone, etc. It's open source, you can copy it, but the ckpool thread is not the place to discuss that, as I'm sure you'll understand why. That's the reason why your post was deleted, not the conspiracy theory that you're trying to create in this post. If anything, this thread you made is a disrespect to Con Kolivas.",

I am extremely lucky and can confirm that CK and his solo pool mining site work exactly as he claims and based on my wallet balance I believe whole heartily that he's 100% legit.I woke up with 6.426845 BTC in my wallet after hitting a block on CK's solo pool mining with USB sticks. It's 1 million percent not a scam as I was able to show that I submitted a share above the difficulty further showing that it was in fact real. Real luck no doubt but make no mistake its real.You'd be much better served asking CK for his help in a private message.",

      "body": "Glad everyone is so trusting . Further exploration down the rabbit hole has led me to many examples of HASHRATE theft . It is very easy to do if a pools source code is half open and rest closed source.  A very clear cut example of a way hashrate theft happens is right here.  https://github.com/ctubio/php-proxy-stratumSolo mining is a gamble . To what degree are gambling is the only question . Gambling on the outstanding odds of hitting a solo block and possibly getting your hashrate stolen? We should only be gambling with one variable….The bitcoin variable. Trust all you want but do you really trust human being with $187,873.125 . I do not care who you are or how long you have been around. 187,873 reasons is way to many for a person to choose self over another person.   If CK pool was so honest why is there no tutorials on how to replicate the pool. Why is there only 2 pools running their software?  So many unanswered questions.  The nature of open source and sharing is what this Bitcoin was founded on. Seems like some of the oldest members here do not subscribe to the ethos of bitcoin.  If I was able to replicate ck pool and see the full scope of how it works . Sure  I would retract my suspicions . Right now any open source developer that deletes basic questions on how their code works is highly suspicious. From the example from link and screen shot look in red. is Kano not the second developer of Ck pool? These coincidence are a little strange right.  The developer ctubio is trying to tell us something here.... I hope this community is not so blinded by the legendary badging of some members of this forum to thinking they are some sort of saint and void of being dishonest",

Once the vibe is in place by a couple things that took place you start to make these negative connections.  Came to this community with hope and excitement. Never imagined in my first couple days to feel so suspicious  about something. no mention of the  1PKN98VN2z5gwSGZvGKS2bj8aADZBkyhkZ 2% development address to Con Kolivas is mentioned any place in the source.

Not sure what you're not understanding.The new pool address(instead of the default one in the code) and the 2%(instead of the old 0.5% seen in the code) are written/updated locally by the pool operator, so you won't see it in the published source code. Think of this as settings, not source code.The new address and new fee that ckpool solo is using are clearly published in the pool website, and you can see it in the new blocks found by the pool as I showed you in the last post. The logic itself hasn't changed, that's still all clearly visible in the source code.",

Nice. Thanks . All this could have been avoided if my post was not deleted by Con Kolivas in the CK pool thread. He answers many no brainer type questions in the CK pool thread but could not take the 5 seconds to reply to my very simple question. Classic case of lack of communication led us here. Do not try to gas light me with this. The error was not mine here. People come to this forum for communication, knowledge and understanding. If developers fails to communicate to simple queries. We end up in this situation. Deleting questions from main threads do not make the longing for the answer to disappear. Just brings the question to another thread with a little added negative overtones from someone being frustrated.",

Not one person can show me the 2% allocation example in the source code. If you can see by my first post . I found the 0.5% allocation in the codebase on day 1. I have never bee confused about that. The 2% allocation directly in to  Con Kolivas at 1PKN98VN2z5gwSGZvGKS2bj8aADZBkyhkZ  is NOWHERE in the source code. See we are right back at the start of this. Not one person can point out the logic and lines of code that represent the 2% allocation of a solved block from CK pool. We are going back and forth with information already known.  Please if you can point out the code example in the source code of CK pool that sends the 2% to Con Kolivas to this  1PKN98VN2z5gwSGZvGKS2bj8aADZBkyhkZ . You simply cannot cause it is NOT there. I have combed through it a dozen times.It is just not thereI explained it as clearly as I could in the last post. Not sure what you're not understanding.The new pool address(instead of the default one in the code) and the 2%(instead of the old 0.5% seen in the code) are written/updated locally by the pool operator, so you won't see it in the published source code. Think of this as settings, not source code.The new address and new fee that ckpool solo is using are clearly published in the pool website, and you can see it in the new blocks found by the pool as I showed you in the last post. The logic itself hasn't changed, that's still all clearly visible in the source code.Thank you very much for answering my questions. I understand completely now. I know this was not your issue to tackle but you did and i thank you so very much for it. Sorry if i came off aggressive or mean. Being frustrated is a tough emotion for me and something i am working on.",
