Based on the merit the user should be a full member and the post should be 120 or more.

It remind me with BobLawblaw who delete his post even though his merit already 3K+, but due to lack of activity he become a member rank, but right now he keep posting and back to legendary rank again.Did DewlanceVPS scam you? does he's trying to scam or did any other suspicious activity?",

In this case I think the user has deleted a lots of posts either it might be for changing hands or something else.I don't see any evidence for the change of hands because the user is promoting his service in 2013 and in 2022 so if the account changed hands then probably the company also sold along?Also bpip doesn't show any records of change of password, email it only shows the wokeup after a long gap and deleting his own post is upto the user who made it so it can't be suspicious unless he tried to scam someone and deleted the post to remove the evidence.",

I haven't seen any suspicions the account has changed hands.several times the account created threads on local Indian boards. but after Woke Up, he hasn't made a post in the local thread yet.as long as no member is deceived by the service he provides, I think it's still normal.",

Regarding possibility of the account changing hands, I see that he is promoting his web hosting business since 2013 up until few days ago, so there is some consistency here.",

      "body": "I would say that deleting post history does not provide any concrete evidence at all that something untoward has occurred but it is because of threads such as this one that we can get together and look at the account in question to pass on opinions therefore thank you for posting about it.Granted, they are not prolific posters in the forum but they have their account dating back to 2012. In my opinion there seems to be nothing substantial to indicate the account has changed hands, on the contrary they seem to be promoting their business when they do post and there seems to be nothing to be alarmed about.Quote from: shasan on November 20, 2022, 03:09:14 AMThe user DewlanceVPS has 100 merits on his/her profile.

After all, deleting a post is not a reason to suspect a user has changed hands, I think this kind of thing can still be done by every user in this forum as long as they think the post is not important.Also I don't see bpip noting this account changed its email and password recently so any suspicion of the account changing hands at this point is very unlikely. About account above, I think he's still the same user without too much suspicion about it on my part. But if he cheats on you, then he should face the consequences.",

Of course we don't know why this user deleted the post, but he has the right to do so on his own. DewlanceVPS may have realized that his account rating would drop after he deleted the post, but it looks like he didn't delete it recently as there's a chance he did it a long time ago.One of my reasons is that Ninjastic.space has only recorded 47 posts from this user in its history. If he deleted them recently, maybe the number of posts scraped on Tryninja tool would be higher than his current post count.",
