You can advice him about how bitcoin is a good investment and that he can invest in it, but do not take it to the level of involving his parent company. Let him be the one to make that thinking and decision by himself. If bitcoin price start falling after he invested his father company money on it, he will start to blame you, even though the price of bitcoin will later still increase above the price he started investing.",

Is it company money or inherited money from his father?I think your friend needs to divide the company's money in the bank into several priorities, such as: capital reserves, emergency reserves. If the company has remaining money from mandatory reserves, it can be used for investment. He also needs to divide investments into at least two things, such as low-risk investments and high-risk investments.I know bitcoin has a high rate of return on investment, but bitcoin falls into the high-risk investment category. This is not a good choice for small company investments unless the company already has strong financial reserves.",

Though Bitcoin is a good investment plan right now, but you shouldn't make it look lik the only option out there .i don't think you should involve yourself in situations like this as it might not end up well. Even though Bitcoin is a good investment, some people who really don't understand how it works might take it as scam ones the price begins to dip. I would advice your to say off from his decision on what to invest with his families money. You can just give him some tips but dont get too involved in it. If he decides to invest that's his choice so that he will be the one to bear any risk that come with it",

First, do you know what percentage of their company's capital MicroStrategy is using to buy bitcoin? I bet they are not stupid enough to use all the company's capital to invest in bitcoin and have no savings in the bank. Second, if your friend's company is in trouble and needs money urgently to handle it while his bitcoin investment is losing money because of the market dumping. How will you help him solve that problem and are you willing to take your money to help his company?",

On the one hand, you as a friend are not wrong in saying that you are investing in Bitcoin.On the other hand, the effects of price volatility that you cannot understand well can impact you, hot balls will be thrown at you.As a good friend, don't have to give advice in certain circumstances if he doesn't ask for it. I think as a good friend, don't immediately advise him to invest if he doesn't know yet. Just guide him to know what Bitcoin is and other knowledge that is important to him.",

I mean emergency purposes for the company because you don't know what can happen in the future. TBH, comparing his company over Microstrategy isn't a good thing. Is his company as huge as Microstrategy? Yes, the company is continuously buying Bitcoins, but I still believe that they have extra funds that will be used just in case the company needs it. Does your friend's company have money have that? If yes, then go ahead let your friend invest into cryptocurrency \"ONLY\" if he knows about it. Don't let him invest the company's money because it's your advice. Let him invest because he knows cryptocurrency.Well, you said it already, but TBH, I don't recommend somebody to invest into Bitcoin unless they're knowledgeable enough already. Good Luck I guess.",

It's necessary to understand that running a company isn't a simple task that you can easily figure everything out just by occupying the office as the boss and so it's necessary he ensures things all intact financially in the company before thinking to diversify the companies savings into another asset.If we assume that the company is doing too well and still have excess money that's lying dormant, then you can consider using like 50% of the excess money as an initial money to front loard bitcoin while the remaining 50% will serve as emergency fund for the company. If after a while everything's seems to be going on well with no effect regarding the money that has been shifted into buying of Bitcoin, then you can probably advice that he start buying more using the DCA methord by then he must have gotten all the basics of investment into Bitcoin and wouldn't look you as someone that's possibly looking for ways to squander his fathers wealth.",

You are wrong.Because to run the company, he will need money. MicroStrategy has deep pocket and they did not invest all money they have to bitcoins.Your advise is wrong too that if your friend took over the company from his father, with a task to run it, he has to do that. If he wants to invest in Bitcoin, do it with his own money or with part of revenue from that company.If your friend invests in bitcoins, but then change to trading and use leverages, he will destroy the company inherited from his dad.",

I would consider your suggestion to be absurd especially since it is important to have your friend in the business that your friend's father has a business standing and not to invest all capital bitcoins in your friend's father. You yourself know that investing in bitcoins is risky and if your friend's father can't make this investment at the right time, then your friend's father's investment will definitely be at risk and the amount of profit he would have gotten if he kept money in the bank might be less profit than investing in bitcoins.Also, if your friend's father has invested in bitcoins and is not careful in hoarding those bitcoins, your friend's father's bitcoins may be at risk. You should be careful in giving advice especially if your friend's dad can't keep bitcoin holdings in the right wallet or if your dad's bitcoin gets hacked for some reason then your friend's dad might blame you for losing his bitcoin.",

As much as I like to encourage people to invest in Bitcoin, I'd say this is not a good advice. The money does not belong to him, it belongs to the family, so it'd be wrong to invest it without the family's knowledge and consent. The right thing is to have a round table discussion with his dad and other siblings and make them see why it is good to invest in bitcoin rather than having it in the bank.",

A company that tries to follow Microstrategy investment steps does not have the same source of support so its output is also not guaranteed. Because the Saylor company clearly has ready financial support in any case, you may not be wrong but giving a friend the option to invest in bitcoin with the company stagnant condition, unstable income is very risky. So it all depends on whether your friend's company is able to balance everything, including the risks of Bitcoin itself.The company involves many parties and there are many things that need to be considered. Therefore, it is not enough to just give advice about investment if your friend does not fully understand what Bitcoin is, its benefits and risks.",
