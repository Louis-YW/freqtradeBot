Can't tell if it's because of the Wasabi backlash or just in general more people are using it. There really is no way to tell why since outside of a few people here I don't think a lot of people are going to come out and say why they are using a particular wallet or service.-Dave",

      "body": "Sparrow does indeed use Samourai's Whirlpool.Agree completely with DaveF above. Sparrow is the best choice by far. The most important thing with Sparrow is to ensure it is pointed at your own node and connecting to the Whirlpool coordinator via Tor, but this is all very easy to set up (literally a couple of clicks).Wasabi use the fees you pay them to actively fund blockchain analysis and pay the company Coinfirm to analyze your UTXOs, spy on your transactions, and decide whether or not you are even allowed to use their coinjoin implementation at all. Here's some fun code from Wasabi (https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/795496595fae2f52730e1556bb6cafd2c649bb97/WalletWasabi.Tests/UnitTests/WabiSabi/Backend/CoinVerifierTests.cs#L133-L142):Code:ScheduleVerifications(coinVerifier, generatedCoins);  foreach (var item in await coinVerifier.VerifyCoinsAsync(generatedCoins, CancellationToken.None))  {   if (item.ShouldBan)   {    naughtyCoins.Add(item.Coin);   }  }  Assert.Empty(naughtyCoins); // Empty, so we won't kick out anyone from the CJ round.Are your coins \"naughty\"? Once Wasabi have spied on them and made that decision, then you will be banned from coinjoining them with Wasabi.  Add in the fact that they suffer from endemic address reuse (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5419000.msg61220171#msg61220171, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg62085316#msg62085316), and I would steer well clear of ever using Wasabi.",

Instead of abandoning that stupid idea or at least staying quite, their response involved throwing dirt and deanonymize other services and its developers. No thanks!",

As I said to you in another post, the wait time for remixing is by far the biggest downside to Whirlpool. Getting unlimited free remixes for an output is obviously very attractive, but much less so when you can be waiting weeks for a single remix.If you don't need your coins mixed quickly and can leave your node and wallet running 24/7, then you can just leave them there and forget about them. They will get remixed eventually. But if you need them remixed quickly, then you need to look at either JoinMarket (but this will cost you to pay for 5+ remixes) or a mixer.And yeah, I wouldn't even bother downloading and testing Wasabi. It doesn't matter what their software is like when they are actively colluding with blockchain analysis behind the scenes.",
