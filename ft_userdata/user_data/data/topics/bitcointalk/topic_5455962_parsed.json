What you will also realize is that the market will start getting use to it and the price will start getting back to the sentiment of the confidence of investors. I think on the long run, bitcoin will recover but shitcoins will give way in the cryptocurrency space. By analysis, the lawsuit may end up that binance may not operate in US and Canada but other countries may decide to allow it with some regulations.",

      "body": "It is not our concern but it is the concern of the market and platforms. Why it's, not our concern? We already have many alternatives to the services provided by both of the exchanges even though we have better services. Why it's markets Concern? Because;⚫ Userbase: Both of the platforms have a huge user base and even though we have alternatives but most of them are not aware of it so, their closing business can make a direct impact on the total users on the market.⚫ Brand Value: In the crypto industry brand value really matters as we already experienced with the FTX, LUNA, SOL, and other projects failures directly impacted the market and made the huge conversion of market investors to the stable funds and market exit. Because Brand collapse always creates a community feud which brings a lot of consequences.⚫ Market Capital: Most of the trading capital is just already occupied by these two projects now slowly things are moving in other directions still a regular inconsistent user prefers these two projects to trade in the market. Strong action against these projects will bring a huge loss in the market capital and trading capital which is not good for the growth of the market.Anyway, things are not that worst yet, I think Binance can manage things out and they also have many alternatives, Same is the case with Coibase. Still, if SEC takes action against them to make strong moves and these projects reach their market default (very measurable chances) it can have a temporary market downfall and pressure it will recover sooner or later as we already faced MTGOX, FTX, and LUNA, and many others major crisis moments.",

Because it is easy for me to use. Though I believe that if Binance stop to exist in the crypto market, there will another one that will spring up that will be greater than Binance.

Binance and Coinbase are larger than XRP so I believe they will manage to live another day against SEC. SEC's just going ham against exchanges these past few years and it's enough to make someone skeptical about the longevity of these CEXs. So the \"rumor\" as you put it is well-warranted considering the situation and the implications it brings. In any case, I do believe as you said that this maneuver by the SEC will be enough to erase Binance out of the map. The exchange just had so much relevance and well-received supporters, as well as a fool-proof failsafe that allows it to linger in the industry for as long as it likes. Although I myself believe that CZ has done nothing wrong to rile the SEC's anger right here, it's still a testimony in itself that the US will do whatever it wants to antagonize anything and everything that stands against capitalism and the little paradise it built for its wealthiest. A true testament to the depravity and utter lack of morals that these people have from the get-go.",

Lots of Binance and Coinbase investors will surely sell-off like what happened during the FTX failure. Binance and Coinbase are much bigger compared to FTX so the damage on crypto is surely more bigger than the recent Luna and FTX fud combined. I’m hoping that Binance and Coinbase will still operate freely even with this lawsuit.",
