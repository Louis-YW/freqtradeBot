Winning? This is hilarious that you keep saying I'm being investigated, but for what? I was told I was being investigated for card counting that is fucking absurd and unheard of, it's impossible to even count cards on online card games, playing martingale and winning 13 bets and losing 8 bets is considered counting cards? I literally just only doubled my balance. You decided to flag me on your own and now you claim you are waiting for evolution to investigate. This is insane, if you need time to pay out my win just say so. Dont say you're investigating. Please, just be patient. That is how gambling sites are these days. If you continue to lose, no investigation, but if you gain and want to withdraw, you will be investigated. Just be patient for the days required. If you have been investigated, let us know the outcome here, and I think FlushCasino will let us know too.",

      "body": "I will understand if their reason is a general suspicious activity but a card counting accusation on live blackjack and baccarat is an absurd reason. It’s impossible to do such thing against live casino because they use multiple deck with continuous shuffle whenever the deck is already on half and same with baccarat.I don't know what's gonna happened to your account but I will not be surprised if they will find other reason to back up their suspicions since they already use a card counting reason to halt your withdrawal.",

True but you know flush.com is here for 3 years and I haven't seen a single such accusation if I can remember correctly (that doesn't guarantee they won't though). I doubt it's same case that all the other websites do.Regarding OP's claim on delay in payment, it's not logical at all. They have spent a lot of on advertisement here and they have been here for more than 3 years as I said. So don't worry. If you are not found guilty, you will be paid.",

It’s impossible to do such thing against live casino because they use multiple deck with continuous shuffle whenever the deck is already on half and same with baccarat.this is what I thought too, with muti-deck cards and continuous shuffling, card counting would be impossible(or almost impossible) to do.anyway, when they posted their response here, they didn't mention the card counting so I think they probably dropped that. @OP, if you want a mediator, you can try posting this on casino.guru or Askgamblers, they are platforms that help gamblers on issues like this. but right now I would suggest try waiting for several days for their next update to you about the issue.",

However, the support team is still holding it hostage and making excuses. Here is the chat with their support: I don't think that's how it works, I mean, you, losing your winnings and only having the initial deposit left would suddenly stop their investigation and let you withdraw the remaining balance in your account(at least that is what I think). you should have just waited for the result of their investigation. anyway, I am not sure if they will suddenly let you withdraw the remaining balance but if they did, good for you.",

Here is the chat with their support: [/b]They can't release it yet when they're doing an investigation and I think that you have to honor that. Just to give you a positive note, when these casinos are investigating and when they're done on it, they'll have no choice but to just release it. Or if they have found something with your activity as suspicious, they may still allow you to withdraw but there could be some exception of the profits you've made.",

During this period, they have not locked my ability to gamble. I have already lost my profits and I am back to my initial deposit amount. It seems that this was their whole intention, to have me keep gambling until I lose, and unfortunately, I fell for it. All I want is my initial deposit amount back. These people defending them will never understand the feeling of having your money wrongfully taken from you. Furthermore, they have been deleting the messages I have been sending on their public chat, and their hot wallet has barely any funds, around $5000. If all of these aren't red flags, I don't know what are.I've seen a lot of scam accusation threads similar to yours and one thing I notice when a casino is investigating the case is that it can take several days, weeks or even a month(s). As much as I call BS about the card counting accusation, they still did say they flagged your account for \"suspicious activity\"as I have said before, they are in the middle of their investigation, I don't think they will suddenly let you withdraw your initial deposit just because you lost your winning and only the initial deposit is left.",
