  "content": "Welcome everybody !I am happy to introduce you to this thread named \"The Encyclopedia of the 1HoDLCLUB \", it includes all the releases of the 1HoDLCLUB. [These are only BTC coin/ingot collectibles]It will allow you to find all 1HoDLCLUB releases in a single thread, which will make your research easier.this thread will be constantly updated and will evolve over time.[Other changes and information will be added during this weekend.The public addresses are not in this thread, you can find them in the original threads of each sale, and soon an Coin analyzer will be available on the 1HoDLCLUB website, thanks to ZipReg for that!Before you go through this thread, I would like to thank you all for your great trust and support, it is thanks to you that the 1HoDLCLUB was born and that it continues today to offer BTC collectibles at the height of the expectation of our community for 1 years now.Without you all this wouldn't be possible! A big thank you to everyone !This is just the beginning.The \"The 1HoDLCLUB Bitcoin Casino\" Collection is the first coin collection of the 1HoDLCLUB.this is a set of 5 different poker chips each with its own material; Clay, Brass, Copper, Silver and Gold.Sales started in October 2021 and ended in January 2022 with the final piece which was the Poker chips in Fine Gold 999.9All sales were separated because I couldn't afford to produce all the chips at once, each sale funded the next one.this collection is a tribute to all the BTC loaded poker chips collections produced in the past, Satori, Kryptowerk, BTCC are the inspiration for this collection, I really liked poker chips without being a big fan of the poker, the atmosphere, the colors inspire me a lot, that's why I decided to make it my first collection, among other things it allowed me to offer the community new poker chips more accessible at the level of the denomination than that produced in the past.it is until today the largest collection ever produced by the 1HoDLCLUB.1HoDLCLUB Golden Brass BTC Poker chipsMintage : 210 Material : Brass gold platedSize : 39mmThickness : 3.2mmWeight : 29.7grDenomination : 0.0005BTC
