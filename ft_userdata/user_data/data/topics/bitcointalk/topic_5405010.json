      "body": "Some solutions will not have an actual effect quickly, meaning that you may start seeing results after several quarters, but the Fed's policy came late, according to many analysts.Raising interest rates will prompt many to deposit if it is higher than inflation. As for those who continue to borrow, they are betting on an increase in inflation and the Federal Reserve has stopped continuing the monetary tightening policy, and therefore we will find a stabilization of the interest rate, not raising it.In the current state of uncertainty it is impossible to predict the behavior of consumers.",
