It's should be that you don't do it right in front of them at all because it's a mirage to assume they will adhere to your caution.Children learn about 90% of all they start with in life from the older people that are always close to, what they see them do, talk, or listen to all the time. Children look up to us and in their innocent mindset they are consumed with the believe that we the older generation to them knows the best and whatever we're doing is the best which makes them follow our footsteps. Anything you don't want your kids to engage in never do it in their presence, gambling games is a fun and entertaining activity and you think children wouldn't want to have fun too with it after they have been seeing daddy , uncle and older cousin's that are like their first role model meshing themselves in it",

It's going to be very hard because of what environment you grow up with, and obviously it will have a big impact on the young generations specially if they see the old ones playing and gambling and so they can influence them.I guess the best thing to do is try to talk to them early so that they won't be sway on playing or at least lessen the effects on them. Just tell them to just focus on their study and what having a good education can do for them in the future. And so you will also guide them, this is not just a one time attempt, you should stay with them specially if you are the parents.",

Find him a hobby of sorts really or something simple he can do that can lead to something he can aspire in the future. Not necessarily studies, even drawing or building figures can be a good past time as well as a push towards jobs related to those industries. Those are the more relatively light or easy methods of trying to get him away from the influence of gambling though. Outside of that, it's purely just communication with the other party. Trying to talk them out of stopping convos like that around the kid or having a completely separate space for them instead would be for the best. It depends on the age but at a certain point, maybe around 17,18, if the issue still persists, just let them try it out for a bit. At least they know what they're doing and has someone to guide them unlike if they try to enter alone and blow god knows whose money.",

We must be able to realize from the start that gambling is a bad act, especially if the younger generation continues or learns what the older generation does, it will have an impact on their future, because usually the younger generation learns. from what they see and hear, if you see the older generation carrying out gambling activities in front of the younger generation or children, it would be better if you gave advice to the parents not to carry out gambling activities openly in front of the younger generation, this will influence younger generation to follow in his footsteps.If the older generation is still determined to carry out these activities without considering your advice then you must be firm and make the older generation afraid and not reckless in using gambling in front of the younger generation.actually the environment is the main factor for the younger generation to carry out positive and negative activities, I mean if your environment is dirty and likes to throw rubbish carelessly then the younger generation will follow these actions, just as your environment is full of gamblers then the younger generation will also follow the trend what parents do and will really influence the younger generation if they let it go, and if your environment is filled with positive things then the younger generation will also be carried away into doing positive activities, so the main point is actually that the environment really influences the growth and development of the younger generation if you want The younger generation or your children are safe from negative things, it would be better if you moved away from an environment that does negative things such as gambling.",

      "body": "The secret with kids, despite being attentive and wise, they don't cease to obey the most kind of adults. Often get them goodies, engage in different form of exercise with them, could be trekking and dancing. The kids won't have reason to sit around where gambling discussion thrive. Having fun is their major priority, like a utility. Provide the kids with fun events, use it to purchase their loyalty. When you've noticed they are loyal and ready to listen to your instructions, henceforth, share your advise with them. Begin by correcting those who already envision being gamblers like the older generations they've been listening to their lengthy conversations. Follow up with studies, asking kids about their assignments in school. Lastly, instruct them to take siestas, once they get used to sleeping in the afternoon. Nothing will ever attract them to the company of gamblers. They'll begin to think better and act reasonably, focusing on their studies and resting when necessary. Reward their performances in school. It's simple to drive kids away from bad influence. No need rushing it, or advising them to stop being with the older ones. They'll gradually begin to change and start a fresh behavior, once you begin to follow such routines as these. It's just the few I can add, but you're expected to have a unique way as well. Depending on the emotional intelligence between you and the kids. Good you noticed this earlier, and seek for means to save the kids. We can't depend or wait on the government for everything. It's our duty to take it upon ourselves to restore our nation's dignity.",

A lot of the things we do while growing up were things we saw our parents or elders do while we were kids. This should be part of the reason a topic was raised here suggesting that we should not gamble before our kids ekse they will emulate us and this can have huge negative impact on them.So the direct answer to this is a yes, the old generation does influence the younger generation to adopt gambling. Just imagine how many coverts a family will have when the dad happens to hit a life-changing jackpot. Even people that hears the testimony will join up to several generations to come.",

The fore fathers are all into gambling, and they all did it for fun, this is normal thing, but as time goes on they start betting money and valuable things, this should have no issue with your family, I grow up with my parents and they have never gamble in my front before, I knew my grand father too and I've never seen him gambling before.Children only tend to do what is been practiced around them, if you or anyone in your house is not into gambling I believe things will be fine, and while you kid grows up the next thing to do is avoid giving him space, not the tiger parenting type but good monitoring, you will be able to know the type of friends he keep in school. Gambling is not a curse on your grand children because of your own parents are into gambling, it makes no sense, keep your environment clean, kids do whatever they see, set a good example around them, and teach them about the wrong friends that can change one's destiny.",

How can I stop the younger generation in my family being carried away by this and focus on other important things like studies only ? You know most of the things we find ourselves doing today is as a result of what we saw the older ones doing or discussing about. No matter how our elders tries to hide things from us we still find out what they are trying to hide from us when we start growing up and for me instead of hiding a habit that someone feels it's not okay for another person that is close to them to get involved in why not come in the open and tell them about that habit and the disadvantages of them being involved in such a habit rather than keeping it away from them. It is believed that no matter how you hide things from the younger ones, someday they're gonna find out and they will feel it has advantages that's why you kept it away from them and before you know it they're already involved in it.It is important to let our younger ones know about a habit that we ain't much comfortable with and tell them the dangers in it as it will help them to stay away from such habits because they are already aware of the harm it will cause to them should they get involved.",

In order to properly manage younger need to create a suitable environment for them. And in this case those who are elderly members of the family should think about this matter. The younger always try to follow the older. When a family has a discussion about a topic almost most of the time, the kids will be encouraged to learn about that topic. I think if you can convince those members to point out the negative aspects of the discussion, then those people will definitely try to refrain from discussing the game. If they take precautions, it can stop its impact on the younger.",

Older people need to be careful what they discuss and the language they use around young underaged people who they know they can easily influence. The situation will be difficult to control, unless you are able to tell the older people to be more careful when they discuss about their cricket games. Before these people start these discussions, they have to be sure that there are no young people in sight who may be influenced to want to try out gambling at their early age due to their discussions.",

A child learns best when they are young because they process information more quickly, believing that everything they see or hear is good and wanting to learn more or even do it themselves. Children should not be exposed to adult content in order to prevent them from learning from it. Even though kids can learn things on their own these days thanks to computers and other resources, although it's preferable if they don't learn all this things at home from their parents or family members.To stop them from learning about cricket fantasy games and gambling you need to stop discussing about it in their presence and also you need to stop playing it when they are around and the most important thing is to educate them about the dangers of gambling and how bad it is for them to participate in it, also if at all possible, you should also make up lies to them in order to discourage them from playing in the future in case peer pressure influences them.

We must teach our children what will be useful to them in their lives, and this initiative must come from us, the parents.Children do not understand what is bad and what is good until their parents explain the difference to them, it is our task to try to give the children the best we can, but what they will do when they grow up will depend only on them.It seems to me that people get acquainted with gambling when they reach the age of majority, in this case everything will depend only on their choice, parents here can only advise something, but will not be able to influence much.",

The first point of stop is for the parents to desist from discussing and disclosing their gambling habit to their children. Such parents should learn to live responsibly and understand that parenting is something important. Whatever you do around the kids, they pick on it easily.You can't have children in the house and you expose them into what they are not yet ready for because they might even be learning and practicing in it in a more dangerous way. Okay just imagine where the child gets hold of his father's phone while he was still logged in to the gambling app and the child bet on the total balance in the account and it was lost  Probably you have $100,000 on the account.

If you must secure them when the discussion begins you can asked them to limits their discussion since is affecting the life's of young people, go directly to those old men or old generation as you said to reduce their discussion not to infects or poisoning the heart of those young people. As an educated individual you are always protect them and make sure they don't involved in a discussion with those old men otherwise they might gets affected, then sometimes it all depends on personal interest whomever that doesn't have interest for gambling may not pick up interest and to look into their discussions.",
