  "content": "What Happened: Today I was browsing my messenger and suddenly I have been showed a Facebook ad which offering Scam Sui Airdrop which is worth of 100 Sui. So they are offering 100 Sui for joining Scam Airdrop. But their pure intention is to hack users wallet because they are asking users Trust wallet and Metamask Secret Recovery Phrase. They also have requirements to have minimum 0.1 BNB or 0.02 Eth to claim 100 Sui so that they can easily steal that assets. Scam Website Link: https://www.suiapp.co/airdrop Archive Link: https://archive.ph/8BKyzI think many of new users can trust this but not all which have minimum knowledge about crypto. But someone can be confused as they are watching this offer from Facebook Ads. So Facebook Team should take care of the ads what they are broadcasting. So my suggestion is that  Never share your keys or Phrase to anyone.And always be alert from any kind of scamming and secure your funds. Here is the Interface where they are offering phishing Airdrop.Here is the Notice where they telling that they will give 100 Sui each to only Trust Wallet and Metamask users.Here they are asking to Import Metamask and Trust Wallet so that they can easily hack and steal users funds. They are also reminding to have minimum 0.1 BNB or 0.02 Eth in users wallet.So everydat new scam tricks are launching and many users are falling into them. We should have more awareness against them so that we all can prevent Scammers. Always Be Safe",

      "body": "Facebook never filters the type of fraudulent ads strictly. I have encountered a lot about this case, as with other crypto offers, which in the end have to enter the Seed Phrase into a phishing site that has been created by scammers, it's no wonder you see this kind of ad on Facebook.But here, I really appreciate you reminding people who don't know that there is no Sui airdrop being promoted on Facebook, all of which are clearly scams.Currently, Sui Network is in hype as the project is running a public sale and also whitelisting on 3 major exchanges: Bybit, Kucoin, and OKX.Currently, Bybit has raised $1,814,469 from whitelisted users, so stay alert, scammers are always taking advantage of the current hype situation.",

Back to the Op, the fact that the site is requesting those participating in the airdrop for their secret phrase should instantly alert them that it's a pure scam. Like I normally say \"It's called secret phrase for a reason\" It has been echoed throughout the forum several times that once a scam site is requesting your private key or secret phrases, it's a clear indication that the site is a scam. I believe only those blinded by greed are going to fall for this type of scam.",

First time i saw Facebook ads for scam site. before this i experiences Twitter and Search engine. This type of phising is easy to detect because they ask for recovery phrase and newbie are also aware that phrase should not be shared. some sites are more dangerous and they automatically send your fund after connecting.",

Well, the same thing with Google and they're even approving sponsored top appearance ads on their search engine. That's why these scams are saying that there should be an amount at least you've got in your wallet because once you automatically connect to their phishing link, CMIIW that this smart contract that they've got automatically drains out any balance on yuor wallet that you approved to connect to them.",

In fact, the SUI project did not launch an Airdrop for early participants in the network, so if someone is a good follower of an official SUI accounts on social media, he will know on his own that this is unreasonable. Scammers take advantage of the hype of popular projects in the market to launch phishing sites bearing the same name as the target project and promote them on social media sites and not only on Facebook, so their tricks are known, and any site that appears in an advertisement does not at all indicate that it is legit, so the person must conduct his research first and never puts his wallet phrases or private key in any sites that appear in these advertisements or links his wallet.",
