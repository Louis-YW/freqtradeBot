It's a really painful performance and for someone watching it is very touching. His daughter adds the emotion when Charlie reconciles.  but I think the factor that made the whale good to watch is that people relate to the movie. You can see a lot of people must have seen themselves struggling with a body like Charlie's. Brendan may actually win.",

Candidates or nominees would be a large pool, also, are criteria given to the public or atleast for the gamblers? form them to be able to take a hint on who's having greater advantage. Quite interesting, I think I'd stick with sportsbetting because it is where I'm goid at and also, celeberities, movies, and such are not thing.",

Because when I look at him in the trailer for his new movie, Emancipation he looks good and totally plays peter, a slave who almost died because of being whipped and escaping from his life. From what I know, Will Smith being banned for 10 years, but is there no forgiveness? Maybe better to voter watch his new movie before making a decision. I'm sure they will change it.",

Adam Sandler should be a good contender in this section too. He did great in the movie \"The Hustle\" combining drama and comedy.But I don't see him yet in the frontrunners of the Best Actor category.I am assuming \"The Fabelmans\" will probably win it as it was the story of young Spielberg. Then, of course, he will also win the Best Director category.",

I have learned from doing this every year that those adjustments come when the list of nominations for all the categories are announced, after the date when the academy of motion pictures and sciences vote, the Golden Globe awards, the Actor's Guild awards and the Director's Guild awards.I will create and share a list and include the dates then we will observe what changes in the odds occur.",

I was pointing out the fact that common people like me are yet to watch these movies. But the reviewers have already watched them, as these films have been shown in various film festivals around the world. But the big question here is whether we want to trust these reviewers or not, without actually watching the entire movie. Normally I don't make a bet, if I don't have sufficient information. 95% of the time, I make bets on sports events. Elections and others events such as Oscars are second priority.",

It seems people are not longer as interested as they once were. The only reason the last Awards had so much relevance and spotlight was because Will Smith lost his cool and decided to slap Chris Rock in a shameless way. I would not be surprised the people behind the planning of the Oscars 2023 (aware of this) planned to turn the event into another scandal for the sake of increasing the ratings.

I am presently very curious now on this. There were articles saying that he went binge eating for this role to reach more than 300 pounds.There were some changes in the top 5 for best picture, very big changes for top 5 of best actress and no changes for best director.Also, this article about Steven Spielberg was published by Gold Derby. They might be brainwashing us that Spielberg is certain to win best director hehehehe.Revisiting Steven Spielberg’s 8 Best Director Oscar races, from ‘Close Encounters’ to ‘West Side Story’Source https://www.goldderby.com/article/2022/steven-spielberg-best-director-oscar-races/",

Given that it will likely have a strong climate change and environmental message. The theme of it could align with current events in a way that will cause annual events like the oscars to throw awards at James Cameron and Avatar. The only thing Avatar TWOW is missing is Greta Thunberg and Al Gore cameo appearances. Guillermo Del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities mini series was probably the best film content I saw produced in 2022. Everything else has unfortunately fallen short of expectations.",
