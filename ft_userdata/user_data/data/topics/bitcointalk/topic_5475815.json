Yes as you compressed the translation threads into one nai good so that they will not come and spam the main board but instead na here dem go come. But one thing you have to know be say though you talk am for the op but the main thing wey dey make them to do di translation na because merit and nothing more and if not who wan translation those plenty things and at di end nothing come out. Like the guy dat has the highest translation has used it to rank up so newbies will also use it to rank up. And one thing be say if dem drop am here people no go too see and read and give them merit unless the op the translation pm the original owner of the thread to over view or any other method they use. I don't know if everyone will this your idea but as for me I like am because it will reduce di spamming of di local board with di translations. And I believed this matter we Don talk before. Brainboss sef don create thread for them to drop their translation thread and I no know what happened after the creation of the local board, that thread was abandoned and everyone bring their words here in the main board.

D main reason why I create dis thread nai be say make people Dem wey dey look for translated threads find Dem easily. If u notice, all d translated threads dey scattered follow our local board and If person one read any, Dem go need to con dey look for these threads page by page. But with dis thread, Dem go only need to search for d one wey Dem want read click the link and e go carry Dem go there asap. Sha e wan be like d thread wey brainboss create sha, but we local board don talk say make Dem disband all the translation make e no dey one single thread. na e make brainboss lock d translation  thread and people com dey drop translation for main board. D idea of merit, no be only our local board start am for translations so that one no supposed be problem. So long say Dem no spam or abuse translation because of merit, problem no dey that one. D thing be say make Dem no always dey put hope for merit wen Dem run translation as that one no good and show say u dey hunt and fish merit and I no fit call dat one translation.",

      "body": "New Translation by @Dzwaafu11, op has been updated. Sorry for not adding earlier, your translation was still under review and I needed to wait until review was finished before adding to my thread. Thanks guys  for your translations and contributions to our local boards. I went through some previous translations and noticed that many aren't accurately conveying the messages from the op. When translating, take your time. The goal is to help those on our local board who might struggle with the more complex English used in the general discussion board. Translations also bring awareness to information on the general boards that local board members may not have heard of before. I wrote out some thing that might help our translators work well Before you start, read the original post to understand the message. This ensures a better translation. Work offline using a notepad or writing app with two tabs or on two different devices to compare your translation easily with the op. Keep a dictionary handy to understand and translate words you may not know.Focus on using pidgin more than English. Pidgin is a broken English used by Africans, and each grammar has a specific pidgin version. Don't rush. Take your time to review your translation before submitting it. Rewards are great, but accuracy is more important. Lastly,I find this most common. Before starting any translation,  you should first confirm form the op that the translation have not been reserved by another member. This will not only help you not to waste your effort, but also prevent you from creating a duplicated translation. I've seen several duplicates on our local boards and most of them didn't receive merits. This might be because the op has already been translated by someone else and the Author might not be interested in awarding a duplicated thread.Let's all be mindful and practice good translation habits.",

Because I don't know if a translation is legitimate and good quality or if it's just copy pasted from Google Translate...I'm happy that Hatchy has PMed me and created awareness about this topic.
