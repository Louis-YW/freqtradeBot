To the best of my knowledge, they removed the ability to sign messages years ago, so while I know that that is the gold standard to prove you are who you claim to be, I won't be able to provide a signed message for that reason. I see no reason why I would claim some really old account (that has been inactive since then and that does not belong to some community \"hero\") to be me, but as alternatives to prove that I am 98789 I could tweet whatever message you want from @tregaus4 (a crypto/fake X account that belongs to me, as you can see in this unedited message from 98789 (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1310101.msg13471129#msg13471129)) or if someone with more privileges is interested in verifying my claim, I can somehow confirm via email.Tehnically, tg9 is the alt account of 98789 so you should log into your main account, tag the new one with neutral and then you can put the old back to rest if you wish and continue with new one from scratch.Quote from: tg9 on November 26, 2023, 09:24:54 AMMerit was introduced. I think the change was introduced not so long after I left the forum, and I have been aware of that change for a few years now (I kept visiting the forum from time to time, I simply did not participate in any discussions nor logged in). I do not consider I was the worst of spammers (at least compared to the average user, I was not a valuable asset to Bitcointalk either), but I would like to build my reputation and my ranks up under the system in place. This is probably 90% of why I went for a new account.Imho, you shoulnd't feel like you ranking up in the old system is somehow underserving and that you have to start from scratch. I mean, there are bunch of high ranking shiptosters now thanks to the old system but its pretty much obvious who are they, meaning they got stuck at their current rank, or still have similar amount of merit even 5 years since the introduction of merit.Quote from: Shenanigan on November 26, 2023, 09:49:05 AMEverything is somehow confusing. Was your account hacked or sold?From what I understand, neither. He just don't want to log in with the old one, for whatever reason.",

I am assuming OP never wanted to be tagged for waking up from long period of inactivity. Maybe a random user could tag him alleging that he is posting in different boards or has a deteriorated English over the years. If this happens, no one will come to the aid of OP.I can say that he is smartly reporting that he is the owner of 98789 and also he has a new account. If he is actually the owner of the old account, there's nothing wrong in using both accounts if he wishes.",

That'd probably convince me! Or maybe sign a message using a Bitcoin address tied to the account? Or really, any sort of hard evidence that irrefutably links you to owning that old account would work. Bottom line is we just can't take your word for it.  Not without some kind of verification to back up your claims.",

I never mentioned being hacked and I would not sell my account (if I wanted to do so, I would not be asking you to tag it). To the people suggesting waking it up: people here frown upon \"password has been changed recently\" (and I think there is also a message that shows when an old account suddenly becomes active, I saw it under the user commenting in the second post of this thread and under Vod, for instance), but more important, if I log in to set a message it could be hacked in the future and since I cannot sign messages because all the addresses I used are from Coinbase, I would be screwed and not able to recover it.I call this bullshit! Why does it matter if the account shows 'recently woken up' if you do not plan on using it anymore? And even if you do continue using it, that alone doesnt impact your reputation. Anyone can see from the post history that the account has been inactive for a long time. The same applies to changing the password. Also, why does waking up an account involve changing its password?

This is still unproven.Quote from: tg9 on November 26, 2023, 05:22:02 PMAs I said, I could have simply avoided re-using anything (which would not be hard) and stay in the shadows, and from some responses I think that would have been the \"best\".This is exactly the reason why this request of yours does not really make sense. What do you want DT members to tag your old account for, while also saying that reviving that account would be frowned upon by the community?",

If you don't do anything dodgy after waking up from a long break and and immediately changing email/password (for example asking non-collateral loan, writing in languages you never used before etc) then people might think that there is something dodgy going on, but other than that your account will be just fine with that \"password/email has been changed recently\" message.

The same applies to changing the password. Also, why does waking up an account involve changing its password? Thats bullshit reasoning that has nothing to do with logic.Exactly this; I also don't understand the OP's concerns. You're supposedly concerned about an old account that you're not going to use and want it to be tagged, without having provided the necessary proof that the account is under your ownership yet. Why is it such a big issue to have your account tagged as recently woken up? You can prove it's still in your possession by signing a message from one of the BTC addresses you've used in the past. I've been inactive twice and wasn't bothered by the wake-up tag. I had nothing to worry about and still have access to the address I used back in my first years of registration.Since you're mentioning that you have access to those addresses, just go ahead and try recovering your account; resetting your password shouldn't worry you too much, although I understand that you wouldn't want a wake-up tag along with a reset password. I also acknowledge your concern with merit acquisition, but I'd consider yourself lucky that you're getting a 250 merit head start bonus and starting out as a Sr. Member rank. There are also two campaigns, which I'm not going to name, that are likely to accept you if you're interested in them, which will help you slowly build your account back. You won't be able to do that as a newbie. I've been in your place, and I was also an Sr. Member when I quit the forum. I started practically from scratch, having only acquired 2 merits when the system was introduced, and now I've managed to rank up to Hero Member with no particular issues and faster than I was expecting when I first started.Prove ownership of the account through signed messages or whichever method works best, and keep using the account. If you're able to provide everything necessary, no one will ever accuse you of alt accounting, and even if someone does, the claims will be quickly dropped as you would have already proven yourself.",
