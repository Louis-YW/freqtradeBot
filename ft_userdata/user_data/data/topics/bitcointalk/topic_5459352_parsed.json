      "body": "You miss a couple more questions, from the opposite direction. These questions are:1. Does the universe exit?2. Does life exist?The reason why these are important is, nobody can prove them with solid, empirical science. Big Bang is a fantasy that sounds good to those who need it to believe in. But the science behind BB is so extremely lacking that it is really utter foolishness. Besides, asking any layman to understand the little science there is, makes the whole topic of this question in a public forum to be foolishness.As far as life goes, the dividing line between something that is dead, and the moment before while it was still alive, hasn't been found. If it is close to being found, it is understood (almost) by a few technical people, but absolutely none of us lay people.The point of asking these two additional questions is, before we ask about some fanciful place called Heaven, we really need to be afraid, because we don't really know anything about this age.But take heart. Since this universe and life seem to exist without proof, and without the knowledge of how such could be possible, something like Heaven could exist for the same, unknown reasons.",

This life is enough for me. Thought of that gives me peace and clarity and understanding that i need to cherish everything i have while i have it. I need to live my life to the end because i have it. While being kind to my family and friends and give my kids a better changes in life than i did.I used to be religious, but after i understood what void it was filling, getting rid of it really balanced my life to better. I just don't need anyone in the sky watching me. Neither gods or government.B: What will happen after i die? My body either get burned or buried. I guess my afterlife would feel similar to before i existed. Like nothing.",

Over the years, I've come to respect Rand's politics and in depth understanding of people and history more than her hostility towards religion. The idea of going somewhere wonderful after death has a strong appeal, especially as we get older, but I can't put too much faith in the concept, yet.",

The forum is filled with people of diverse religion, opinions and different in every other thing you can think of are viewed in different ways. So take it cool, you will see people responding the way you want it. Religion is the shaping value for the way people reason just like you were brought up in church and Christian way, of course heaven is real and Christians want to spend eternity in heaven but some Christians too don't believe that so open your mind but hold on to what you believe.",

Many religions believe that your works on earth determine how and where to spend your afterlife. And it is believed that the afterlife is everlasting. Although many false teachers have adulterated many religious teachings, I have stopped listening to them and focused on the Holy Book. And this sacred book unveils that if you live a righteous life on earth, you will go to heaven but if you are evil there is a place called hell waiting for you. QuoteDo you expect to go to Heaven, when finished here on Earth?I am aspiring to go to heaven when my time is up on earth. Living a righteous life is becoming hard every day because evil is taking over the earth. If you are not corrupt you might be subjected to hardship and poverty. But every day I keep fighting temptation that wants to make me derail from the path of truth. But I am hoping that when I stand before the judgment throne when my time is up on the earth, my maker will find me worthy to enter the gates of heaven.",

Look at the parable of the sheep and the goats - Matthew 25:31-46 - https://www.biblehub.com/niv/matthew/25.htm.In this parable, it seems that the King is judging people on the merits of what they have done. It seems contradictory to passages like the one where Jesus says, \"The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent,\" John 6:29 - https://biblehub.com/john/6-29.htm. So, how do we reconcile these two ideas? Something like this...ALL people do good, and they all do evil. There are some believers and some unbelievers who do tremendous amounts of good, and very little evil. There are also loads of believers and loads of unbelievers who do very little good, but large amounts of evil.In the sheep and goats parable, why is it that the King doesn't acknowledge the evil that the sheep did? It's because the sheep believe in the salvation that Jesus provided, and the sins (evil) have been washed away in Jesus blood. Their sins don't exist any longer because they are covered by the blood of Jesus. All that is left is the good, however small it may be.With the goats, why doesn't the King acknowledge the good that they did, even though they did some evil right along with the good (just like the sheep)? Saint Paul explains it simply and clearly in the easy words, Romans 14:23b, \"...and everything that does not come from faith is sin,\" - https://biblehub.com/romans/14-23.htm. So, for the goats, everything, even the good, is sin. Why? Because it was not done in faith.Good works are to be done by believers because their faith is tested and diminished when they sin, especially if they do evil intentionally. Believers can lose their saving faith. But it is difficult, because God won't let them go easily.One of the other good reasons why believers should do good and not do evil is, so that unbelievers can see that their godliness exists, so that these unbelievers also can turn to faith.Nothing stops any believer or unbeliever from doing evil. But, reread Romans 14:23b above.",

I'm one of the hardest person to convince of something without proof.My goal is to do what it requires to get there... to please the CREATOR always. *I believe water exist because I saw it.* No human can describe heaven even if seen. It has a Great Sparkle that can't be described because it has never been seen nor imagined by humans. The sparkle is healing when stared at....you immediately feel healing & painless crackling in your bones/body as if being pressed together by a powerful force. We could have our evil pets, friends, brothers and sisters destroyed in hell while we meet their replica in heaven. The evil ones are not who we think they are.

I am a Christian today because my parents practice the religion and most people in my location are Christians.No, this is not why you are a Christian. The reason why you are a Christian is that through your parents, you heard the Word of God spoken, or you read it. Then the Holy Spirit worked faith in your heart through the Word that you heard.Quote from: Zlantann on July 13, 2023, 07:19:38 PMIf maybe I was born in Saudi Arabia, I would have been a Muslim.

If you assume that only Christians would go to heaven, then God can make it easy by stopping giving babies to Muslims and other religions.It is the hearing of the Word of God - especially the parts that talk about Jesus-salvation - that works faith in the heart. People of nations or religions that don't have the Bible possibly will never hear the Word of God.Quote from: Zlantann on July 13, 2023, 07:19:38 PMAnd make more Christian families have more children that will go to heaven instead of sending children in families that will lead them to hell. I don't believe that only Christians will go to heaven. King David talks about how he was put together by God in his mommy's tummy: \"For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb,\" - Psalm 139:13. What this means is that God is putting people together before they are born. So, we all heard the Word of God from the beginning of our conception. But if we don't have reinforcement by the Bible once we get out here, we forget. The point is, everybody who believes in Jesus-salvation is saved, no matter how he gets that faith. But we can see how difficult it is for people born to practicing Christians to be saved. So, we can easily understand how hard it will be for people who don't have even the Word, to be saved. However, if they get the Word in some way that we don't know about, they will be saved, if they believe. Yet, who has a clear example of how a person can get the Word without getting the Bible, or without somebody speaking it to him? Because that is what the Holy Spirit uses to work faith in the hearts of people.",
