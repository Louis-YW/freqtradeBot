I think they are great questions.There is an additional issue relating to RBF. RBF stands for Replace By Fee.  Bitcoin Cash does not have RBF because it allows the sender to cancel or change a transaction after it has been sent and before it is confirmed.",

      "body": "to achieve it 210k blocks would occur in 2 years instead of 4 yearsmeaning you would have halvings happen sooner and the supply cap mature sooner than 2142so you would need to adjust the halvings to be at 420k instead of 210kalso the formulae for hashrate difficulty adjustments would also need to change from 2016 blocks per fortnight to 4032 blocks a fortnightalso you would need 2 sets of rules for initial block download/syncing checks.. rules for pre milestoned date/blockheight of old rules(blockrewards per 210k blocks). then second set for rules after milestone theres other things too.. (i wont bore you with all the details, but what i said should be enough to show its not as simple as changing 2 variables)..doomad has no clue about bitcoin, and no clue about block propagation, latency.. its buzzwords he throws around without understanding of themhere is one examplenodes do not validate transactions after a confirmed block hash..nodes relay most transactions pre-confirm at the relay stage. meaning when transactions are in mempool 99% are already validated... thus when then getting a blockheader+the hash(solved block) and its merkle root and leafs of TXID.. its actually less data a node actually needs to process when a solved block is propagated. and requesting missing tx not in mempool but has a TXID in the merkleroot leaf of a block header is a milisecond action not a 1-10 minute delay actso his FUD fear of issues are stupid due to his lack of knowledge of bitcoin... he simply recites stupidity he read from others without doing further research beyond some social rhetoric he reads...but with that saidchanging blocktimes is not a simple act and will impact many other mechanisms of bitcoin which can then cause other issues so its not a simple change nor one that will be as simple as just letting more transactions into a block at the current blocktime methodology",

      "body": "The result of a shorter time between blocks is an increase in stale blocks and reorgs. However, ten minutes is a long time and reducing the block time to five minutes would probably have no significant effect. The first confirmation would occur sooner, but but the waiting time in order to guard against a double-spend would remain the same because you would need to double the number of confirmations for the same security.As for \"reducing ... size/reward by 2x\", I assume you mean by 1/2 in order to offset the more frequent blocks, and the only effect that I can think of is a reduction in the maximum size of a transaction.",

(hashes per 300sec instead of hashes per 600sec) which is weaker security per block, compared to a 10 minute block average. fourthly, for pools to work making block templates after a solved block appears, there will be more instances of \"empty block\" due to how mining pools send out templates to miners in the initial few seconds of previous block solve and then slowly fill blocks per update request over the next few minutes. due to the fact if all pools are then required to average 5minutes, it would cause more 'lucky' blocks found in less time. meaning more \"empty block\" chances, for them lucky blocks that find a solution in less than 5 minalso due to the lower hashrate and difficulty due to hashes per 300sec instead of hashes per 600sec.. people end up instead of waiting 6 confirms for large amounts will wait 12 confirms for same large value amounts. and 2 confirms instead of 1 confirm for same smaller amounts.. due to security metrics of economicsthus your idea has no advantages",

      "body": "For any change you should first start by saying what you think you can achieve by that change before we can start discussing its implications. That's because in every change there is always pros and cons (it's not all good or all bad) and knowing what the change is trying to achieve helps put the disadvantages (or implications) into a better perspective.For example I am just guessing that you are trying to speed up confirmation time. With that assumption we can start discussing the change better.In this case turning 10 min on average to 5 min on average doesn't change anything whatsoever. So in other words you are talking about a fundamental change in the consensus rules that doesn't really solve anything. Which means even the smallest disadvantage is considered a major negative reason not to do it. Like the small possibility of a small increase in number of stale blocks.",

      "body": "It would have the same effect as doubling the block size in terms of blockchain capacity and storage requirement for full nodes. And that would be pretty bad because the blockchain is already large enough that people who don't have a lot of storage space on their computers don't run a full node anymore. Also, Bitcoin confirmations at 10 minute block times are considered to be quit secure, some businesses accept 1 confirmation transactions, typically it's 3 at most. With faster block times the demand for confirmations will rise, and it would take the same time to actually have your transactions finalized, despite them technically being confirmed faster. Ethereum or Litecoin have much faster block times, yet when you send them to exchange the exchange asks for more than 10 confirmations, so it often times take as much time as depositing Bitcoin.",
