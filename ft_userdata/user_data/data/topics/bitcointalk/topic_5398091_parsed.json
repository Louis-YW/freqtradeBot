  "content": "The word skepticism has appeared in my posts for more than enough time, that's probably because of my experiences with it (both the good and bad).Skepticism is characterized by Doubt, Disbelief, Uncertainty and Agnosticism and also Scrutiny, Inquisition, Investigation and Probe. Aforementioned are words categorised into two group which I refer to as first phase and second phase. The first phase can be generalise as Doubt, it's a phase where our lack of knowledge of an entity/subject makes us feel unsure about it; at this phase, our sense of judgement is clouded with disbelief and uncertainty. We can call the second phase the Curiosity phase, this is the period we want to put all things to test to make sure we are making the right decision, this phase birth Scrutiny, Inquisition, Investigation and Probe. At this phase, we overly seek for knowledge about something because we want to satisfy our curiosity. While being skeptical is not bad, many of us fall at the first phase of it, we only exercise doubt and disbelief about an entity/subject without seeking knowledge about it. The fact that we are unsure of something should make us eager to want to know about it, this attitude towards life could help us redeem situations where good opportunity always pass us by due to the fact that we base our judgement on the first phase (Doubt). The second phase helps us to make decision rationally and our decision would be based on facts rather than assumptions or dogma. After making our decision based on the knowledge we've acquired about the subject, we are left with the knowledge and it could  help us sometimes in the future. This has happened  to many cryptocurrency investors or trader at a point in time, it also happens mostly to beginners (most especially the ones who have experienced scam). It made them miss out on great opportunity that has come their ways that could have transformed their lives. When our skepticism end in the first phase, it deprived us of the positive impact skepticism could have on us. Skepticism should yield curiosity, while curiosity birth Knowledge!",

      "body": "In cryptocurrency, skepticims more often than not saves people from losses, because most of the \"opportunities\" lead to a loss. Even if you take altcoins that showed great growth, it only counts as opportunity if you manage to sell with a profit, which a lot of people don't do, as they get greedy. And then the market crashes and they miss out on any profit at all.",

Sooner or later, you will have wisdom; you will know the pattern. You will immediately know a scam when you see one. And so you can make generalizations. That's what knowledge gives us. Having said this, you don't have to scrutinize and investigate each and every altcoin, each and every airdrop, each and every NFT project, each and every DeFi platform, and so on. Somehow, you can make a generalization.",

I don't see it this way. There is no need to rush until you understand all the consequences that may await you. Although cryptocurrency is, of course, a risk in some ways, we must be 90 percent sure that we know everything about the project in which we would like to invest. And from this, it follows that we question everything to make the right decision in the future.",

Skepticism is the mother of all knowledge if the individual gives time to research the rate of scams will be reduced to its nearest minimum.",

      "body": "Skepticism has to do with our attitude towards something. It deals with an intellectual inquiry and caution applied to an information, ideas and things being presented to us. It is an essential part of critical thinking,  it helps us to embrace objective truth which deals with what is universally true and accepted as opposed to being satisfied with what we know and settling for personal or subjective truth.Skepticism helps us to ask questions, challenge claims, make enquiry about things.  It also encourages us not to accept authority because we know it's source or think the information is true.  The same yardstick should be used to scrutinize ever information so as to be on the safer side and this helps us to gain more knowledge and make progress.  We need not stop at the doubtful phase of skepticism, progress can only be made when we seek more knowledge about things.",

Skepticism should yield curiosity, while curiosity birth Knowledge! Sometimes it is rather good to stop skepticism at the first phase, according to the phases you mentioned above. When your instinct tells you that it doesn't worthy it, compared with your past experiences, you don't need to proceed to the second phase.For instance, I am a victim of ponzi schemes in different forms and I have known that one of the features of a ponzi scheme is a referrals. Then, you come with a project that I need to refer upto 100 persons, that the project is as good as bitcoin. I won't even bother myself going into the second phase of investigation.So, when you have your standards, your problems are half solved.You can consider to avoid much coloration of texts. It makes people ignore your posts. If you want to emphasise a word or a group of words, you can italize, bold or underline. Colors are majorly used for extreme emphasis, maybe involving tables, photos or memes.",

While others have been lucky at it in terms of decision making without knowing.So being skeptic to me is something one need to be careful about wether of the first phase or second phase as the OP has emphasized.",

Its not a bad thing to do aside from doing your dyor, or research cause it could help you avoid such losses without any reason why you lose it. If you care for your funds then dont let it gone for a very shallow mistake of not doing this. Its add on your skills to differentiate and identify which crypto is good and or fake one that could only potentially incurred loss to us.",
