Owning the same stocks and crypto are not stupid, it’s what we called diversification and that’s the best strategy to make more profit.i would suggest also the same. better use platforms that are really into stocks investments. because with crypto-exchanges, they are more on crypto-related investments. aside from that, would be better if you use different platforms for these 2 different investments. at least, if one fails, you are at peace that you still have the back-up investment. because if you will avail both  services at one platform, you would regret it if the platform got abandoned or was financially bankrupt.",

Shares are traded in capital markets that operate in each country with different policies.Whereas cryptocurrencies are transacted on the global crypto market.That's the problem why crypto investment/trading and stocks can't be combined.",

Why haven't top giant exchanges like Binance or FTX implement Stock investments too?Do you think it's stupid as a crypto investor to want to invest money on stocks too?Obviously because both of them are not the same. Cryptos are currencies while stocks are from big companies however many people crypto people compare crypto with stocks or vice versa. Cryptos and forex in one roof could be more possible because both of them are currencies.I heard etoro supports cryptos now but etoro also have forex and stocks. Why won't you try them out? They are also reputable among the others out there. Of course, it's not stupid if you are a crypto investor and then you want to invest in stocks as well. You can even expand your investing business to other assets. The more the merrier. It's called diversifying and it allows us to cut risk or even earn more.",

You need to make sure that you invest into a company that will be strong even after 30 years. Stuff like IBM, Microsoft, Apple, Google (alphabet), facebook (meta), tesla, amazon and so forth.These are all huge companies and they look like they will make a good profit. If you really want to fuse crypto and stocks together, you could buy coinbase (coin) stock as well, doing badly right now but there is a chance it could recover in the future so you could maybe get in when it's low like right now.",

Didn’t know any online broker that offers crypto as well, this might not exist yet but hopefully in the future.There’s nothing bad if you own stocks as well, many still prefer the traditional stocks and they are ok with the slow movement on that market. With the top crypto exchanges, they are also not interested to offer stocks, probably it can disappoint many crypto supporter if those exchanges started to adopt stocks as well. Better to use a separate platform for this and monitor at the same time.",
