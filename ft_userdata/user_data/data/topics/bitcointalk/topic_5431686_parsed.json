  "content": "By chance, I came across real gold, this YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41oRqH65Eb8 showing goals from all FIFA World cup finals from 1930 to the present day.It was really a pleasure to watch all those goals and all the finals.I have a question for you all. Which final and which goal do you think is the best in history?I'm interested in your opinion. Edit: My suggestions for the best goals in the finals are in the poll.If you think another goal should be added, feel free to suggest it.",

      "body": "I watch the video and it remind me of the past really. I saw in time ago some things that have changed this modern time. Like the videos of 1930's world cup are not clear and most in black colour video. I remember some of the game in USA 1994 that Brazil defeat Italy in penalty, Roberto Baggio lose his shot kicking it over the post. The captain for Brazil is Dunga. In 1998 host by France and they humiliated Brazil by 3:0. In 2002, Brazil beat Germany. It is a good review of goals of the world cup.",
