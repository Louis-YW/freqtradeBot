So how can it be invalid? Also, could you specify which source(s) are saying that your address is invalid?Quote from: digaran on January 19, 2023, 02:12:58 AM111113DUwES2ZNWSJztA3oBuhzfcdmiaGAbove address is what I'm talking about.Im able to search for this address on blockchain and blockchair explorers already. You have no balance with no transaction history, is that correct?I suppose you are trying to import your keys in a different wallet but you could be using the wrong format hence the sources bring you invalid error?!",

There's a reason why ChatGPT answers are banned in multiple platforms and forums, that's on example.I've also seen users here who referenced ChatGPT answers and some are too generic, if not, incorrect.Give it a few more years before taking its answers into account.Quote from: Edwardard on January 19, 2023, 03:22:36 AMQuote from: digaran on January 19, 2023, 03:00:03 AMI wanted to know if signing a message with invalid address was possible or not.If it was possible, wouldn't everyone sign a message with any address they wish to?

Messages are signed with private keys (as you know), and the address is actually irrelevant as it can be derived from the private key anyway.",
