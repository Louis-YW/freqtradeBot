  "content": "Bitcoin's market performance during the Christmas period over the past several years has been as follows:- 2022: Decrease of 2.7%- 2021: Decrease of 11.9%- 2020: Increase of 22.3%- 2019: Decrease of 1.1%- 2018: Decrease of 5.3%- 2017: Increase of 4.1%Since 2017, over the seven days following Christmas, the probability of a price decrease has been over 66%. This trend indicates a prevalent likelihood of a decline in Bitcoin's value during this particular period. It's noticeable that the market sentiment during Christmas for Bitcoin hasn't exhibited consistent bullish behavior, as evidenced by the majority of the years showing a decline in value or a relatively modest increase.However, past performance is not indicative of future results, and various factors can influence Bitcoin's price movement beyond historical patterns.",

If they approve, Bitcoin will be pumped a lot but if they reject all Bitcoin Spot ETF applications, you know how the market will react.But a more important point is Bitcoin halving will happen in April 2024, even if SEC. refuse all Bitcoin Spot ETF applications, 4 more months will be enough for Bitcoin to recover.",

But thanks for the data, it's pretty good and maybe it needs to provide a broader view and needs to have a certain classification every year, because for me every year in the bitcoin cycle is different, so it needs to be studied in determining conclusions.",

People can argue to have 1 minute chart to see more details but please don't think I am writing this to argue with you.It is only to explain that the chart from BTC_Archive is good enough to give us a view with a big picture.Something is more helpful but not full details about the market.https://casebitcoin.com/charts#data_tables",

Anything can happen within a week, but the view that is actually much wider is when you compare the prices of Bitcoin during Christmas days. That would be comparing annual prices of Bitcoin on a certain day of the year. It's more pleasing to the eyes and more suggestive of what to do with your Bitcoin. It teaches us to hodl long term because although there were Christmas days in the past in which the price has gone down, most of it is really about price appreciation. Comparing Christmas day prices gives us a lesson.",

They may sell their assets to enjoy the turn of the year, which will result in crypto prices experiencing a correction.We can only hope that the correction that occurs will not cause the price to decline too deeply.The decline in the price of bitcoin will provide an opportunity for investors to increase the amount of bitcoin. They will start buying bitcoin at a low price and continue buying it even if the price of bitcoin continues to decline and could remain at a low price for some time.But if we can't buy it yet, we must stay calm and wait for when we can buy bitcoin again.",

It can give me the clue of what I will be expecting this time.Not only during the Christmas period, there is a decrease in prices in Consumer Behavior, this is also seen during holidays, especially Saturdays and Sundays. Some of them will sell a number of bitcoins to meet their shopping needs and enjoy a relaxing week with family and friends, although on the other hand it also has an impact on the market, causing a little pressure and I think currently this is not too much of a problem if we pay attention.For long-term purchases, a decline is a good decision, but we have to make sure by looking at the existing data so that when we buy there won't be another decline after the decline with tips, combining several tools will give us the best signal with less risk. This means that we will easily know the direction of the next market trend and prepare to accumulate it again.",

They will be less actively on cryptocurrency market even they can do it with mobile devices and Internet connection.Whales and market makers will take advantage of Christmas and other holidays to dump the market. Usually they will go dumping the market than pumping it but this year is special and it raises a very uncertain big question.Will the market be dumped or will it be pumped because of SEC decision on Bitcoin Spot ETF applications in next 2 weeks?If it is in another year, I bet on dump but this year, even I think there are many reasons for Bitcoin to be dumped, SEC decision is a big uncertainty.",

It is also easy to predict that the price may either remain stable, or there will be a higher chance of a downward trend. Apart from history, the reason for this is that people often go on vacation at Christmas, and because of the vacation, they often spend more time with their families. Majority of people exit the cryptocurrency market, due to which trading is negligible, and this will definitely have an impact on the market.Â when the capital does not come in then the market price may go down instead of up. However, I don't think we can see any significant increase in the price of Bitcoin this Christmas. Different factors can influence each time.There is no specific period at which various factors may affect the market a lot.However, many experts are thinking that the last week of the year may be bearish in the market.",

I was also thinking/observing that in the Christmas market can fluctuate under the shadow of current sentiments about ETF's results being announced on 10th January. I concluded that the market will be very volatile in the first days of January. And besides all that, I all thought the market might be highly volatile in the last 10 days of December but so far it is doing good and keeping the support of $43k. You provided stats, showing a pattern that is very easy to detect and that is, in 2017 the price increased and after then for two years it decreased and then it increased in 2020 and it then decreased for the next two years and now the third year 2023 it might increase as per pattern. And the funny thing is price is increasing and not following the previous two years's trend or average trend either.",
