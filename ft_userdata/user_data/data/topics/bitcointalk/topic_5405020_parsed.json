Here's a recent thread I found, and a user with the exact same issue as yours, helped by one of the forum members here;Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on June 01, 2022, 10:31:50 AMYour database is likely corrupted. Try wiping out the block index with bitcoin-qt -reindex. This will re-make the database by going all over the blk.dat files, re-validate them and rebuilding the chainstate. It'll take a lot of time.Have you checked your debug.log for further info?Read from reply #75 down for a step by step process on how to possibly fix the issue.",

Click OK to “do you want to rebuild the block database now?” Then another error message appears and says- Error: Error opening block database.The error that you're getting can also be caused by corrupted chainstate and --reindex-chainstate is a lot faster than --reindex.You can try it instead but it's better if you check the errors from \"debug.log\" first so you'll know which command to use:If your blockchain is pruned, either of those commands will trigger IBD which require you to redownload all the blocks from start.",
