  "content": "This should be news which will put a smile on your face and it could take your hands right into your pockets to take out those fiat and invest into the bitcoin for long term holdings. Motely Fool which is Financial and Investment Advisory giant, has taken next level leap with the bitcoin investments. The company publicly shared the information that they are investing arounf 5 million USD into bitcoin out of their own balance sheet because their analysis suggest the Bitcoin to reach $500,000 in next 10-15 years. Obviously this is huge price for bitcoin but at the same time we do know that bitcoin has exceptional price hikes. If we consider the last decade then bitcoin turned from few cents to 60K + USD in a decades of time. Now I am not going to go in trading analysis here but this giant firm has so much confidence that they think it will be 10X investment asset soon. What do you think about such news which is way motivating for us to have some more time hodling our bitcoins? QuoteFinancial and investment advisory giant The Motley Fool has announced it will invest $5 million into Bitcoin  with the expectation that it will rise to $500,000. Announced earlier today via a blog and Twitter post, the firm stated it won’t be “buying overpriced ETFs” but will be “buying Bitcoin directly.” Currently ranked fifth globally in the investing category, according to Similar Web, and with 87 million website visits per month, The Motley Fool outlined three core reasons behind the purchase: Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold, it's an effective hedge against inflation and it has the potential to become a transactional asset.The firm will be investing in Bitcoin through its 10X real-money portfolio as one of 40 assets that it predicts will provide a 1,000% return over the next 15 years. The firm has recommended the digital asset as a core holding to all its 10X members and has provided time for them to purchase BTC before The Motley Fool initiates its own purchase. It added that in the coming weeks the company \"will also be separately buying $5 million in Bitcoin on our own balance sheet.\"Due to the long-term commitment, the announcement explains that volatility is of little concern.“While Bitcoin may very well continue to be volatile in the short term, we think it has 10x potential from today's levels over the long term as part of a diversified portfolio. We plan to hold this Bitcoin investment for many years.”Should the company’s prediction prove true, it will see Bitcoin passing $500,000 within the next 15 years. The Motley Fool says it has a solid track record with its investments.The Motley Fool has so far named 10 of the 40 investment picks for the 10X portfolio, with the others being cloud computing company Appian Corporation, Swiss biotech firm CRISPR Therapeutics, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, e-commerce platform Etsy, genetic testing platform Fulgent, insurer Lemondate, social media platform Pinterest, mobile gaming platform Skillz and video communication firm Zoom. It is worth noting that many of these stocks have already been recommended in the firm’s other, more basic investment services.The advisory firm has been aware of cryptocurrencies for years now, with a 2017 analysis suggesting that Bitcoin’s biggest competitor was not Ethereum but Litecoin.Fun fact: The second-most visited site users go to from The Motley Fool website is that of the Internal Revenue Service.The headline has been updated. The $5M investment will be added to company's balance sheet rather than to the 10X portfolio.  The dollar amount allocated to the portfolio has not been disclosed but Motley Fool said it will be a \"core holding\".Motley Fool adding Bitcoin to its ‘10X portfolio’ — Has a $500K price target",

      "body": "Of course, it is good to see more financial institutions entering the field of crypto, specifically bitcoin, since this contributes directly and indirectly to spreading awareness of digital currencies in exchange for partially abandoning fiat money assets.  At the same time, I find it funny that a financial advisory firm of this size has only now discovered that Bitcoin is real wealth and a safe investment in the short term.  This company, which claims that Bitcoin will reach the threshold of $ 500 million within ten years, is the same company that missed the opportunity to buy it when it was less than a thousand dollars or even a little more.  An investment company that will venture that amount into investing in Bitcoin, will certainly promote it as its most successful deal, and therefore we should not be too deceived by its analysis, and let us suffice with thanking it for its step without asking it for an analysis.",

I think they get many people who are new to trading and they think by following Motley Fool they will get great investment advice but you know how it works out.They make everyone money in a bull market, then a bear market hits and everybody gives up their gains and some. And keep in mind that they posted this back in 2021, I actually remember when they said they would do this because its around the time when Tesla put bitcoin on their balance sheet and many companies were doing the same. Some event were 100% sure that Facebook would put bitcoin on their balance sheet but that was never true.",

Considering the amount of money that's changing hands everyday in the crypto world, I can easily say that they are not doing that great by adding just five million.This could be a good influencing move if they are famous, maybe it is just me who never heard of them and millions of others did, and in that case this five million doesn't even matter because the amount of money their followers could put in could be a lot higher and that's why I believe that it is going to be pretty important to just put their money into crypto if you can as a big company.",

The company is neither recent and nor it started as crypto investment firm because their foundation dates back to the 1993 year which is quite impressive timeline. We should anyway take positive crux from it that firm picked up on the bitcoin investment along the way. They really set the good example of investing into assets which are newly invented and has potential to grow. The Motley not only invest in the bitcoin but also in the alternate portfolio which has huge potential to become 10X in the coming decade or so.

They also measure the volatility and how much of a positive it can make relative to the whole portfolio. Because of high volatility, perhaps they think there's is no need for the portion invested in Bitcoin to be larger.Quote from: Flexystar on February 22, 2023, 07:02:29 PMQuote from: maydna on February 22, 2023, 03:57:50 PMWe don't need news like that to motivate ourselves because we have already experienced many events in the market.

It's true what you say. But if we don't start learning to find out and just use other people's stories as motivation, we may be slow to progress. We must be able to motivate ourselves, and other people's stories might be helpful, but it would be better if we realized that we needed to do something and did not need to wait for motivation from others. For example, if we dream of becoming a billionaire, do we just wait until we get news or the true story of someone who becomes a billionaire in a short time and uses an easy method? Of course not. We must try to change it and use it as motivation to change, especially in investing in crypto.",
