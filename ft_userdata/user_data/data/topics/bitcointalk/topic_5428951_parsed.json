It's hard to get a user who is already a loyal member of other casinos. For instance, I guess it would be very hard to attract a VIP level gambler from stake as they offer lucrative rewards while with a new casino, they would get nothing. I got an invitation from a new casino to have VIP level from the very start there same as I have in other casino. If I'm not wrong, I guess bc.game has offered VIP membership every stake VIP users. With such a move, it becomes pretty much easier to attract loyal gamblers from other casinos.",

      "body": "Indeed there are many gambling platforms in this industry as of today. Different gambling sites offering the same set of games, promotions and bonuses. But what would make a casino to stand out over the competition, for me, is their response with problems. Problems in any platform is always expected but only few gambling sites are putting attention into it. Not all players are just into high rewards; coz all of the gambling site could do the same thing. If gambling house team addresses bugs, delays, or basically issues on their platform, that is something only great casinos would do. Such as with the platform I am currently playing at.",

First you need enough bankroll to even enter the competition, then you would need to find a margin or niche that other casinos were neglecting or haven't been monetizing properly. Exclusive deals with celebrities or companies providing slots could be one way. If i would build it i would go similar way to \"mining\" casinos where users can be part of the casino in a way, so when they staked mined tokens they would get dividends from profits. That would automatically bring in people together who would be doing mining strengthening the community and \"we\" spirit. Betfury and other places had profitable mining at the start, but as it's no longer profitable miners would be looking for new sites.And then that new casino should offer exactly what other offer, but with a better and faster GUI. But that would be hard to accomplish too.",

One thing that makes gamblers go back to these casinos are its reputation for being a long time in the industry which even a new gambler can trust on. Even if new casino will provide a better promotion or bonuses, I doubt that gamblers will shift unto playing on that platform. Probably, the only thing that would boost a new gambling platform on almost the same level of existing top online casino is to partner with these casinos and have known people on the gambling industry to introduce and be part of their team.",

Casinos that are frequented by a lot of people perfected their platform by listening to their peers and improving based on those suggestions/feedbacks. A casino can spend millions on advertising and still be shit and not have patrons, because they do not listen to customer concerns and are mainly in it for pure profits and not build client connections.",

Casinos like Duelbits, Stake, and others offer something to the table not any conventional casino would. And to top it all off, they have the greatest customer service systems that any new-age cryptocurrency gambling site could offer. In an industry where complains are very much in common, it certainly adds to the user experience if you are a casino who would go above and beyond in offering the best service to the customer, especially if they are not a happy camper. Anyhow, these sites have very much mastered this field, so my suggestion to aspiring casino makers is to take a page out of their books and tweak it to add uniqueness.",
