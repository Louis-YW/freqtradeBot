With blue wallet you can just import your trust wallet seeds or keys and enjoy this features, or better still create new address since trust wallet is not open source",

I can also recommend Blue Wallet. I don't use an iOS device, but if it's as good on iOS phones as the wallet is on Android devices, go for it. I consider it as a go-to mobile wallet that is a step ahead of Electrum anyways. But I wouldn't recommend importing the Trust Wallet seed. Instead, sweep your bitcoins from Trust Wallet, and don't go back to it. Another reason is that Trust wallet is a multicurrency wallet, while Blue Wallet is bitcoin-only. If OP owns altcoins, he won't be able to use those on the Blue Wallet.   Quote from: Yamane_Keto on May 22, 2023, 09:58:06 AMBlueWallet is another excellent option but I'm not sure if they still support Lightning Network.

Not supporting coin control and many other features.Another wallet which I would have recommended but will not because it is supporting cloud backup is Nunchuk. It is supporting Android and iOS. Having beta version for Linux, Windows amen macOS. The wallet would have been a good wallet if not the support for cloud backup which is not recommended at all.
