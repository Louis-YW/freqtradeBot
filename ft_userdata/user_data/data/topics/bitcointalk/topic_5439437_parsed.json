As a politician you must be nursing this in mind so as to remain relevant irrespective of your political affiliation and that is what he is doing.Â  I know many would tag it selfish and self centered, that is what and how the business is, if you do not protect your interest, you will be thrown overboard with nothing left for you. Being a smart politician is all it takes to remain relevant and I believe you already know that he wike is a very smart politician who knows how the game is played.Lastly, op I would like to see the link to the claims of wike telling his supporters to vote tinubu. Let's be factual with updates.",

Atiku na the reason PDP go fall commot for the face of Nigeria as I believe if labour win then APC go become the new opposition party and vice versa if na APC win. How PDP go use their own hand betray their very own just because one abroad based politician. One thing is certain, PDP no dey this presidential race in my opinion. Everybody agree say North no dey return to that sit again and even Buhari and his statement came to an arrangement which is why APC was pushing for the tickets to go to other areas and most especially a young man so him fit relate well with the youth but unfortunately Asiwaju get other plans.
