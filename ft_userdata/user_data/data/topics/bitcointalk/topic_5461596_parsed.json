Rather than planning to sell in Kate '24 or early '25 you can target when Bitcoin reaches $100k in value or more?This is a suggestion cause the price does not always rise at the time we expect, as Bitcoin matures the cycle changes slightly to adjust to the newer investors and response from traders to market conditions.Quote from: Cyberbex on July 31, 2023, 03:32:48 PMIf you guys have any tips , do let me know ...The security of your Bitcoin is the most important factor;• Do not store on an exchange• Use an open source hardware wallet or software wallet on an airgapped device • 1 BTC is a significant amount, you should not be telling strangers on the internet or offline how much Bitcoin you're worth.• Have a savings plan - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=345065.0",

If you're unfamiliar with the saying that I've said, I'm basically telling you to sell your bitcoin when the price is pumping and the sentiment of the market is that it's nearing the peak, aim for that peak when you sell.",

I would be very grateful for it.Yes bitcoin is a great store of value and this has made it an asset that hedges against inflation, so it is a very good investment plan if you’re holding for that long. Concerning it breaking you out of a financial crisis, if I guess well you mean it making you rich. I would say there are two ways to this, many people are of the belief that it is not a get rich quick scheme but surely with its volatility it is also a great return on investment. So getting you rich definitely depends on the amount you invested. It has the potential to grow your investment into 2x or more your invested amount. So base on your determined date of taking profit which I would also advise you should state it out on price tag, you could be able ti double your investment then. My tip is just like what Upgrade00 pointed out, the security of your funds is definitely a priority I wound advise you take this amount off anything exchanges and purchase a hardware wallets. I would have simply said a cold wallet but your current investment amount huge that a hardware wallet shouldn’t be that expensive to you. Or you can just setup an airgapped of any prominent cold wallet like electrum.",

And with your case I'm glad that you know things already such as not putting all of your money into this technology simply because you want to earn profit. Indeed this blockchain is a profitable asset and a useful digital currency as we all know but problem arises from an investor's mindset. Some are having too high hopes and that is why they are going all out on their first investment, which worries them 'coz it is all or nothing scenario. On the same instance  they do tend to panic most of the time which affects their decisions on their investment. But Bitcoin won't be enough to break financial crisis and inflation related issues 'coz that is related to a country's economy and you're just you.",

In a world where we have 4 year cycles, that is 15 cycle, so think about how big bitcoin could get. One person could just get one single purchase at 18, and no matter how much they get (unless its like 10 dollars) they could literally be wealthy by the time they die. That is a huge huge amount and they could be very well rich while they are living as well, in case they would need something that is life or death situation.",

This means they could not stop Bitcoin, but they could ban or restrict the usage of exchanges, whether they are centralised or decentralised, to buy BTC. Such as the US banning Binance from providing their product to US Citizens.But the implementation of such big laws is not that easy, and the level of ease depends on the country. Because some countries are banning crypto and capturing those who are involved in it. But some countries are promoting it. So, in which country are you? Will help you gain more BTC, and you should not worry about Governments.Bitcoin had saved a lot of people from inflation and made them financially independent. My only tip for you is to avoid getting into fud because that's what's currently going on in the market. People will say the market is going to boom in 2024 or 2025. But you have to make up your mind about the profits you are expecting. Because if you are satisfied with your decisions, you will not regret them later, even if you have to bear some losses.",
