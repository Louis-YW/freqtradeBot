Even the government with unlimited supply fiat failed to address poverty.Bitcoin investment might help to get you some profit but it’s not sufficient to defeat poverty especially if you are only investing small amount of money on it. This is possible when we are on the initial phase of Bitcoin which the price is near a dollar each since the growth is exponential but right now the price is discovered and having even x10 gain is very hard to accomplish on the current price. Op Investing on Bitcoin is not bad if you are poor but don’t rely on it solely to getaway from poverty since you will need steady source of income to maintain consistent investment and purchasing your necessities.Which means Bitcoin can not eradicate poverty.",

But majority of the people do not know or do not care about this since all they believe is that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme and a big threat to the government. Only those bitcoin enthusiasts are aware about this, the reason why everyone in the bitcoin community is really struggling to save money to purchase bitcoin even at a minimal amount.On the other hand, poverty cannot be totally eradicated but it can somehow be reduced having bitcoin as a tool. And in order to do that, one must personally gain sufficient knowledge in bitcoin so he can use it smartly to create big positive changes in his life. I've known a lot of people who's lives are improved with bitcoin, but it takes a lot of patience and persistency in the market to make it happen.",

There was a time when it was thought that in the future bitcoin could replace all fiat currencies and be both a store of value, an exchange mechanism and a unit of account. Too good to be true. There are still people who think so, but few. In that idyllic scenario it would supposedly reduce poverty, but as things stand, with most people buying it as an investment and not caring about privacy, blacklists and tainted coins, I don't think such an idyllic future will happen, not by a long shot.",

The world is suffering and Bitcoin should be introduced in every nation and should be freelyThe thought that Bitcoin will eradicate poverty in a country is not correct. Poverty can be reduced in a country through diverse economic programs that include an increase in exports, provisions infrastructure, employment creation, quality health care and education, etc. Teaching students about the crypto space is not a bad idea but it will not singlehandedly lead to the development of any nation. Countries like El Salvador have invested heavily in Bitcoin and it is gradually becoming profitable but the Investment has not made the country eradicate poverty. People learning about the crypto space can help them to diversify their income or create few jobs but you shouldn't see it as the solution to your country's economic woes.

This year has not been an economically prosperous one. Many people become unemployed and others have been forced into debt because of the harsh economic realities. I know that everyone wants to enjoy this season by going shopping and travelling to visit loved ones. But we can forgo these activities if we don't have the financial resources to fund these expenses. This year will not mark the end of Christmas, there will always be other opportunities to celebrate next year. My suggestion is that you maintain a low-key celebration if you don't have enough money. Don't stress yourself or go to take a loan because you want to be like others. If you don't have money for transportation and there are no provisions for that, remain in your location and celebrate with what you have.",

First of all, it's banned in our country but we use it anyway. Second, it really is reducing poverty. Our lifestyle changed rapidly because of bitcoin. Before the introduction of bitcoin, we had much much employment problems. But now young educated generations are going towards bitcoin and crypto space. As of this moment, we are self employed. But before that, we had to search for jobs with much lower success rates. Also we gained our financial freedom. Bitcoin opened an entire new world to us. Apart from everything, the only problem that we are facing now is the ban issue. After it gets lifted we can hope to start teaching others became at this moment, we are using crypto in secrecy.",

However, the problem of overcoming poverty depends on the government and each individual's efforts to improve their lives.And with the convenience of the Internet, people can get more information.

I think it is best fit in the Nigerian local board, who knows if the president of Nigeria will decide to join bitcointalk and may one day stumble on this post. This could be by 2035 and they will provide free bus.On the question if bitcoin can reduce poverty. It is no longer a new thing. Bitcoin has done it and will continue to do it. But then, bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme. For you to benefit from bitcoin, you will have to do any of the following; Have a job and then be investing in bitcoin  Own a business and DCA with your profits  Have a skill, offer services and ask people to pay you with bitcoin  Become a minner  Maybe the easiest, is to develop a good writing skill, grow your account here and join a signature campaign In a nutshell, bitcoin cannot turn a poor country to a rich one. It is the government that will create jobs and not bitcoin.",

Where you talk about poverty and Bitcoin or Altcoin coming to save the day I feel is not going to be possible even if the government approve the use of Bitcoin, as in making it legal I don't see it kicking poverty out. And is a choice to teach Bitcoin without taking any penny, you get paid for teaching or not , it doesn't change the fact that poverty is something we have to live with.Teaching Bitcoin can't take away poverty but it can only educate people on how to go about it but when you say it will reduce poverty I doubt. It will only increase our knowledge about Bitcoin.",

The world is suffering and Bitcoin should be introduced in every nation and should be freely Why can you be so sure that cryptocurrency can solve the problem of poverty in that country. However, on the other hand, you say they have difficulty meeting daily food costs. Cryptocurrency investment is still quite speculative and people will get a lot of pressure when involved in it because generally speaking cryptocurrency will have quite a lot of coins in it. It's the same with bitcoin and I think it will be much more difficult to get involved in it when society is experiencing much more serious financial problems. Never mind buying bitcoin, it is difficult for them to meet their daily needs and how could they possibly think about investing. Poverty is becoming a serious problem today and many people are starting to find it difficult to live a normal life, education costs are high, transportation costs are increasing and health costs are increasingly out of control thus creating a much bigger problem for society.Teaching others bitcoin is a good step so they can understand how to do it, but if people don't have healthy finances then it will be much more difficult for them to get involved in it. It's the same as when you talk about investing in bitcoin to people who are experiencing the effects of war and disaster in their country and they will never care even though bitcoin is a step that can bring someone to the stage of financial freedom",
