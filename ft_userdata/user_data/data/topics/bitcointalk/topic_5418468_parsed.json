      "body": "I believe this topic has been discussed before, but I would like to point out one of the cases I find to be more interesting when comes to countries where gambling in banned.North Korea ideologically is a communist country, but in reality I believe the elites of the party of that country actually engage in vices of the capitalist system they allegedly antagonize so much, gambling is probably included (together with drug abuse).  We have already read or watch videos on the atrocities and horrible punishments that are put onto people there, so It safe to assume the general population cannot gamble. The pachinko machines from Japan is another example of companies using loopholes to offer \"gambling\" services to the people, still I have seen a couple of articles of people (I think they were from Japan) who somehow managed to lose all their money gambling.",

The countries listed above have different reasons for illegalizing gambling. Religion is just one.I think in most Islamic countries gambling is likely illegal. This is because they see gambling as haram. The religion believes that gambling increases the desire to acquire wealth which might lead to diverse immoral behavior. It is also believed in Islam that gambling can make one far from his maker. Time for prayer might be used to gamble. But most of these Islamic States allow tourists to engage in gambling when  they visit. Some other countries have banned or are restricting gambling because of the increase in the rate of gambling addiction among underaged children or teenagers. That's why the governments of some nations are ensuring that gambling activities are restricted to check the rate of gambling addiction.",

While in the mainland china casinos are considered illegal, so china should be included in the list in illegal category.",

There are some countries online gambling could be banned while offline is not banned. There are countries sport betting is not banned but casinos are not accepted. Some countries just ban some types but legalized some.I still also think that more countries banned gambling, especially those Muslim countries in Asia, but I am not perfectly certain about this.",

So long as it is acceptable else where, there are always those that would like to test it or use such services even in a restricted zone and the ability of you to offer such services, on or off records could mint you some real money.Thank goodness for some on VPN and Crypto casinos and/or sportsbook.  Although, its not usually accepted to operate a gambling site using VPN. Run into trouble of verification or flux of IP address and you would be troubled.",
