As you have mentioned already that your post is Lottery related then it falls into the Gambling Board but I will suggest if you're posting an article to collect the review and feedback you should post it in the Parent board of Gambling rather than posting in the Gambling discussion.If you want to seriously promote your Site then create a professional looking ANN thread in the gambling discussion. It will boost your traffic and user interaction as well. For posting related to your site regular updates you can also customize the thread settings to self Moderator.",
