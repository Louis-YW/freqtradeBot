You will find more than enough on emojipedia.It's not possible to copy and paste an emoji from another site to the message Icon field, which I think was OP's interest.OP. I think the reason for limited number of emojis available by default is probably for the sake of the forum's functionality, like loading speed. Imagine that drop down menu having over 50 emojis",
