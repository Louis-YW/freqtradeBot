  "content": "Hi all !I was researching the emerging solutions that help increase the security of blockchain-based digital wallets. It would be great for my research assignment if you all express your opinions and high level analysis on the below techniques regarding security, technical feasibility, likelihood of adoption, Ease of use, performance etc. 1 - Continuous user behavioral biometrics authentication for walletsreferences- https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1631/1/012104/pdf2 - Threshold signature-based walletsreferences- https://cryptoapis.io/blog/78-what-is-the-threshold-signature-scheme 3 - Zero-knowledge proof authentication for wallets - Like Edge wallet for ZcashReference - https://youtu.be/VHkZnuM-VLE?si=lMg_VjJcJOsWno_shttps://z.cash/ecosystem/edge-wallet/Comments on any of the solution is highly appreciated.",

Without having any backup of the shared keys, me and other 4 guys should do what exactly? Nothing because there is no solution for that problem.",

So the scammers can use it to steal more money from us like bank accounts, credit cards, and what else?Quote from: shubh3010 on September 23, 2023, 02:12:38 AM2 - Threshold signature-based walletsreferences- https://cryptoapis.io/blog/78-what-is-the-threshold-signature-scheme This is nothing but a multi-signature concept But I want some clarification for this part \"TSS transactions are data light since they contain the same amount of data as a normal single signature transaction. Being data light means they are faster and cheaper to verify with lower transaction fees (mining fees or gas). \"Cause if it's multi sig the TX fee will be higher but the ref said it will be the same as a single sig transaction so if you can make such a wallet then it will be a deal breaker but practically it is not possible (correct me if I am wrong).Quote from: shubh3010 on September 23, 2023, 02:12:38 AM3 - Zero-knowledge proof authentication for wallets - Like Edge wallet for ZcashReference - https://youtu.be/VHkZnuM-VLE?si=lMg_VjJcJOsWno_shttps://z.cash/ecosystem/edge-wallet/Edge wallet is a multi-crypto hot wallet, which is nothing but the previous era coinbase wallet which is highly not recommended for storing cryptos even if it's a small amount. So I recommend you to go with something that is non-custodial, no data collection and open-sourced if possible because that is what people from the crypto community wants to use for storing their cryptos.",

      "body": "Really wonderful to see all your opinions and analysisÂ  ! I do agree that a continuous behavioural biometric authentication solution is technically and ethically far-fetched. This concept ends up storing user biometric information, which violates the core blockchain principle. Technically, they would have to store such massive data, raising security and cost concerns. The ease of using this wallet would be severely impacted because of performance overhead and hardware requirements.Threshold signature-based authentication provides a great alternative to already popular multi-sig wallets. As mentioned in this article https://www.blockdaemon.com/blog/why-threshold-signature-wallets-are-better-than-multisig-wallet-top-5-reasons, it does add more value. I'm only concerned with this approach because you still would have to manage and communicate multiple parts of the key, which may cause delays in performing transactions.Zero-knowledge proof authentication is still in its early phase. It is difficult for me to provide a judgment on it. As you guys have mentioned, it is still a custodian wallet, but when it comes to privacy, keyless authentication is still better than a custodian wallet. You don't have to worry about losing your private key and maintain anonymity.",
