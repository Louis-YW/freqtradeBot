It is still very volatile, and when it goes down it goes down very fast, which scares a lot of people, but there is nothing more profitable today. I don't think it's going to be the best performing asset indefinitely, but I think it still has many years to go.",

Unless they are just posting the numbers and that it is all. Either way, it's a nice change from last year to see Bitcoin having this title so far for this year instead of being surrounded by crap like the Luna/Terra and FTX debacles in the previous year.",

We can pick a moment in Bitcoins journey and focus on it for better or worse but long term its only going in one direction.",

Now imagine how happy and satisfied is someone who invested during the dip at the currently moment. What kind of investment returns so much profit like that? Besides bitcoin, I don't think there are many others. And that is just the first quadrimester. I hope the positive trend continues and bitcoin hit 40,000$ at least by the end of this year.",

I'm not sure how this bet works, but does that mean whoever wants this bet needs to have $1 million? To me, it seems like some kind of game for the rich, and for them that amount is obviously insignificant enough to gamble away it in this way.No matter how euphoric and fanatical you are when it comes to BTC, that price can be reached in 90 days only if some big central banks and rich investors start buying BTC en masse and cause mass madness and FOMO that we have never had the opportunity to experience.",

This is a strong indicator that Bitcoin is a reliable investment option that can provide consistent returns in the long run.Finally, I suggest that investors should seriously consider Bitcoin as a viable investment option, especially given its impressive performance this year.",

But with this recent dramatic increase in the price of bitcoin in a few months, I can argue with anyone that bitcoin is one of the best hedges against currency devaluation and inflation. It has shown over the years that even if it drops, there is hope that it will rise. The problem mostly is that the time of its rising and falling is unpredictable. I don't think I have encountered any asset or currency that has had such consistency and recovery rate.I will be pleased if Balaji Srinivasan prediction comes to pass because I might benefit from it.

One thing that is sure to happen is a correction in the form of a price decline after reaching the next highest price. And we have seen the price is in the $27k-$28k range, so I feel like yesterday was a correction time for bitcoin. And now the price has returned to $ 28k and it looks like it will continue its rally this week. So we'll see how bitcoin goes and we really hope to see it increase to $30k or even more.",
