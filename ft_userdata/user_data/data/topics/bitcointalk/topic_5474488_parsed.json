So what is the address you gave? Don't say that those who want to participate need to send an ETH amount of what you say is 5%.¬† If this is what you mean, that's a red flag to me, because this behavior of scammers is a scammer's style. So if I were you, you would explain properly so that you don't get a red flag account here on the forum. Smart community here, you might not know.",

Is that so?¬† Is this a smart contract token or another memecoin that has a name of eth netwotk? Pretty confusing if theres a lot of these kind of tokens. 5% must be the reward upon joining right?",
