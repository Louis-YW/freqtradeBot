Anyone who still thinks gambling is a way for him/her to break free and gains financial freedom is only digging a pit for themselves, gambling is meant for fun and if you’re looking for a way to earn passively then go and learn a skill and monetize it rather than risking the little you have for gambling,— If you no longer feel excited when gambling and always have regrets after each section then you should stop for a while and resume when you no longer have that mindset of playing to be rich.",

Topic has been discussed at length.Addicted gamblers are never playing for fun, they are playing for the rush that comes when you take risk and the suspense of winning big or losing it all. Also the reason why \"Max Bet\" exists in so many casinos. Anyway, it is difficult for them to actually practice a bankroll management or set up a weekly/monthly quota for betting.They will try to chases losses and make more, the only way to stop the vicious cycle is to shut yourself off from these sites and accept the losses while trying to earn and make it up.",

I mean, I do not mind because someone would need a little bit of a reminder to stay on track about their gambling habits and who they are not supposed to see a money making opportunity on casinos. However, Sometimes it is sincerely tiring to read the same several times in the same week. OP, it would be great if you also offered more information on the techniques to train ourselves to be \"frugal gambles\", it would enrich this thread beyond the same affirmations I have seen before.",

Have a daily or weekly gambling budget and learn which games you like and how to play them so that you can actually have much more fun playing them than just winging any game.I sort of disagree with you because if you playing entirely for fun, then you cannot take it seriously. Have you forgotten that the gambling industry is worth billions of dollars? If you play for fun, you might not know the importance of discipline, seriousness and commitment and this is not how to survive in a multi billion dollar industry. You can catch fun while playing but it should never be the driving force for venturing into gambling. I have always been an advocate of developing a strategy that integrates, risk management, style of play, winning targets and when to stop playing. If you have developed this system and follow it religiously, the fun will come naturally because it will take away the pain of loosing beyond budget. By the way, what other fun is greater than having huge and winnings? With the money, you can get all the fun in the world!",

I never thought someone could even spend their children's money just to fill the void of their addictions. well, that's the reason why you should really consider stopping when things are not right anymore when you play because the more you insist on staying, the more it gets worse and you might go to do the same scenario as the others.",

Gamblers ought to know that gambling is a risky venture and as such can yield positive results or not but some choose to be reckless and squander their funds and then blame the next person for their bad luck.

In simple, people don't spend at the beginning. They prefer playing on demo platforms and games that allow to accumulate fake money. People keeps gambling using this fake money/tokens and at some point decides why don't we try.Further this thought lands them into gambling and starts with small bets and further goes high with time based on the won/loss. When won, they think of making good profit and spend big. When lost, in the event of recovering what had been lost they keep wagering with big money.
