Invest in short term is not investment. You are gambling and speculating that coin will give you good profit in short term. It's not investment.Altcoins rose a lot in the last two months and I don't think it is safe time to buy them. Bitcoin will be tested its resistance about $25000 before it can move higher to $30,000 that is a strong resistance. If Bitcoin fails to break through those resistances, I am sure with you altcoins will have their bleeding days again.If you don't buy Bitcoin, it's safer to hold your stable coin or fiat currency and wait for market crash.",

Bitcoin is once again being stimulated to build a long term structure, this continues to represent a high level of support and bitcoin at 24k8 has represented it.  I think the short-term goal is facing many obstacles, most of the altcoins are working hard to develop their products, improve, change their platforms in the long-term, especially when the ecosystem is revolving around solutions new for stablecoins and I think the altcoin trend is gradually improving and more suitable for stablecoins - decentralized.  (Sovryn may have a short-term and long-term stepping stone that looks to be in line with the trend)",

A good example of it will be Ethereum and BNB. Why I choose this?Well, because they are the biggest among the rest and then I also see them being recommended by other users here in the forum. The one that you call there, Matic is also a good addition to these two. Only the top coins are the ones that we can predict closely and some of us here already made millions from investing on them.",

People are not interested in doing the hard work aka DYOR. There are many ALTs that rose up with time and then went down. IMO even rising ALTs are good for short term investment as they disappear or cease to exist with time.",

I am not great at finding out about the short terms, I am usually pretty terrible at it. But by the looks of it BNB has been kicked in the nuts for a while now, along with BUSD of course but that's stable so we ignore that. This means that while we are going up, BNB has been taking a beating and after that is done, it could go up a little bit more.I am sensing that it is not going to be easy to stop them from getting a beating, all the news everywhere is bad about Binance and how they are doing something wrong when we all know they are innocent, but that's what media wants to focus on and whoever controls the media, wants that out there. As soon as that stops (if it stops) BNB could go a lot higher.",

I know that many people will want to see something great with most of the altcoins they are holding, and have high hopes. However, in the crypto world you see bitcoin rising first, and when bitcoin rises, it takes the others with it, so you need to wait for that bitcoin rise before anything else.I know that it would take some time before we could see it go somewhere decent, but that doesn't mean that it will be years, so we just need to wait this period out and when the bull run comes, from bitcoin to smallest token, it will start to rise as well.",

While Bitcoin still hasn't broken above $25K, it's likely to be quite a struggle. This moment can be a pause for us to see Bitcoin's movement in the next 1 week and see whether during that time the price has penetrated the $25K line or not. For now, I will continue to reserve assets in stablecoins until the appointed time arrives. Altcoins will naturally follow so what needs to be watched right now is that resistance line.",

Don't you see how big the impact of the pump happened with bitcoin once it was going from below 20k to the above 20k? There are so many tokens got massive pump. Even some tokens were pumping like 500% from their bottom. That proves that the impact is so big. Think about that. Once bullrun will be really coming and i thought that it will be greatly pumping all of tokens. Even some meme tokens were also getting pumped so hard. to be honest it's a bit too late for you to join in the party. Why don't you think to buy once the tokens reached its bottom? Were you worrying about that?",

I would advice anyone to stay away from alts for now until the dust settles. The price seems to unstable at the moment, going to $25k, coming back to $23k, and then back to $25k and then again to $24k and a bit stable. There are traps all around, and if you buy an alt that gets stuck in between these movements, you will end up losing a part of your capital.It's better to wait for the price to either drop lower to rise higher from these points, especially the $25k mark. Though it did cross it two times in two days but it couldn't manage to hold it there.",

I do not trust XRP and Doge to be fair and I will avoid that but if you really want to invest then you could invest into those as well.I believe that it goes from bitcoin, to other top coins, to top 50-100 range, and then to every coin and token out there. Of course there is a good chance that we could see bitcoin continue to grow first, maybe it is not time for all these other coins to start growing faster than bitcoin just yet, or maybe it could, we should wait and see that before we make any quick decisions.",
