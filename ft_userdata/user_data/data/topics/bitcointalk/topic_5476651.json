The Bitcoin network is not controlled by a single person but by developers ,miners who run nodes and we the users.Some other reasons include  creating a currency that is impossible to fake.this works for Bitcoin because new validations are stacked in a block format making it more difficult to alter previous blocks.",

You can add what you think. To be honest not every person can contribute to the BTC blockchain in terms of Nodes, because hash power is touching the sky and not every person with an ordinary computer would add computation power to the BTC node. But I wonder if there is any way to contribute to the BTC blockchain with my ordinary system with no physical graphic card.Maybe there is some way of which I am unaware. Please mention if there is any. I can predict that Satoshi must have assumed that the world will not remain the same because computational power will increase, or it has to increase because more adoption of BTC means more congestion on the network and it means we need more computational power to process transactions.Making BTC a legal tender does not make it centralized, because it will not be controlled by the government. And that's a good thing, but they can keep a close eye on every individual and to do that there is no need for them to adopt it as legal tender.",

Government's don't need to make it a legal tender to do that. Taxing bitcoins already means that the government is involved in how you spend your coins and with the help of centralized exchanges they can track and sort addresses and transactions.",

Being legalized does not actually mean that it will be a legal tender soon, of course fiat or dollar will definitely be the legal tender for life, or it could be bitcoin we don't know actually.However, the term legalized could also mean that it will centralized soon and that taxing can be always possible. When that happens, I'm sure that's not the one that Satoshi is trying to appeal about bitcoin. Being controlled by the government is not actually what Satoshi wants.",

There are no limitations on its accessibility. There are no limits in where Bitcoin can be sent. The job has been done.Whether Bitcoin was intended to work as a payment system is another topic. Electronic cash in comparison to a payment system are two different things, even though they sound the same. The difference is that a payment system has an element of scalability. And a focus on growing scalability...it needs to in order to stay competitive. Electronic cash doesn't need to do that, it just needs to serve a similar purpose to cash, and fulfil that purpose in a long-term and stable way, as Bitcoin has since its beginning.",

You can add what you think. The way in which Satoshi Nakamato invented Bitcoin and wanted to use Bitcoin was correct from his point of view. But today's Bitcoin usage and payment system is much more flexible than just Satoshi Nakamato thought.Currently, a country's government and central bank play a major role in Bitcoin legal tender, as does the role it plays in the trust and confidence of the people of that country. If people don't care about Bitcoin acceptance then Bitcoin will never get legality in that country.Again, it is not possible to give legal tender of bitcoin only if the public imposes importance because the government and the central bank must have positive feedback. For example in my country Bangladesh people express confidence in Bitcoin but only because of the hostile attitude of the government and central bank towards Bitcoin Bitcoin is never getting legal in our country.",

It could be a reason why many people still do not see that Bitcoins can be a legal currency soon but will just remain as an investment.",

Do you mean you have really finished reading the white paper? If yes, then I will really applaud you for that, as I have not had the courage to even start. All I do is study any quoted part I come across online or on a billboard, and I gather my knowledge from other sources. Things are developed for some purpose, and they are later used for that purpose, and some other better uses are also being discovered from them, which makes the discovery even more interesting. Some parts of me do feel like there are still many things that can still be achieved with bitcoin that have not yet been unlocked, and bitcoin being recognised as a legal tender is also part of the vision when you want something to be used for seamless transactions.

You can add what you think. It doesn't matter. Bitcoin being legal tender or not being legal tender doesn't affect what Bitcoin is. If a govt adds Bitcoin as legal tender, like how El Salvador did, that doesn't mean that govt has any sort of control over Bitcoin. These are decisions happening in the external world. They don't affect what Bitcoin is, it would just allow much greater participation in Bitcoin, which is a good thing. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that allows self-banking. No matter who calls it legal tender, no matter who holds it in ETFs or other investment vehicles, no matter who holds it as a store of value or spends it daily, or whatever, doesn't change one bit what Bitcoin is.I see people on here complain if it becomes legal tender or complain that rich people and corporations own it or complain that people are going to hold it as investments instead of use as money. Why would anyone care about that??? It's a currency that anyone can use in whatever way they see fit for themslelves. There is literally nothing wrong with any of these things, including if nations eventually decide to promote Bitcoin to legal tender.",
