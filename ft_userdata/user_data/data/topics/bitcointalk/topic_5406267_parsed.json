  "content": "Fair Launch’ tokens outshine the average coin's performanceDate Feb2021Data from Messari shows the top 20 “Fair Launch tokens” are outperforming both the top 1,000 crypto assets and Ethereum-based assets on average this year s far.‘Fair Launch’ tokens outshine the average coin's performance NEWSSo-called ‘Fair Launch’ tokens are outperforming most projects released via centralized token distribution events, according to crypto market data aggregator Messari, Messari defines Fair Launch tokens as having a publicly announced launch without any form of pre-mine. These include older top 10 crypto assets Bitcoin and Litecoin, newer DeFi projects such as Yearn.Finance and SushiSwap, and veteran 2013 altcoin Peercoin.Fair Launch tokens appear to be outperforming the broader crypto markets by more than double over the past three months. The top 1,026 crypto markets gained an average of 9.56% this past week, compared to the 31.44% average gain seen by Fair Launch projects over the same period.Over the past 30 days, Fair Launch tokens are up 145.33% compared to the collective crypto average of 49.50%, while the last 90 days have seen Fair Launch projects gain 296.46% compared to 112.41%.Fair Launch tokens are also outperforming the averages of Ethereum-based assets, which gained 1.90%, 43.82%, and 248.45% over the past seven, 30, and 90 days respectively.The performance of Fair Launch tokens has also been bolstered by Bitcoin’s meteoric run into all-time highs since breaking above $20,000 for the first time in December. ............................................................................... .... July 14th 2022 Case study (Fair launch project)In addition to avoiding pre mined tokens another determining factor to success is the amount of tokens in the circulating supply on the market. To put the above theory to the test, we created a Token DRAMZ with fair launch principles and limited supply. our token $DRAMZ www.gamecrypto.co was launched last month 25th July with zero pre mined tokens and a limited supply of 130M available in the market. the remaining 420M vested and locked between 3-5 years 25th July - Launch price 0.00000500014 July - 0.00007023that's an impressive 1300% in less than a monthCurrently with only 30M available and going by the recent history, we believe there is a strong possibility for the tokens price to continue appreciating We will keep our followers informed on the progress on how a live Token based on fair launch principles, with low circulating supply can consistently outperform market leaders and better well known altcoins.Thereby providing evidence that regardless of market conditions fair launch tokens with limited supply are a best use case for robust Tokenomics model.Wayne CEO/Founder https://www.gamecrypto.cohttps://gamecrypto.co/dramz-token/https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0x5F059aC4A928e45ba26c118CEc8CaAc8EEaC036bhttps://poocoin.app/tokens/0x5f059ac4a928e45ba26c118cec8caac8eeac036b",

      "body": "Cheers,the word is shill not chill by the way, but anyway I'm sure your analysis is indeed in-depth Yes it is my token and I never said anything to contrary, and stated clearly I am the owner of this project in my sig.lets consider BTC as the poster child for a fair launch which clearly shows the advantage of non pre-mined tokens with low total supply.If done correctly fair launch Tokens should technically be superior to your ICO, IEO,IDO etc due to the fact insiders, whitelisting and investors do not receive tokens before a public launchwhich generally leads to P&Ds as witnessed on multiply occasions and eventually lead to price manipulation as the insiders continually dump into the unsuspecting market  My evidence will be in the results of the token appreciation and price overtime as to weather a Fair launch protocol is actually special or not",
