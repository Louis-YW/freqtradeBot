Bitcoin become phenomenal because of its cutting edge blockchain technology which allows you to send money without the need of 3rd party services such as bank. Assuming Bitcoin as physical currency will just be another fiat currency.Why will you buy some physical currency rather than your own fiat currency? Also I wonder what will backed on Bitcoin value if it’s only physical.",

If bitcoin was a physical currency, it will just become a fad and a thing of the past and some other \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" would probably create \"bitcoin\" but a different year.",

You should define \"physical currency\".Both gold/silver coins and paper money are physical currencies.I assume that by \"physical Bitcoin\" you mean BTC that was printed on paper.1.If BTC was a 100% paper currency everyone would just try to create counterfeit paper BTC and there would be no central authority to fight against all those counterfeit paper BTC. The governments won't do anything, because paper BTC is not legal tender.2.I don't agree that physical BTC would be very difficult to buy. There will be no KYC and no additional transaction fees when dealing with offline sellers and buyers, but the security of the buyers and sellers would become a big problem in offline trading.",

Are you thinking about this?So Bitcoin is lucky as a digital asset because anyone can buy it without having to think about where to go. Apart from that, Bitcoin in physical form can also be duplicated, especially with current technological advances, it is difficult to distinguish between genuine and imitation. With its existence on the internet and Bitcoin using an blockchain mechanism, it cannot be duplicated and cannot be imitated.If Bitcoin becomes a physical currency, it means there are regulations governing it and perhaps not many people are interested. And it's certainly not much different from antique items from ancient times that are only owned by a handful of big collectors.",

Many factors contributes to the popularity of a currency. My country's currency is not well-known outside our sub-region. Even in the face of daily increases in the development of more digital currency, bitcoin's popularity keeps growing which means that it is not just the digital currency status that is making it more popular. Bitcoin is popular because of its uniqueness which distinguishes it from other currencies. It has given people the uncommon privilege of enjoying privacy and bypassing financial middlemen. It has also helped people to have unlimited access to their funds which is not common with conventional fiat currency. OP it is true that the digital nature of bitcoin has made it easy to acquire it.

CBDCs are not the first fiat that is digitally created because fiat has been existing in digital form since many years ago before CBDCs were created.
