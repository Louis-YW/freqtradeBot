  "content": "Hey Guys,While I stated that PNNV.com is a community-based project, it still is. I want to add a banner to help me cover some of the expenses. My expenses are high with zero income. So I was thinking of selling banner space at the header or at the button (we'll figure it out together)So I got 24K users per month (see the attached google analytics stats) 100% are crypto dedicated mainly from Europe.The bid starts from 1000$ for two weeks with 50$ increment.You can either pay with BTC OR USDT (ERC 20).",
