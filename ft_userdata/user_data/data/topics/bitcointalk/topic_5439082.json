Having such device that  notice Bitcoin addresses will help bitcoiners.Bitcoin addresses do contain a checksum and the proper wallets do check it before allowing you send coins to an address.This being said I'm not sure what would achieve such a device as you propose.You can have a clipboard virus and send to a different (but valid!) address than his.He can have a clipboard virus and tell you a different (but valid!) address than where he expects the coins.You may have been sending from a scam platform that doesn't process withdrawals/payments.He may have the wallet on a scam platform or one with bugs that ignored the incoming money and didn't fund the account.(there may be many more cases that didn't come to my mind right now)Would the device you propose fix this? No.Would the device you propose do more than what a proper wallet already does? No.And then..?",

Do you mean detect a device that is possibly infected with a virus(es), thereby giving addresses that doesn't actually belong to you?

Hardware is not necessary for this at all.Well, you could add the address to your address book and give it a label if you use it frequently. Now if only wallet software had a feature to block sending transactions to addresses which are not in your address book, then if you combined it with some double-checking of the address, should prevent you from sending coins to any wrong address.",

It's easy, have him give you the tx id!I have a feeling this might be either a case of scamming or somebody had his computer infected with some clipboard malware.Every transaction that is valid will appear in the blockchain, if he sent coins to somebody it will show where those coins went!That aside, there is not possible to build a program that will automatically detect if the address you want to send coins to is the address your friend sent you via telegram or email, or any kind of new address generated by your exchange, in order to make sure you only send coins to selected addresses you will first have to insert them in that program's database so it will know them, which brings us to the address book NotATether mentioned.",

Sending another transaction with a higher-than-normal fee should fix that right up.That's not great advice.If the original sender simply uses their wallet software to make another transaction with a higher fee, then chances are that software will create an entirely separate transaction which has nothing to do with the first. And so when the mempool empties out, there will be two separate confirmed transactions both sending the same amount of bitcoin to the recipient, and the original sender will be out of pocket.If you want to bump the fee of an existing transaction, then you either need to use a wallet which supports RBF to specifically replace the existing transaction, or you need to specifically spend one of the unconfirmed child outputs in a new CPFP transaction.",

Impossible, OP started the topic on February the 9th, claiming the transaction deal was around one week oldOn February 5th we had a bunch of blocks from 775142 to 775160 that were not full and confirmed even the lowest transactions at 1sat/kb so if it was sent a week go (February 2nd)  it's impossible for it to not have been already confirmed for four days prior to OP opening the topic.Also:Quotenot seeing the coin and not even showing a sign of coin is on processSo probably his friend checked the mempool and saw there are unconfirmed deposits to his address at all.",

You can only send bitcoin to valid addresses, which will receive a confirmation at some point (barring rare cases when the mempool is too full). Your proposed software has no way of knowing whether the bitcoin address you have entered is valid and correct or valid but incorrect.

All you are doing is adding unnecessary steps, and the more steps the more chance of something going wrong.
