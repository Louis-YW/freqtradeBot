  "content": "QuoteWhile speaking at the opening ceremony of Tesla's Gigafactory in Texas, Tesla's CEO said that the Tesla Semi will be produced in 2023, along with the Cybertruck and Roadster. In fact, it's one of the reasons why Tesla built a Gigafactory in Texas –- so it could have the capacity to produce all three EV models. Once the Semi is released, Tesla expects that it will be sold at a starting price of $150,000 for the 300-mile range model and $180,000 for the 500-mile range model.Assuming those prices prove accurate, it means the Tesla Semi won't be very expensive compared to other diesel trucks -- not to mention, it will reportedly be cheaper to maintain and fuel than most alternatives. \"A diesel truck will be 20% more expensive than a Tesla Semi per mile,\" according to Elon Musk. Tesla's CEO also says customers will be able to drive the commercial truck for a million miles without it breaking down. At the time of writing, the Tesla Semi is available to reserve from Tesla's website with a deposit of $20,000.https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-teslas-electric-semi-truck/ar-AAZN5x1....Tesla's new electric semi is scheduled to begin production in 2023. It utilizes the new 4680 battery cells, which do not use cobalt mined in africa with child labor. Has a drag coefficient lower than a bugatti and can do 0-60 miles per hour in 5 seconds. They claim it can add 400 miles of range in only 30 minutes of charge time.Food prices are climbing. Partially due to the cost of shipping and transportation rising on fossil fuel overhead. Electric based shipping carries a potential to reduce shipping costs, and stabilize prices to a relative degree. It also carries a potential to reduce consumption of fossil fuels, and perhaps help stabilize prices.",

Partially due to the cost of shipping and transportation rising on fossil fuel overhead.The inflation was caused mostly by the massive money printing and the stimulus checks. The global oil prices had stabilized at around 100 USD.Shipping/transportation costs aren't such a big inflation factor. The transport companies simply saw an opportunity to raise the prices and make fast profits.Anyway, the Tesla Semi sounds promising, but these are only promises. I can't say anything about the Tesla Semi until there are several thousand Tesla trucks hitting the road. I don't see any other big companies in the auto industry focusing on electric trucks. There are multiple issues around the creation of a fully functional electric truck that we don't know about.",

It is bad, but there is nothing, absolutely nothing that fortune 500 corps can do about it. Except for cutting ties with those firms and watch their production capacity drop.All of this \"safe factory labour\" clamouring by activists and special interest groups is just that - clamouring. Activists themselves cannot do anything about the problem so it's just a tug of war between them and the factories with Fortune 500 is the rope (and if the rope is weak, it snaps in half).",

Trains!So rather than reinventing the wheel and it would be far simple to offer incentives to companies to ship over long distances with trucks and to operate logistic centers near railway junctions, cutting a lot of traffic and pulling a lot of trucks from highways.Quote from: Lucius on August 03, 2022, 10:14:33 AMDoes this mean that all the green cars of Mr. Mars were actually created with the help of exploiting children in Africa, and destroying the environment of the countries where such mines are located?

It would be nice if everyone drove electric cars, but we should not fool ourselves that pollution will be less, because countries like China, Russia or India or even the US do not care too much about environmental problems, but only worsen pollution in the constant race to be competitive.",

The sea salt industry had connections to slavery in south korea. Foxconn worker concentration camps were known to use child labor in the past. Beverage corporations were linked to assassinations to prevent workers in south america from unionizing. Exploitation and abuse are widespread and seldom acknowledged.The conventional chemistry of lithium batteries uses cobalt. But its not so much the battery industry that is corrupt. So much as it is every industry in africa being linked to exploitation of some type. Whether its mining diamonds and gold. Shipbreaking. Cobalt and rare earth mineral extraction. Africa has terrible conditions for workers as a norm.",

Well, electricity prices are also bound to continue rising in the near future. From what I know, at least in Europe, a big bulk of electricity is generated from natural gas (basically they've replaced one fossil fuel with another).So financially electric cars are no longer a great business now.And the rather long charging time + rather small number of km one charge holds make the electric cars okay only for those having one car for long distances and another card for the daily use. This is an old problem and won't be solved unless a much better battery system is developed (either much faster charging, like 1 minute for each 100 km added, either a battery that easily lasts over 1000 km).",

      "body": "I know a little bit about this topic, using electricity to power the marine engine, and applications for long-range shipping lanes. Though it was impressive to see Tesla's technology advance in this field, it is still quite far from actually a replacement for marine engines that use oil in diesel-engine. The main critical thing for marine engines is the endurance for crossing the oceans. They're made for slow speed but have long range and many days voyage over the sea without a rest stop.As many of you have know or own electric cars, that is impossible for the battery technology right now. High capacity and high discharge rate enough to power propeller to move the average 100,000 tons container ship is nearly impossible. The battery technology under the military section might have more potential to solve it. The Japanese's Soryu-class submarine boasts to have the best lithium-ion batteries in the world to power its 4,200 tons submarine when submerged. And the Japanese keep improving this technology so the battery will have higher capacity and higher discharge rate in the future.Pic to illustrate the Japanese Soryu-class submarine spec right now. Remove the restraint of the battery size to fit on the submarine and all related specs for a submerged submarine. Although it has a limitation, a lower speed than the typical container ships with 15knot. Could be improved in the future if the technology advance.",

Not only shipping cost but also the fuel cost or the crude oil cost will go lower when this will happen but Tesla is already contributing enough to this. I think with time obviously fuel usage will reduce and so will the fuel reserves in total. So the equilibrium price of the fuel will still be maintained in total.",

Just to give an example, there are periods in factories where it was many people who worked, and with the salaries and all it cost 5 bucks to build each product and 10 bucks was the sale price, then technology helped to fire some people and machinery took over, and cost of producing that product became 1 dollar, but companies still sold it for 10 dollars, just because they have been, and didn't share the profits. Meaning, truckers could get tesla semi, but even if the price went down for them to go from place A to place B, if they do not drop the price for it, they will profit more, but it would be same for us.",
