  "content": "dumb people cheat, smart people scam the other, and zero sum.dumb people cheat the system, smart people scam the other people in the system. eventually the system return to zero sum because it is so broken, koolaid can't patch it anymore.in the school, dumb student could not get ahead in result, they often have to resort to cheating, by cheating the exam system, they can bring note into exam, and go to toilet as an excuse to cheat by reading the note in the toilet. (do not tell your kid to cheat with this tricks okey!)but smart people do not like to cheat in the exam, instead, smart people scam in the exam instead, obviously they have to scam someone else, who are they going to scam in the exam? They scam the teacher, they scam the examiner, just like how the banker scam the regulators. Look there is priviledged student who get easy pass in the exam, especially some gender almost always do better than the other gender by great margin, nobody wonder why such irregularity is allowed, btw it is tough to be teachers.it look like what we learn in school, we could make good uses of them in the job market too, ahahahaha, btw is it true money is just as stupid as examination and grade?So dumb guy cheat the test by acquiring doge instead of working hard for money(not working hard on the exam), smart guy scam other by making plethora of pump and dump coin (trying to work hard in the test). And some guy rather become housewives or house-nerd(basement dweller), which is basically retire permanently by rooting on a breadwinner or a rent for life support.but why want to try so hard to cheat and scam in a test? what is the reward in the end? May be getting a princess's blessing, may be a chance to marry Minnie mouse to have many little kids? Because being animal is very bad, animal do not work hard, they get to breed as hard and as many as they could without restrictions, animal can get fast house fast car and fast woman without working hard.",

      "body": "What has this thread to do with economic discussion and what have school exams have to do with the economic situation of the students or how they can develop a marketable skills, e.g. haven't you heard the saying that examination is? Not the true test of knowledge and the one who comes first in class doesn't necessarily become the smartest in the society. One thing I disagree with your point further is the part you mentioned that smart people scam others,  I don't think that is 100% true,  because smart people can figure out their ways instead of cheating others.",

There is quite a lot of con artist who is surprising smart, street smart, they are also able to pull off very complicated scam, such as the one we can see on ftx and luna, they are indeed top of the world class scam pulled off by top of the world class genius.",

You are likely driving this discussion into another dimension and I think you need to have some clear part for the discussion my above comment was based on how I understood your post and at the same time try so hard to fit into the discussion,  but you overly mentioning gender and male excessively which is not something I will like to make further comment about that term used since I am against gender differentiation in my discussion.",

All in all, I see the OP is limiting himself by the illogical and persuasive arguments in this conversation, here the reasons OP pointed out are only part of the result and it is not the complete reason. for such an outcome to exist in society. The problem that the OP mentioned is smart people and scams, simpler than thinking about whether they are ethical or not, honoring personal interests leads to greedy, selfish, selfish behavior want to win. Just like the problem of economic ranking based on criteria that some people and organizations set up, and ask themselves whether it is necessary? And on top of those rankings there is another look at economic issues that are more encompassing like human well-being.In short, I don't want to go into a long discussion here that is not on the same level of thinking, if you are more persuasive about the argument please make it easier to make it easier for me to open my eyes.",
