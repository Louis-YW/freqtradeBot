  "content": "So I see the difficulty going down pretty well in the last 24 hours,especially the ETHW is in less than 300 T now and ETC less than 1.8 P while RVN also less than 200K,looking good but is this because of the FTX drama or because many miners are realizing now that they can't do much with their rigs until they are like I am mining even at a loss for a longer run and much better perspective than it is now? What are your views in this,many of you predicted that difficulty lowering down would happen in a couple of months but it is happening in just 1.5 months after ETH moved to PoS.",

What are your views in this,many of you predicted that difficulty lowering down would happen in a couple of months but it is happening in just 1.5 months after ETH moved to PoS.The revenue need months to recover, not the difficulty. Difficulty adjustment is fast on most coins.And the Diffi go down, because of hashrate go down and hashrate go down, because of mining revenue go down, and after the black swan (FTX) the revenues are doomed at the moment, but will recover fast. So many shutdown or some jump over to kaspa, it raised over 35% in the last 7 days.The people must shut down, mining at a loss is senseless - 1+1 is not 3",

      "body": "If you look at the chart. It's quite clear that there is some correlation between the drop in difficulty and the recent drop in crypto market. Perhaps so many miners shut down ¬†their rigs citing low revenue or negative profitsYou can see it rising back a bit when the market recovered a bit as well.",

What are your views in this,many of you predicted that difficulty lowering down would happen in a couple of months but it is happening in just 1.5 months after ETH moved to PoS.I would imagine that a lot of people got burned by FTX directly or by having leveraged positions liquidated as a result of the market action. Many of these people are probably considering this the final straw and throwing in the towel as the stress becomes too much to bear. As always when there‚Äôs a panic, this is probably the best time for fresh money to enter the markets in order to bank off the next uptrend. If you can afford to mine right now, it‚Äôs probably a good time in spite of what the calculators say.",

If you can afford to mine right now, it‚Äôs probably a good time in spite of what the calculators say. I can afford like 150-450 Mhsh in total to run with electricity not being the highest here yet and the government despite others in EU raised their price in here I am still with the old price so for the moment since the difficulty is low I have the new 150 Mhsh rig running with just 2 Rtx 3060 ti and an old card.I already am stocking up good amounts of the ETHW which for me is gonna replace ETH maybe not that soon but in the long run I am extremely confident about this.",
