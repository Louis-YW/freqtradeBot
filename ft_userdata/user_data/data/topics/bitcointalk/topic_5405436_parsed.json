  "content": "Hi Gamblers, in my quest to learn about how gambling started, I found a really helpful article, filled with information about the history of gambling, I learnt a lot from this article, so I decided to share the article here so you all can learn about the history of gambling too, I hope you all like it. , please note that article was copied word for word from source, Now, lets dive in....THE HISTORY OF GAMBLINGAccording to the article, It is believed that gambling, wagering, betting, and gaming predate the invention of writing and have their origins in the late Paleolithic era (roughly 2.5 million years ago to 10,000 B.C.). Back when we lived in caves or huts and hunted and gathered. We also gambled! There is no way to know exactly how old gambling is, but it seems to have existed almost as long as humans have.We present here a timeline of how and when gambling developed from actual evidence unearthed or later from written accounts. We end up where we are today.3000 BC – A pair of dice was recovered from an Egyptian tomb dating back 5000 years.2300 BC – In Ancient China, small wooden tiles were discovered that appear to have been used for a lottery. Evidence of keno ‘slips’ has also been found.200 BC – Lotteries were used to fund state works, possibly even the Great Wall of China, and they still serve that purpose today. Did you know that lottery funds were used to build Harvard and Yale? --I didn't know this either .500 BC - Sophocles mentions dice for the first time in Greek history, despite dice having been around for millennia already. It is clear that the Ancient Greeks and Romans loved gambling and even had gods and goddesses dedicated to gambling and fortune, as did many other cultures.800 AD – the first playing cards appeared in China in the 9th century, although they bore no resemblance to cards used today, and how the game was played is lost to history.1400s - Baccarat was first played during this time period and was first mentioned when it made its way from Italy to France. Since then, the rules have changed many times, and the game we know today originated in Cuba via Britain.1600s – there are a number of games from this period that can be claimed as the forerunners of blackjack, although the French game vingt-et-un is the most obvious. Early French settlers brought blackjack to the US. In the 1930s, Nevada casinos offered a special promotion that gave the name ‘blackjack’ to the game. 10 to 1 odds were paid out if the player won with a black Jack of Clubs or Spades together with an Ace of Spades. The odds are long gone, but the name stuck.1796 – Roulette made its debut in the gaming houses of Paris. Originally the wheel had two green zeros, the very one now referred to as the American Roulette wheel. Hugely popular by the 1900s, the famous Monte Carlo casino installed roulette tables with just one green zero, and it became known as the much more popular European Roulette wheel and was adopted all over the world, except the USA, which has stuck with the old version.1829 –  poker had rather murky beginnings, growing organically and transforming here and there and everywhere over decades and possibly centuries. Poker wasn’t that particularly popular until the 1970s and the advent of poker tournaments. Poker’s popularity exploded with the birth of the internet and live televised streaming.1891 –  As slot machines got more and more sophisticated and became the biggest draw card in brick and mortar casinos. What would a casino be without the flashing lights, the music, and alarm bells going off when a jackpot had been won?1976 – The first video slot was developed, paving the way for the eruption of technological advancements in computer technology that would come into play in our daily lives and in the gambling industry.The first video slot machine was developed in 1976 in Kearny Mesa, California, by the Las Vegas-based Fortune Coin Co. This machine used a modified 19-inch (48 cm).1994 – Microgaming developed the first online casino software in 1994. However, the casino management tools and player tracking systems were not launched until 1995. The first online casino is launched circa 1995 -1996. The website was casino.co.zaThe casino was exclusively for South African players and was simply called casino.co.za (the website has long since gone and been replaced by an online gambling portal). Players who wanted to wager real money had to phone the casino to get an account number and password, and deposits were taken via credit card over the phone.2021 – Online Gambling has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry with thousands of online casinos available; casinos have been focusing on evolving in terms of graphics and games and becoming more mobile-friendly.So what are your thoughts? lets discuss.Source:-  https://blog.owldao.io/?p=277",

      "body": "Interesting basic overview. Quite frankly, it is very likely that gambling is as old as life itself. If you consider animal behaviour, everything is about gambling and the stake is usually life itself or even the right to reproduce, feed or a territory. Many animals frequently have to \"bet\" on a decision in the sense that they choose to fight or flee, confront a rival or leave it to see another day, etc... For humans, no difference... life is a gamble.",

      "body": "I believe gambling would have begun millions of years ago as people will doubt people from doing something, just like someone says he will do something while other person think he can not do it as it can be difficult to do, this can lead to gambling in a way the person can try to do it, request the other person to give him something if he do it, the second person can think he can not do it and tell him he will give him something  but which is valuable like food. If done, that means they just gambled and he has to give him the food. Gambling start from what is not called money but valuable in my opinion.",

I mean, who knows, even some of their discoveries may just be a result of a simple gamble of yes or no, so yea, gambling has been an integral part of our lives imo. Just that we pushed and developed it more with tools and simple games which made it more entertaining and easy to understand in the long term. I reckon not everyone was people who concentrated on the development side of stuff and the like, so I reckon gambling started there as a form of entertainment (especially for the rich), which people just ultimately developed.",

It looks really nice, which is weird, because the website design in the mid 90s was usually horrible. Maybe somebody will launch a brand new online casino and use this classic design for the frontpage. I kinda got tired of online casinos having similar designs by using the same template.",

This shows to what extent it is useless to ban gambling, as it is  an activity that humans have done throughout their history, and the only thing prohibition does is that people continue to gamble but with less guarantees and in the hands of mafias. People have bet throughout history and will continue to do so. There is a choice between doing it with guarantees, as is the case today, or doing it with much more risk.",

Now the addiction can be explained very easily with the addiction towards things like chocolates, cigarettes etc , all these things are working out to provide you dopamine which slowly makes the person addicted and then the more you do it the worse it gets, there are a lot of ups and downs in your life and thus when you are down the body would be looking for that happy hormone, then you tend to gamble more and make more mistakes as well, there isn't much history but there certainly is enough biology to talk about.",
