And we do not want to have to live like this. But when I am getting this feeling there is some things that I like to do for making it feel better.Going for a walk, reading a good book, and meditation are all things that help with my frustration. These things can help with my mood, agitation, and just if am I having a bad time.",

Once there is no established expectation then there won't be frustration. The only thing I had to say is that it is seemly impossible going through life without expectation from family, persons  etc.",

No I'm not ,(at least not in my age now) because I have learned my lessons , in the past I kept trying my best and expect best result but time thought me not to , instead just give your best and let the result comes.if you did not get it then its not for you that simple but  worth believing and trying.Quote from: bitterguy28 on September 17, 2023, 02:45:52 PMExpect  nothing so you will never be frustrated mate.Pefectly said , expectations bring us losings.",

First the title should be edited because of wrong spelling mate so better work on it before continuing the topic.----------------About frustration? It us normal for human because we are tend to seek for better outcome but that doesn't mean we need to expect and make that attitude keep going because life does not work that way.We need to accept defeat and losing for us to grow better.",

      "body": "I stop with what I do whenever I get frustrated. Why? Because it will stop me as well for being productive with the work or anything that I do. That's how I deal with it and taking some deep breath and fresh air really helps and having a conversation with someone that you have the same interest also helps. Drinking some fresh or cold drink do help as well while eating some fruits that have juices is also a good way to deal with it. In short, anything that you are comfortable doing must be done for you to tackle against frustration. Don't dwell on it for too long because it is temporary.",

It can stem from various sources such as unmet expectations, feeling stuck in a situation, or facing obstacles despite efforts.

I remember a time when I had a severe accident that I spent all my money in the hospital treating myself, my business went down no source of livelihood as it took me some time to recover fully and get back to my feet, I ran into series of debt just to make sure i got back to my fit and as soon as i recovered though not fully, all the people i was owing were on my neck coupled with some other bills and i was looking for a way out, it was just as if i should dig a pit and fall inside due to the level of frustration i was facing, like someone who was doing fine alright all of a sudden just go broke it's really a very sad experience and I don't wish anybody to be frustrated.",
