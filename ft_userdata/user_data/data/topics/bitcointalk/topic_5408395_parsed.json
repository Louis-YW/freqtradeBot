That pizzeria could make much better use of the event for promotional purposes, although they may be doing well without it, given that fast food has a cult status in the US, although the rest of the world is not far behind.Quote from: mk4 on August 02, 2022, 02:02:44 PMI'm guessing that the masses still don't give a crap for now anyway so this will do.

I think that people in that country are much more aware that Bitcoin exists than in some other parts of the world.",

Hopefully this will occur to them or someone who can get it done, A bigger one maybe like a sculpture outside perhaps alongside this portable one inside the store will ensure that everyone in Jacksonville recognises Papa John's store as a historic site for bitcoin. The more persons that get to see it, will get to know more about the famous pizza story and understand that there is a strong culture and history behind bitcoin. Those who are not bitcoin hodlers or hodl no form of crypto will develop an interest from constantly seeing this sculpture, plus those with twisted opinions on the credibility of bitcoins will see that they have been around for a while now.",

Acknowledging the benefits of bitcoin requires a strong level of discipline, to realize the broken parts of the current monetary system. It ain't easy to make such hard acceptances.Especially when nearly the entire world is ruled by politicians, economists, bankers etc., who're supporters of a theory that goes completely against bitcoin; that is, Keynesianism.",

In his words it was \"Free Pizza\".Also, it was not all the bitcoins he had, so it's all good. Plus, he only paid the market value of the pizzas, maybe a bit more, but something like twenty dollars or so in Bitcoin. He didn't pay 200 million for the pizzas, that's just nonsense.By your logic, every single purchase you've done in your life after 2009 was a colossal waste of money because you could have bought Bitcoin instead.",

Maybe he's having a normal life, but his act have changed many users lives and he'll be remembered throughout. Maybe adding some pizza to the menu with the name of Laszlo Hanyecz will add value.

Those who do know about this information often criticize Laszlo because he spent so many Bitcoins on only 2 pizzas, although they do not understand that people mined BTC with personal computers and the reward per block was as much as 50 BTC at that time.Laszlo, unlike most people today, understood why Bitcoin was created, and he showed it with his example.",
