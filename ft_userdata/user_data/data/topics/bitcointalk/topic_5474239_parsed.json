I made a quick search but couldn’t find the project I once saw this mechanism running. I think theirs was up to 10% of what you transact. So yes, when you send tokens, whether to another wallet or to an exchange (though this depends on their own implementation), the 2% will be burnt from the transaction, and the wallet you are sending to will receive 98%. This is how I know it should be.",

Almost 90 percent of them are failing. 10 percent are lucky to survived but I think it also has to do with their dev's approach. Maybe their devs made something special to that meme coin and then they prepare a good budget for it to get a good exposure. So, don't say that those things doesn't matter. Hodlers are willing to HODL a coin as long as they know that the devs are working hard to improve their project more. Don't worry I still agree on some of what you have said there.
