      "body": "Over the past years, social media projects have not succeeded in supporting blockchain or taking advantage of web3 applications.  The biggest example of this is the Meta company (Facebook in the past), which ventured with huge budgets to create the Libra currency and then promote the world of Metaverse, but both attempts ended without success.  The only experience that can be said to be relatively successful is the Steam network, but it still needs more updates to facilitate the service and encourage users to increase turnout. In fact, I do not see anything special in your project, and I do not expect it to have better luck than Steam, because the social media community does not need the blockchain at present, and therefore there is no point in launching a project without returns.",

      "body": "Thank you for sharing your perspective on the current state of social media projects and their integration with blockchain and web3 applications. It's understandable that you have reservations about the potential success of such projects based on the examples you mentioned.While it's true that some previous attempts, like Facebook's Libra and Metaverse initiatives, have faced challenges and setbacks, it's important to note that the technology is still evolving and finding its footing in various industries, including social media. Blockchain and web3 applications have the potential to bring about decentralized and user-centric platforms, with enhanced security, privacy, and ownership of data.Regarding your skepticism about our project, I believe it's important to consider the broader context and the long-term vision of integrating blockchain technology into social media. Although the adoption of blockchain in the social media community may not be widespread at present, there are several potential benefits that could drive its future adoption.Blockchain technology can enable transparent and verifiable content creation, combatting issues such as fake news and online manipulation. It can also empower users by giving them greater control over their data and digital identities, reducing the influence of centralized authorities. Additionally, blockchain-based social media platforms can provide new economic models for content creators and incentivize active participation.While it's true that returns may not be immediate or guaranteed, the exploration and development of blockchain integration in social media can lay the groundwork for a more resilient and user-centric digital ecosystem. It's important to recognize that new technologies often face skepticism and challenges before they gain widespread adoption and demonstrate their true potential.Our project aims to explore the possibilities and potential benefits of integrating blockchain technology into social media. While success cannot be guaranteed, we believe in the long-term potential of this integration to create a more secure, transparent, and user-driven social media landscape. We appreciate your feedback and hope to demonstrate the value of our project in due course.",
