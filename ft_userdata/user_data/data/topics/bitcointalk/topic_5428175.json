And on top of that there is a bonus CLORE given to hosts.An important update from yesterday dev meet-up is that $CLORE will be deflationary: the $CLORE bonus given to hosts will be now proportional to their $CLORE holdings: zero coins in the wallet = zero bonus = all the bonus goes burned. This brings in the need for hosts to buy and hodl $CLORE instead of just selling at market. Given the raising number of rented machines and hosts, new hosts joining the platform will be in need to buy the coin if they want to obtain the bonus $CLORE on top of their payments. Also, if a host won't meet the requirements to get 100% bonus, all the unassigned bonus will get burned. In this way we'll have basically a constant coin burning unless each host will have a massive wallet full of $CLORE.BTC transfer fees will be also paid in $CLORE for an advantage fee rate and there are plans to make rentals discounted for $CLORE holders, always with a proportional method. Dev said he would have worked on this over the weekend. Likely in a few days we should have the new tokenomics implemented and IMHO this will be a massive boost to $CLORE market value and usefulness, at least in this stage.$CLORE adoption keeps growing. You can monitor the current status here: https://opendata.clore.ai/d/aKQRJmA4z/clore-ai?orgId=1If every new host will buy $CLORE to get his bonus, value will grow together with adoption.Â  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1037687652528422996/1070653169794809916/clore-rentals.jpg",
