  "content": "A Closer Look at the Evolution of Gambling Through HistoryMesopotamia and ChinaIn Mesopotamia, it all started with astragalomancy or cubomancy, a form of fortune-telling that relied on a type of dice. Those into cubomancy began to roll the dice and gamble for goods and services.Back then, there was no such thing as money. So, yes, gambling predates money. A discovery in an ancient Egyptian tomb from around 3,000 BCE resembles the closest thing to modern dice.China started gambling in some form about within the first million years BCE. So soon after humans discovered how to communicate, they started going to gambling houses in China.Persia had As-Nas, Rome developed poker chips, and the Italians imported baccarat and Spain created blackjackYou may have heard of the ancient card game As-Nas? The game developed in Persia. As-Nas is the first version of our poker.The Persians took As-Nas to Rome where it became such a hit that Roman authorities had to make gambling illegal. So instead of gambling with money, the Romans gambled with a form of poker chip.Then, they’d cash out the poker chips after the end of play. This form of playing with chips or coins and then cashing them out after game play exists today in every casino every where in the world.It also exists online where when we decide to play a few games of blackjack, we sit at the table and then cash out the rest of our balance and go and play another game.The first known card game that exists today is baccarat. The Italians created the game and then imported it to France some time around 1400.It took another 200 years, some time around 1600, for the Spanish to come up with blackjack even though nobody called it blackjack. The Spanish version of blackjack is different than our version. The French took the idea and turned it into 21.When French settlers arrived in America, for some reason, nobody really knows, it turned into blackjack. Settlers in what became the U.S. were the first ones to call it blackjack.Keep reading→ https://n2g.io/502e0b6",

      "body": "Quite an interesting topic.. but if you have to explain the history of gambling in detail, it seems like one day and one night is not enough to explain it, because gambling has been around for a long time. Gambling is a social culture from the past that has continued to the present, even though gambling has many advantages and disadvantages, and many people also have a negative view of gambling activities. Gambling has survived until now because there are still many enthusiasts and addicts, and continues to grow, especially after the emergence of online casinos that can be accessed by anyone.In fact, gambling has always been a form of entertainment since ancient times, but over time, more and more people are playing, and some people think that gambling is an advantage. As a result, many people take their chances in the hope of getting money soon to improve their standard of living, when in reality what happens if gambling is considered profitable for many people whose lives are getting worse? Tragic.",

The Asian part have a different story whereas the western part have got a different history. It is really hard to have the precise data on the beginning of gambling. Gambling came into existence long back and from some sources it is clear that gambling had existed even before the written history. Rather than thinking of the origin/beginning of gambling it is good to explore and find the base for the modern day gambling.",

If OP says it starts in Mesopotamia and China, then it's just limited to their recorded history. For all we know there are more ancient civilizations than Persia or China since there are new discoveries found in carved stones. It probably didn't start with money like he said and people only barter during that time. One person who wants to eat a banana but doesn't have something to barter will likely just dare the merchant for the banana which is kind of a gambling still.",

Now I know that it predates any other important thing in human society, so that explains it. Also, when it comes to widespread gambling, I know that the Romans and Persians are to blame. They have huge influence in Asia and Europe during the time of their empires and kingdoms that it's not really a thing to be surprised on when we find out that they're the progenitors of gambling.But damn, poker in ancient times? I wonder if they have poker faces back then or how they play it.",

Well it's because they are much more convenient.Thats the main difference if we are really that trying out to differentiate in between timelines in speaking on what are the things that been risked out on the time that they would gamble. They do differ in form but ending up on the same thing which does have value because you cant really make out some gambling game or against someone without betting a valuable thing. Neither on ancient times or digital age the whole concept of gambling would really be just the same. They do really differ in form and offerings or types on how its been done. As we do know that gambling had already existed on ancient times and then further developed as the generations had passed and this isnt only excluded on gambling field but also in other things in life which it do evolved and been able to be invented out.Lots had changed and lots had been replaced by something new but in overall concept or risks taking then gambling would really be remaining to be a gambling thing.They do really just differ on some points but still the same on how its been done and needs up on risking something.",

Well it's because they are much more convenient.I am not an scholar of history, but in my opinion gambling probably appeared when the first societies were formed and we stopped gathering and hunting to move forward established settlements where there was no need to continue to be nomads.From there the appearance of  currency was a matter of time, though I have not read on history books about some scientific evidence on people wagering goods like food and cattle.  It probably happened, however when gambling started to blossom there was already a well defined economical system; Roman empire, Chinese Empire and the inhabitants of the Highlands of Scotland are examples of it.",

Very rarely do we see a post discussing anything related to the history and origins of gambling. In general, these kinds of threads is what makes gambling interesting since you mentioned that it is a broad terminology which can cover all aspects which may/can be related to gambling.In conclusion, the scope of gambling and the topics that are relevant to it is broad- anything can be discussed and almost everything is interesting!",

The decentralized gambling before becomes illegal simply because of the casinos who influence the government regulations, imagine you can gamble anywhere before without being afraid of getting caught by the authority. Well, this is how the government regulate gambling and they believe that having your business registered makes your activities more legal. This industry continues to grow as the technology grows as well, they managed to adopt so they will remain in the business, there's a big money here so I think casinos will not stop from growing too.",

I don't know, but I never saw online platforms again that could hold PVP poker tournaments, and that's because poker is one of the most popular games worldwide, of course there's also black jack, which I really like about that game, but also , we must focus on the fact that in poker in 2017 I found other platforms where you played with other people and even for free and you earned some BTC, and the money that was paid because you Earned much more in the Prize",
