I have (historically) been a Democrat. But this is positive news for BTC and I think one positive step towards greater adoption. Not sure what he will do regarding the strategic reserve, but just having the UNITED STATES government finally support BTC brings a certain level of validation to Bitcoin. I don't care how bullish we all were for the past decade. There was always a level of uncertainty regarding BTC. Much of that uncertainty will disappear in one week, and BTC just became THAT much less risky as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, and perhaps even as a currency.",

The article talks about Elon Musk, Marc Andreessen and tech but nothing about an executive order on day 1, which is a rumour I've been hearing for some time but I don't see it in the Washington Post article.Searching in a search engine for the title I find another article that speculates on it but does not take it for granted:QuoteEveryone’s counting on Trump to sign executive orders right after he’s sworn in.The real action kicks off on January 20. <...>Then J.D. Vance will take his oath as vice president, followed by Donald Trump swearing in as the 47th president of the United States.His inauguration speech is expected to lay out all plans for the next four years, and crypto insiders will be listening closely. Why? Because the industry anticipates immediate executive orders that could change everything.",

Much of that uncertainty will disappear in one week, and BTC just became THAT much less risky as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, and perhaps even as a currency. You are correct that with a move like this the \"doubt\" in many people's minds due to years of FUD could go away but time will tell if this is actually a positive thing for volatility or a negative thing. I'm personally worried about government level market manipulation coming to bitcoin from now on. And that is the most dangerous thing that can significantly damage adoption and future bullish trends as US government would be the one doing the \"pump and dump\" where regular people would lose their lifesavings... There is also the problem with centralization. We could start seeing more crackdowns on anything US government cannot control; we've already seen what happened to mixers and even wallet softwares that did CoinJoin and of course what they've been doing to exchanges (forcing more surveillance). On top of that US regime is trying to take control of the mining as well. That's is already terrible for bitcoin not to mention for the US electrical grid that is already experiencing a lot of problems and some predict \"power shortfall\" in the next decade. That only means crackdowns and centralization would get worse.",

I’m not entirely sure about the current accounting practices in the banking industry when it comes to crypto holdings, but I assume those holdings are mostly from clients, with banks acting as custodians. In that case, it makes sense for those holdings to be treated as liabilities since the banks are obligated to return them within a certain timeframe. Because of the unique risks involved, it’s reasonable not to consider them as assets.My guess is this \"crypto ball\" could be addressing crypto regulation. This would make sense since Trump would need to establish a clear stance on crypto in general before moving forward with bigger plans, like the strategic reserve we’ve all been waiting to see happen.",
