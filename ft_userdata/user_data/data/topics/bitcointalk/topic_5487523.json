  "content": "The month of march has been a bearish period for Bitcoin since it's history and a lot of whales predicted it's price to go below 60k and probably rise again after March in the anticipated halving towards April.  However we saw a different case this year and instead of BTC going down it has attained a high of 65k today which is close to the price of the All Time High in the last Halving by Nov 2021 which was about 69k if I'm not mistaken. Also, Tether recently released about a billion dollar USDT and afterwards we saw the price of BTC surge above its previous price of 62k to 63 and currently 65k plus. This has made lots of crypto enthusiasts wonder if the billion dollar release by Tether is the driving force behind the resurgence of Bitcoin, what do you think about this? Well in own my speculation I think Bitcoin could attain a height above the previous ATH of 69k to 70 or 75k and above, before April. Also, if the previous ATH was about 69k there's a possibility that it could double that figure, maybe close to 150k. What's your say on this.",

You kind of miss his line of point, OP means bearish month for Bitcoin in its History and not that this month is a bearish month so far for Bitcoin, but I guess in the past pre-halving years he's talking about. And to answer your question OP, definitely I guess this is part of the reason and not mainly the reason because on before the new Tether were printed, Bitcoin already started gearing up for this move, but now it will act as a catalyst to help get the price of Bitcoin where it's headed to, and besides where do you expect those minted Tether USDT to go into? Definitely buying of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well.",

What's your say on this.If there is a driver for the rally, it is not USDT but the inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs. Currently 900 BTC are mined per day, but the Bitcoin ETFs have to buy around 10k per day to fullfill the demand. This means that around 9k are being bought on the open market every day, which creates a lot of buying pressure. This naturally attracts speculators, who ensure that prices continue to rise. I read an article in a business magazine a few days ago that if the inflows into the ETFs continue as they have in the last two weeks, then USD 45 billion will flow into the Bitcoin market through the ETFs alone by the end of the year. You can imagine what that would mean for the price.",

I think we got $500M to go.Yep. It just means money is coming into the market.People always claim when  new USDT is created it means they just created it out of thin air lol. I always wonder where do they think this magical money created out of thin air goes lol??! I've never heard of anyone being GIVEN tether for free.Obviously Tether isn't simply created out of thin air as the conspiracies always claim, it is printed when people bring new fiat into the market and exchange it for Tether. And yeah as you say it doesn't mean all this money is flowing into Bitcoin, it just means a lot of people are exchanging fiat for Tether, which will in general go to Bitcoin or other cryptos or stay in Tether waiting for when they person wants to buy.So to answer the OP's question: yes, a bunch of new money coming into the crypto market (some of which is being exchanged for Tether) is of course one of the driving forces for the surge of Bitcoin's price. Because people moving money into the market generally means more buy pressure for Bitcoin.",

Because you are narrating a tiny portion of the trend!Price started rising a long time ago and it has been breaking resistance after resistance at $30k, $40k, $50k, $60k, and soon the $70k. It is not like price had stayed at a fixed level with a completely flat chart with no rise then Tether printed some of its own shitcoin then that flat chart turned into a rising chart!!! It's been rising all along and this centralized shitcoin created more of its tokens to match the increasing volume and most importantly to get ready for the altcoin pump that always follows after Bitcoin starts rallying.",

However some people expected a bear season this March before the halving but there was a U turn this year or would I rather say it didn't go as they predicted. That's why it's good for people to DYOR about Crypto currency instead of listening to speculations from the so called whales or paid advertisers. I won't be suprised that a lot of people would be mislead by those predictions and probably sell their coins cause they thought this March would experience a bear market as predicted by people on the media.",

What's your say on this.You are probably referring to the rumors that were circulating in the past when it seemed that Tether was used to artificially pump the Bitcoin price. While I think that back at the time it probably was the case, there is now more risk for any company running a stable coin to do that as the crackdowns on market manipulators and other scammy activities have become far more severe. Since its public knowledge, the moment that Tether prints a billion dollar worth of USDT, I am pretty sure that they would be highly careful to abuse those USDT for any illegal purposes. Because chances are high that the SEC or any other authorized institution will investigate how those funds have been used. But this still doesn't mean that the market isn't being manipulated at all at the moment. Huge players could pump the market slowly while keeping the volume high, making sure that the number of retail investors increases and buys into the surging price.",

If Tether does not provide proof of reserve of all these billions of dollars, then what is their money supply apart from thin air?haha. Has anyone ever proved the conspiracy theory that Tether prints money out of thin air? Nope. Despite people making that claim for many years there is zero proof its true. It's just a crackpot theory for conspiracy theorists and for people who want to argue that Bitcoin has no value because it's all from fake Tether money haha.The people making the outrageous claim are the ones who have the burden of proof. So the people making the claim that zero people have ever actually exchanged dollars for tether, despite millions of people using Tether for many years, and that it is $100 billion of fake money...this is the outrageous claim. Until anyone shows any proof of Tether printing money there is no reason to believe the conspiracy theories.I mean if any of these conspiracy theorists actually thought about how stablecoins work, they'd laugh at themselves. When fiat being exchanged for Tether outstrips Tether supply they literally have to create more Tether. Because the whole point is its a stablecoin. If they don't make create more money when more money is used to get Tether then the price goes above $1. Likewise when Tether decreases, if people are unloading the Tether supply if the company doesn't reduce the supply then there will be too much supply and the price will go below $1.So whenever some conspiracy theorist says \"OMG they printed more Tether!!!!!\" and they're freaking out about fake money, they are actually just freaking out that new money is coming into the market and buying Tether. That's literally how stablecoins work lol.But if you still believe the \"Tether is entirely fake\" after all these years I doubt you'll ever accept the common sense explanation.According to your argument, if I don't show you proof of my bitcoin addresses then I don't actually own Bitcoin lol.I'll be more than willing to accept that Tether prints out of thin air.....as soon as there is literally ANY EVIDENCE AT ALL that it's true. So far, after many years, zero evidence. While the simple dynamics of how stablecoins work perfectly accounts for why more Tether is created over time, same with any stablecoin that increases supply as the crypto world expands. The vast majority of the time the simple common sense answer is the truth buddy, not the conspiracy theory with zero evidence.Thinking Tether is fake was sooooo 2017 haha. I actually can't believe people are still harping on about that lol",
