  "content": "The Big Question Who Is Really At Fault?Have you noticed that whenever someone complain or there is an incident of scam they is always a role that was played by the person in that happening, either they failed to be security conscious or they were totally ignorant, and when you look at it the scammer never forced them to comply, this people willingly fell for their trick (Now to be clear I'm not saying scammers are right or saints, I'm pointing to the fact that we are responsible for ourselves, so enough of that shitty excuse, yeah the Internet would be a safer place without scammers but there are here, so deal with it)There are lots of crypto investors that are well educated, have a good job and a higher level of exposure than even most scammers, but they chose to enter into the crypto space irresponsibly and they inevitably get scammed and at times lose huge sums of money or even life savings. Last bull run there was this Elon musk swap scam that was on and someone lost 10 bitcoins to it and even other cases where people have gotten scam through crypto ads or crypto exchanges that shut down and all this would have been prevented in a way.In conclusion there are numerous experiences and stories of people getting scammed and it wasn't as tho a high class hacker went into the blockchain or stole their seed phrase, they literally gave them their money, I think no matter the new app with added security or software, people would still fall into scam as long as they chose to remain ignorant and disregard security consciousness, we can not protect anyone's holding for them, no matter how many treads on security and how to avoid scams are introduced, at the end of the day its a personal responsibility and each person must play their role in their safety.Quote from: adaseb on April 06, 2024, 04:16:04 AMWith crypto you gotta have high standards when it comes to safe guarding it. There are crazy scams all the time and so elaborate that even some bitcoin devs fall for them. It's so funny how people would be so careless in the crypto space, and you would wonder if there knew what they were doing, it's decentralization for God's sake which means you are responsible for yourself you can't go around messing with what you have; your safety is in your hands  your improvements is also in your hands I think if more people accept that it's their responsibility to protect and safeguard themselves and also filter the information they consume, we would have a reduce in the amount of scam that happens.Quote from: Churchillvv on April 05, 2024, 10:13:51 PMFirstly, I don't think there is any need for the big question in bold, here. Because obviously you're not disputing the fact that not only one plays the role in scam rather the both party does. It's very much obvious that both the scammers and the scammed plays a very big role in every scam case but the fact that this scammers are just so greed not to go work for their own money rather prefer to take from people who have worked for themselves, that's the only place I blame this scammers hence, I thing the people scammed in the crypto space especially with the Ponzi scheme scam are truly at fault for there lost coins. Greed plays a major role in this scam case most victims are very greedy to the extent of risking their money to get more with someone who you don't even know. It's just poor to see such scenarios but it's true that both party plays a very big role in every scam, but we pray circumstances don't befall us hence we could be save in the crypto space, because for sure there is no 100% safe place in the internet. Yeah they played a big role in fooling you and also held your hands and forces you to send your bitcoin to them, then you go around screaming I was scammed, doesn't that sound lame to you, the truth is that your were ignorant, careless and failed to be security conscious, yeah your so busy crying out for decentralization and most you don't know what that really means, you in fucking control, no one is responsible for you but yourself, and scammers know that and that's why they exploit the shit out of you, if it's so fun been ignorant your free and can continue blaming the mirror for showing you how ugly you are than applying some make up.If more people realise that decentralized systems isn't like a banking or centralized system were you can go and report a transaction and they seize the persons money or track the person( although its possible if they are not smart enough) then you would be more careful when doing deals here.",

      "body": "Well, when all those kinds of ugly incidents happen, there is no need to start casting blame to who is at fault and who is not at fault, there is no one who is above the mistake. The fact is that little mistakes can lead to great or little damage to one's security, and if the person doesn't act fast, they may lose all or some of their assets. No matter any situation of scam, the victim can already tell if it's their fault or not, and once they have discovered it's their fault, they will learn from such mistakes, living by them and never allowing themselves to repeat such mistakes again because if such a situation repeats itself, then it will be counted as foolishness and no longer a mistake. What usually leads to some people becoming victims of scammers is a lack of awareness, a lack of proper orientation about security, carelessness, etc. Like people would say, \"one thing leads to another.\" Some might not be properly oriented about something, and when they fall victim to scammers, it becomes their fault.",

We cannot blame them since they did not force us to give them our money or information related to our wallets. They only try their luck in the form of traps, and most people who get scammed fall for it.People who are new to cryptocurrency are mostly eager to invest due to FOMO; as a result, they skip the learning process and begin to complain when they get scammed.Newbies need to have patience and learn before starting any form of crypto investment because it is risky. They can lose money to scammers with just a single mistake, so newbies should hold on to learn first before anything.",

A great example here is bitconnect, but also many other scam projects that were invented to such value out of bitcoin, like BSV. If you buy and hold these coins you are to blame. Every coin has 2 sides though and there are scams that were supposed to be legit companies like FTX and many other failed exchanges (Gox, Quadriga). I don't think you can blame the client for using a popular exchange that looks legit, sponsors celebrities and events and has been around for years. In such case I blame the fraudster for fooling everyone. Some of you will say that you should always keep your coins in your wallet and centralized exchanges are a vulnerability and that's true, but you can't expect everyone to withdraw instantly. People will leave coins on exchanges for 24 hours and consider it a fast and safe trade. What if you're unlucky and that's when the exchange collapses? Gox at first was delaying withdrawals for weeks, so it's not like you could exit at any moment.",

As said by other members, they have manipulative approaches and they will trick you in ways that you wouldn't understand that you are getting scammed. I know you can prevent that from happening if you have had similar encounters in the past, but if it's your first time and you don't see anything shady at that moment, you are most likely going to fall for it. And remember, a third person would know it's a scam if they are told but when a person is stuck in such a situation, they won't be able to easily identify that they are getting scammed.Scammers are expert in their craft, and you would know it when you face it yourself. I was once getting scammed on Telegram. I was working with an agency, the scammer contacted me as the head of our team, and believe me, he had set his account in such a way that you wouldn't even realize that it is someone else. He asked me to lend him some money because he isn't able to access his account at that moment. I almost fell for it until I realized I already had an open chat window with the guy and it is not him.The point is, they make situations where it becomes difficult for you to evaluate what's happening quickly, and by the time you realize that, they have already done their work and there is nothing you can do after that point.",
