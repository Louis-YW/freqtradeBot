This is the price of using Bitcoin to receive payment, You can earn more or less once you convert your Bitcoin to fiat when you already need it.",

We use it as it comes, we get paid in Bitcoin, Litecoin, USDT all currencies which are most favoured by clients. If you receive salary in bitcoin or any cryptocurrency, I think the best option is to have an agreement based on usd value for your work. For example instead of asking for 0.1bitcoin per month you could negotiate for $3000 worth of bitcoins/month, this way you don’t have to worry about the market fluctuations. All this is pointless if you’re just going to sell all the bitcoins for usd.

If you provide services on this forum, then I guess 90% of your income will be in BTC or altcoins, so it all depends on where you offer your services.As for fees, it's rare that on-chain fees for Bitcoin are higher than usual, but if it's not about microtransactions, then no one should have a problem paying a few $ for a transaction that has a value of a few hundred $. Alternatives can always be some altcoins, even those that have a 0% fee - although one should not lose sight of the security of such transactions when it comes to the number of confirmations on the network. For Bitcoin, 1 confirmation is usually enough, while for most altcoins, this number increases significantly.",

Any other crypto an agreement is made on a fixed fiat value. For example if the fiat value agreed is $50 then the equivalent value Satoshi value would be paid regardless of the fluctuating Bitcoin price. The same condition applies for other crypto. It is not that complicated as the OP made it look like. There is zero complications when getting paid in Bitcoin. The only issue is that the recipient has to bear the transaction charges. At store they use the same method but the sender has to pay the fee. Cheers!",

When you agree to receive a certain amount of bitcoin let say 0.02Btc you will always be paid that amount and it will be converted to the equivalent amount in dollar on your wallet so where is the need to constantly check whenever bitcoin price rises or drops.And OP if you are worried about bitcoin volatility that your payment will drop when bitcoins price drops then you should rather stick to receiving Fiat as payment so you don’t get worked up checking your payment constantly.

There is a general board here for service,which you should have posted your service there in English so that more people will understand what you gat to offer. Who knows someone might even need your service now that is not Spanish. I will advice you to write it in English and put it on the general service board if you are really looking for someone you want to render your service to. You should also remember that it isn't everyone that will accept to pay in bitcoin or Litecoin,you should ask for payment in USD and use it to buy bitcoin or Litecoin. Instead of looking for who must pay you in cryprocurrency. In my country nobody will need your service if you want payment in crypto because it is restricted by the government",
