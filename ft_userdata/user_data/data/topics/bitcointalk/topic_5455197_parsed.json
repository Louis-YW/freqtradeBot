We should stop going with these debates because it's pointless and what's the sense of having a space that's dominated by men when the time will come that there will be a lot of women in it already I am pretty sure that they're increasing over time. I think this may take time until people will stop over these arguments because even in other things, there's always the comparison about being dominated by males or females. Or whoever makes these articles just had it so that they've got something to present into their own audiences as a topic and content.",

Bitcoin is private and decentralized, no many data can be collected to accurately tell us the percentage of woman and men adopting bitcoin. All I can say is that bitcoin is being used by many females I know, it has to continue that way and many will get to know about it yearly. But men tends to understand investment more than woman and have the mind for it more. This thought can be the only reason bitcoin is more used and adopted by the men but women are actively involves all the same.",

What's the purpose of bringing the discussion?You see, people converge into areas that they like or have an interest in it, and it's the freedom of choice that leads to the different proportions of males and females in the field. As so there are more female nurses in the healthcare industry, so what?Quote from: Bruce4 on June 05, 2023, 05:17:13 PMBitcoin is free for anyone to adopt yet they still say it's because of the \"patriarchy\" that there's no females involved in bitcoin.Just ignore the left b.s. cause it's good to have freedom of choice.Male/female proportion is never an issue, especially in Bitcoin when anyone can download a wallet and buy it from exchanges (or mine it, whatever).",

The fact that some field of interest is dominated by men doesn't mean it's mens fault and no-one is even saying that. Quit trying to be victimized.When majority of the whole cryptocurrency scene, holders, miners, devs, and thought leaders are men, the field is dominated by men. Dominating in a sentence is not a curse word that you should feel shamed about, it's a fact.Reason why men are dominating the playfield in bitcoin scene, is like you said, women are not that interested in general. That doesn't mean there's not women investing in it or developing it, because there are. And there will most likely be more in the future.",

Bitcoin is a digital currency and has no sex restrictions,what matter is how you understand bitcoin and believe in it before you can be part of the bitcoin community. Females are weak vessels and depends on male for everything,we makes them don't see risk taking as an advantage to hit it big. Females are not ready to sacrifice their time and resources to invest because they don't see any reason for that or I will say that they have the low mentality of making decisions because they only think in one direction. All these put together will make the number of female less in the bitcoin community.",
