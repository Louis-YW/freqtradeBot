      "body": "With my practical knowledge of inflation and investments in assets like Bitcoin, I advise you to invest when there is a good and obvious reason for a bull run and be sure to let your technical chart confirms it on the higher timeframes before taking action.Specifically, halving is a Bitcoin tradition that has had a track record of influencing Bitcoin in the past with no regard for the prevailing inflation (obvious reason). This same thing will most likely happen in the coming halving and even happen significantly more especially this time that people are more aware of the opportunity, and money will flow in. Bitcoin will spike higher within months irrespective of the status of inflation.And like I always warn, people should stop making links between inflation and Bitcoin, they should rather view it as an asset and as an investment opportunity. In my own studies, Bitcoin and Inflation don't just relate proportionally as it could fall or rise during inflation. Just own your coin when we are in the bullish season, and you might also want to divest when we are in the bearish season.",

Bitcoin market and its effect is uncertain and doesn’t have a general guide that’ll determine what will happen next to bitcoin price. Talking about low interest rate having an effect on the price surge in the last halving, it could not be the same this time again or what we expect won’t turn out to be so. Since the inception of bitcoin, this is a trend that at every halving, the price of bitcoin will increase and it is still following that pattern and I don’t think even in the next halving there is going be an exception to that. Bitcoin will surge again in price with either low or high interest rates.",

Can anyone explain how interest rates influenced the past halving's impact on bitcoin's price and whether this could challenge the expectations of a price increase in the next halving?Low-interest rate increases the money supply and decreases the price for individual and business borrowing increasing economic activities. When this happens individuals and corporate bodies have more money to invest in cryptocurrencies and other areas. High-interest rate force investors to focus on fixed-income investments or safe-haven assets such as government bonds. In recent times there has been a correlation between the price of bitcoin and the US interest rate but this relationship is weak. But low-interest rate is not the only factor that contributes to the increase in the price of bitcoin during halving so I don't expect it to greatly affect the increase of the price of bitcoin during the season.",

Can anyone explain how interest rates influenced the past halving's impact on bitcoin's price and whether this could challenge the expectations of a price increase in the next halving?There are few major factors you need to watch out for that will create a massive surge in price after the halving ... Just hope they happen simultaneously during the halving period:1. The promotion of Bitcoin by very influential people. This is needed to ensure that demands is strong when supply is lowered. By the way, Bitcoin bull run is nolonger influenced by worthless fundamentals such as an increase in adoption through centralized platforms/exchanges. Bullish fundamentals are those that are based on the Bitcoin ideals such as decentralization, transparency, immutablity, censorship resistant, deflation, etc. The influencers must be people who are idealistic.2. Good development in the Bitcoin space, such as an improvement in the Bitcoin Project that's very significant and useful. The improvement has to expand the utility of Bitcoin without compromising on its ideals. Again, the improvement has to be based on the Bitcoin ideals to power up the price.3. The demand for Bitcoin has to from the good side, and the demand should outweigh supply from the good side. If demand is from things that are contrary to the Bitcoin ideals, it's considered bad demand and won't have any positive effect on the price. If supply is lowered via the halving and demand remains constant, price will increase significantly because demand will be greater than supply.",

With that money most of the people start to invest in BTC or in any other thing. But if they are investing in BTC as more money is in the market then more money is going into the BTC and more BTC are being demanded but the supply remains the same.Due to which it surges up the price of BTC. But do not worry if Interest rates are not going to decrease this time but even though there are ETFs which will help BTC to surge up with more heat. Because They are keeping delaying the ETFs and i think they are doing it on purpose just to approve all of them at the right moment when BTC need ignition to the moon.",

When the rate is lowered, risk asset benefits because investors would want to borrow money from banks at a low rate and invest in assets that appreciate over time. For instance, Michael Saylor borrowed and invested in Bitcoin when the rate was zero. Generally, it has a positive influence on the market.",

      "body": "The only way I see the low interest rate benefiting Bitcoin is as a result of investors having the chance of getting a huge amount of loan that is given out to them with a lesser requirement for collateral, and the time for repayment is enough for the investors to gather up the borrowed amount without thinking about how much interest will be attached to it. Which makes it easier for them to always be able to grab a loan from the Banking sector and use such a loan to grab Bitcoin in preparation for the halving, and this buying opportunity usually increases demand, which in turn brings about price positivity.I don't think the next year's halving will have to depend on anything relating to a low interest rate before it can pull off a bull market, as it is already certain that the bull run is going to come, not exactly in the year of the halving but in the coming year after.",

The myth of Bitcoing now going below the previous ATH as busted, we had just three halvings out of which one was barely known to the entire world, so taking such a bold assumption on so little data is just taking a gamble.I see everyone here being so serious, the halving is coming so the price must go up, it's like some cult of the second halving coming of Jesus forming.

I analyze Bitcoin charts both offline and online many times a day and follow its reaction with economic data, so I didn't just jump to this conclusion. I don't also know the reason why you are comparing Bitcoin with gold because I never mentioned gold, they are not in the same asset category even though Bitcoin could give you more money when you own it. Gold is a risk-off asset, while Bitcoin is a risk-on asset based on its behaviour, so no reason to compare them.Please, refer to the response I shared with Oshosondy for the rest to avoid repetition.",
