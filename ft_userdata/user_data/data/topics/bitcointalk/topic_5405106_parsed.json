  "content": "Recently, I received complaints about trust on my mining pool https://soloblocks.ioSome users don't know how to verify if you are mining on a legit work or if I a scamming you, so I decided to spend a few times about this issue. You can apply this method of retro engineering on whatever mining pool you want.So here is a method to verify the jobs, to get the current payouts amounts and the current payouts address of the differents outputs of the current Block, from the jobs I send you via the pool (via netcat so)Here is the tutorial : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5397166.msg60503248#msg60503248I need help to implement a standalone application that does the extraction for me (don't have time, I have a side job  )As always : don't hesitate to mine on https://soloblocks.io. My goal is to stay online for the next 50 years",
