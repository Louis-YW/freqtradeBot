  "content": "I criticized Safepal many times because of their Safepal S1 closed source hardware wallet, but it looks like they decided to change direction with their new products.Safepal just released new model of open source device called Safepal X1 hardware wallet, and this can be currently pre-ordered for $70 plus shipping fees.So far we know that Safepal X1 have design that reminds a bit on calculator or on Coldcard wallet, with 12 buttons and D-pad, and it's using Bluetooth for connection as signing mechanism.There is integrated 128mAh battery with USB type C connection for charging, and secure element is included with EAL 5+ certification from unknown manufacturer.Anti-tampering self-destruct mechanism exist, and there is only wallet support for Safepal app and extension.It's funny that Safepal claims ''unlimited'' support for coins/tokens, but simple check is showing no support for monero.What can I say initially about Safepal X1 wallet is that price of $70 is not bad, but I have major problem with fact that you can't use it with Electrum or any other third party wallets.There is also a big question if their open source code is going to be verified and reproducible, and I am not impressed with only Bluetooth connection, I would prefer to have camera and airgapped. functionality.I think their main competition is Ledger Nano X, and maybe Safepal X1 is better choice because of it's price, bigger 1.8’ color screen and better battery.https://www.safepal.com/en/store/x1Safepal Blog article with more information:https://blog.safepal.com/safepal-x1-open-source-wallet-suite/",

      "body": "The device looks so ugly that it's even cute.  I have mixed feelings about the look of this.And really, why didn’t they bring the appearance to a calculator? This would make an excellent disguise for hardware wallet (make some of the calculator buttons a non-functioning dummy). Although I haven’t seen anyone with a calculator for a very long time , the functionality of which can be found in any phone. The presence of such a calculator in your hands will already be a reason to become interested in your person. The battery capacity is too small compared to other safepal wallets (128mAh, versus 400mAh and 500mAh). They could have done more by sacrificing the thickness of this device (there wouldn't be anything wrong with model X1 being a little thicker.)The phrase \"Open Source\" is a kind of marketing ploy. These statements should not be relied upon 100%.I would argue about the color screen. I am a supporter of minimalism and believe that hardware wallets don't need frills, such as a color screen, but I don’t force this opinion on anyone.",

Firstly, open-source nature, as security cannot be guaranteed without supervision. Secondly, the wallet must have been tested over several years and have a good reputation, preferably from a well-known brand. And finally, cheap is also important.Considering the above points, if I want try Safepal X1, it must be at least 3-5 years later.",

So the first condition you mentioned may never be fulfilled and you will have to look elsewhere.  According to the number of app downloads on Google Play Store, the data published by the official websites of various wallets, and the number of reviews on Amazon, I estimate that only Ledger, Trezor, and Safepal have 1 million users. Among them, only Trezor is open source. This indicates that users lack the necessary knowledge, or are ignorant. The number of users of other brands is particularly small. I estimate that the number of OneKey users is less than 300,000, the BitBox users is less than 100,000, and the Keystone users is less than 30,000. If a company's annual sales is less than 100,000, is its profit enough to maintain the operation? With too few users, the supervision will be insufficient, and it will not be safe.",
