For gambling I got a little result in performs how I gambled, my skills in gambling are very minimal so my next resolution might include to improve my skill in gambling",

But there are something that you can make that can help you. Example is to determine to do better in exam by next year. You can challenge yourself to achieve some goals in the coming year. That is just it. But in gambling, I do not think this will work unless the person has realized that gambling is not a way of making money and that is just it. This can happen at anytime. The chance that an addict can change and not gamble anymore or gambling responsibly may not be part of his new year resolution but happened just withinÂ  certain month in the new year or the next.",

And in fact what they plan is not in accordance with what they do, they promise that they will become a responsible gambler and be able to control themselves over these activities. But unfortunately that only lasted for a short period of time, after which they returned to their original behavior of \"gambling recklessly\". They really can't appreciate what they have planned before, they are never consistent to do the good habits that they have recorded in a new year's resolution.A resolution without action and consistency is just nonsense. They are only able to plan, while in practice, the results are zero percent. So in this new year's resolution, if we can't do it consistently then don't ever make too many plans. it's better that a plan is simple, but in its implementation is maximum.",

In my case, I make few changes in terms of scheduling increases in deposits, since I always maintain the minimum deposits per casino.What I do have established for 2024 is to return more frequently to the game of poker, playing at least some tournaments on the weekends, either in a crypto casino (difficult at the moment) or Fiat.Well, of course improve my earnings in 2024 in relation to 2023, play at least 2 pools in the Forum, an interesting year is coming in football.So... yeah, that idea is always latent even if we don't want it, even in the background, some thoughts are carried in expectations for the new year that it warns.",

While for those that have been dealing with such huge problem in gambling, you have to just not include that in your new year's resolution but also seek some professional help because putting that into your resolution could be forgotten by you.And while you are trying to stick yourself into some of these resolutions, it won't be enough and effective for some reasons.
