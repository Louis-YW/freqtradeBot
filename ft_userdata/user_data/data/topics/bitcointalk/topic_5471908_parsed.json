Be ready for facing robbery gangs too. Would like to hear from any forum member who may have visited the place.",

There are also public bath complexes where there are lockers, but I haven’t been to such baths for a long time.",

This is good in theory, but when you start heating the water in the pool using ASICs, you will realize that you need a lot of ASICs; the efficiency of this method of heating water will be low. In some cases, it will be more profitable to use a household water heater, because the price of Bitcoin is low and the profit is small. And in the city it is very difficult to obtain permission for large electricity consumption and the price will be at a commercial rate.",

How much heat are the miners generating which could heat the water so hot? Maybe I'm out of context but I have recently seen, (not recently but maybe few months ago) Linus tech tips aka LTT on YouTube. He was demonstrating how you can water cool your PC using your pool in the backyard. He was cooling the PC using his pool water and as he measured the heat, there was no change whatsoever. Maybe this doesn't relate to this. But they work the same way. Increase the amount of miners and you get more heat. But is it capable of heating the water to a level to be considered as hot. Also when the heat is generated, looping that same water in order to cool down those miners may not be efficient and could eventually decrease the performance by generating more heat. I don't know how they are harvesting the heat in order to heat up water. But I think it's just a theme in order to attract more people. I'm still confused about this.",

I'm still confused about this.Swimming pools differ in water volume, from a small pool with 6 cubic meters of water to large pools in bath complexes with 30 cubic meters of water or more. For each pool it is necessary to make a calculation of the necessary equipment. The ideal option is not to use a radiator, but chlorinated water is most likely not suitable for cooling ASICs, unless they have special tubes.",

But my question is what's the size of the pool or whatever it is in that spa in New York? Also, how are they harvesting the heat in order to make the water hot? If you use water cooling, then the same water keeps on looping and if the water itself is hot then how is that helping it to be cooled down? Either they are taking that heat to heat up the water somehow or it could be a double tubing process. One go straight to the water making it hot, and another tube is providing with cold water making the miners cold. But it is also still not convincing. When you are supplying two types of water one of them being cold another one is hot, doesn't it eventually get averaged in a single temperature? Maybe they are doing something in a way that I don't understand or maybe I'm just dumb. I don't know man, I'm still confused.",

Let's persuade philipma1957 to go to the Bitcoin spa  I looked at the price of electricity in New York and it is more than 15 cents there. I don’t think this is a lie, but this heating installation is more of an advertising nature than an industrial one. I think the easiest way is to use radiators because it's easier. And the operation of the installation itself does not have much effect.",

I don’t think this is a lie, but this heating installation is more of an advertising nature than an industrial one. I think the easiest way is to use radiators because it's easier. And the operation of the installation itself does not have much effect.So out of curiosity, I did some research on this and not much information is out there. I came across this video on YouTube Bathhouse and Bitcoin. They submerge the whole mining ring in a biodegradable liquid which is non-conductive to electricity but does absorb heat. Then it is directly sent to the pool. And new fluid is added when the old hot fluid has been transferred to the pool. I got confused because the video I saw on LTT YouTube channel was using water cooling through tubes and looping the same water over and over. But this is totally different from what I have imagined. Even it seems legit, I'm still not convinced that the amount of heat generated from Bitcoin miners could heat up an entire pool. When the water is exposed to the weather, it will cool down faster because of wind. It is more like an advertisement to attract people and show some uniqueness to their business. It is a fantastic marketing idea and they have done it very well. But Bitcoin miners heating up a pool is still not 100% accurate.",

I am sure that the cooling of this liquid and heating of the pool occurs through a heat exchanger. The disadvantage of immersion liquid is that it is not cheap. If you swim in such a liquid, its composition may change.",

While those of us in the bitcoin and mining community was excited and happy about it because of our we believed that it was a symbiotic relationship where both parties benefit, that is utilizing the heat generated from Bitcoin mining was beneficial to both parties, the other side of the arguments from folks who didn't get it was environmental concern. I always point them to well-researched articles that puts their arguments to rest. These materials helped shed light on the nuanced aspects of Bitcoin mining, addressing environmental concerns and offering a more comprehensive understanding of the situation.",
