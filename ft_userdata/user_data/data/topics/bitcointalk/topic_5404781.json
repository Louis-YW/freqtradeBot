  "content": "Hi Dear Community,IntroI want to know about BTT app because as much i know the platform is working from Intial age of BTC and greatly motive was to bring all Crypto community for Better dealings then it was developed and with time Local boards deveoped and sub forums came in being.But why there is no proper application for Smartphone and Desktop users as it helps more.Why APP needed ?Due to regular visit opening browser and then login in to the Site consume time that not a big deal by the way still, if there will be and application then Bitcointalk can be accessible by more users and that will boost the Experience. Anytime acces will be available.That will be more secure as my perspective due to no third party Browser involvement.Better User InterfaceIn the 2022 everything is user friendly and every platform targeting the audience always preffer to focus the UI to attract users, BTT has a Decent clean UI no colors and Heavy Graphics which makes scense as BTT is Database oriented. Still BTT has impressive active users. Some of Bounty Related Reason also involved still there are some rare users with Knowledge proper own Setups thats another thing.Applications are more preffered then Website platforms in Regular Utility.Everything has drawbacks apps can contain bugs but that can be improved i know that idea will be already experienced as platform running from time but i think Application should be considered. A random Question to ask that When Platform is going to be upgraded.",

Even if it would be provided, it can follow new forum software, but I do not think it is necessary.",

I have no need for it and wouldn't use one even if it was available. I browse the forum exclusively via desktop devices. I have posted on the forum with my phone maybe 5 times in all these years. But I understand that many people use phones exclusively and it would be a much more pleasant experience if they can have a nicely optimized app for that.
