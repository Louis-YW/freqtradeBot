You wrote about many of the tragedies that occurred in the crypto journey, but if you wrote about crime and fraud in other ecosystems (like FIAT), you might need to write more than 1000 words.There is always a risk in every action, and crypto is one that has a high risk. Honestly, for now I prefer bitcoin, crypto in general has thousands of altcoins in it and most of the losers are those who invested in alts. So, from now on buy bitcoin, even though bitcoin also has risks, bitcoin is still the safest. AFAIK",

But, it's obvious that people easily forget about these scams, especially the newbies who was not affected by the previous ones. The cryptocurrency bull run is known for being attractive to fresh investors. These people do no research about what they're holding or investing into. That's the cause of having multiple victims, whenever centralize platforms shut down or go bankrupt. The market gains enormous amount of investors, but lose them to scam projects. And they'll never come to invest into bitcoin anymore. It's the disadvantage of lacking research ability as an investor.  The market, to retain existing investors, also need to remind  them, about such mistakes. Just like Op did, with this thread. For most, it's hard to resist some scam during the bear or bull market. Aside that, being in charge of their money and holding private keys is a crucial reminder, that shouldn't be on snooze. Else, the market will suffer from lack of investors, unlike in the past. Whooping amounts of money ranging at billions of dollars lost to hackers, is affecting negatively the speed of bitcoin's growth. Which occurrence, is powered by the carelessness of bitcoin community members; investors, traders etc. Those exchanges are vulnerable to hackers, added to the fact that their owners are greedy. Possessing hundreds of millions in dollars, is tempting. Hence, it's our duty as bitcoin users and investors, not to put the temptation of messing with our funds on the CEOs of different crypto platforms. Since it's strenuous to manage people, only a few follow due instructions. Those that like reading bitcoin docs have high chances of not becoming victims. The rest that utilize bitcoin their own way, without care and control, will have themselves to blame.",

There’s a warning sign all over this project which dumb user ignored. While FTX, Luna and other exit scam project took us by surprise since they offer legitimate service with good liquidity until they pull off the exit scam. But all this exit scam now and in the past can be avoided if we are sensitive and very thorough on every news regarding the project we are investing because all of them has a window of opportunity to exit early with less lose since most of them pump hard from its original value before they become scam which you will still be in profit if you believe on the early warnings about this projects.",
