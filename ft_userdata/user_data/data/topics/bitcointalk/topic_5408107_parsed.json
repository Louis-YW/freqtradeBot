This is straight-up the rarest Casascius coin out there that isn't loaded with 1,000 BTC.https://auctions.stacksbowers.com/lots/view/3-XS9GA",

My understanding is that these issues were mainly present with the later Microsoul coins, and with some 0.05 BTC's - though the risk remains for 2013 0.01's. That said, the Microsoul coins o S&B are confirmed loaded as per the public key, which means that 0.01 BTC was placed into the corresponding address and remains there. Whether or not the private key is readable cannot be confirmed without peeling, but the balance of probabilities suggests that they are redeemable. That said, if we had a way of knowing which coins were un-redeemable \"errors\", I  suspect that their collector value would be much higher. In practice it is unlikely we will ever know, as there is almost no reason to peel a Microsoul anymore as the Numismatic value is many times more than the funded value, and the \"errors\" are likely a very small percentage of what's out there.",

In my opinion by not letting people know the issue, or potential issues that lies within Microsoul coins is wrong. You’re leaving out material information that’s important to know when purchasing these coins. Maybe bitcoin shoots to a million bucks one day, the peel value of the coins will be pretty high. You never know. Plus maybe the person who buys it will simply need the money at some point regardless of how little the redeemable value is. Regardless, this should not be considered in to the equation. So selling coins while omitting these material facts I believe to be wrong and somewhat fraudulent.  The last thing we need is someone buying one, a coin not being redeemable even though it says it was in the listing, then they complain to Stacks about it.  I could easily see them then say that they don’t want to have to deal with this situation ever again and no longer will offer them. This link with the information about the potential issues with the coin should be included in the sale ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3315347.0 ).   Something like this is all it could take to ruin things for everyone going forward. IMO MinerJones should be doing the authentication for Stacks. A true expert.",
