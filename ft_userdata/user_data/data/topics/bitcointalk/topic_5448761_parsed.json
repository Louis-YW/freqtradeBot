  "content": "Risk assets such as cryptocurrencies and stocks  has had a positive performance since early 2023 as a result of a merging of various factors such as oversold conditions and decelerating inflations. The upward momentum may be a resultant effect of many investors taking short positions in these assetsIn the cryptocurrencies sphere, the best performers since January have been Decentraland (MANA), Solana (SOL), and Enjin (ENJ). This trend is specifically notable since it shows that the recent rally in the crypto market has gone beyond just Bitcoin and has encompassed a wider range of digital assets.The meeting of the Federal Reserve is one possible explanation for this upsurge in cryptocurrencies. Traders have been cautiously waiting, hoping to the see the direction of wind blow after the meeting. The expected minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) could provide a boost to the market, but any surprises could potentially cause it to give up its recent gains.The upward trend of cryptocurrency market capitalization, which has seen it grow by over 25%, can be associated with numerous macroeconomic factors such as weakening dollar, slow decline in liquidity conditions and slowing inflation. The analysis concludes that bitcoin was in an oversold territory and the macro incentives  further led to the recent price rise.Looking into the details, the December Conumer Price Index (CPI) data, which was published on 12 January 2023, fell from 0.1% from the previous month, reaching its lowest in almost a year. This deceleration is mainly due to the broader energy category, which saw a 4.5% seasonally adjusted drop from the prior month. Again, softening of inflation with  the stabilization of unemployment rates eased investors' view that the Fed may be close the hiking cycle. It's noteworthy that China's cessation of the zero-covid policy  also helped spur economic growth in 2023 and beyond.https://www.seba.swiss/research/from-bear-to-bull-cryptos-resurgence",

      "body": "Well today alone Bitcoin made up of $700 from 30K to 30.700 crazy right stock is volatile but crypto is twice of the volatile. It is high risk high return but you need a lot of knowledge and better emotion control and like always Know when to take profit know when to stop losses. for now enjoy the little bit of profit when you bought at 15-17K level. and accumulate more when the price having a correction",
