Regardless of they cooked their reports, I think they have good treasuries for Tether USD.However, in cryptocurrency, things can change very fast and we don't know how Tether USDT will change in future. If you want to store your capital in stable coin, I don't think it is safe to store all your capital in only Tether USDT. You can choose some other stable coins to store your capital like BUSD (Binance USD), USDC together with Tether USD.Decentralize risk of bankruptcy from one stable coin by this way.",

Thanks in advance for more experienced folks for sharing their insight! I do not like usdt due to lack of transparency, if I remember correctly according to their own whitepaper if something does happen they can give you another coin or something \"equal\" of value to replace your usdt. I never heard of any problems with people using and withdrawing USDT even when withdrawing billions and cashing out in small spaces in time but that 100% doesn't mean it won't happen in the future but who knows time will tell. I personally like USDC, they have a fully reserved stablecoin. Each USDC is backed cash.",

The death of FTX was their own mistake, no one harmed them, so there is no reason to say that Binance will collapse like FTX. But if talking about the stablecoin market, I would say that none is safer than the other, all are centralized, and all are in danger of collapsing at any moment. Many people doubt USDT including OP, but if you check the capitalization and popularity, USDT is still at the top, still the most used.",

However if we want adoption we need to deal with pretty high level of centralization involved and some people don't like it. The fact that usdt is 100% backed, but not all of them are backed with usd is somewhat troublesome, but even in case of a bank run everyone would eventually get their dollars. And that's not the case even with real BANKS so i am thinking people are overreacting. Many of the fudders seem to came from a time when bitfinex got hacked and didn't like the way Ifinex dealed wih that. And since iFinex Inc owns Tether i think they just wanted to hurt them.Quote from: ryzaadit on February 09, 2023, 08:49:34 AM-cut-1.
