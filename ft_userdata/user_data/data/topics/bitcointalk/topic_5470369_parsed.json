The precautions should be related to installed operating system mostly.The wallet software should be installed on a freshly installed copy of an operating system (Linux the best choice,) and once everything is done in the best way e.g wallet software installation, wallet generation, and wallet private key + seed phrase generation and saving those on multiple storage options, then the user should get the address and send Bitcoin into that address and completely cut out the internet from that system. That's the best way to Hodl Bitcoin and a user doesn't need to worry about hackers if he/she has done the steps in the best way possible.",

Bitcoin being open-source means that the code is available to the public. That doesn't mean everyone can know you have bitcoin.Anyways, as you worry about your privacy: 1. Don't reuse addresses and give a new address to any one who wants to send you bitcoin.2. Use Coin control. With spending multiple UTXO(s) in the same transaction, you may ham your privacy and that's why you should use coin control. 3. Don't use block explorers or SPV wallets with your real IP address. You can even run your own node, so that you don't rely on nodes run by third parties when you want to check your balance or broadcast a transaction.",

For instance assuming you have multiple Bitcoin wallets and a particular HODLING wallet which you fund using the other wallets(the multiple wallets), using block chain explorers to inspect the transaction history of the other wallets will give a trace to the hodling wallet and therefore give someone the ability to monitor the assets in your HODLING wallet .How then can this problem be solved? Of course someone may suggest Using mixers to run the transactions how ever is there any other alternative way of moving funds to a hodling wallet from other wallets without any trace?Well other than using a mixer and conjoin feature you can use the Monero or Zcash tokens to obfuscate your transactions. But in short what actually happens in Monero and Zcash is, mixing. Like you have to convert BTC to XMR and use the XMR built-in mixing service to obfuscate the transactions, once you receive the obfuscated funds (XMR) then you can convert them back into BTC. So you must be thinking about what really makes them both unique from each other. The simplest difference is, that XMR has its own features while the Mixers you will use are third parties, secondly, XMR works as an integral part of the blockchain and mixes transactions by using enhanced security that cannot be reversed easily, and the TXs with XMR are totally private. I hope it would be of some help to you.Quote from: Mia Chloe on October 14, 2023, 08:34:42 PMAlso I would like to understand more about how mixers work so I will appreciate any summarized explanation or any article on mixing.I can mention tens of threads here, but the best way for you to understand the functioning of mixers is to go check all the review compaigns run till now, and check all the reviews written by expereinced users and then you will be able to understand what actually happens in Mixers. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5106873.0All you need to know about Mixer before using itQuote from: BitcoinBarrel on October 14, 2023, 08:38:37 PMYou can generate an address offline and send funds there.So by doing that, and sending fund from one wallet to this address, will it not be traced using any explorer.

It's true that they can use blockchain to track the transaction and see the wallet that holds the most of the coin, but what they cannot do is know that you (Mia Chloe) are the real person who has the wallet. What you should be more concerned about is the security of your wallet and your privacy. I mean, the security of your cold wallet should be taken seriously, plus the fact that you should learn not to reveal your privacy informations through KYC. Since it's a cold wallet, you don't need to always log it online.On blockchain technology, every transaction is transparent because you can know which wallet received or sent the coin, but you cannot get the identity of the person who carried out the transaction. It is not a problem; that's how technology was designed.",

If you use a mixing service or Whirlpool, the trace of your transactions will be greatly hidden.if this happens, unless you provide your data to CEX, it will not know your name, but will determine that it belongs to you.",

They are cheap to use and readily available. So to me, I will suggest you continue using mixers to get clean Bitcoin without being worried about being monitored. There are several mixers in the services announcement section of the forum. You can check the thread for Sinbad mixer to understand in detail how it works. Alternatively,  you can visit sinbad.io and you will see all the information you need. It is pretty easy and straightforward.",

The two are not related. In other words even if you have zero privacy (eg. posting all your addresses with your driver's license on the internet) your coins can still not be stolen (unless they find and physically attack you!).So if you create a cold storage properly, your coins will remain safe.Now if you want to improve your privacy, there are many ways to do it. For example you could start running your own full node where you only import your addresses (without private keys) to create a watch only wallet. You could also run the node through Tor to even further increase your privacy.Mixers are an entirely different matter. It is an option to use when you have coins that you want to be \"mixed\" so that the link between the new coins you receive and the old coins you had is severed.",

Regarding the mixer service used to obscure traces, there are also limitations in the number of transactions [large and small].For me, the first step is to choose the best wallet that is open source and maintain it well, such as making several offline backups.Second, be careful in public spaces.Third, Multisign.Fourth, use other tools to hide the IP address of the device used such as using Tor.CMIIW",
