I remember when I deleted a phone audio recording on my Android phone, I used an app (but I do not remember the exact one) to recover many videos, audios, photos and files that I had deleted long time ago. Those files can still be recovered until certain period of time, but not when you formatted (hard reset) your phone. Although, I couldn't get hold of the call recording I was looking for, but there were a lot that were recovered which I had deleted long time ago.",

Both of these things simply delete the pointers to your the data, telling your phone or other device that these sectors are now free to be used for other purposes. But unless you actually write something else to these sectors, the data on them is not deleted and can be recovered, even after a hard reset. This is the basis behind the specialized apps that BitMaxz mentions above - to actually overwrite all your sensitive data in these sectors with junk data, meaning it cannot be recovered. Quote from: SodaOak on September 27, 2022, 01:44:39 PMI have used my phone to store sensitive information like in PDF format or TXT files that consist of recovery seedsWhy would you ever do this? Seed phrases should be stored offline using pen and paper. If you must store them electronically, then they should be stored encrypted on airgapped devices. Storing them in plain text on a phone is a recipe for disaster, even worse if your phone then automatically backs them up to the cloud or similar.",

      "body": "Not only is it completely unreasonable to use smartphones as a storage for some sensitive information and then be afraid that we will lose the device or someone will steal it - but it should be taken into account that at some point that device will very likely end up in the trash or we will sell it, and then someone will try to extract everything that is in the storage of such devices.That's why I personally never throw away old phones, memory cards or hard drives - because it's not something that takes up a lot of space. In case you really want to destroy them, take out the battery and break them into pieces, then set them on fire in a safe way. After that, you can be sure that the data has been destroyed.",

Never save recovery seed words in any digital format on any devices, that applies for both phone and for computer, especially if they are connected to internet.Even if you format hard drive there is a chance of having leftovers, stuff that can be recovered, or someone could steal this data before formating.It's much safer to use simple paper to write words with pen, or you can use stainless steel metal if you want more protection from elements.",

Except that the target of someone stole your phone is to really access your documents through your phone, the possiblity is there to recover all the necessary information if it's desperat.

Maybe they won't think about it because of how much they get from buying and selling devices.However it will be different if:- The thief is someone who knows you, knows that your phone is used and contains important things so he will find a way to recover some data- Or if someone deliberately wants to know various files or data from previous users of phones.If that's the case, it's risky",

I have not heard of it that phone was stolen and the phone which was formatted, later the files were recovered. I have not even heard that lost files in phone can be recovered. But BitMaxz explanation is very nice. But if it is hdd, I know that it can be recovered because there is an recovery software. The last time I used factory reset method to format the phone because I forgot the screen lock password, after formating the phone, and I was thinking that the password would wiped out but it was a surprised for me that the password was still inside which the phone was still locked so I have to to the phone a mobile phone repairer. And I paid for the service and format the phone with a laptop. And I told him to recover my files but he told me that the process is too combasome I would have to pay extra fee so I just left it and install the necessary apps back.",

Some thief would ask expert help to bypass the screen lock so they could sell stolen phone at higher price and also copy all file/data or see installed application while they're at it.There are so many tutorials on how to unlock a phone lock that today almost anyone can do it without the help of an expert, although you should always be careful because there are a lot of software that are used for that purpose, and apart from being malicious, any such procedure can brick the phone. Also, many people today use facial recognition unlocking, which, like fingerprint unlocking, can be misused when a person is asleep or unaware of their actions. This is just one more reason that we do not consider these types of protection to be safe.",

What if the phone is an iphone, I think the security of that is a bit more higher compared to android phones.Since iOS 12 the trick of formatted data that wasn't written on it doesn't work anymore because of how APFS works, once the file is deleted the key is also, plus a long time ago iOS started encrypting the file system with a second key based on the first lock in user. So once you erase it with \"erase Iphone\" there is no way for someone to actually read the data even if recoverable, the only way to do it is from your backup.That doesn't mean you should use your Iphone to store your keys either.Quote from: Lucius on September 27, 2022, 03:31:08 PMThat's why I personally never throw away old phones, memory cards or hard drives - because it's not something that takes up a lot of space.
