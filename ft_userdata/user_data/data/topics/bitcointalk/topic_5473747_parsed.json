  "content": "Last week was highly anticipated for Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasts, as it saw the price surge above levels not seen in over a year. Taking a look at the moving averages, the MA-20 (in red) has shown significant strength compared to the MA-50 (in orange) and has managed to avoid any negative trends this month. This suggests a positive sentiment for the world's largest digital asset.On the technical front, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is poised for a potential move into the overbought territory. This might lead to profit-taking as BTC could reach new yearly highs once again.This bullish momentum, breaking through the $35,000 mark, is largely attributed to the growing optimism surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF by the SEC. Overall, the next targets for BTC can be placed at $36,000 and $38,000, respectively. In case of profit booking momentum, support levels can be placed at $33,000 and $30,000, respectively.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is really struggling to break the $38,000 price point. I will not stay bullish on Bitcoin for long. If it's unable to break the target, then it could eventually go down. I'm not so good at market analysis but it does seem like a hanging man pattern on the daily chart. From my analysis, it's going to go down and then push back up again maybe about in a week or two. And if it is unable to break the target point again then it will take more time to become bullish again. I'm out of the market for a bit and I don't know about what trend and news are spreading on the internet about Bitcoin. Any good news can push Bitcoin to break the target point and become more bullish or a total opposite could happen. If your investment plan is for a long-term, then it is better to hold and not think about this small movements.",

      "body": "Your post is better situated in the speculation board than bitcoin discussion.This is a great analysis that is currently surrounding the bitcoin market now. The momentum and anticipation of the bitcoin ETF is what has been fueling the increase in price of bitcoin recently and we might see a downtrend if bitcoin ETF isn’t approved by end of the year. That time will be the last time for those who haven’t invested a considerable amount in BTC or haven’t invested at all to get into the market. If for any reason the Bitcoin ETF gets approved, the market will continue in an upward direction until the time of the halving and eventually bull run.",

Currently bitcoin is priced at $36k so expect if the market continuous to be bullish, then we can hit $40k-$45k just this month. Aside that good things happen at the last quarter of the year, the pressure that is created with the expected Bitcoin ETF approval and the upcoming bitcoin halving is high that's why I can't help but to stay optimistic with the future prices of bitcoin. And for sure a lot would agree to this.However, while the volatility factor of bitcoin remains, we may expect for some price decline but most likely its only a preparation of the market before bitcoin price skyrocket again and reach a new price resistance or a new all time high.",

Although the momentum in bitcoin is so strong that we can move straight up without retrace, but such moves are usually unsustainable and not considered good ones.Also for the bull run to commence, a healthy correction is needed. We don't want to get too much in the over sold territory. The higher we go without retracement and testing lower levels , the bigger will be the dump.",

Now the halving in 2024 is different because Bitcoin is already at a high point, perhaps more than $40,000. That's the starting point. So when the effect of the halving starts to reflect on the price, it would only need to double and a little more to hit $100,000.",
