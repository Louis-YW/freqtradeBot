Infact, the idea is the first step to proper restructuring of the country that we all clamor for. Meanwhile, if we get a leader like sai baba, with the intentions to restructure the nation; it can also be done by making the arms of government follow the executive orders just as sai baba as done over the last 7 years. Also, unemployment is not just about control of resources; the nation needs to implement policies that help people grow.How?Revoke the high import taxRevoke the border closure lawRevoke the excessive income and utility taxManager Monetary policies well and stop meffy from printing naira every time he is hornyThere are lots more, make God help man survive this clueless contri",

You sound like someone that didn't brought up from dis Naija, as long all those old men that have different companies in Nigeria and other countries are still alive, no matter what you do to improve the country, dey will surely make ur government ungovernable for u bcos dey have more political influence both Nigeria and other countries too. Once our vote start counting genuinely in every election, I guess ur idea will bring a good result in ur government.",

As you dey see ba, you go think say you fit achieve all this things if you become president but unfortunately you can’t do it. Doing something like that have to pass many protocols and has to be agreed by the National Assembly always. As the president, you can only bring forth projects but the National Assembly members have the final say either to accept or reject it.",
