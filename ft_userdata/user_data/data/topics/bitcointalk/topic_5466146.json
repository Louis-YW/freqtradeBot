Holding and owning Bitcoin isn't easy, you need to know how to manage, secure and deal with the risks involved during this process of acquiring Bitcoin.",

I do not think I have ever met such a person in this area.  Jokes aside, I believe un_rank's point is spot on. Once you achieve a goal, it is a good idea to set yourself a new one.",

It’s like ranking up in bitcointalk, Legendary is the highest rank and the ultimate goal for a beginner but we set little goals like reaching full member and immediately our eyes on the next rank when we get there. That’s my opinion btw, some people goal may be to have a certain amount of bitcoin that will be enough for them to buy a boat and retire to the Bahamas. I wonder what your bitcoin goal is that you have come very close to achieving in such a short period.",

Take what hatchy explained where you will focus on getting more Bitcoin even though you already have achieved your goal like getting Bitcoin (certain amount) and you will get more what you have planned already.

If you have reached reached your Bitcoin goal what did you do after then?It is important to know the reason why are you accumulating Bitcoin.  Since you have set your target then if you know the reason behind this accumulation, you can answer the next question.Most of us are accumulating for profit and when it comes to profit we want it to be cyclical.  So my answer would be that when I hit my target amount of BTC, I will wait for the target selling price to realize and sell my holdings.  Then rinse and repeat.  I would put some of the profit into creating a business to diversify.  Since my strategy in profiting in Bitcoin takes a long time, it is good to have a business that can give us profit regularly.",

If you have reached reached your Bitcoin goal what did you do after then? Always know that bitcoin is not the only potential investments in the market. You could start a new goal through acquiring some real estate or invest in gold. For me, that’s probably my next in line when I come to maximize my bitcoin investment. Although I believe that bitcoin investment has no end, so if you can also add more investments to it, then that will definitely make your life more valuable and meaningful to live with.",

But when the time comes that I’m already in good profits with bitcoin, then I would also love to venture on buying properties like apartments so I can have my passive income as well as bitcoin investment may not be considered a passive income.",

We are all happy for you and, for your question, it is good to get more assets because, since we are still alive and we have children and families, it is better to achieve more than spending the once we have achieved. Besides, if I have achieved what I wanted from Bitcoin, I will still invest in it for my children's sake so they can inherit it in the future to come, and I will also invest in other things like real estate.. . . Someone like me, even if I have 10 BTC, I will still accumulate more. Because I am not content with that as long as I am profiting, the only thing that can make me quit from investing in Bitcoin is if I have lost more than a million dollars in it. Although I will not be totally discouraged about the investment, I will use another analysis for my investment.",

That's how it goes usually after hitting the goal that we were able to set before. I have reached a few of the goals that I was able to set but it doesn't end there. Because like what you've said, we can renew it if we want to and be the better version of it and prove to ourselves that we're better than the old goal that we're able to reached.",

If you have reached reached your Bitcoin goal what did you do after then?I never had a set target at first when all gained interest in bitcoin all that mattered to me was just owning a bitcoin not mind the amount I invest in, but then after buying my first bitcoin I felt unsatisfied realizing I need to invest more Soni can own more and that's how I have been on the journey but there's no set goal for it. I just keep buying whenever I can how much I can at each brief period . I think setting a goal can put you on a pressure to meet up the goal on time, and circumstances and challenges happens in life which can chunk into the way of achieving that set bitcoin goal by delay, such things can mount so much pressure on you. So I avoid setting a goal towards bitcoin buying, I buy whenever I can, which at times I could even be privileged to buy 3 times in a month.",

I used to have specific goals in the past like reaching a certain amount of coins, but then after that, what? You will continue to add more Sats to it every time you have extra savings.

What do you expect with Bitcoin growth in future and Why do you decide to DCA Bitcoin in last couple of years?If you think its future growth is good and you DCA because you planed to invest in Bitcoin some years, at least one more halving, not only a next halving in 2024, you will some thinking like.- Will you hold your Bitcoin (in this almost done plan) till 2028 without selling it?- If you continue DCA, but buying Bitcoin at higher price after 2024 halving and bull run, but don't have enough savings to use, will you have to sell your bitcoin?If your plan is continuation of DCA but can sell it in next one or two years, I think you can simply hold your bitcoin and use your future income as your saving, it's not necessary to DCA more.",
