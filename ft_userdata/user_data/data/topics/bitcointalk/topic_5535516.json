  "content": "This question might seem like one that a beginner would ask. In fact, someone recently posed a similar question to me, and I’ve been thinking about it ever since.A friend of my younger sibling wants to invest in Bitcoin, and he asked me about the best wallet option. I advised him to consider an open-source hardware wallet, since that's what I use as well.He then asked if he could store 1 BTC in the wallet, to which I responded, \"Why not?\" His next question caught me off guard: \"What about the saying, 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket'?\"I took a moment to think, but deep down I felt confident in my hardware wallet's security compared to hot wallets. However, he argued that it's best to split the Bitcoin into two parts and store them in two different hardware wallets.What are your thoughts on this? Personally, I keep all my BTC in a single hardware wallet. I’d like to know, from the Bitcointalk community: do you think the saying \"don’t put all your eggs in one basket\" also applies to those using a single hardware wallet?",

It will only create confusion and confusion will lead to a disaster. Most of us learned this by the hard way in the past and your friend will also understand it eventually. (Hopefully he will see it before losing any coins) There isn’t much you can do about it. You can try to talk sense into him but he won’t understand a damn till he lightens up miraculously.",

Even if you store you Bitcoin in two or three different hardware wallet and you don't carefully keep your secret phrase safe, chances that you will lose all your Bitcoin in those wallet is there and for you to prevent that, you don't need to be careless with your security. So, even if you have one wallet and you store everything there, you don't have any issue unless your phrase is exposed. That phrase of not putting all your eggs in one basket was being said to those people that like to invest all their money in just one asset or when someone put their entire hope on something. For the case of Bitcoin wallet, it is clearly advised that investors should have a cold wallet which is usually offline with the seed phrase also backed up offline In a safe place, if that is done, you don't have anything to fear.",

So it's true that what the proverb says is true, not only the ways of guarding have evolved for the better, nowadays scammers also have newer & better ways to deceive their potential victims. But to do those separations, you have to spend more effort & time to manage all of that. In the end, only you know how far you can go.",

When you actually don't have doubts or trust issues about the security features of your hardware wallet, you won't just see the need to have two hardware wallets; instead, you would prefer having one hardware wallet since it can comfortably serve the purpose of storing up to 1 BTC without having security bridge.",

It means don't make Bitcoin your only investment.Anyway, it is not clear that storing bitcoins in multiple wallets will reduce your risk of loss because more wallets increases the chances of loss. It also increases the effort needed to maintain them.Interestingly, I just got a different perspective on this now. I had only viewed the post from the perspective of splitting our Bitcoins and storing them in different wallets. However, I still think the meaning of the phrase \"Don’t put all your eggs in one basket\" depends on the investor and the definition they choose to give it. In this context, it seems the investor is actually talking about splitting their Bitcoins into different wallets since the discussion at that moment was about the storage method for 1 BTC.To me, the best definition I can give to putting our eggs in different baskets is diversifying our portfolio. The goal here is to protect our funds. If one asset class performs poorly, there are still other assets performing well, which will balance the returns from the overall investment.",

      "body": "You don't necessarily have to have two hardware wallets. You can, for example, use a hardware wallet to store 0.5 BTC and a cold wallet based on the light Electrum client to store the remaining 0.5 BTC (using two different devices). In fact, you raise a very interesting question. A hardware wallet is considered a very secure way to store Bitcoin. However, from a paranoid cypherpunk perspective, this is not entirely true. A Bitcoin holder may face various threats and various methods of attack. For example, a hardware wallet has one drawback that is rarely mentioned by those people who advocate storing Bitcoin using a hardware wallet. This drawback is that the very fact that you have a hardware wallet indicates that you have Bitcoin. I am not sure that the principle of \"not putting all your eggs in one basket\" should not be applied to the Bitcoin storage system. I doubt it. From a paranoid cypherpunk perspective (I guess), the principle of diversification is a universal principle.",

Electrum is a great wallet to start out with, and it's pretty basic to set up; even a newbie can do it. As for what your friend told you, I will agree with the previous users; it's about portfolio diversification, not for Bitcoin storage. There's nothing wrong with using a single hardware wallet to store your Bitcoin; they'll be safe. However, I don't see why you couldn't split your coins on a second wallet as well, if that makes you feel safer. The only downside I could think of, apart from overcomplicating things, is the cost of buying a second hardware wallet.",

Anyone can do who they see will be a perfect strategy for them. 1 or 10 it doesn't matter. What matter is that you will have total control of those wallets and then you know how to practice safe hygiene like not keeping your private key in a safe multiple location and back it up.Although the quote \"don't put all your eggs in one basket\" connotes diversification not splitting your Bitcoin or any crypto for that matter into different wallets.",

Should you have the leverage to have several wallets, why not utilize them? It doesn’t do you any wrong to do so. It’s a security measure you know, you don’t get lose all in the event of any compromise, doesn’t matter the source. So long as you didn’t have them all and both wallets in one place, you would be safe at least, in one end and that too is a step wise towards security of your asset.Quote from: franky1 on March 17, 2025, 09:13:04 PMbest strategy is to have nearly 1btc in a secure cold wallet, and then a few sats in another wallet as play/losable funds(hot/cold wallet principles)Like Franky1, I don’t subscribe to the idea of an equal splitting too.",

So I personally agree with your brothers friend, there is no too secure wallet that can defeat the idea of \"don’t put all your eggs in one basket\" for me he can actually split them into two or more wallet, 1 bitcoin might be small for some investors to split into two wallets but might be huge for some. The only problem with having two or more wallet is the way you store their seeds do not back them up together do not over spread them for redundancy sake.",

To start with you actually need to consider making use is a hardware wallet or a cold storage of your choice. Then you need to make use of an open source wallet as a watch only wallet because trust me it's important. If you want , for extra privacy you can also consider running your own node and that would help in masking your IP and public keys. Also you should avoid sharing your address so you don't get monitored.",

With just one storage medium, any loss of property or the password will lead to the loss of everything. Instead of this ugly situation to happen, it is better to divide the entire assets into two or three different parts and save them separately. I feel this is a better way of securing one's Bitcoin than keeping everything together. Storage medium can be hardware wallet with open source like you suggested but this time, it could be two of three different hardware wallets.",
