They are holding some altcoins after they carefully did their own personal research about those certain projects. Honestly, you would be a legend if you could do that thing you suggested but it's far from reality because there are too many choices and it makes it more even difficult to choose the right altcoin to hold for the long term let alone jump from one to another.",

Considering the volatility of the existing market you can go to the top or lose everything. Think before you make a move and be prepared of a plan b if your plan a doesn't work. As I have seen all calculation take a deep dive suddenly in the altcoin market. In that situation in order to recover your loss you would need a few less volatile coins in your portfolio.",

You mean trading, right?If you can do that with trading then follow what you think is doable. If you can compound your altcoins profit during the bull run and as you start today, see if you can do it. Not everyone can do this much and have this set of plan to make during the entire year or before the bull run comes. Because if this is all about trading it looks promising but hard to execute.",

Just keep in mind this is the market and if you will see a pump so definitely you will see a dump too. So never think like that which you have mentioned.I will recommend you should not buy one coin you should divide your amount on to 5 or on to 10. Means you should pick 5 or 10 Altcoins with your analysis and should invest equally in these coins. If any one will go down others may recover the loss of one coin. And if the whole market will dump so this is your luck.I will again recommend that you should not invest only in one coin. You should choose different coins and should invest into them that will be good for you. DYOR.",

I would suggest you to come up with an strategy, I can share one of mine but it won't work for you because we both might have different calibre to execute the strategy and efforts might differ. Start from small profits and then multiple it then set aside a percentage as take profit and continue with rest until you achieve your desired results. There might be losing day you gotta consider those as the day of accumulation to sell it or higher at winning days. Try writing down your strategy and start with very lesser amount to check trail and error basis.",

In this way you don't have to take any risk for any negativity from that project price. You can reinvest those seed funds to other projects or you can buy some major altcoin like ETH matic to minimize the risk. But the strategy you wants to apply to multiplay your asset 2x every time can be a failure. You have seen success for few project but you will not be successful in every project in which you invest.",

I've seen several people trying to do this in years i've been in this game. Some of them are proud that they have found this way, like they invented the fire. But like you said. All it needs is one altcoin that's not 2x:ing, and these coin flippers lose their composure And since here are more altcoins out there that go down then up, you can guarantee that some point you will encounter them. Some of the projects will be even rug pulls so you can't even sell in loss as there's no liquidity to sell. So you will lose everything.

More then you know.easy to plan but in actual scenario too difficult to find alt that will indeed give you at least 2x profits in a short period of time. how the OP laid out his plans is quite easy. but try applying it in actual trading market, i guess, he would find it challenging to find those profitable alts. but if you think you have a sound plan, you can push thru as it is your money at stake. so better take care of your own funds from potential screw-ups.",

That's possible but you should know that this will only happen when it's bull run and you may even get more than that. For your information there's some kind of cycle you should know because it's starts first with Bitcoin, then large caps, medium caps, and then the shitcoins. At least know this cycle if you want to fully maximize compounding. Maybe you're just in shock how you make these profits but it will just be grab again on you by the market if you don't pay attention well. Take profit as needed and always eye on the target.",

      "body": "Op trust me this idea of jumping from one coin to another is not a good for your financing health. Even if you choose to start with €100, I bet you might get tempted to increase the amount after successfully making this profit you desire. Its possible for altcoins at this time to increase to 100% in their price but, how would you differentiate those that have come to stay and those that would disappear in a twinkle of an eye. No matter how careful you'll try to be, those altcoins who move 2x their price are usually low when it comes to popularity and their their market cap, in other words they are not to be trusted. I'm happy you understand the risk behind the decision you're making so all risk tolerance would be on you. They say a word is enough for the wise, I think I'll end my advise here and let you learn from your own experience. You have a very low probability of coming out successful with this idea. but anyway, good luck.",

If it can do almost 100% in less than a week, in can likewise go down by the same (or even more) percentage. You also mentioned to jump from one Altcoin to another due to your compounding interest plan. Well, not bad but know that jumping from one Altcoin to another increases the risks even more and like I said, be careful because one of these Altcoins could be having a bad day and you wouldn’t know; going in with all your funds.
