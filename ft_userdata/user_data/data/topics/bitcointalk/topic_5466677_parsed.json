I realized something suspicious from the notification. when I opened the thread then my suspicion turned out to be correct. This scammer shared a fake phishing website. The website required wallet connect to claim airdrop. it is clear that it's a scam attempt and by connecting wallet wallet funds will be washed out. I request everyone to tag this scammer and also create a flag to save newbies funds. Account is fully new created and I think he will spam more.

If you are so clear about it, you should have at least tagged him. Asking others to do it without doing it yourself doesn't sound very coherent to me.",

Over time, if it turns out that your assessments are good, you will quickly reach at least the DT2 list. So, based on your trust/distrust list and the feedback you leave, others can better evaluate you.In such scam accusations, always notice that you tagged that user and that (if) you possibly created the tag.note: I am going to tag the account mentioned from OP to be visible.",

He is now asking the bounty hunters to connect their wallets and approve sign messages in order to receive five stakes per week to be eligible for $5,000 cyber coins.

It's obvious that he's already aware of what he's doing and has seen that he has been caught in the act, but he did not expect a quick response from members here on the forum.It just keeps on suppressing me how some scammers do think that they can come to a crypto forum as big as Bitcoin Talk and just post any link and don't expect anyone to investigate what's truly behind that link; they don't really think straight on their mode of scam attempt.",

His posts may be deleted by the moderator, it doesn't mean he will stop his activity, he will resume his activity when he gets another chance. This user should be banned to keep the forum clean so that he can't promote this kind of phishing link in the forum again. Because we have seen many such members in the past who came to the forum and promoted various scams and ended their activities by getting banned. This user will continue such activities until he is banned.",
