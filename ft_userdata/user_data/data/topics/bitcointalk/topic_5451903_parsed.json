So profitability is almost doubled.Some people are paying 800 sata/byte now which is about $50 for a small 2 output transaction. If this continues then many old ASICs might be slightly profitable again, maybe not the S5 but the recent generations of BTC ASICs.",

If you need the heat, you might as well take advantage. This time of year though, when a lot of people are having to start running their air conditioners for summer, even if it was profitable to mine, it might not be when you factor in the cost and inconvenience of having to cool the miners.",
