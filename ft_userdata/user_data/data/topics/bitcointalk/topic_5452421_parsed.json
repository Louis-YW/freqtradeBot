  "content": "Introducing Purebet: A Fully On-Chain Sports Betting Aggregator What is Purebet? Purebet is a fully on-chain sports betting aggregator where ALL bettors are welcome. Over the past year or so, many fully on-chain sports betting protocols have developed and grown. These include exchanges and automated market makers and span across many different blockchains. The Problem with On-Chain Sports Betting Because these protocols are each on a different blockchain and use a different currency for betting, it is impossible for bettors to be able to quickly take the best odds at the venue offering them. Getting there involves expensive swap and bridge transactions. How Purebet Solves This Problem Purebet solves this by unifying the liquidity from every venue and every blockchain into one place. We show the best odds offered by every venue within our orderbook, letting you always take the best odds, regardless of the source blockchain or collateral token. When you place a bet, our system places the bet at the source venue and matches your offer, locking your stake and the potential profit into a smart contract on the Solana blockchain. If the bet wins, you are automatically paid the stake and profit to your blockchain wallet. There is no need to worry about cross-chain bridging or redeeming winnings at the source - we do it all automatically. Key features - No need to create an account and log in, simply connect your blockchain wallet and bet right away! - Betting is done via blockchain transactions. We cannot ask for KYC or limit winners. Your bet winnings are directly paid to your blockchain wallet so users never have to demand a withdraw- No protocol fees on any bet staking or profits, other than the 0.000005 SOL transaction fee from the Solana blockchain- We currently offer markets on all major US sports; major soccer leagues including J-League, Eredivisie, MLS, Copa Libertadores; UFC; Euroleague; and we are ready to offer French Open M & W tennis and Nordic and non-European leagues in the future- We have a total of 6 venues across 5 blockchains aggregated at the moment, which allows us to offer betting margins < 4% (and sometimes < 0%). We have odds that are better than most bookies and can compete with Pinnacle most of the time.- The aggregation of multiple protocols gives the possibility of frequent arbitrage opportunities. We welcome all arbitrage and value bettors! How to Place Bets Bet placing can take place via the UI on our website or via our API. All you need to do is connect your blockchain wallet and bet right away. Since we are based on the Solana blockchain, the transaction fee is 0.000005 SOL, and we charge 0% protocol fees on stakes/returns/profits/anything. All betting takes place using Solana native USDC, so there is no need to worry about price fluctuations or risk from bridged tokens. Arbitrage Opportunities Since we have multiple protocols aggregated into one orderbook, there is the possibility that arbitrage opportunities appear within the orderbook (or one side of the orderbook + odds from another venue like Pinnacle create an arbitrage opportunity) and we happily welcome arbitrage/sure bettors. All winners are welcome - like other exchanges such as Betfair, winners are welcome since we take no risk on any bets: it is all passed on to other sources. Connect with Us You can visit our website at https://www.purebet.ioYou can read more about how it works in our documentation: https://docs.purebet.io/Our Twitter: https://twitter.com/Purebet_ioOur Discord: https://discord.gg/22tr2FYAh9 (I will try to be active in this thread but the Discord server is the main point of contact) Current Promotion We currently have an ongoing promotion for a risk free bet to users who have bet with on-chain venues before, but this will be extended to users of this forum: https://docs.purebet.io/promotion-terms/phase-1-completion-celebration-promotion-07-04-23Send a private message on here with the link to your first losing bet.

I've used a couple of bookmakers in the past that claimed they welcome winners but they quickly limited my account after a few winnings bets. What's your policy on that?It is like a hybrid between a sportsbook and an exchange. It the base layer, it is an exchange which allows anyone to match bets with anyone. However, there are also offers of instant liquidity which come from other venues which are aggregated.The max stake for instant liquidity varies depending on what venue the top odds are from, but like an exchange, you can get a higher stake at lower odds. We like winners more than losers because it means you keep coming back! Since betting is purely done through your wallet, even if we wanted to stop someone, they could just make a new wallet address and keep betting. Because of this, the system is inherently designed to welcome winners.",

Did you plan to add greyhounds/horse racing?Solana account structure lends itself to an exchange format which cannot exist on EVM chains. The fees are also consistently the lowest. The 400 ms time to finality also allows for live betting when the time comes, while EVM chains would lead to weird delays and gas races. We do not have horses or greyhounds because no on-chain protocol offers them yet for us to pull from. We have a design to offer trustless on-chain markets of these types, but it is outside the scope of the current product which we are busy with for now.",

Does the sportsbook account will automatically created once we trade on your built in DEX?Buy copper membership for proper ANN thread.

Let me explain in more detail to clear things up.The base layer and the UI design is that of an exchange. We allow anyone to put up offers (maker orders) at any odds with any stake for any event we have online. On top of this exchange layer, we built a liquidity aggregation layer which pulls odds and liquidity from other venues and shows them in the orderbook. This provides instant liquidity for those looking to place bets as taker orders.It is essentially a hybrid of Betfair exchange and Mollybet which aggregates asian bookmakers - but we aggregate on-chain venues.",
