  "content": "QuoteAmericans born in 2021 can expect to live for just 76.1 years — the lowest life expectancy has been since 1996, according to a new government analysis published Wednesday. This is the biggest two-year decline — 2.7 years in total — in almost 100 years.The Covid-19 pandemic is the primary cause of the decline. However, increases in the number of people dying from overdoses and accidents is also a significant factor.American Indian and Alaskan Native people have experienced a particularly precipitous drop in life expectancy since 2019, going from 71.8 to 65.2 years. This kind of loss is similar to the plunge seen for all Americans after the Spanish Flu, said Robert Anderson, the chief of the mortality statistics branch of the National Center for Health Statistics, a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“It’s a ridiculous decline,” Anderson said. “When I saw a 6.6 year decline over two years, my jaw dropped. … I made my staff re-run the numbers to make sure.”Life expectancy isn’t really a prediction for a single individual. It’s more like a check engine light — an indicator for the health of society as a whole. When more people die than would be expected, or when they die at younger ages than expected, then life expectancy will decline.“Life expectancy is an interesting measure, because it emphasizes deaths that occur at younger ages,” Anderson explained. “A death at a younger age basically takes away more years of potential life than again in older age.”Image link:  https://i.ibb.co/wCyPZFC/us-life-expectancy.jpgFor decades, Americans saw steadily rising life expectancies. Efforts to reduce smoking contributed to this increase in the 1990s and 2000s, because fewer people were dying of related conditions, like cardiovascular disease. American mortality data has been collected since at least 1900.But American life expectancy began to stagnate around 2010 — while other developed countries continued to see gains, Anderson noted.This year’s life expectancy figure is 0.9 years lower than last year’s. Covid-19 accounted for about half of the decline, and a category encompassing accidents and unintentional injuries is responsible for another 16%. That category includes overdoses; in fact, about half of the unintentional injury deaths in this analysis were due to overdoses.“We think that the increase in drug overdoses during the pandemic is partly due to the pandemic, but probably not wholly due to the pandemic,” he said. “It'll be interesting to see [what happens] as the pandemic abates — assuming that it does, hopefully it will.”Although deaths from heart disease were the third biggest contributor to the decline in life expectancy, the number of people dying from this condition actually decreased. “With heart disease, we did see increases in mortality at younger ages — from ages 35 to 64 in particular,” Anderson said.Not every demographic group saw the same changes, the researchers found. Asian-Americans have the highest life expectancy of any group — 83.5 years — and only saw a 0.1 year decline from 2020. Meanwhile, Black Americans lost 0.7 years between 2020 to 2021.But American Indian and Native Americans saw the largest loss of life expectancy of all — 1.9 years less than 2020’s life expectancy, and 6.6 years less than 2019’s. They also had the lowest life expectancy among the groups studied. (Historically, Native Americans’ life expectancy has been staying level even in years when the life expectancy of the entire population did increase, one recent study found.)The data used for this analysis is still technically incomplete, Anderson noted; it includes about 99% of the deaths that the researchers expected to have. The precise figures could change when the final analysis is released in December.https://www.statnews.com/2022/08/31/u-s-life-expectancy-drops-sharply-the-second-consecutive-decline/....They're claiming a 6.6 year decline in US life expectancy in a 2 year period. Which they claim is comparable to the spanish flu.Numbers cited here appear to be preliminary. The revised statistics will hopefully be more believable.QuoteThe data used for this analysis is still technically incomplete, Anderson noted; it includes about 99% of the deaths that the researchers expected to have. The precise figures could change when the final analysis is released in December.During the 2008 economic crisis, the recession contributed to steep rises in suicide rates, violence and crime. I would expect a similar trend today with inflation, gas and food prices being what they are.One interesting point here is, for life expectancy to fall that much. A significant number of youth have to be affected. The article mentions drug overdoses ranking highly in rising mortality rates. There has been considerable news recently of fentanyl overdoses being a big issue. A quick keyword search reveals the fatal overdose quantity for fentanyl can be as low as 0.002 grams. I hope people are taking steps to protect themselves is they use substances like fentanyl.If a fatal dosage of fentanyl is 0.002 grams. What does a dosage that size even look like? Is it easy to measure on a scale? I think this is the type of information people need. But there doesn't appear to be much urgency to cover the topic.",

But everyone needs to understand how even slight changes in death rates can alter the overall number when large populations are considered. The overall trend of rising life expectancy, which has been in place since the late 20th century, appears to be reversing. Obviously, there are a number of factors in play here But nevertheless, the data indicate we should be concerned about these recent developments.",

Life expectancy does not account for overall health status either. It would treat someone that is 50 years old and healthy the same way as a 50 year old that is obese. Obviously different projected life expectancies.Anyways - If it is true that overdoses contribute to lowering of life expectancies, then only anticipate the number of OD's to increase after the government decided it was a good idea to take a depressed society and confine them to their homes for an indefinite period. Whatever economic woes will compound the issue, the roots will have been the lockdowns.",

These days the government seems very interested in how to propel economic recovery than the health of the people.They are pursuing increase in revenue generation through tax and import duties. Even when these products are unwholesome, they still protect these firms because of the fear of loosing tax revenue.In my country there is little or no regulation as regards to the kind of products these food processing companies push into the market. Most of these consumer protection agencies are manned by corrupt officials that are only interested in receiving bribes from erring companies.",

We reviewed the latest edition of \"Health at a Glance,\" a book by the OECD, which offers an extensive collection of indicators for OECD members and major emerging economies' population health and health care system performance. These cover health status, health risk factors, availability and quality of care, and health resources.Below, you'll find how life expectancy significantly rose between 1970 and 2019 and how it suffered during the Covid-19 pandemic, with most surveyed countries facing reductions in just two years. The largest reductions in life expectancies can be found in the USA, Spain, Poland, Italy, and Lithuania, while Norway, Japan, Costa Rica, and Finland actually recorded a slight increase in life expectancy.This is actually a great scientific book, and I'd advise you to go through it. It provides a great deal of interesting indicators regarding health subjects.",

Note that science doesn't want to look at spiritual things very much... the metaphysical. Yet such is the most important part of each person.Everything works together. As long as people listen to science, and continue to ignore the metaphysical part that is involved, good nutrition and supplements will only work a little.Sing to your garden plants songs of joy.

Jokes apart, the American dream is failing to many people and that also has to show in the life expectancy, but I am sure also in the stats for suicides, mental illness and other side effects.Of course, life expectancy is linked to income levels. Someone barely making the minimum wage doesn't have the same access to health care as someone well off, nor does he have the same working conditions as someone well off. The Queen not only had the best access to medicine and healthcare, but also a life with little to no manual labor and poor working and living conditions, something which the average Joe has to go through in order to survive in this rat race.I couldn't find an index on income levels and life expectancy in the OECD's book \"Health at a Glance,\", but I did find something close. Life expectancy by education level, which is usually correlated to income levels. The following graph represents the gap between lower and higher education levels for men and women. A 30-year-old with lower education can anticipate having 5.2 less years of life than a 30-year-old with a higher education (a university degree or equivalent). The life expectancy difference between males with lower and higher education levels is over ten years in many central and eastern European nations (Slovak Republic, Latvia, Poland, and Hungary), where socioeconomic inequalities are particularly pronounced among men.",
