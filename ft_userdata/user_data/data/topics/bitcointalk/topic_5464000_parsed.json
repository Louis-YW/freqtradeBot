So, do you actually have collateral or not?Then you mentioned \"small valuable item.\" What exactly does that mean? Are you suggesting using physical items as collateral for a loan? If that's the case, you need to clarify the items you're putting up and be prepared to send them to the lender's physical address (and cover the shipping costs). Are you ready to do that?",
