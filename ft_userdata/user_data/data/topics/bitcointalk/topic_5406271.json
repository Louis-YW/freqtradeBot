Well, maybe 1-2 exchanges from 1-2 countries.And even if all would ban the not backed coins because of laws... one can make a new exchange, hidden, P2P where people are allowed to exchange again not backed coins.So no.. it's not possible. Also it's likely that you have misunderstood both bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies (and the relationship between them).",

I saw a token released by a project who collateralised every token to a dollar of stablecoin - so now that coin is worth a dollar and is staying there....",

It is how Bitcoin is a standard technically in crypto.In trading, on exchanges, Bitcoin is a standard to as altcoins have their trading pairs with Bitcoin.

But if you mean a standard in a sense that cryptos should be backed by Bitcoin literally, then there isn't enough BTC to go buy, and BTC itself is very volatile to be considered for this role. I also don't see why anyone would need an altcoin allegedly backed by Bitcoin if one can simply use Bitcoin itself.",

Anyone could create it, at least anyone who can follow the most basic of instructions. I know that isn't creating anything special or unique, but take a look at most of the stuff released today, and you'll see that a lot of them have gone this route.

Innovation is good. Its obviously the driving force behind the new generation of money technology, aka \"Bitcoin\".One day there might be a better alternative cryptocurrency alternative to Bitcoin and us devoted Bitcoiners will have a hard time accepting that fact.However that day has not come yet. Every altcoin is nothing but a cheap imitation or a unrequired derivation of Bitcoin and/or the blockchain technology behind it and is therefore unnecessary. But I am sure a few people would disagree with me on that. Especially since we can't really do some things like DeFI or complex smart contracts with Bitcoin. But you are correct in assuming that Bitcoin is currently fullfilling its purpose of being an alternative to the current corrupt and government controlled monetary system.
