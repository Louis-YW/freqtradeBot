Registrations were made in one or two days. But I wouldn't be surprised that there are other accounts like this.Registration in the bounty also occurs by machine, you can track it by the time the account was created and the time of registration in the bounty.There are many more bot accounts than the OP found. They have slightly different actions, but still, they give themselves out very noticeably.I will mark them all as cheaters.1.JosueBenicio    December 18, 2021, 02:48:24 PM2.EmmittCase    December 18, 2021, 02:56:47 PM3.RileyLeandro    December 18, 2021, 03:08:16 PM4.SpencerLane    December 18, 2021, 03:14:49 PM5LyricMathew    December 18, 2021, 03:18:18 PM6.MarcosReid    December 18, 2021, 03:18:56 PM7.ConnerAlonso   December 18, 2021, 03:26:12 PM8.KaceMiguel    December 18, 2021, 03:28:05 PM9.DaxtonJustice    December 18, 2021, 03:36:43 PM10.LelandSage    December 18, 2021, 03:39:15 PM11.ChrisLangston    December 18, 2021, 03:47:08 PM12.FrancoAryan    December 18, 2021, 03:49:48 PM13.WillieKairo    December 18, 2021, 04:04:38 PM14.LawrenceAugust    December 18, 2021, 04:13:23 PM15.EzraJaiden    December 18, 2021, 04:19:33 PM16.CallumJosiah    December 18, 2021, 04:23:18 PM17.RafaelDeclan    December 18, 2021, 04:30:11 PM18.TommyKayson    December 18, 2021, 04:32:14 PM19.AmosAdriel    December 18, 2021, 04:44:20 PM20.YosefAnder    December 18, 2021, 04:46:52 PM21.GunnerGabriel    December 18, 2021, 04:58:16 PM22.ElishaJaime    December 18, 2021, 05:02:19 PM23.BenicioLouis       December 18, 2021, 05:22:10 PM24.GageLeroy       December 18, 2021, 05:28:45 PM25.ConradIra    December 18, 2021, 05:30:47 PM26.LouieDominick    December 18, 2021, 05:59:35 PM27.RiggsJosiah    December 18, 2021, 06:05:53 PM28.BodhiPierce    December 18, 2021, 06:08:24 PM29.KendrickDax       December 18, 2021, 06:26:32 PM30ColtLucian    December 18, 2021, 06:34:12 PM31.AntonioKeith    December 18, 2021, 07:50:34 PM32.RhysOtis    December 19, 2021, 11:56:21 AM33.ShepardNehemiah       December 19, 2021, 12:03:03 PM34.VihaanMilo    December 19, 2021, 12:03:56 PM35.StanleyCade       December 19, 2021, 12:07:21 PM36.ReignGage    December 19, 2021, 12:13:58 PM37.RodneyAtlas      December 19, 2021, 12:17:57 PM38.KareemKody    December 19, 2021, 12:21:30 PM39.NovaLeif    December 19, 2021, 12:32:02 PM40.LucianoStefan     December 19, 2021, 12:37:45 PM[BOUNTY] PartyLandMetaBank Reward Marketing Program [Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, etc] manager @tranthidung",

Registrations were made in one or two days. But I wouldn't be surprised that there are other accounts like this.Registration in the bounty also occurs by machine, you can track it by the time the account was created and the time of registration in the bounty.There are many more bot accounts than the OP found. They have slightly different actions, but still, they give themselves out very noticeably.I will mark them all as cheaters.1.JosueBenicio    December 18, 2021, 02:48:24 PM2.EmmittCase    December 18, 2021, 02:56:47 PM3.RileyLeandro    December 18, 2021, 03:08:16 PM4.SpencerLane    December 18, 2021, 03:14:49 PM5LyricMathew    December 18, 2021, 03:18:18 PM6.MarcosReid    December 18, 2021, 03:18:56 PM7.ConnerAlonso   December 18, 2021, 03:26:12 PM8.KaceMiguel    December 18, 2021, 03:28:05 PM9.DaxtonJustice    December 18, 2021, 03:36:43 PM10.LelandSage    December 18, 2021, 03:39:15 PM11.ChrisLangston    December 18, 2021, 03:47:08 PM12.FrancoAryan    December 18, 2021, 03:49:48 PM13.WillieKairo    December 18, 2021, 04:04:38 PM14.LawrenceAugust    December 18, 2021, 04:13:23 PM15.EzraJaiden    December 18, 2021, 04:19:33 PM16.CallumJosiah    December 18, 2021, 04:23:18 PM17.RafaelDeclan    December 18, 2021, 04:30:11 PM18.TommyKayson    December 18, 2021, 04:32:14 PM19.AmosAdriel    December 18, 2021, 04:44:20 PM20.YosefAnder    December 18, 2021, 04:46:52 PM21.GunnerGabriel    December 18, 2021, 04:58:16 PM22.ElishaJaime    December 18, 2021, 05:02:19 PM23.BenicioLouis       December 18, 2021, 05:22:10 PM24.GageLeroy       December 18, 2021, 05:28:45 PM25.ConradIra    December 18, 2021, 05:30:47 PM26.LouieDominick    December 18, 2021, 05:59:35 PM27.RiggsJosiah    December 18, 2021, 06:05:53 PM28.BodhiPierce    December 18, 2021, 06:08:24 PM29.KendrickDax       December 18, 2021, 06:26:32 PM30ColtLucian    December 18, 2021, 06:34:12 PM31.AntonioKeith    December 18, 2021, 07:50:34 PM32.RhysOtis    December 19, 2021, 11:56:21 AM33.ShepardNehemiah       December 19, 2021, 12:03:03 PM34.VihaanMilo    December 19, 2021, 12:03:56 PM35.StanleyCade       December 19, 2021, 12:07:21 PM36.ReignGage    December 19, 2021, 12:13:58 PM37.RodneyAtlas      December 19, 2021, 12:17:57 PM38.KareemKody    December 19, 2021, 12:21:30 PM39.NovaLeif    December 19, 2021, 12:32:02 PM40.LucianoStefan     December 19, 2021, 12:37:45 PM[BOUNTY] PartyLandMetaBank Reward Marketing Program [Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, etc] manager @tranthidungpls check BOT farm ( participating in Metavault.Trade video campaign )https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985001#msg60985001https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985002#msg60985002https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985023#msg60985023https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985027#msg60985027https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985029#msg60985029https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985035#msg60985035https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985038#msg60985038https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985057#msg60985057https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985058#msg60985058https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985060#msg60985060https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985064#msg60985064https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985066#msg60985066https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985068#msg60985068https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985070#msg60985070https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985073#msg60985073https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985074#msg60985074https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985075#msg60985075https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985082#msg60985082https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985082#msg60985082https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985088#msg60985088https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985090#msg60985090https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985092#msg60985092https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985095#msg60985095https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985099#msg60985099https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985102#msg60985102https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985104#msg60985104https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985105#msg60985105https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985109#msg60985109https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414372.msg60985204#msg60985204All of these accounts were created on the same day and continuously accessed together.
