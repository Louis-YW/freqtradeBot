We don't have the luxury of looking at history and saying oh I woulda/shoulda/coulda done this blah blah blah. I could do it on the weekly or daily and it looks way different for sure, but I ain't giving it away, not sorry.

In the subject, you added ...with real data... So let those data be real and easily digested. You can also make use of the image format here to represent.However though, some out there thinks DCA has higher portfolio value than the Lump sum but I don't think that is correct. What would be more correct is that the Lump sum has more portfolio value than the DCA when you considered the funds. But why the DCA is kinda appealing to the investor is because it could reduces great lost after subscribing to the investment fund in a monthly basis for instance over long time. Some will say because of the volatility of the market, it id better we focus on DCA instead of Lump sum. In the end. It is the choice of the investor to take.",

You took only 1 asset into the experiment, only on 1 interval (from 2019 to 2023). Perhaps if you decided to buy LUMP once a year, but not in January but in June, the result would be the opposite.Quote from: spectre71 on September 09, 2023, 01:30:17 AMI'm also thinking of omitting 2018 and 2019, those were immature growing years, I don't think they are indicative how things are going forward really. redux coming when I some timeImmature growing years were in 2010-2014.",

      "body": "From your data, it is clear that lump sum investments outperformed DCA's strategy. Both strategies have their upside and downside, and they both need specific scenarios to outperform each other. If an asset has the potential to rise constantly in the long term, then a lump sum investment will give a big return, but the investor needs to have a reasonable amount of funds upfront. But if the market is volatile and it runs like waves, then DCA will help an investor reduce the impact of the volatile market in his portfolio. In general terms, lump sum investment seems to better-performing strategy, but if the price of that asset goes down and stays there for a very long time, then it will be a big loss for the investor. There are some downsides that i noticed with these strategies.1. They are both extremely good, but a more dynamic approach can give investors better ROI. Without buying everything in one shot, you can make a lump sum investment in every notable dip. This might provide a better yield.2. Buying small amounts every month seems like a better choice in a volatile market condition, but frequent buying activity might charge significant fees over time. I think these fees were ignored in the calculation. In my opinion, why sticking to one strategy when we can make a combination of both and create a better one according to market conditions. For example, we can lump sum in a notable price dip and perform DCA when the market moves sideways. This gives our strategy more flexibility. Also, making some tweaks to our strategy in different market conditions is a good practice as an investor.",

And out? Clearly one can't say that DCA is the best way automatically. But most of us don't earn or have meanifull lump sums and we put in what we have on hand. We also can't go back in time and change and cherry pick decisions. Looking at this, I think it a good idea to lightly manage your money on policy (example: At 133% above blended avg I will sell to 100% then rebuy in at 85%).

The outcomes you included for both lump and DCA is dependent on a number of factors. For instance, you put thar lump amount at a time when bitcoin was at one of its lowest prices and then some of your DCA were done at times when the price of bitcoin was relatively higher vs lump entry price. So the value is definitely to be reduced since price has dropped since then.If you DCA more strategically (ie only when price has fallen significantly), then the results for DCA would've been much more better.",
