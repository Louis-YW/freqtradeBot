  "content": "Is there a way to get the time with seconds on Windows 11 without installing a new software for that?I am using the command prompt with the command time but the command asks to enter a new time, you can ofc leave it as it is but I don't like that.I would like to get the time with seconds in a clean way.I've finally found a rather convenient solution, I created a desktop (and keyboard) shortcut toward C:\\Windows\\System32\\timedate.cpl It displays a clock with the seconds",
