  "content": "I only later discovered the importance of either capitalizing the first letter 'b' in bitcoin or not. I couldn't quite decide how to present it in the middle of an essay, attributing it as a noun or pronoun, until recently when I learned the difference. By capitalizing the first letter 'B' in the term Bitcoin, one simply refers to the ledger wherein information regarding every transaction is stored.Also, while using the term 'bitcoin' without capitalizing the first letter 'b', it refers to the kind of cryptocurrency used to perform a transaction.",

For me just as other currencies enjoy capitalization in sentences, I always capitalize the word Bitcoin regardless of its connotation or meaning in the sentence.  It is a common convention to use uppercase b when referring `network/protocol` and lowercase b when referring `unit of currency`. People are following this convention for over 11 years. Although, it is not a hard and fast rule but knowing so help in understanding the context of the usage. If I remember correctly, even forum shows this convention in the ad slot sometimes.",

Bitcoin currency units are called \"bitcoins\" with a lowercase \"b\" -- this is often abbreviated BTC.Click the quote's author link to view the \"Ad info\" page, it's currently at the 26th in the list.",

Thank you for highlighting this detail OP, it is an added knowledge that will assist us better in our writing.",

A small distinction but that encompasses one of the greatest intrinsic values of bitcoin, and that is that it is not only a coin, but a completely decentralized protocol that largely gives value to the coin itself, and which is the baseline for a whole ecosystem build on top and around this network. In my view, this apparently small matter of using an upper or lower \"b\" contains great part of the reasoning that dismounts the \"bitcoin has no intrinsic value\" argument.",

There were also a lot of topics concerning the unit of currency.But it came down to \"standardness\", means BTC has been the most used unit and abbreviation.(IDK if there's an official announcement to use BTC since I can't find any, anyone?)",
