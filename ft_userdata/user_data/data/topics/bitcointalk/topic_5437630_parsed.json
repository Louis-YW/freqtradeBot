Sorry for the newbie question, but as I know that some pool operator are present here, I hope that I will find a proper answer  Also, it's not a manual ban it's automatic, even going back a decade to NOMP https://github.com/zone117x/node-open-mining-portal#attack-mitigation it had automatic banning of IPs that were causing problems. It can also be a combination using something like cloudflare as discussed above to take care of the 1st layer of attacks then something internally to filter out the rest.-Dave",

I imagined that all the shares submitted by the ASICs could have been considered as DDOS, and could have been unnecessarily blocked by the \"typical\" protection services.I made something that's rather simple much too complex haha",
