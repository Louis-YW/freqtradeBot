Why don't you guys recruit some of the elders you know? Maybe I should invite Biden. Maybe Warren Buffett, Dick Cheney, and Bernie Sanders would also be great members of such a group since they are all in their 80s and are US citizens. As for this forum, you are the oldest that I'm aware of. There might be others, but their ages aren't public.",

(Syed56 no disrespect, by making you 80+ years old as many dudes feels it like disrespect when they are related to big ages while they are not.).Very very congratulations üéâ sir, i hope you may live a long, healthy, wealthy and happy life. Keep growing and sharing love. I am bookmarking this thread if more octogenarians join here.",

There will be 3 halvings before that happens, so the price should be stratospheric. I think the price of BTC will be around $100,000 because you have experienced $67,000 before the price decreased to $26,000, and there is a hope that the price of BTC will reach $100,000 or $200,000 before the end of 9 years or 10 years.",

Firstly congrats to your new age @81 and hope we all still see you as active as you are now at this stage #nonagenarian, because that would be a massive milestone in one life, in this part of world where am from such acheivement are rarely seen. And for the price of BTC as of that stage I would hopefully speculate it to be around a 100k plus",

Happy birthday.At your age like now, of course I wish you the best.Anyway, Biden is too young compared to your age stated on the profile that doesn't need to be invited. Maybe inviting one slightly older than Biden is more suitable  Just kidding.By the way, did you know that I, who am younger, can still read the writings of an experienced person like you.",

Lol @Jet Cash and a very big congratulations on your new age. I'm so sorry to hear that you haven't gotten any pal yet in the octogenarian group.

Happy birthday Mr. Jet Cash. Reading some of your posts reshapes my thinking and lifestyle. I saw one of your posts about your diet and it made me adjust my consumption of inorganic food and junk.
