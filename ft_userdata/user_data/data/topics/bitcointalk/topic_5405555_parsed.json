  "content": "Topic: Do you place your bet(s) as private or unlisted in the \"public bets list\"?Why? Why not?I utilize this feature from time to time and the main reasons why I do this are:-To hide my bets from the public, and to keep my strategy(more on stragedy really)  from the public view. It is a secret recipe for disaster. I also utilize it because it gives me an edge on contests, because others can watch and they will be able to strategize something that surpass my lb ranking(s).I turn it on occasionally if a contest requires username visibility to make sure the wager or stats is mine, . etc.How about you guys, what makes you hide your bets and/or what makes you show it to the World?Thank you and good luck to your bets!",

      "body": "There can be a couple of reasons so as why people might choose to hide their bets, from having complete discretion to having zero public influence it is quite a way to make sure that people do not ' copy ' as well, some newbies will try and copy every bet that you might make only to end up causing stress for some bettors, I do think that the best way would be to be highly organized while gambling and winning without anyone knowing, its like the time when a man won lottrey online, posted about it and got killed the next day. Discretion is a vital strategy, I also like making bets without putting my name in there and using only casinos without kyc.",

I also don't care if they imitate the strategy I used, it's up to them. I only hide it when I want to or in case the information I have used on the gambling site is related to my true identity. Maybe I’ll even be able to hide my identity publicly if I win big.",

      "body": "On the contrary, I like that no one knows how much money I bet and how much I won or lost. I do not need publicity in such matters. I consider this one of the elementary safety rules. In general, life is always better when people around you know less about you. Because among them there may be envious people and hidden enemies. The less they know about you, the better for you. And they can use the information you told them against you. For example, such people can tell the boss, that you allowed yourself to lose a large amount in gambling in the casino. And that means you have a lot of money. And the boss can cut your pay. This is of course a primitive example, but it happens in life as I said.",

Of course, if you want to know if you're dealing with a professional gambler then there is no better way to find out than by seeing their stats online. But sometimes it's not always that simple. Every gambler has the right to discretion and the right to his privacy. I usually like to hide my bets when it comes to big amounts and when it's not a common technique. And in the case where a bet is under $100, it doesn't really matter if anyone sees my name or not.",
