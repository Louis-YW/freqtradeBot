      "body": "You sound very funny. This is what you should know about individuals that no one is destined to be poor , it depends on individual knowledge. It does not matter the amount of money you recieve from your work place, if proper management and investment strategy are not in place, poverty is an inevitable phenomena. There are people who are working with a low pay job yet they lived a fulfilled life with their earning and investment. A lot of people devout their time to work without any investment that can be as security for them. This is the reason why some person go poor immediately they loose their job. Op should know clearly that individual plan is a determining factor of what becomes their life irrespective of their job and pay.Another consideration is money management strategies applied by individuals, those who are prodigal in spending tends to lack. No body is born poor, but the disease of lack of  knowledge has ravage so many in the society.",

If there's no poor there won't be a rich person. And no matter the duration you sink yourself in your job, if it's not your time it will never be your time to grow in any business until God says it's your turn to shine.",

This is something most people don't master throughout their careers thats why some people excel more than others.Another factor that can affect this is that most people invest and create more than just one source of income for themselves when others solely depend on their salary hence giving them an edge over others.For those that wants to make good profit, creating more than one source of income is the way to go.",

Can we conclude that such are individual destiny?Depends on the situation. There are workers that have been working 10-20 years and then they're part of the sandwich generation and that's why the life don't have any progress on them. And that's because they've been obliged to sustain their parents needs and not for them. There's also the difference between someone who knows how to manage his finances than of those that are lacking financial knowledge.That's why some even have shorter tenure of employment gets more assets and better handling in money and managing it.",

Can we conclude that such are individual destiny?For me this boils down into few things.1. The person behind the work2. The burdens upon him.3. The social status of the environment.1. The personality of the person behind the job matters a lot and could be a number one reasons to such differences. Life will be a lot more difficult for someone that acquires more expenses to himself through liabilities than creating avenues for assets. The best way you can build more assets is through investments. As you make money out of tbe work you do, plan to make an investment plan to it. Investing in Bitcoin is a good choice to make.2. The burdens on the individuals varies. Burdens could be that of family and friends. If they are tied into an environment that harbors people with poor mindsets, they will face more issues around trying to feed extra mouths, instead of just themselves and their immediate family.3. The social status of the environment they live can differ. For instance, if Mr A lives in a community with relatively low income earners, he's likely to spend less than a highly developed community or a smart city.So we could be earning the same amount of money but wirh different ways of consumption.",

Can we conclude that such are individual destiny?Look, I'm going to speak plainly because with that mentality you're not going to progress in life. To talk about destiny is to have an extremely magical-religious conception of the real world, which is not going to serve you on a day-to-day basis, or to believe the garbage communist ideology that makes you believe that because you are a low-skilled worker you are going to stay that way all your life because capitalism oppresses you.Nowadays you have more opportunities to progress than ever, much more with the internet. If you have a job that pays you little, train yourself better, look for another job, or even if you find it difficult and you can't, look for ways to earn money online. One way in this forum are the signature campaigns, in which many people participate. What they pay is a good extra income if you live in a developed country, but in a poor country it can mean a whole income.It is true that negative circumstances sometimes prevent us from progressing and that there are people who have bad luck, but the people who progress the most are those who believe that they have destiny in their hands, despite the circumstances, instead of the other way around: believing that they can't do anything because of destiny or the supposed oppressive capitalism.",

Can we conclude that such are individual destiny?I’ve found that when it comes to not being poor it is mostly how a person handles their money, not how much they make that determines their net worth. If you’re the type of person that needs new cars and expensive shoes, you’ll probably be broke your entire life no matter how much you make. If you stay away from debt and don’t waste money on things you don’t need, you’ll probably end up quite well off financially. However, most people today don’t know how to live within their means.",

We are constantly reminded of how we need the latest thing which are all aimedat taking our money.

People in the far left believe rather in the theory of equal results, but I view that solution as a punishment towards those who took an opportunity and worked hard to take the most of it for the sake of their own future and their families.One can have a job for 5 years and change one's life, but perhaps it is a job which requires special education, going to college, while anyone can sell peanuts in the streets for 20 years and go nowhere.
