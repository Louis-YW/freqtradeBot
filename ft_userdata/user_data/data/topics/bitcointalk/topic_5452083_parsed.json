This i s an estimation for a transaction to get confirmed in the next 6 blocks.QuoteCan you add an option to choose the type of addresses, number of inputs, number of outputs? Then the estimate will be much betterThis will nto change the estimation, this is change the transaction total size.You need to pay the number of satoshi per byte  according to this image  to make your transaction confirmed in the time you want.What you are suggesting is to make an estimation of the total fee you will pay.For that, you can use this tool which i created:https://bitcoindata.science/plot-your-transaction-in-mempool.html",

Highly recommended man. All the three tools that are available on your website are just more than enough to make a beautiful and updated thread related to financials of campaign. It’s helpful tool for sure. Question:Does the above price will automatically update if there are any changes ? May be not since it’s static image or is it more surprising than I think?Edit:Its working.  The image is auto updating with updated balance. This is just awesome tool man.  Love it. <3",

Nice work and essential tool for this forum but I'll be very glad if you can add one killer optional feature. Mempool.space shows you the fee ranges of upcoming bitcoin blocks which itself is a good indicator to predict better whether fees are going to increase or not. It's also good to see the fee ranges of recently mined bitcoin blocks. I think it will be more informative but not annoying, if you do a horizontal line and write down the fee range of two recent mined and upcoming blocks.Just my opinion, otherwise this is perfect but slight UI improvement is never a bad idea.Thanks again for your work! It loads quickly and works well!",

I was referring to how mempool.space convert sats/vbyte into USD, but I guess that's a bit useless since total fees will be different like you mentioned. Even if it was available it would be meaningless to put there since people can easily use their wallet to see them anyway. Looking forward to the updates if you plan to add new features.",

And also they can check the fee from their Electrum Wallet, they can just do as if they want to send coin after inputting the address and the amount of bitcoin you want to send then click pay. Remember that pay is not the final pay, that is just to show you the fee price page then you will still see and pay in beneath. Like I checked today, the fee is still high. Example:Amount to send: 0.004Mining fee: 0.0000929Fee Rate: 43.8 sat/vBTarget : Within 25 blocksThat means the fee is still high.",

If I go lower what exactly could happened compared to this metric?As far as my observation goes, it always reflects the fees on the \"no priority\" list on mempool.space. According to mempool.space faq, it is:QuoteNo Priority. This figure is either 2x the minimum feerate, or the Low Priority feerate (whichever is lower). Consider using this feerate if you are in no rush and don't mind if confirmation takes a while.Source: https://mempool.space/docs/faq#looking-up-fee-estimatesCMIIW. bitmover might be able to clear this up after he updated the faq, which he already plans to do so.",

I don't really know anymore how it calculates the fee, there was a difference of 2 satoshis between the Low priority and Medium priority fees.Unless you want to share the tx there can be only speculations but from my own experience:I paid near the minimum next block fee as it was a bit of a priority to get it confirmed, there was a small dump before the next block that pushed my tx outside of it but the second block was mined just a minute after so my tx was in the top paying ones and some with just 1/2 got confirmed also.So technically I paid twice as much, but in any other situation, I would have paid the minimum.Since you mentioned only a 2sat/b difference this must have happened just like in my case, in the low fees era, so, not applicable anymore right now.Quote from: bitmover on May 29, 2023, 03:49:53 PMThe truth is that there is no reliable source of fee prediction, because no one really knows when the next block will be mined.It may takes 10minutes, or 10 seconds or just 40 minutes.On top of that, nobody knows the incoming transactions rates, you can have a normal time with just the average 2-15tx/s or you can have somebody dumping 5000 in one go as Binance did a few months ago and this will ruin every single prediction made in the last hour, turning next block transactions into next day priority.",

The best we have so far, as far as I know.Don't get me wrong, I don't complain your service, I just got very angry at mempool.space but now I analyzed the block and I can confirm that absolutely everything was okay on mempool.space, so I'm sorry about that!Here is what happened:I made a transaction, it got immediately green-colored mark but with 0 confirmation (that happens on mempool.space when your transaction gets picked almost immediately) and then the miners manually added lots of low-fee transactions, and when you see the fee range of block on mempool.space, that includes both, automatically included and manually added transactions. So, when the block become finally mined and mempool.space analyzed the transaction fees, it showed me that I paid 2x more than what was necessary.",
