And it it understood that any information as regards to anything that's happening around the crypto space can be achieved here unless they're information that isn't related to crytocurrencies especially bitcoin but moreover every other information that may not be bitcoin related are still covered in off-topic forum so almost everything we seek within the crypto space have been made available on this forum",

I understand you're trying to make a useful impact but this forum have lasted for a decade and more and updates and/or news have been taking place if it was so important for news of such as mentioned above to have a sub-board it would have been done, because it's not too relevant or it has been covered by offtopics and other board that is why it has not been included as a sub-board of it's own.",

They join those threads to spam and get posts for their campaigns. I have been complaining about this too but it seems to be normal for most of them so I just ignored most of those post. They don't really care about the forum but care only about their campaigns and post count, whereas contributing to this spams. It's so unfortunate that people that feel like senior colleagues are not mature enough to speak up for what they claim to be.Should have just added this to the above comment but noticed it late while I already hit the post button",
