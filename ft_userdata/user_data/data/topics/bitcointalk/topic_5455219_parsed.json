I don't think that's ever going to be possible. This is because the exchanges and platforms that you are referring to are all business-oriented, which means they are there to make profit and not losses. No matter how little the fee turns out to be, they just have to charge it, and exchanges have the feature of allowing others to pay for the next person's withdrawal fee because your fee is always automatic if you want to withdraw.The best option you have is to either wait patiently for the transaction fee to reduce a little more to the level that you can pay, or you shouldn't go to a centralized exchange to buy your Bitcoin at all. Maybe some P2P options might help since you are allowed to choose which fee rate you want to use and execute your transaction, but I'm not sure how much different it might be from what the centralized exchanges will charge.",

      "body": "When discussing centralized exchanges, it's important to note that withdrawal fees are a significant factor to consider. These fees should not be confused with transaction fees, as exchanges typically charge higher withdrawal fees than what they actually pay for transaction costs. This is because exchanges engage in a large volume of transactions, which allows them to negotiate lower transaction fees. Ultimately, their goal is to generate profit from users rather than cover their fees. While it is possible to have control over fees in non-custodial wallets like Electrum, not all wallets offer this customization feature. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect reduced fees from exchanges. It's worth mentioning that withdrawal fees encompass both transaction and processing fees and serve as a source of revenue for exchanges.",

You can not send your bitcoins from your exchange account to Electrum wallet. You don't have rights per Terms of service and don't have private key to make any transaction on chain.

Individuals who have just made a large withdrawal do not mind bearing such fees. However, for users who withdraw smaller amounts, they need to promptly seek alternatives in order to maximize their balances.As long as this exchange continues to provide reliable and secure services, the issue of withdrawal fees will only be a concern for crypto users with small balances. There are still many users with significant balances who remain unaffected by this fee problem.",
