As the saying goes a fool and their money are soon parted.Altcoins are similar to romance scams, phishing scams, tech support scams, etc. but using a lot of high tech buzzwords and hype to take scamming to the next level. Which is why the scam and fraud industry is a multi-billion dollar business and growing every year. Sadly it isn't difficult to take advantage of the average person, you just have to appeal to their human greed, ignorance and stupidity.",

However in your analysis you said the decline percent is 4.5% for bitcoin which is not on the high side compared to those altcoins you talked about their decline percenage rate being higher. We understand that the market is volatile, which is natural, but why risk on investing on altcoins that you know that you are at a greater risk of loss if bitcoin just experience a little decline, some of those altcoin project are just looking for a little stumble in the market for them to use as excuse to end their project.",

If the price of Bitcoin falls, it recovers quickly. But if the altcoin price falls then it becomes very difficult to recover. Bitcoin started to rise again, reaching around 99k. But you will find that altcoins will not recover easily. So if you want to invest, do it in a trusted currency like bitcoin, don't go to altcoins. Altcoins are very risky, if you lose it you won't get it back.",

And it is altcoin developers' fault as well as the users who only care about making money!Innovation mostly died in the cryptocurrency world and over the past decade we've seen very little of it. Instead we've seen so many money grab projects that are created to be pumped and dumped, and people love them. Therefore that's what we mostly see in the altcoin market.Basically every time I hear someone say this new coin is \"better\" than bitcoin, I know I'm most probably dealing with a shitcoin and it makes me sad because I really like this technology and want to see it improve...When that's what they create (useless coins) they obviously have no potential and people obviously don't have any faith in them. So when the only useful currency makes any kind of move, they dump their altcoin bags and come to the bitcoin market. When that move is in the downward direction, they also panic and sell their altcoins more than they sell their bitcoin. Therefore we see a bigger altcoin dump every time.",

In contrast to several other tokens that are still making low, even though the current Bitcoin price is at $98k, this is very frustrating considering that when the Bitcoin price drops it will have an impact on other tokens to go down, unlike when Bitcoin goes back up, altcoins will remain sideaway at low prices.",

When Bitcoin jumps, altcoins jump too and vice versa. I am obviously not counting meme coins here as these are not real coins. I think it happens due to the dominance of Bitcoin on the crypto market. Every single altcoins can be traded with Bitcoin in almost all exchanges. So when the value of Bitcoin changes, it impacts the value of the altcoins as well.

Even if there are other Altcoins that are actually trying to innovate something I can agree with you that 99% of other coins are just simply duplicate and lack any proper innovation. Many will say bitcoin is the first coin and that’s why it takes the lead and I usually debunk this and simply say that bitcoin utility is what drives it or gives it its value and been considered as investment. Bitcoin dump usually signifies that there is a negative impact on the market and as such every investors usually go for very volatile coins that’s why the Altcoins usually suffer more because they are not guaranteed of survival after every huge dump. For bitcoin it’s investors know that even after dump their is belief it will come back up again but Altcoins doesn’t have that guarantee. Reasons why they heavily hit most especially those without any utility",

I mean likening Bitcoin to a father in a family who has to earn a living or income for his family and if he is sick or something happens that causes him to be unable to work then his family will starve or other things that can harm his family and vice versa if he can work well then his family will be happy and will get enough food and can meet all their needs.
