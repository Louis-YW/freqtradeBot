Quiet confused by this.  Could you elaborate further? I don't expect average people know about merkle tree or have serious privacy concern.Quote from: jackg on November 21, 2022, 03:05:15 AMHave you got a link?My quick search lead me to this article, https://bitslog.com/2018/06/09/leaf-node-weakness-in-bitcoin-merkle-tree-design/. Although this article is about security concern, not privacy.Yes, only very few will know about it even in the future, like most people know how to use Apps but not really know the technology behind. And, I cannot elaborate futher because it is come from a offline meeting, some guests said so, them though they don't want others know about their transactions from Merkle Tree, because assets or property are belong to them， I guess it is like people don't want to be so transperant.Quote from: NotATether on November 21, 2022, 04:47:36 AMMerkle Trees are just binary trees of transaction hashes. Each branch contains two other child branches, and the leaves contain a single transaction. The root merkle hash is what is included in a mined block. I am unaware of any techniques that can be applied on Merkle trees that could result in unauthorized transactions being mined.So it is a proof of real transactions then.",

It might be that they meant something else and just used merkle root as a placeholder unless they're not actually cryptoskeptic. There's nothing that has come up that I have read that means this would cause problems with full nodes and not spv clients.A simple fix for this when using an spv client would be to double check a txid (which is what a lot of people do so it's unlikely a repeatable attack vector after being used a few times).",

I am unaware of any techniques that can be applied on Merkle trees that could result in unauthorized transactions being mined.So it is a proof of real transactions then. In short, yes. Although it's more accurate to say merkle tree is used as proof the transaction is included inside certain block.Oh~ Got it. That's a much better explaination.Quote from: jackg on November 23, 2022, 05:56:33 PMQuote from: kira_Lee on November 22, 2022, 01:16:00 AMQuote from: jackg on November 21, 2022, 03:05:15 AMHave you got a link?A merkle root tree is a data structure.
