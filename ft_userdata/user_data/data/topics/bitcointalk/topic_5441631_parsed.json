I can see an object with a torch, but I looked for Theymos and tried hard enough to find him and the moon. But in the end I am not able to find anything that refers to Theymos. Can you please explain your artwork? Though my first impression of the art is not positive.",

In your OP it looks as if theymos is scared of something and tries to stay as far as possible like going to sit on the moon in the background, and if you look closely, you can see that satoshi is also scared of something because the way he is looking the other way.The torch you are depicting was used by a whore to set fire on the great persepolis palace in ancient Iran, and theÂ  whore you call statue of lady liberty is the same notorious cunt facing east with a torch in her hand to remind us what they did with one of the greatest civilizations in human history.Â  Btw, theymos doesn't kneel, that's the job for whores to perform a BJ. A bitcoiner never bends a knee, remember that.ðŸ˜‰",

I made a piece of art that depicts satoshi handing the forum over to theymos.Here it is:satoshi is the one passing the torch. theymos is kneeling on the moon.Personally, I'm using it as my wallpaper. You guys may use it the same way or any way you like.I'm a newer forum member, having only been on here for a year and some change. I would, however, love to hear what some OG bitcoiners think of this piece.<3Wow this is really cool man! Great work here looks very interesting. What did you use to create this?",

Those 8 planets have their own appearance, are you hope the @OP to draw Saturn without a ring around?  anyway the art you provide and the @OP drawing are completely different. I wouldn't call it plagiarism since it's not from someone art or brand, it's a science which can't be changed.How about this? I'm pretty sure everyone know the original art lol.I think what @OP mean is Bitcoin is universal and there's no one can stop it.",
