By trying to spread this scam you are becoming a scammer as well, and even if you made money out of this, which I doubt unless you are the one that created the scheme, all of it would come from scamming other people, something that is simply unacceptable to me.",

Based purely from my experience, ponzi-schemes are attractive enough to get the attention of newbies and ultimately invest on their website. On the first few days, you can actually see your investments increasing but after a week, the website will start to crash, thereby causing you to lose everything on the process.That is why, I really warn everyone to avoid these kinds of projects as it would only lead to one result- you losing your precious resources and/or capital.",

(This is called initial investments made by the site to grab more big investors). Once the investors gain trust from the site, they invest more and this time big amount. The site waits for it and hence does an exit scam.It’s always advised to not go for these types of scheme, and don’t try to make yourself rich overnight.Act wisely and invest cautiously.Good luck everyone.",
