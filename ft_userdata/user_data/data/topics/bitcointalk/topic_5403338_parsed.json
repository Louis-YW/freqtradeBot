  "content": "Founder of SchiffGold and CEO of Euro Pacific Capital Peter Schiff has taken to Twitter to comment on the return of Bitcoin above the $20,000 level. He does not believe the growth will continue. \"$20K is the new $30K\" for Bitcoin Schiff has warned that Bitcoin holders should not get excited about BTC going back above the $20,000 line. He believes that $20,000 is \"the new $30,000\" and that such small rises are normal for a big decline. Big drops do not occur in a single line, he added, and the slow crash is \"extremely orderly.\"Schiff also stated that he does not yet see any signs of a capitulation that would signify a bottom of the current bear market for crypto. Several times earlier this year, Schiff shared a prediction that Bitcoin would fall as low as to test $6,000. Over the weekend, he tweeted that his earlier prediction of the cryptocurrency market dropping below the $800 billion mark had been confirmed, but it took a few more days and altcoins held up better than he expected them too. \"Gold has risen 40% since 2017 unlike BTC\" Even then Between Bitcoin and Gold I prefer invest to Bitcoin.

I frankly, do not expect anything positive coming out from such people! Bitcoin goes through a bear cycle like many other assets. It's very similar to what we have seen back in 2017-18 phase. So if you have the guts to stay invested and accumulate along the way, the reward can be way better that you could imagine.",

I think that the only moments he was not seeing the doom of Bitcoin were in the ATH days. But I'm not sure even about then.For somebody who pretends to be against Bitcoin, this guy tweets far too much about it. However, I oddly find his tweets entertaining and I see them as advertising (!).But the fact he's trolling continuously makes his tweets far from something to be taken serious.However, like a broken clock that show the correct time twice a day, he may be right: the bear market may indeed not be over yet. Caution is in order for now.",

Although the bottom is really not certain if we already hit or not. Peter Schiff will never change his side unless he will be able to purchase again at lower price. Once a hater always a hater is the perfect saying on article like this. We should just ignore his existence since he didn't contribute well on the growth of Bitcoin. People is just using his nonsens tweet to spread more fud about Bitcoin.Without a doubt it is a mistake to expect anything but criticism when it comes to Peter Schiff talking about bitcoin, however this routine is getting old, how many times is Peter Schiff going to use the same arguments to try to prove his point that gold is better than bitcoin? At this point his routine is so well known that a great deal of people can anticipate the criticism that he is going to use this time around, so it is better to not waste our time with someone like him.",

Constantly predicting crashes and then getting vocal during bearish market cycles which is a pretty normal scenario in every market, only to go silent again when the bulls take over is not being smart or seeing things early, it's just being a critic; and not a constructive one at that.At best, he is just being polarising cause he knows Bitcoin is a trend that will get him traffic and the more insane his criticisms are the more audience he gets.",

We also know Bitcoin does go up and up, but only spends about 10% of its lifetime in incremental steps up, and 90% meandering and crashing. So it's a long game for both, but perhaps gold doesn't have the heartache and patience required of Bitcoin holders.But we knew that. We've been taught all of that from history, experienced it ourselves, and are getting schooled all over again.We knew that... right guys?",
