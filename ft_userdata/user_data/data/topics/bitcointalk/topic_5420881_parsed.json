  "content": "2022 has been one of the most significant eventful years of crypto history. Enormous exploits, hacks, and scam events occurred that this year will be remembered as one of the badass years for the crypto industry after Mr.Gox. Here are some major incidents that will happen in the crypto industry in 2022. QuoteLUNA & UST crash:QuoteLUNA & UST was the most extensive algorithmic stablecoin protocol till May 9 2022, before its collapse. A group of whales put enormous sell pressure to depeg LUNA protocols stablecoin UST, creating panic throughout the crypto space and initiating further UST price crashes. LUNA shows potential growth to 119$ before its value becomes worth the penny. UST's total market free fall from $20B to below $250M, and investor's loss from both coins was around $60B. Terra blockchain still exists, and its old token was rebranded as LUNC.Ronin bridge hack:QuoteIn March 2022, $625M worth of 173,000 ETH and 25.5M USDC was sucked from the Axie ecosystem, one of the top games projects until that point. Lazarus Group led this massive attack by using Ronin Network's cross-chain bridge. This is considered one of the largest Defi exploit in crypto history.CELSIUS:QuoteCelsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 after it lost user money because of its unsustainable business model. Celsius offered their customer up to 18% interest for their crypto deposit which they leveraged in many start-ups and risky projects and took losses. Till now, Celsius owed their users $4.7B worth of crypto.3AC:QuoteThe infamous 3 arrows capital firm headed by Zhu Su and Kyle Davies failed soon after Luna did, leaving creditors with $3.5 billion of debt as they went on the run. Strangely, both individuals have returned to Twitter in the past week amidst all the FTX chaos.SIFU: QuoteSifu was largely to blame for the collapse of Wonderland, the most popular Olympus fork. The coin crashed from a market cap of $2 billion down to a few hundred million and has since bled out to a mere $10 million.WORMHOLE: QuoteBridges were one of the most popular targets of hackers and exploiters this year, and Wormhole’s vulnerability resulted in a loss of $326 million. This situation was unique, however, in that, a full bailout was provided by Jump crypto.BNB: QuoteThe most recent and second largest bridge hack was the official BNB bridge hack of $586 million. This resulted in a chaotic mess across multiple chains as the attacker tried to escape before funds were frozen.FTX/ALAMEDA: QuoteI don’t think I need to remind you all about this, but this list would not be complete without these two. This collapse has likely been the most publicized and damaging crypto has seen. In the coming weeks, we will almost certainly continue to discover that more crypto platforms, funds, or other entities are also insolvent due to the FTX/Alameda situation. The first so far has been BlockFi as they have halted withdrawals.Source: https://twitter.com/StackerSatoshi/status/1591774088011579392?s=20&t=fhJ0z8GioDmPDJ1hx-Uisw2022 isn't ended. We could see more exchange involved. Crypto.com and Gate.io are doing internal transactions to show their proof of reserve. Many users withdraw their funds in a rush from those exchanges.",

      "body": "I could definitely see a few more coming. But you gotta go back and see a few more years back in the day, I remember clearly there were a lot of years where the amount of bitcoins that were shifting hands or being stolen would be insane to consider right now. Just the fact that mt.gox already got hacked is a big proof of that, if we are talking about \"crypto\" size, that was the biggest and will never be anything like that again, sure the dollar price was lower back in those days so it wasn't a big news, but calculate how much was wrong with today's money and you would be going insane when you see the price.",

Many users withdraw their funds in a rush from those exchanges.Because of the rumors circulating online that these exchanges might be the next one to be failed, many are panicking and getting their money out of those exchanges which I think should be done in the first place since storing money on exchanges is not advisable at all. Learn from what happened in the past, and don’t do the same mistake again. Few more days before the end of 2022, worst trend might still happen so be ready for that and as much as possible, store your crypto in a more secured wallet which you can access anytime.",

For example, Meta Corporation announced the launch of the Metaverse project, and then recently it was announced that Instagram will support the Polygon network for NFT services, Twitter supports the Lightning Network and Ethereum for sending TIPS, and then Alon Mask, which supports Dodge Coin, buys the Twitter platform.It has been an eventful year that Bitcoin has reached record levels that no one would have imagined going down.",

      "body": "Simply because peak price of cryptos and its downfall happened on the same year but this is no longer surprising. The market value of cryptos cannot continuously increase constantly. There will always be times wherein its market price would fall; could be on a sudden or gradually. This simply makes it volatile. The problem now is when will the market price of not only Bitcoin but also with other cryptos, go up again? If we would base on the previous years, there are times bearish market last for more than a year. But as I've mentioned, nothing is consistent and constant. It could be longer at the present but it could also be shorter .Knowing that no one has assurance of the possible time for uprise, you as an investor may decide whether to use yhis opportunity to invest for more or sell due to necessity. Eitherway would be valid because that is your investment in the first place.",

People shouldn't panic but they must face the consequences because they insist to invest here in first place even after knowing that there is a big risk that entails in crypto. Panicking doesn't help but it will only make the situation more worse.2022 is one of the worst years but I think it's okay to have a year like this sometimes.

Because last year, when it coincided with your entry into this forum, there was not much price decline in the market, but a bigger and more substantial increase. And if it is calculated with this year, it is indeed a very large price decline that has been witnessed by many people so that the utilization will obviously be different this year.But if you were already in the market in 2018, then obviously you have seen and felt a great decline at that time even though the amount of decline at that time was slightly different from the amount of price decline at the beginning of this year.",
