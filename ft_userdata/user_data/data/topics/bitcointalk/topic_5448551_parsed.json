Am I right?The more inputs you have, the more fee you have to pay to miners. By the way, 15,000 satoshi is worth around 4.5 dollars, not 15 dollars.",

And it is a popular and trusted bitcoin wallet.  So there is no opportunity to say scam. Bitcoin transaction fees are not determined by any wallet.  It is determined by the minor.  And the more transactions it tries to complete in a single moment, the higher the fee.  And if you have selected the fast transfer option, then the fee will be slightly higher. Because the transaction with higher fee is given fast priority to get block confirmation. I think you tried a quick transfer which is why your fee is comparatively higher. Waller cannot be held responsible for this",

But setting it to 4 sat/vbyte would be better this time around. Although even if he set the fee to 1 sat/vbyte, the opt-in RBF is by default on both Electrum and Bluewallet.",

It's much more simple using Trust Wallet, and the fee can also be customized, but note that the lower the fee you are willing to pay the longer it might take for the transaction to be executed.

It's not that miners can charge you any amount they want. Whenever you make a bitcoin transaction, you set a fee rate and miners prioritize transactions based on their fee rate.",

So, the minimum fee rate you can set for your transaction is 1 sat/vbyte. Note that the transaction fee equals to the fee rate multiplied by (virtual) size of transaction and miners prioritize transactions based on their fee rate, not their absolute fee. There is no such thing as 50 sat per transaction.",

Maybe it was good back in the days where we could play around with some faucets and send them to our online wallet, but it's not safe to use them for more than a few k sats. Easiest way to have an address without downloading a wallet is using bitaddress.org using a browser in guest mode and disconnecting the net, generating keys, saving then, closing the browser. Then you could reconnect, but this is still for small amounts, for large amounts produce your keys on a system that never connects to the net and don't print or save the keys on flash drives, just carefully write them down, this is the best way.You should also use electrum instead.",

When I was still using it, the network was clog-free and there's no problem about the fees but then it's still an online wallet that has brought problem to many users. So, from .info domain to .com and still nothing has changed from its service although they are also upgrading some of its features but it has never enticed me to be back using it. While the fee is being determined by the network if it's empty or not, if it's empty then the fees won't be that much and you have to take note that these wallets are also taking some little commission for the fees that they ask. You can set priorities and increase the fee for the speed or adjust it a little back if you're patient enough to wait until your transaction is confirmed. Your problem is much better and solvable than of those that they can longer recover their wallets there even if they've got the recovery phrases because the retrieval process has changed for them.",

That wallet offers a user the option to select low fees or high fees.
