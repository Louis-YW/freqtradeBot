  "content": "QuoteReuters reported that China told state-owned banks to get ready to sell dollars and buy yuan in an effort to prop up the local currency. The move could stem the yuan's fall, as it remains on track for its largest annual loss against the dollar since 1994. A hawkish Fed has pushed the dollar to 20-year highs this year, pressuring currencies around the world. The People's Bank of China has told major state-run banks to prepare to shed dollar holdings while snapping up offshore yuan, which has continued to fall despite prior interventions, sources told Reuters.The scale of this latest effort to prop up the yuan will be big and could provide a floor to the Chinese currency, according to the report.The amount of dollars to be sold hasn't been decided yet, but Reuters said it will primarily involve the state banks' currency reserves. Their offshore branches, including those based in Hong Kong, New York and London, were ordered to review offshore yuan holdings and check to see that dollar reserves are ready. On Thursday, the yuan fell 0.9% to 7.1340 against the dollar and is on track for its worst annual decline since 1994, having lost more than 11% so far this year. Earlier this week, China's offshore yuan this week depreciated to a record-low against the greenback, and its domestic unit fell to its weakest level since the 2008 financial crisis.The Federal Reserve's hawkish policy path has bolstered the dollar to 20-year highs this year, putting pressure on other central banks and triggering a \"reverse currency war.\"While a weaker currency can sometimes be beneficial, as it means exports get cheaper, the yuan's recent decline below the psychological threshold of 7-per-dollar has raised concerns. The People's Bank of China has consistently imposed a strong bias to its currency reference rate to help support the yuan. Central bank officials have also issued verbal warnings against speculating on the yuan and increased the cost of shorting the currency.But it has refrained from raising benchmark rates and instead has been easing them in an effort to spark growth in an economy that's been dragged down by COVID-19 lockdowns, a real estate crash, and supply chain snags. https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/china-bank-dollar-yuan-currency-markets-economy-beijing-fed-hike-2022-9....It appears china is dumping the US dollar to buy more of their own native currency the yuan. This approach contrasts sharply with china's past strategy of devaluing the yuan to boost chinese exports.Exports being the backbone of china's economy. Any move china makes which could carry negative effects on export markets bears watching.Rising fossil fuel prices also carry a negative impact on the shipping of chinese exports overseas. Would anyone here recommend selling the US dollar to buy the chinese yuan? If you dumped assets to fund purchasing something today. What would it be?",

The normal response to news like this is to expect the Yuan to rise against the dollar in the short term, so a priori a short move like the one you are talking about would make sense. But markets are very irrational and you never know what might happen. If I were to consider doing so, I would only do so with a small part of my portfolio.",

There is definitely an economic war going on which is getting more intense and China has been attacking US in any form they can, so targeting the dollar is always on the agenda.But unless you can find a more reliable source than Reuters (which is well known for spreading propaganda), I'd say no.Quote from: Hydrogen on October 03, 2022, 11:43:41 PMThis approach contrasts sharply with china's past strategy of devaluing the yuan to boost chinese exports.Keep in mind that China only devalues Yuan as long as it keeps their prices competitive not indefinitely. These days that their competitors in other regions (specifically in EU) are struggling with the massively increasing production costs, that gives China a much better advantage where they don't need to devalue their currency as much to remain competitive. The winning of that competition is ensured as other currencies are heavily devalued.",

This approach contrasts sharply with china's past strategy of devaluing the yuan to boost chinese exports.Because it's one thing to devalue your currency by a few points to keep the balance between imports and exports, and it's a different thing when it dumps to the lowest value in 10 years and for a decade you've become a net food importer, importing 100 billion of food mainly from, guess who, the US. Chian is heavenly dependent on soybeans, corn, and pork, not even counting oil and other raw materials from Australia for example, but food security is the top priority for the CCP, the ghost of the 59-61 famine won't let them sleep at night if even a slight danger is threatening this.That's why they are auctioning stockpiles after a stockpile of soybeans and corn and pork to keep prices stable,Quote18 Apr 2022  China auctions 502,900 mt of soybean imports from reservesOn May 07, 2022 China to auction 314,000 tons of imported soybeansSep 29, 2022 China would auction off 500,000 MT of imported soybeans from state-owned reservesPork costs in China, the world’s biggest consumer, rose an average of 22.5% last monthhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/13/chinese-pork-prices-surge-to-new-high-prompting-authorities-to-actEach country has its own priorities and each government sees different dangers and different things that might trigger the population to revolt, for some its a guy getting shot in the street because of his color, for others is the price of pork for others is a piece of cloth on women's head.Cina will sacrifice half or all of its growth to keep food prices at bay, that's a line nobody will dare cross.",

It's all a matter of how big those are and if it's worth long term to do it, as numerous countries have failed, and some have decided it's not worth it and they can't stop it anyhow so they nearly gave up on this method, like Turkey for example.",
