Even if their prediction are wrong, they still get a lot followers although it's actually haters. But follower is still follower, those hater can help to increase the expert name and follower.",

They are social media experts, so they know what the trend always is and how best to gain attention with it. Cryptocurrency is a big topic among youths, so what better way to gain the attention of the youths if not to act in a way like an expert in what is interesting them. They take up these roles as experts in cryptocurrency to gain more audience, followers and influence of people. Some of the predictions they have made that maybe entered or worked were most likely still not their predictions but borrowed predictions from people. I have developed the culture for a long time now not to take people on social media without results serious, because social media can be misleading.",

I assume so because no expert can really predict correctly regarding prices let alone decide if Bitcoin will become extinct.If the expert is active on social media which always discusses Bitcoin, it is nothing more than to find followers so that he can benefit from his social media.Quote from: Fiatless on January 21, 2023, 06:42:12 AMHappy bull run.Not yet. For me, it is not certain that the current condition is running fortresses. There are other possibilities that are more likely to lead to another correction. The positive thing behind the current market green for me is that price support is already at $20K - $21K.",

Or popular people with little to zero influence on things. To predict with 100% accuracy, you need to see clearly to judge right. And your truthfulness/honesty and wisdom alone are enough to influence the price of Bitcoin and other things. In evil and deceptive system the honest and influential ones are hidden while the fools & non-influential ones are popular. There is actually a true Bitcoin Master. He is humble and unpopular and can actually control the price from wherever he wants.  The popular ones are fakes.",
