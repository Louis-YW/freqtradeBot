Could this be a guarantee that users' funds on the FTX exchange will be refunded or given to the user back?It won't be easy to get full refunds to all customers after a bankruptcy occurs. Maybe customers will get refund partially for their capital on the collapsed exchange but I am sure they will not get a full one. The leftover of collapsed exchange does not have enough money to fully refund all users.Even refund happens, it would take very long time, maybe take years. We have an example of Mt. Gox exchange and years after the CEO was arrested, a lot of lawsuits, until now, that case has still been ended and customers who have lost money on Mt. Gox have yet received any refund.",

Just like Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos, Sam will have to pay the many frauds he did and it does not matter to me if creditors will get the money owed to them but certainly they are entitled to get some as there are many asserts still left intact by FTX so it is a matter of legally liquidating them. Sam tried to make his name a little bit more acceptable with his interviews and with the mainstream media playing along...but the immense pressure coming from different directions for law enforcers to do what they should be doing has finally come to the arrest of the man...definitely no more the golden boy of the crypto industry he is now its Bernie Madoff version.",

Too many big creditors lost their money trusting Sam, and that played a big part in making the arrest decision so quickly. As much as Sam hopes and plans for a new business that could justify him in the future, he will have to dream while in prison for a significant time. At least, I really want to believe it.",
