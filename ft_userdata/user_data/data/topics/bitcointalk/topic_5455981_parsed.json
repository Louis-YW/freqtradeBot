Few days ago everything was fine and text size was normal. Did anyone faced similar issue and how to fix it?Although, I don't use the website on an Android based device, but I also have to zoom in to read the posts on my PC because of the small text. I think this thing might be related to our display's resolution and is not an issue from website. I'm also using Chrome browser but the PC version. I have to zoom the site up-to 200% to write replies. But, on PC it's still manageable and doesn't require much effort to zoom up-to 200% or more in order to write a reply. I think you should try to increase text and font size on your Android device and that might solve the problem for you. Because when I was using Android based smartphone I used to do that thing and most of the times it would work on applications and web browsers. You may also check if your browser has built-in text settings and change the text-size in those settings as well so you might be able to read the reply without any issue.",

As I said, everything was fine, text size was big enough to read it easy. And I haven't changed any settings, so, no idea why it's changed. Now tried to find how to change it in settings, but didn't found.",

I'm sure that by Â clearing those Cookies and other site related data your browser's previous setting will be restored. If that doesn't work then you should go to App info and click on clear the cache, and then click on clear all data. That will most probably solve your problem and the previous setting will be restored.",

Text size settings is available on chrome and all you have to do is go to settings and tap on accessibility then you will see the text size scale but you still have to zoom the page a little bit but I think it's fine. If not found in settings then accessibility then try updating the app then go to settings and accessibility again.",

I looked at accesibility settings and I see that text size is at 100%, so, it's not related with my browser settings.Now I tried to check how it looks on Firefox and it's same little text..So, I guess that I will have to zoom in a bit more. Reset settings is an option, but don't really want to do that, as all my logins and preferences will be gone.",

Did anyone faced similar issue and how to fix it?This is very common if you're the type that uses a mobile phone to log in to the forum, in most cases you have to zoom out to be able to see the text characters, those uses to the computer or desktop version may not have this kind of stuff experience but am very sure that the smart phone user's were already used to zooming in and out while making a reply on the forum comment section, I don't think it's a new development or change that was just implemented.",
