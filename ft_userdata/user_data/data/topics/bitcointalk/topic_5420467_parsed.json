      "body": "Bitcoin is the pioneer in the crypto market. That's the reason why bitcoin is so popular right now. People have invested millions of dollars into mining bitcoin which keeps the network secured. So it is safe to say that bitcoin is expected to have demands always. But I don't think we should be one sighted at all, especially when it comes to investment. There are many other cryptos in the market which are excellent as well and have different use cases which are practical. We should not overlook them for our own benefit. Bitcoin is good but there are other cryptos which are good too. So bitcoin should not be your only last resort. That's stupidity!",

I don't find it wrong to trade with altcoins, the reason behind trading is to get profit, so why disable the option of getting more profit and fast phase trading that can be observed in altcoin market.  We just need to be vigilant of the scam projects and frauds that disguise as cryptocurrency projects.Quote from: coinbaazar marketplace on November 11, 2022, 05:44:20 AMMost Altcoin Exchanges sustained for a period of 1-3 years , and somehow are on the verge of getting closed, due to this (fraud to innocent people)There is always rise and fall of a company, even company that take advantage of Bitcoin shut down.  Company bankruptcy is normal.Quote from: coinbaazar marketplace on November 11, 2022, 05:44:20 AMOne more thing according to my observation people have not even taken a grasp of Bitcoin completely 3-4 years back when this all hyped altcoins and exchanges came into market with the intent of making fortunes in a jiffy, where is some has already managed to do so, on the people's money.. So you are saying you fully grasp Bitcoin completely?Quote from: coinbaazar marketplace on November 11, 2022, 05:44:20 AM\"Its rightly said, Only One Cryptocurrency can replace Bitcoins and that is Bitcoin Itself\" I always believe that in due time, another cryptocurrency will take over Bitcoin's dominance.  There is nothing constant in this world but change.  and besides, you cannot replace yourself same goes with Bitcoin.  Quote from: coinbaazar marketplace on November 11, 2022, 05:44:20 AMLet's hope Bitcoin should reach to maximum people and everyone should feel safe and secure like always ...We all hope this thing to happen, more adoption, more demand, which will result in higher prices and thus more profit for early takers.",

      "body": "How does Bitcoin solve the problem of scammy exchanges? The original exchange exit scam happened with Mt. Gox - a Bitcoin-only exchange. Bitcoin protocol doesn't have in-built fiat trading capability, so there must be exchanges in the ecosystem, and p2p exchanges like real life meetings, direct bank transfers and DEXs can't fill the full demand for exchanging BTC and fiat, because not all people want to trade in such risky way. That's where centralized exchanges come in, but because they are not properly regulated, there's a high chance of them doing shady things that eventually make them collapse.",

The only viable solution to the CEX mess is to start using DEX.Well why people not talk about peer-to-peer exchanges , which is probably where people can trade safely ..even by holding their coins into their own hardware wallet or any other exchange ... Thats what i believe Cex was meant to give people a chance to earn by being trustworthy.. But looking at current situations ..it seems most of them are involved in some or other mess... and ultimately Bitcoin comes out to be winner in all these Hue and Cry in the crypto world...",

There is also differences in interfaces and features that may seem less convenient to some hardcore traders. Trading volume in some cases is a factor too.",
