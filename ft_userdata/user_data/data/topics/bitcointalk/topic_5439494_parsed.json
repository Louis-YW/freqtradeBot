Most of the prizes will be in USDT, obviously the more participants there will be, the more we will increase the prize pools.Most of the events will be accessible to all users. However, there will be some events accessible only to certain roles (role system)Role systemTo reward the most active users and the one that contributes more to the community we have created a role system on discord.Upon reaching certain objectives, users will be rewarded with a role of greater importance and with various prizes in USDT.For the launch, the first 100 users will be rewarded with the Founding Member role which will allow access to all events.PartnershipsTo start we got a partnership with the BingX exchange.This partnership allows us to create custom events with BingX-sponsored prizes in addition to our own events. There will also be BingX staff members on our platform who will offer faster support.Collaborations with other exchanges will come in the near future.Why we chose BingX as our first collaboration:1) It has very low commissions (0.045%)2) Does not require KYC3) It has a very simple and intuitive interface (ideal for novice users)4) It has many cool features like Copy Trading (also from external platforms like Binance), Demo Trading, has a bot for Grid Trading, etc.5) Like many exchanges, after the collapse of FTX it published its Proof of reserve. We also did our research and it turned out that BingX in its 6 years of life has never had problems with security.6) It is possible to trade Index, Forex, Commodities with cryptocurrencies directly from the platform.I'll leave the site and discord link if you want some more detailed information!https://www.gatexacademy.com/https://discord.gg/QHYKyvkVHb I wish everyone a good evening",
