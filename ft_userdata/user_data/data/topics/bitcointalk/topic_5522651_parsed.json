  "content": "I'm into crypto since 2013.Since the beginning I've always seen cryptos as an instrument of liberation from government slavery and the tiranny of central banks and an empowering tool for the poorest.Yes I'm glad BTC has become more valuable with time but I'm in firstly because I always intended it as an instrument to build a better world. Above green candles I'm more glad when I see an interview with a poor guy from africa using btc for micropayment or a pakistani woman using it to free herself from a system that would otherwise repress her.During all of these years I've been always skeptical about the different random guys shouting and putting themselves as great defender of btc from Peter McCormack, to bitcoinboy, from Tone Ways to any possible other person which acts as influencer.When there was the blocksize war I put myself in the middle between Roger Ver and Jimmy Song but with time I've built a maximalist portfolio mainly with btc.I also \"hodl\" eth and xmr.Now that btc has gone mainstream it looks to be the time to newer big players and cryptos have become only as a way to make money from BlackRock to Microstrategy.It looks everyone is forgiving where we are coming from. Not to mention people like trump who once called btc a scam.The old ideals and the utopia for a better future are becoming only a rich scheme.I've recently watched an interview with this new big idol Michael Saylor saying that 300k fee per transaction is ok and I'm losing my faith in btc.I fear we are going into a direction where one day (if not even now) we'll be hostage of these big players overtaking the community ideals despite any decentralization.These people are here to make money. They care zero about africans or privacy and they can dictate where the network has to go.These people are not with us.They are against us.We are not the same.What do you think about?",

Spike in fee is not okay at all. Did you see when the fee got to 2000 sat/vbyte? Even getting to 500 sat/vbyte is not okay at all. It would be good if the fee is not going more than 10 sat/vbyte.Also there is nothing to be worried about the institutional investors. If theyt do not get involved, that means bitcoin may not be significant as it is now. Institutions are after something that has promising future.",

In the US itself, there are so many homeless and there are many who cannot afford to pay their bills even after working two shifts or even three.

It is still the most decentralized coin out there, and it still follows its core principles. Let it stay that way.",

The \"get rich quick\" sentiment is nothing new by the way; the novelty is the major institutional involvement.Bitcoin has a quite complex system of checks and balances. If a single big player like Saylor tried to change something fundamentally, e.g. proposing a protocol upgrade and executing pressure on Bitcoin Core developers, then it is still likely that many other actors would reject that upgrade if it is directed against decentralization. An actor wanting to change something has not only to convince the Bitcoin Core devs, but also miners and minor holders. He can of course code his own client, but the 2016/2017 blocksize war showed that this approach is very likely to fail.Still I think the community should stay alert, because that equilibrium is not impossible to change. The cypherpunk values should always be reminded and held up, also by social media influencers. I think this is still the case, judging also by the positive feedback the \"OGs\" (Greg Maxwell etc.) get when they appear here in the forum.My biggest worry would be a Bitcoin dominated by Central Banks which try to influence development. I have nothing against Bitcoin being used as a part of a small strategic reserve of different nations, but if the dominance of these actors is too high, then a distortion of the check and balances system is possible. Again, if the community stays alert probably even Central Banks can't change Bitcoin's character, but if the community's character changes, then the pressure to remain in line with cypherpunk ideals could weaken eventually.",

Nowadays central banks are under governments' full control and do whatever the governments tell them. Even the CBDCs are introduced and are likely to be enforced by the governments and not the central banks. The original demand for CBDCs came from the governments who were afraid they would lose control over the population. so the governments demanded from the central banks to come with a something that would help them counter the spread of BTC as a way to make payment. Then the central banks came up with the idea of CBDCs which are pretty much the old bank (electronic) money under the disguise of crypto/decentralized money (and in fact they are neither of these).So the governments want to keep the old fiat system that allows them to keep the people under full government control. Regarding BTC and other crypto money, the governments want to keep them as fully-transparent commodities that will be traded on exchanges for those who want to invest or play on the market. The recent regulations (AML5, AML6, MiCA, etc.) do everything possible to put crypto under strict government control, essentially defeating the purpose of the crypto as a payment method.",

Yes, they are slowly dying. Especially when centralization dominates the industry. Greedy corporations, banks, and governments are stockpiling BTC for their own benefit. They already dominate the market. Most people now consider BTC to be an investment tool than a currency (store of value). This is NOT what Satoshi wanted. Everything was supposed to be decentralized since day one. Yet, centralized exchanges have a large influence over market prices. With spot Bitcoin ETFs approved in the US and abroad, we've essentially introduced the traditional financial system into Bitcoin. Something that BTC was meant to avoid in the first place. Satoshi created BTC as a response against banks' inherent failures (economic crisis of 2008). Having them on-board, greatly defeats Bitcoin's intended purpose. At least, Bitcoin's open source nature gives us some level of hope. What's stopping someone from creating a truly-decentralized version of it in the future?",

No, he will maximize the potential of Bitcoin as high as possible so that they can sell what is been invested in the future, that's there plan and that's what business is all about.
