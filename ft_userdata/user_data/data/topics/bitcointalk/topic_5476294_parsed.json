With this large chain of transactions I will suggest you bump the first transaction (first parent) using the RBF method if you control the private key to the the address. This will render the other transactions invalid but will Atleast prevent paying too high fee.",

Not a noncustodial wallet?If it is a noncustodial wallet, you can import the seed phrase into Electrum to pump the fee if you want to invalidate the child transactions. But a wallet that flag a transaction to support RBF should also be able to pump the fee.",

I guess waiting is the choice?Paid accelerators are demanding too much and not worth using. Instead of paying too much, the best is to just invalidate the transaction by increasing the first (parent) transaction fee to invalidate other transactions. If he wants to pay coins to other addresses, he can send the coins to all other recipient addresses in one transaction and use fee rate that can make the transaction to have high confirmation priority. Or he can just increase the fee of the last child transaction, using fee rate that is significantly enough to make the transaction get confirmed.",

I never saw Bitcoin fee go back below 20sat/vB for a long time since the bull run started. Are you using trustwallet because I encountered same bullshit situation before using that wallet. Your best chance is to suddenly drop the fee during weekends. Always check mempool suggested fee to have any idea how close your pending transaction to be confirmed.",

He will have to wait much longer. There aren't that many transactions paying +30 sat/vByte currently, and with a bit of luck it could have been confirmed within the next hours. His effective fee rate puts him 15-18 vMB from the top. Perhaps Sunday brings more luck like it did in the past when the mempools used to clear up.@Mulling389Is the transaction time sensitive? Does it have to confirm until a specific point in time in the near future?If not, just wait. Especially if you are sending the coins to yourself. The BTC isn't going anywhere. It will either confirm or not confirm and return to the original address you sent it from if mempools drop it. In that case, you can start over and pay a higher fee.",

Why can't you bump up the fee? Are you the initiator of the transaction? What type of wallet or service did you use? Are you on the receiving end? Do you have access to the private keys of any of the addresses in the transaction chain?",

An old thread of same thing is here and if it has been working from day one we will have had it’s suggestions all round the forum like that of Viabtc. The sites also didn’t provide details of the transaction will get confirmed or the pools they work with as you have said. I will advise OP to just stay away from that site, they probably what they can do is to just rebroadcast transactions and claim it is accelerated.

Bitcoin price increase has nothing really to do with the high transaction fee, it is just congestion by Ordinals that is causing it because of you check they are mostly the ones filling the block space with high transaction amount.Also it is not TrustWallet that did that transaction because it doesn’t have an Opt in RBF bumping option and from the explorer the transaction is RBFed enabled.",
