      "body": "I hope OP is still well since this transaction is still not confirmed until now. I have stuck transaction too from my withdrawal to different casino. The price of Bitcoin drop hard since I withdraw my funds.@Bitmover, can you help me to understand what happened on this case. Why does his transaction is available on sochain while its not visible on other blockchain explorer like mempool. Is sochain an off-chain explorer by the company? When will it appear on other explorer?",

      "body": "The problem here is actually that the transaction OP has linked is the 26th transaction in a chain of unconfirmed transactions. The maximum number of unconfirmed ancestors or descendants by default is 25. You can see the code for this here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e9262ea32a6e1d364fb7974844fadc36f931f8c6/src/policy/policy.h#L59-L65Because OP's transaction exceeds this limit, the vast majority of nodes will not accept it until at least the first unconfirmed parent transaction has been confirmed.There is nothing OP can do here to speed this up. None of the parents are opted in to RBF, and since the chain of transactions has already hit the maximum descendant limit, he cannot use a CPFP since it would also be over the limit and therefore won't be accepted. He just has to wait.",

I don't know if it was successful or not, but there was a discussion about how someone was trying to get someone else to accept a TX that went back to dozens of unconfirmed TXs.IIRC it was back in the 2017 mempool bloat. Have to see if I can find the discussion. Could have been later then that too.-Dave",
