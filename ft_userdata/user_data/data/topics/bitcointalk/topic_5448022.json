So finally even if you are only able to generate 2160 keys, it would be enough if there is no collision in their linked addresses.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/RIPEMD-160In addition, you can theoretically create any private key from the 2^256 range by flipping a coin 256 times in a row.",

And as far as I know, whether it can or not doesn't really matter as long as the number of unique keys generated from a seed is greater than the number of keys being used. Â (I am not an expert)Quote from: studyroom1 on April 08, 2023, 09:55:47 AMwhat i was getting idea that bip32 is 128 bit and in 256 range this cannot simply drive every address as master or first address of HD wallet. BIP-32 generates a sequence of 256-bit numbers. The BIP-39 128-bit entropy value simply defines the starting point of the sequence. Obviously, with a 128-bit source of entropy, not every private key can be the first key in the sequence, but is that important?",

Each depth uses an index which derives a different key and is a 32-bit unsigned integer ergo it can derive 4,294,967,295 keys. With 256 depth we can only derive a total of 1,099,511,627,520 keys using a single master key. This is far smaller from the number of possible private keys.Of course we can ignore this limit easily but then it is breaking the standard and the child master keys can not be encoded/decoded using the standard.",
