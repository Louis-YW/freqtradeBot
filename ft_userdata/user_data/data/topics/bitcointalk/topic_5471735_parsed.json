  "content": "As stated in the title, I have 0.0033BTC and need PayPal funds at preev 1:1 (roughly $113.36)I will not send first unless you have significant green trust or if I've done business with you before.This will be a neutral feedback transaction.Send me a PM if you're willing to help me out, as I might miss seeing this thread if you post here.Local rule:  Please do not post here unless you're interested in doing this deal and are at least a Sr. Member or a member I've done business with before.  PayPal is very risky because of the chance of chargebacks, but I have never done this and won't ever.I might be asleep for a while, so I'm going to lock this thread until I get up and can do the trade if anyone's interested.I'm awake, still looking to trade.A'ight, that was quick!  Deal done, locking thread for good.",
