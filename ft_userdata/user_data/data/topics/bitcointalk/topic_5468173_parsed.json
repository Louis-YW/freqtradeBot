      "body": "Since the op is not part of the project team, I would like to ask him why he chose to publish this vision, on the basis of which they launch their services:- What benefit does the subject expect from providing such a service?- Who might need this service? That is, what might prompt someone to create their own token?- I would be really surprised if I learned that the owner of the show found clients in exchange for his service.I often encounter advertisements for these projects that I do not find a reputation for on the Internet. I often wonder who launches it and what they gain from it.",
