      "body": "To be fair, bear markets are usually created due to a big negative event happening. Whether that's the recession or FTX or whatever past company that has screwed thousands of users. It's pretty much always off the back of bad news. At least, the big dips are. Obviously, you get natural variation so there will be ups, and downs. I will say though, while I haven't particularly looked into this FTX situation, naturally humans seek out the most extreme explanations, and usually the reality is much more down to earth. So, while you might think there's a conspiracy going on, and you might be right in assuming that, it could just be your mind looking for something more exciting. It could be that FTX just mismanaged their funds horribly, promised users things that they'd never be able to deliver on, and ultimately paid the price.",

I'm not gonna assume that as \"mismanagement of resources\". How could Alameda research file for bankruptcy too? along side with FTX? Well, the reasons could be that there are affiliated and owned by the same person, Sam.CZ doesn't really have a hand in the whole situation. Centralized platforms that are basically trading cryptos are experiencing a bad turn over this period ( this could be where the whole problem came?)? But how bout the bankruptcy deal? Are there any plans to settle everyone that had 'em stocks with them? I'm yet to know that.Sandra ðŸ’‡",

I know you cannot really compare it to something like The Titanic, but for all its bluster, expectation, and initial promise, the ship just capsized spectacularly before many had finished getting comfortable. On the other hand, we could also see something positive arise from this disaster, as many long-time users and developers could be revitalized by the chaos and turn out some exceptional work. A harsh lesson, but ultimately a lesson that can provide us with a foundation for how to be better marketers in the future. As for the specific situation here, it is still unclear. A fault of mismanagement, perhaps? Or maybe they simply expanded too quickly, just like many other startups in the field.",

Hence, no doubt, he is behind the CEX scene so he knew something about this yet his hands are clean. The blame goes to the SEC for not regulating exchanges. According to Rep Warren Davidson; in his tweet, he said that the SEC had multiple meetings with FTX before this incident and he's surprised that the SEC haven't taken action regarding the CEX regulations. On the whole, his statement is pointing to a direction of incapability, the SECs seem weak for the job.Â And many reports or tweets sound it that Gary and Sam including the Alameda CEO have got some mutual relationship. In a nutshell, when money is the goal most officials won't take action. SBF is the scape goat they're other people behind the FTX bankruptcy.",

There are many people talking about it everywhere and this will only make the trust of traders and investors in the market even more affected which in the end will also be very negative for crypto.We know we can't stop people from complaining about losing a lot of money to FTX, but losses like this are the real consequences that many crypto critics have long feared.

To be frankly speaking, without concrete fact, this remains an allegation until proven otherwise, because a person can only work based on the level of information one is been given, and we were told FTX got hacked,Â  of which the sum of $600million transferred to an unknown wallet address, of which nobody can argue about it. But if you suspect this must have been a planned conspiracy, then the best thing you need to do is to first secure your asset, by storing It in a cold wallet, rather than using a centralized exchange that can be hacked someday and money stolen",

Nothing is safe as manipulation is always possible to find out, but something like this would not happen at bitcoin as fully decentralized.What you said is very much the truth about the cryptocurrency industry this is because all the manipulations always favour institutional traders, the exchanges and the big market manipulators.Ordinary investors are the people that suffer most.Then the way the cryptocurrency industry is going, exchanges are taking over and it is more or less going into centralisation. You can understand with me that 70 to 90% of the newbies that enters into the cryptocurrency industry only had to buy their first coin through exchanges and when they get their coins through exchanges, many of them will not be bothered anymore to make further research on how to secure the account. By this we develop newbie of exchanges. So, incidents as FTX collapse cannot be avoided even in the future.",
