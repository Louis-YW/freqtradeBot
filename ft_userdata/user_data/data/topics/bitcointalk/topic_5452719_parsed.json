A lot of politicians do this. Nothing intellectual about them, so they outsource all the creative thinking to someone else who writes a script for them to read.Assume this of every elected official until proven otherwise.",

      "body": "The thing about politicians is that most of these people or their script writers only talk about things that they know people would love to hear regardless of it being logical/achievable or not. Most of the time in politics, the main goal is to garner as much attention and blind compassion as they can from the masses that would help them succeed in their campaigns and probably winning and achieving their wanted positions. It is pretty rare nowadays to see manifestos that are realistic and truly possible to achieve from politicians. Most have become just sugarcoated crap and empty promises that are just created for the sake of having something to say. Well, that's politics for you.",

The outcast politicians would not even be able to fulfill every promise made in his campaigns—per if it could be fulfilled 50% would be very good but his dryness under it would even do the opposite of what he once promised. What can the people do to such an elected president? I think there’s nothing but going on living and working well to improve our lives because hoping that the President will change our situation is just a dream.",

Government is for the people, and it takes a lot of work for a good leader to achieve his vision for the Nation, Governance is everyone affairs, and no one individual can run it alone, on this topic, i think most of us here do not understand the working of Government, Tinubu Hiring best brain to draft his working tools for his government is not out of place, because Nigeria is a multicultural entity, the President Elect could have his own vision and mission for his government but can not draft all the challenges facing the entire Region, he must seek for good brains from each region to draft his manifesto for his day to day running of hi government, this how government works. so mr president elect is on track",

This statement is just an indirect means to tell the citizen not to expect anything from this government since the tenure has been shared and how any person rule his own doesn't matter to anybody, this kind of can only come from Africa because of the haplessness of their citizens, if it were to be developed nations once you make this kind of statement you will be disqualified because it means since is your turn if you are not given the opportunity to rule, you will do anything to get the position which nobody knows what the way will look like and such way might cause insecurity even though you might be arrested by then somethings unusual might have happened.It is so disheartening to have come across this kind of politicians that is reckless in thinking that want to grab power by all means .",

Who cares about the political manifesto of African politicians? They cannot be held accountable for failure to abide by them by anybody or any institution. So they can include fantasies and blue elephant projects just to make the electorate feel good. The current president of Nigeria promised to make the Naira strong until it becomes equal to the dollar. The Naira was about N170 when he became president now it is about N750. I have stopped listening to their political folktales and stories because they are all empty promises. Their ideology is to promote corruption and steal from the people. I have learned not to depend on these empty promises and focus on how to take care of myself and my family.",

The president-elect has a lot of work at hand,  judging from the current situation of things with the economy and other aspects of governance in Nigeria today,  so I ain't trying to judge him despite that he has not been sworn in yet as President anything can change still.",
