Well, most of the altcoins in the past that didn't able to cover with the ones that are trendy have fallen to the ranking.It's #388 now as per coinmarketcap.Quote from: cunningstunts on January 24, 2023, 09:36:54 PMWondering with all the pressure from legislators to regulate further if Privacy coins are the future... What does the community think?It's possible that it had became lowkey due to the regulations and pressure that has been placed upon to the privacy coins. We've seen the example for Monero.",

Just check the different articles about it1. Verge of disaster: 200 days transactions wiped from blockchain2. Verge (XVG) Hacked Again, 35 Million XVG Tokens Reportedly Generated by Hacker3. Verge Cryptocurrency Hit By 51% Attack, Loses 250,000 Tokens",

Verge has got so many bad things in the past. The blockchain got exploited so many times. The developers were trying to bring trust by partnering with adult site which has become a failed partnership. people are tired to buy more and more this garbage coin. You have monero as the best privacy coin. Verge not needed.",

It is being constantly under 51% attack and hackers. I don't think its worth any attention in 2023.QuoteOne of the reason is it being a privacy coin, most big exchanges desisted it because of regulation pressureThey didn't delist monero nor dash which are privacy coins too.",

Wondering with all the pressure from legislators to regulate further if Privacy coins are the future... What does the community think?Probably this is one coin that is good in the last bull run. We have seen this kind of cycles in the past as well, that there are a lot of projects in 2017, even touted to be the ETH killer, but suddenly in the bear market, majority of them barely survived, and some has died already.So this might be the case here, 2021 might be a good year for this project.But after that, it will be a challenge for $XVG to stay afloat in the market because there will be new one so investors might be looking for something new to invest their money.",
