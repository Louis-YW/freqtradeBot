There are no other alternatives to mining on these ASICs. In a month, the profit will be $ 100 from ASIC. Asics for bitcoin at this purchase price will be better.",

Soon many beginners will regret buying these ASICs, but they will get a good experience.",

I was in the same situation before I got D3 units not directly from the manufacturer, but through someone who sells 2nd hand/used units. I never made a profit, so I made the choice to sell it to others at a low price with a negative return. The profitability of this unit before is very attractive forcing you to buy it.",

Don't fall into the trap of focusing solely on daily profits; long-term sustainability matters. Reevaluate your mining venture before the situation worsens.I don’t even know what to advise those who bought these ASICs, the mining difficulty is growing strongly and the profit drops by 30-60 dollars every day. We'll come back to this conversation in a week. It is difficult to sell these asics now, because a smart miner just needs to look at the chart, the link to which can be found in my previous post.",
