Do you think the gambler did it purposefully perhaps to become popular in the headlines  No matter on how drunk you are and if you are a person who does have that rightful thinking then there's no one would be on their right minds on having that kind of act, on the time that you would really be able todo such thing even if you are drunk then for sure you do have that little abnormalities that you do have or simply being crazy.Even on how addicted you are with gambling, there's no way that you could afford on doing that. Doing it for purpose? Just to be popular? This method is the most dumbest thing you would really be doing.Intentional to make some headlines and marketing out a certain Vegas casino? Who knows! If ever this was true and having no hidden intents basing up on the action had been done then this do solidly shows on that crazy people would be doing crazy things which we cant really be able to see on everyday. It is really just that sad that they do really end up on that way.If you do find yourself not to be that good when you are drunk then its better to avoid it out on the first place because you are really that putting yourself into great shame.",

Do you think the gambler did it purposefully perhaps to become popular in the headlines  According to the report you shared, his wife claims the guy was drugged; someone had slipped some kind of psychedelic into his drink in his absence. I do not think this has anything to do with gambling and gamblers, even if the drug information is incorrect, the person may be suffering from some mental disorder. Anything is possible, but I doubt that many people in their right mind would decide on such a shameless act.",

So this must has been the man initial idea,let me go and do a wild naked dance and while nobody have attention I am going to grab some chips and cards because I lost everything.Good plan but failed execution as the security guards immediately got him as soon as he started to grab the chips and other casino goods.Nevertheless I think he made a name for himself and gave some idea to people who may be will do the same but execute it much better in a much better time than the one that this one choose to do so.Of course women will start behaving like they don't want to see it but a study has shown that women are much more nasty when it comes to watching p*rn so I am not surprised by her behavior.",

Do you think the gambler did it purposefully perhaps to become popular in the headlines  I wouldn't think the man was pretending. I have seen quite a lot of incident from very drunk people who on a normal day, wouldn't put on such a display, but because of alcohol, they create quite a scene. The highest penalty they may melt on him might be total expulsion from the casino and perhaps some fine payment. Besides this, I believe alcohol swab and drug use test would confirm the man's mental and physical state as at the time of such misbehavior. Casinos should also try to ensure they limit sales of alcohol to persons who may have had too much to drink.",

Which brings me to think what the fuck is going on with these types of people to make them do stuff like this when they are drunk! Cause alcohol doesn't make you do stupid shit and I know this, what it does is just give you enough confidence to do whatever you want that's why some people call it liquid courage lol. So seeing people go absolute stupid when they are drunk is just something that makes me wonder what type of people they are really, or at the very least what goes on in their heads when they're sober.
