  "content": "Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ So Iâ€™ve been working on this little side project thatâ€™s all about Bitcoin and the pizza story . I thought it would be fun to create a website that not only shows the current price of Bitcoin but also updates dynamically to show what 10,000 BTC are worth today and how many pizzas you could buy with that insane amount. Spoiler: itâ€™s a LOT of pizza now! ðŸ’¸The idea came to me because I always found that story fascinating. Itâ€™s a crazy reminder of how much the value of Bitcoin has grown, and I wanted to bring that to life in a fun and visual way. But the project is still evolving, and Iâ€™ve got plenty of ideas for where to take it next. One thing Iâ€™m considering is a way to monetize it a bit â€” nothing too intrusive, just maybe partnering with some brands or products. For example, we could feature different items and show how many of those you could buy with 10,000 BTC. Itâ€™s a cool and creative way to show the purchasing power of Bitcoin, and it might be fun to collaborate with brands who want to showcase their stuff in a unique way.Anyway, itâ€™s all for fun right now, and Iâ€™m just enjoying building something that gives people a laugh and maybe teaches them a bit about Bitcoin along the way. The site is definitely a work in progress, and Iâ€™m still adding features and refining things. Iâ€™d love to get some feedback or ideas if you have any! Hereâ€™s the link if you want to check it out:Link to the website. Let me know what you think ! ðŸ™Œ",

You can add an introduction to the homepage. An introduction that briefly explains the entire story behind the Bitcoin Pizza day. This is to help new users who are new to Bitcoin that stumble into the website. In the meantime, ill add to the listWith 10,000 BTC you can get 2,221 estates in the US and 2 football clubs in Serie A",

      "body": "Focusing on Pizza is going to make the site limited. I think there was a user this year that created a site to measure how much you would have had with current price of Bitcoin If you invested a certain amount during a certain time period. I doubt if brand would be interested/ pay to compare their product with the value of 10000BTC of Pizza. You can maybe make it possible to toggle between dark and light mode of not implemented yet. Maybe a calculate to help assist in calculating DCA.",

This is very important because having a live calculator on the website will help in a great way to calculate the value of Bitcoin vs the DCA value of today and how much pizza you could buy with that amount of money at this period in time, this is very important if we must discuss the Bitcoin pizza and the story surrounding it and how time has an influence on some levels of value of things around the discussion, this thread could give birth to a lot other factual topics and discussions because Bitcoin Pizza is such a remarkable event in the entire Bitcoin community and anything that relates with Bitcoin pizza cashes the attention of many Bitcoin analysts and community members. So let's see how far this discussion and development goes, whether or not we see some positive development and advancement as far as this topic of the Bitcoin Pizza calculator goes, and what progress comes forth from this; good luck with this project proposal.",

      "body": "These comparisons are for fun but they're not too helpful and accurate because there are totally differences in contexts of two years 2010 and 2024. Like you want to compare a newborn and an adult, it does not make any sense at all, rather than to make a joke or to mock Laszlo Hanyecz about his pizza for bitcoins trade.Pizza for bitcoins?Inflation rates, purchasing power of US or fiat currency are different between 2010 and 2024 too.",
