      "body": "I proposed this before [1] and it was well received by the community but nothing ever came of it. There was no official reply from theymos or any of the moderators. I do not know why this has not been made a priority. Most members here are using Tor and care a lot about their privacy and it would be great step I think. It does not create any problems because if we were worried about spam then theymos would not allow us to bypass the captcha. We already have a evil fee setup to prevent spam from members registering on tor. I think we just need the onion address set up I do not think it costs much to run too. Some members were suspicious of tor and think it is spied on but even if that is true every one here that connects via clear net is spied on by their isp and for members who are using tor a onion address increases our security and privacy. Tor has been under a sustained attack for a few weeks now but the slow downs are not bad and it is still better privacy then using clear net. I know Tor is not good for everything and that is fine but I think the forum would benefit from using tor I have seen moderators recommend Tor and it feels like a very btc friendly feature because most of us care about privacy more then most people. I think people are focusing to much on it only helping a few people who use tor but it would not affect the people who do not use tor to access the forum and it would be a feature that would be appreciated by many. I do not know the costs but some speculated it is simple and cheap to implement and requires almost no maintenance. I do not know how DDOS attacks are prevented on .onion addresses which might be something that would need to be solved? 1. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5336728.msg56987138#msg56987138",
