  "content": "Bitcoin seems to be struggling to get past $20k - $21k over the past days. There's a possibility it could go further down the drain due to the worsening of the global economy. Some say BTC will go all the way down to $15k within a matter of months, while others say BTC will be worth less than $10k soon. The market is extremely unpredictable right now, so it's hard to tell if BTC has reached the bottom, or if there's still room for a further downtrend in price. I'd be surprised if BTC continues to fall down in price all the way to $8k and below. Our only hope would be the next BTC halving and a swift recovery of the global economy.What do you think? Has BTC reached the bottom? Will you buy more regardless of BTC's current market price? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.",

Bitcoin will stay around avarage price of $20000 for long which will be the price it will stay most before the next halving will lead to another all-time-high. Buying now would be profitable next year but will be more profitable after the next halving.  Bitcoin getting to $10000? I do not think that would be possible.",

      "body": "Even if the price gets past $20,000 and $21,000, it is quickly followed with a correction that will pull down back the price to $19,000. Sometimes it even touches $18,000. But then it doesn't fall down lower than that. There is a rebound that follows. And $20,000 is once again targeted. This is another boring moment in this price range. Generally, this is a sideward movement. Which could either mean that there will be another surprise big fall or a big rally. So we cannot really tell whether this bear season has already found its bottom.",

      "body": "In my own perception, I think and wishing that the bottom will be 18k$ but not so sure for this thing. But according to others it will get down more below 15k$ and that is scary for me in some other way. But I do nothing if the market continue to fall and besides bear season can't be stop anyway. However, based on my own assessment the price strugling between 19k$-21k$ plus, where that if you look at it,it looks like it's very difficult for the price of Bitcoin to surpass 22k$, it seems like big investors are really controlling it. Which we don't know when the price of bitcoin will kick up. So, as of this moment holding is the best option for this matter for the ordinary traders like us now.",

I'm afraid that we are still going down far more from what we are having today , the market never show being stable for the past months and even showing a bad positioning .What I am seeing as Bottom ? at least 15k t 13k , I am not bearish but at least I know that there is no perfect expectation these days.But hopefully we may see some bright in the coming months specially this 3rd quarter and so on.",

Getting ready for bitcoin's halving season is a good idea.Halving makes the cycle and without it, the bullrun is not very possible. But some notable persons in crypto are actually taking it seriously about this supercycle. The marketing works and people will believe what they want to believe. Its not very far from happening since the bottom can be seen in the chart. The thought that its too early to see we will have another bull market before this year end could come true. We still  believe BTC can be a hedge.",

Many will do and it means profit for the veterans who knows the history of Bitcoin that it always goes up whenever a fall happens. It's not like an altcoin that once dump it becomes dust.",

If you are asking if bitcoin has already hit its bottom, no one can tell precisely. But most likely, bitcoin will still create further price decline considering that we are still in a long bear market. And if ever the price settles below $10k, i won't be surprise because everything in the market even in stocks or bonds are also falling. But always know that the lower the price of bitcoin, the bigger the opportunity we can maximize our profits when the market turns into bullish.",
