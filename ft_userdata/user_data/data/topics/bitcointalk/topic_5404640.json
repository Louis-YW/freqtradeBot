It will be more suitable!I will not trust anyone from this piece of shet forum anymore!Don't get your skivvies in a bunch, we're here to help.  The trouble is that there are a ton of scammers out there, and there's no way the forum can afford enough moderators to prevent them all.  Any attempt to prevent even one scam will cause a false sense of security and likely cause more people to get victimized.I'm older than I care to admit in public, and I've been using forums for over 20 years.  I can tell you from experience that this is the most free and liberated forum I've ever visited.  Freedom isn't free, however; we all need to remain diligent to preserve it.  Whenever we have a modicum of freedom, someone will inevitably abuse it.  So, I am sorry for your loss, but at the same time it's up to you to keep yourself safe in this space.Here are two suggestions for you going forward that will help you avoid this type of thing again, whether you choose to stay here or try to do business elsewhere:Caveat Emptor, or buyer beware.If it sounds too good to be true, it's probably a scam.Good luck.",

Also you should do your own research to verify people if they are legit or not because this forum has no moral obligation if you get scam so you don't have any rights to blame this forum for scamming issues happen to you since if you just hire a trusted escrow to middle up the deal for sure this incident will not happen.",

And why dont @theymos make that \"show rating\" link removed and make it default to show those  untrusted feedback.
