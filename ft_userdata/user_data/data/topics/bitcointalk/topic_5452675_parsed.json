  "content": "Is there any secure GUI tool which i can use to Encrypt/Decrypt and sign message or files with my ECDSA Secp256k1 private key?GUI could be binary file, or local HTML file.Think of Alice had become a cyberpunk  .

Also encrypt, decrypt capability would be appreciated.Thanks",

      "body": "Files are usually signed using GPG not ECDSA but you can still encrypt/decrypt messages (as in plain text) using Electrum. It has a GUI and the option is available under \"Tools > Encrypt/decrypt message\" option. It uses ECIES (ECDSA combined with AES) to encrypt/decrypt messages. The code can also be found here:https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/17a89efd3c19cbff1fbf76d24e5c246d6e0ed935/electrum/ecc.py#L344Code:message: foobarpubkey: 0395EEF24C89CEE0312E6DD7585B6FF566499466642F92FF0160CDB3155563B9B5encrypted: QklFMQMlRbTppQ0eCl3mFqDlQ5ibPfXStdfgeAxzwtCjKiHv2/b9ivpc/ibfbVt6+6sI7auz2mnAehhIS26VhHiKKZw1HK2BeMtk5qfycuneFFfthA==Throw away private key I used:Code:Ky8CKVUHyAuPGFy8r2UCpiUEnNoQo8eBj7B8t2vYPhPEtu8cvXTAKeep in mind that you can only decrypt messages with the keys that are part of your wallet. Don't import this key since it is publicly known or use a TestNet Electrum wallet and import the above key so that you don't accidentally forget and lose money by sending funds to this key.A preview:P.S. You can obviously sign and verify messages using ECDSA too. The option is available under the same path: \"Tools > Sign/verify message\"",

Let secp256k1 be used to store coins.I think encrypting message with private key is fundamental operation of signing files.Anyways as I searched, the Kleopatra (https://www.openpgp.org/software/kleopatra/) is good GUI tool for asymmetric encryption, also supports ECDSA NIST P-256 (not sure if it is secp256). but still it do not support encrypting with private key.",
