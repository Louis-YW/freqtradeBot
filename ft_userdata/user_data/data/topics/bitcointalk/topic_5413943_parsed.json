Honestly we miners have been scammed, this is a scam that no one needs.",

ETH POW is not the only coin to mine, there's ETC too, ERGO and RVN.This is something beneficial for these coins as ETC and ERGO got almost all of the ETH hash rate so we need another good coin to get back some of that hash rate because with the price of ETC and the apparent increase in difficulty sure it is not a good coin to be mined anymore,the same can be said for ERGO,only RVN didn't get that huge of an hash rate and is some what better to mine than ETC and ERGO but pretty soon it will not be anymore seeing how things are going.Maybe people trusted Vitalik but right now most of them will not anymore after switching from PoW to PoS and centralizing ETH to a huge degree,most crypto owners do not like centralization which is against core philosophy of crypto itself.",

Whether the developers implement more features or not. if the numbers are not there EthW will keep going downwards just like you saw with ETC or all those Bitcoin folks you have witnessed.Honestly I don't see EthW surpassing ETH in terms of marketcap let alone even get close to top 10. the coin is taking a huge dump.",
