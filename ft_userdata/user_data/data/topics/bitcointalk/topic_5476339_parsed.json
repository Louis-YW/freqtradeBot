I just realized that PayPal is also a payment option for the Bitvavo exchange (not on Binance). The 2% fee on a 6k transfer costs me 120.There may be some merit though. Typically PayPal takes the money out of the bank account. If the money isn't there, I have to pay a fee.The advantage is that the money is transfered from my bank to PayPal, and not to the exchange. This means that my bank does not know that the 6k is a crypto investment, and so they can't flag it to the IRS. Or am I wrong about that? I don't know if PayPal has to disclose what the 6k was for.It could be for furniture..I'll reconsider tomorrow. I hope that BTC doesn't make more crazy pumps like it did last night. I freaked out when it jumped 8k in a heartbeat, just to get right back. I still don't know what happened there",

Much better if you find another merchant accepting fiat and exchange it to BTC or any crypto you want to be out on trouble.Also to make all clear as stated by people here go to your bank and ask about that situation since they are the one who can make you understand about certain things that you want to know. Also much better if you avoid doing transaction using your bank account to any crypto platform since this might be illegal or unacceptable to them.This is why I don't actually like to use bank because we can't decide for our own since they always have the full control of our money.",

Look, you can't even use/spend your money the way you want and the bank doesn't allow you to manage your assets the way you want. Who is the actual owner of this money? You or the bank?The bank doesn't allow you to make transactions directly on Binance and Bitvavo. Ok. How to bypass this problem? What if you buy BTC, for example, through the exchanger's aggregator  Bestchange and transfer BTC to your account in Binance and Bitvavo? Won't this solve your problem?",

Better reaching out to bank to have a check why these transactions were blocked since bitcoin or crypto is not illegal in Belgium there should be a valid reason and if it's to do only with Binance and Bitvavo then go for other exchanges else if they say iits some rules they have implemented to safeguard their bank users as they use terms like safeguarding etc, then go for some other banks which don't have these restrictions post checking with crypto community based on Belgium.",

There shouldn't be any link that says you are buying crypto on binance, if I want to use Fiat to buy Bitcoin on binance I always use their peer to peer and I always send the Fiat to someone's account, it's just like sending a friend some money, there is no binance account involved, unless you proceed and write something about crypto in the transaction description.Bitcoin was once ban in my country and they are freezing customers account that's involved with crypto transactions but mine was never freezed because I don't pay to any crypto platform account, not for once before, I think the best option is to find a P2P platform to make your purchases from now on, for example Bisq and few others. You can also create a new bank account, there are many online banks available around the world today and use yout account to fund the new bank account then use it to buy crypto, remember, dont always add any words partaining crypto at all in your description.",

But this way I have to know which bank I should transfer to.I'm in a few facebook groups but none of these people are professional and the advice they gave me doesn't seem to work out. They said that there have never been problems but they only transfer amounts that are insignificant. I want to transfer 15-20k and 2 or 3 deposits.I know a few people who are into this more professionally, but they are very secretive and don't help.",

Every word I type can and will be used against me.Most likely my email will be forwarded straight to the IRS. I'll officially be exposed as a crypto investor and I feel bad about that. It is an open invitation to a tax agent who will treat me like a criminal. They will come over to check all my tax declarations, also for my normal job. And they always find something to make people pay. I considered typing in the email that this crypto currency will be gifted to my family overseas. I can literally prove this too and I do not have to pay taxes on it. Case closed on my part then, but I do have to handle the tax authorities when they come over.In the facebook groups I'm in, there are cases of tax agents who demand to see crypto transactions of users.",
