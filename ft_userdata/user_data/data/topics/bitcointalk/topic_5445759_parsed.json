People that have reputation here can always go to the established users in the forum that offer loans, also that's for a much smaller %.20$ is not really an amount that would help anybody, unless you need some crypto for some gas fees or whatever.But for a scammer, they even think 20$ is worth scamming, sad world.Anyway, I hope you can make some good business, just be careful.Cheers",
