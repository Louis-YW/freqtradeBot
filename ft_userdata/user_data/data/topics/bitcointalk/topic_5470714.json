      "body": "he is just naming PRZ as what regular people call the tipping point or the highthe chart he shows has such a narrow field that you are (after exchange fees and other costs) not going to make much he has two windows of possible direction it can go (although he draws an arrow to suggest his preference)one of 27.6k-28.4k (if the price goes down)(his preference/suggestion)one of 28.4k-29.2k (if the price goes up)in simple terms support=bottom¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† PRZ=topthe thing is those windows are so narrow at 0.8k each that it is only a challenge of 2%dont aimlessly follow some nubtubers chart they published on tradeview without looking at your own costsEG the tx fee to deposit. the exchanges market trade fee, the tx fee+exchange fee to withdraw = 2% of your balanceif the fees total are more than the possible 2% gain. there is no point trading in these small windows",

But, I believe you might be referring to terms related to price reversal and retracement, potentially including the concept of a Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ). To learn more about this, I would recommend Some articles/videos:https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/06/retracements.asphttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/harmonic-patterns-in-the-currency-markets.asphttps://harmonics.app/what-is-potential-reversal-zone-in-harmonic-pattern/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvNUmOUfDILearn yourself and make decision on your behalf don't listen to those BS influencers/youtuber+trader.",

      "body": "another tipwhen a certain pattern appears too often, it is usually a sign a whale/bot trader is pushing the price a certain way. using its influence on niave traders to follow its preachingshowever by it being a pattern recognised so often, other smarter traders anticipate and react accordingly to trade against it. breaking the patternso eventually the premonition based on past patterns breaks its own ideals and becomes a useless pattern to followthese whales want naive people to trade a certain way because it benefits the trader causing it. to put it simply. when a whale shouts \"everyone should buy\" the whale wants people to buy to cause a community pump. purely so the whale can sell and cause a whale dumpto put it simply. when a whale shouts \"everyone should sell\" the whale wants people to sell to cause a community dump. purely so the whale can buy at a discountnever trust these influencers publishing their trade models. its just a call out to the community to hope the naive community listens and falls for it to cause the naive community to cause the premonitions to come trueits also noteworthy when these influencers have 2 windows of possible trade path. so even if the price did drop(if community didnt cause a pump) they can just say they also predicted it would go down into the lower window, to make people think they are never wrongits worth noting although this topic shows yesterday he said \"price up\".. on the same day he also said \"price down\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/rVD3ZwL2-Bitcoin-Mid-Term-Analysis/here is him in that latest post making a comment\"‚úÖAfter rising almost ‚ûï15% for the past four weeks, Bitcoin has started to decline again (as I expected in previous posts‚úÖ). \"in short dont trade based on influencer advice.. they wont bail you out/offer refunds, many influencers usually show two windows of a possible premonition of a path. and after the reaction happens. delete the errored path's post/data to pretend they didnt advise it. to only show a comment history of posts of the paths that work, just to seem like they are always right",
