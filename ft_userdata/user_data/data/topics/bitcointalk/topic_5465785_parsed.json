For example we all know Germany, whereas Germans prefer Deutschland. This is a silly controversy raised by the opposition. It has become a habit of the existing ruling party to come up with a new policy and the opposition to always create a  controversy surrounding it. I don't think that in the upcoming session of Parliament India's name would be changed to Bharat. I feel both names would be used in the future by the government.",

      "body": "It is a controversy created by the opposition and nothing more. The foreign minister Mr Jaishankar has already given a hint that both names that is India and Bharat are legal and can be used as per the constitution. India is a international brand name and it is not that easy to change it.Indian across the country call Indian as Bharat in their native tounge in some form or the other as the name is derived from Sanskrit word Bharatha. I think it BJP is trying to create a rift within the political community to gain a little mileage before the next central election. They and the stupid opposition will now drag this controversy till the end of this year. That will only help the BJP in the upcoming elections. Nothing is going to happen for sure, it is just a way to show the citizens of India that BJP is trying to get rid of the colonial past. BTW, this topic should have been posted on Press & News",

Thank you.I have seen views of both the parties who are in favour of this and also those who are against it, also the opinion from down south who strictly are against an only Hindi Name Bharat. My point to all this is why is all this sham needed anyway? We all know constitution has provisions for both the name. The name india comes from the Indus river system that flows here and there is no concrete evidence as to whether Britishers were the first to coin this term. Also there would absolutely be zero effect of this on any person's mind or mentality, honestly no one even better an eye on the Name India for 70 years until this government made it such a big issue.",

The ruling party is only trying to create this hype because the central election is on the way. They will use this hype of name to highlight that they are trying to shed the colonial past. It is not that easy to delete the name of India as it is not only a name but a global brand. If they do change the name then it won't happen rapidly, it will happen steadily.",

      "body": "My political reading.IMO, It's just a political gimmick but if I am being honest then the opposition forced the current government to use \"Bharat\" instead of \"INDIA\" when the opposition opted for the India acronym for their alliance, which was an excellent move but double edge sword as well.  BJP is an election beast, they even take gram panchayat elections very seriously, like it's a matter of life and death. So no wonder they played a \"Bharat\" card beautifully and they are not breaking any rule at all. My personal experience. I've spent a fair amount of time working in SEA and okayish times traveling the Middle East and in my experience, if we ignore the English speaking locals then you will hear the sound of Indo, Indu, Ando, Hindostan, Hind and Turtsu (another ancient Indian name) which became Tianzhu/Tinzhu-Tinju (heaven) in China/japan instead of India regularly. We only got here because Persian didn't know how to pronounce \"SaptaSindhu\" which became \"Haptahindu\", then a shorter version \"Hind /hindu)and Greek made into \"indu\". As far as local Indian languages go Bharat, Bharto, Bharoto, Barat, Bharatvarsha, Bharta, Bharata desham, Bharatam, Bharatu, Hindustan etc are quite common. Indian or Bharata history is freaking rich af, you don't need wine to get high. There is a reason all indic religions are referred to as Sanathana, just dig in and embrace it.",

They were able to successfully stop the opposition alliance from interfering in the G20 summit by announcing the special session of Parliament before the summit. Till now no one knows what agenda or bill would be up for discussion. The opposition is in the guessing mode and is trying to prepare for the discussion without knowing what to discuss.  According to some media reports UCC & declaring Kashmir as a state might happen between 18th to 22nd of this month. If these two topics come up in this session ,then another milestone would be achieved by the ruling party. For the time being we can keep guessing just like the opposition has been doing so far.",

Before 2019 everything was out of control and peace was a distant dream. I only quoted what is circulating in the mainstream media. You cannot disagree that the ruling party has the habit of suprising everyone in the country. No one has been able to stop PM Modi from taking bold decisions except the farmers. For now everyone is clueless as to what will be discussed in the upcoming session of the Parliament. In a few days time we would know what has been cooking? 😜",

Also I feel this is the first big blow on Indian Diplomacy since Modi has taken the chair, a blow that they are not able to extinguish easily by suppressing it.True but to be fair to India. Justin Trudeau started this diplomatic mess and now India is going on the offensive with this visa ban move. I also think Canada might not follow the same route because of various reasons. One of em is that Indian students make up for like 40% of international students in Canada and contribute about $7-9 billion per year. India-Canada diplomatic relations were already bad and the recent incident is just the final nail in the coffin thanks to man child Trudeau. I won't say \"Big blow\" because I'm yet to see any bashing from the international strategic community. Traditional foreign media house doing their thing, which we are used to lol. The majority of the op-eds and coverage are full of racism and it indicates that they are already trusting that Trudeuo claims are true without seeing any evidence. \"Trust me bro\" meme became a reality in this case. Independent and conservative media in Canada are not buying anything tho. India-Canada diplomatic relations were already bad and the recent incident is just the final nail in the coffin thanks to man child Trudeau. It will take some time to fix it in every scenario but this drama should be closed soon. Also, don't forget there is virtually no blowback in India and on this issue, every single party got behind the gov, which wasn't surprising to me because of the trigger word of \"Khalistan\".",

The revenue generated by Indian students is big and I have heard that the fee structure for them is on the higher side than the locals. Trudeau made a mess of diplomatic relations by bringing in his personal ego after his humiliation at the G20 summit. Imagine if Canada were to ban visa applications, many students would apply for higher education in the US. Already Mahindra and Essar Steel have withdrawn from upcoming projects in Canada others might follow.  If the opposition party comes to power in the next Canadian election, then relations with India may become normal. As of now, Canada has not withdrawn its pension fund from the Indian stock market, if it does then companies like Paytm, and Kotak Bank will get hammered.",
