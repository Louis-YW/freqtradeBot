  "content": "Topic translated in Pidgin : MLM na dangerous marketing strategyOriginal Topic: MLM – a dangerous marketing strategyAuthor: 1miauABEG DE CAREFUL: abeg oo no go invest ur moni 4 MLM System u no go get d moni way u invest put back. D gist way de after dis one go explain y: As u go take no say na MLM SystemAs u de fine beta Beta chance 4 place  to take invest moni put, u fit com jam all dis bizness way Dem de call MLM. D full meaning of MLM na Multi-Level-Marketing and Dem de use am well well take de catch new customer. Multi-Level mean say pipo way don de d business  de put new customer join. And dis pipo way don already de d business de receive commission anytime way dis new customers way Dem refer deposit moni.Many of dem de get many many level way Dem de pay commission 4 pipo way Dem refer.Wen pesin way u refer com refer anoda pesin u go com sti get small bonus afta d pesin way e refer sti deposit.If u Fe look d matter e resemble  watin gain de say once u refer pesin u go get bonus.but if u reason am wel wel u go notice say no b beta mata and e go good if u avoid to de invest 4 Multi-Level-Market system Dem.d way MLM of BitConnect Ponzi-Scam take arrange. To de refer new pipo join go de give some kind bonus way go depend on watin who Dem refer deposit. Anoda promise way all dis project way no clear de give na say Dem go de multiply crypto way u ge wit small time. Some of dis  MLM project sef go even get ogbonge bonus if u invest more moni put say u go com de get beta gain fast fast: Dis MLM matter cast well well 4 crypto matter  bcos crypto de bring beta gain  “if moon com” and pipo way no get beta experience  put nai him Dem de target  pass. Dat time way Dem de hype am dat kind 2017 ending many Ponzi pipo use d  “when moon” take raise moni even if say d business  de lend or mine.many Times na lie lie promise to take put pipo inside.To take add join, Bitcoin and other  cryptocurrency de complex 4 new pipo way de use am, and e somehow de  easy 4 scammers to take fool dis pipo com sell fake business model say na real one. U fit no MLM with structure way resemble pyramid, if u get different level of referral bonus and mostly if big gain de com every day or every month. MLM system way pipo no well well na BitConnect and BitClub.Afta BitConnect tay crash, their coin con almost  de useless. To take  add am  up, here na d general disadvantage of MLM system and y u suppose avoid any of Dem  investment: 1. MLM match wit scamMLM no really  mean say d project na scam but many many times na scam Dem b.dis one na bcos say MLM de easy 4 operator to take get new customers join wit d ones way don already de wen Dem de advertise d service.E de beneficial 4 pesin way get d platform since na customer de advertise am and na new members de fund am.so pesin way get d MLM system de face zero risk and e no de pay 4 marketing.if d owner don get enough money from inside Dem go com close d platform and customer no go fit withdraw Dem moni again. Na dis one dem de call \"Exit- Scam\".  Ponzi go always reach point way new customers way de make deposits no go reach bcos say Dem de pay d pipo way don already de wit moni way new customers deposit. Na only redistribution of moni bcos e no de generate profit come out. But even if say  any MLM de generate real profit, some things de to put4 mind.2. MLM de cause significant costsIf profit de way Dem de  generate, business way base on MLM go need to spend beta part  of their profit on top commission way dem suppose pay 4 MLM-expenses. Depending on d numba of level way de and d amount of each commissions way Dem de pay, and this matter  fit chop beta tin commot from their profit.To add join de profit way Dem need to spend no longer de available 4 normal investments, which get bad effect 4 money way customer de earn.4 here d customers de pay 4 d marketing. Bcos of dis one,business model way legit no go use MLM most times bcos e no de profitable 4 beta development of the company. 3. Only d pipo way quick invest and invite many pipo go benefit from the MLM Bcos  of d affiliate structure, d pipo way quick  invest (mostly d pipo way get am) and d ones way refer pipo pass go benefit d most.dis referral commission moni de com directly from d customers way de under Dem 4 deir downline. And normally, d owners de always make profit 4 MLM systems, otherwise Dem no go run am. Anoda important point na; d pipo way de advertise their project no pure wen Dem de present d business model. Dem go advertise d product in a way way Dem go likely get more referrals (and  bigger bonus) bcos  of d affiliate structure. D result na dangerous dynamic way go give bad eye to d product .na dis one Dem de mostly call “shilled project”. 4.  MLMs no de open an clearBeta legit projects de always de interested to make their business model de transparent make pipo 4 get reason take invest,tins like how Dem de generate profit, which team de  hold d project and how Dem de divide d revenue (team / expenses / profits for investors). Sha but most cases dis  projects no de get multi-level marketing system. Many times  transparent structure of the company in MLM projects no de de, 4 where Dem nor no d operators or na small Dem no Dem and na customers de market am. Na beta style 4 d owners to take hide demsef con sti get big marketing. Especially pipo way no de experienced na him Dem de target wit dis marketing strategy wit big promise way Dem de give Dem like \" new Bitcoin\", \"Lambo or Moon\" or other returns way no de realisticIf d business model na good one, MLM way get clear commissions fit be viable and legitimate marketing , but tins way don sup b4 don show d opposite. Finally, multi-level marketing systems de  mostly discouraged bcos high risk of scam de and even if no b scam de structure no de favor customers but e de favor d pipo way start am.",

      "body": "Most MLM business models now are obvious scams, the truth here is that people know that they are likely  to be trapped, but due to the high frustration and hardship in the country, the same people brainwash themselves on the possibility of cashing out before it crashes. these sites pays only those who gets in early and the unfortunate late ones are used to enrich the organizers of such schemes. For me, any business that involves gathering people and high ROI is not to be trusted at all cos looking critically at the business models, you can see that what they project to be doing with the users funds cannot yield such revenue that they pay to the user, talk less of the money they make for themselves.I had a friend who did the recently crashed NHire. When they were enjoying the proceeds from their early #10k investments on a daily basis, I tried to make him understand that that forum would not last long seeing that they only run ads for goods to be bought and they pay as high as #1800 per post, I was thinking of how much they actually charge the business owners that can cover for the hundreds of thousands of people they pay #5100 daily. we analyzed it together, but he seemed not to be interested in my analysis, I encouraged him to stop spending excessively and save for the time his commission will stop coming, he heeded my advise a little and it helped him three weeks later when they stopped paying. He himself couldn't believe it could crash, but reality surprised him.  All these MLM marketing models with high ROI are not to be trusted at all, they're all obvious scams.",
