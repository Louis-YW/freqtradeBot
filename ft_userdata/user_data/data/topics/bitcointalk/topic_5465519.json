Or maybe because they don't want you to withdraw?   Anyway, I think it would be impossible for a business to give something for free. Even the DEXs need it because it is required by the network. It's part of the fees so it should be paid by the transactor. Are you doing something like depositing and then withdrawing small amounts?",

All exchanges charge withdrawal fees, and yes, in some cases, withdrawing Bitcoin may be costly, but there are ways to minimize the fees by converting to another currency, such as LTC, but yes, they may be extravagant, especially if the network is congested. Fees are probably the main source of income for an exchange; it'd be a red flag if an exchange had significantly low or zero fees. Binance, for instance, has pretty low fees, especially compared to other exchanges I've used, such as Bitstamp and Coinbase, but also offers a great deal of investment products; it's not an ordinary exchange.",

FTX offers that free withdrawal since they benefit on many new users that use that exchange that purchase their tokens $FTT to reduce transaction fee. $FTT tokens pump hard due to the hype on the exchange which SBF use to steal money by liquidating $FTT assets. You’re right that anyone offering free in crypto surely have something behind.",

I just can't imagine how people think and plan to scam people while if they spend the same energies in a positive way, people like SAM could make exchanges / products even better than Binance.

Don't keep the funds on the free withdrawal exchanges but only move a certain amount of funds if you want to pay to a few different people and avoid the fee. There can be many use cases for the free withdrawal exchange.",

Nope, that's not what I meant as I have no idea whether Sam premediated all this, or  things get out of hand due their incompetence. All I am saying is that people should be very careful when new exchange shows up that offers something that no other exchange does.

I don't think that people generally learned anything from FTX fiasco as this is not the first time something like this happened (read Mt.Gox) and soon all this will be forgotten (if it wasn't already). For example, I know some people (that are crypto veterans btw) that lost money in both Celsius and FTX and they still have considerable amount of money on Binance.",

If FTX never collapses, then we don't know of SBF's side businesses with customer money which can lead us to the conclusion that there are other incomes that are bigger than charging fees to customers.",
