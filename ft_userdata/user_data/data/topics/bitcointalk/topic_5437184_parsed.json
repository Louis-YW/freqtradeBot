I also think that the current cryptocurrency may be less in demand after banks create and start using CBDC.",

Too many opinions that are mixing together which resulted to a more bullish and bearish situation for bitcoin. Adoption is coming but definitely must be oversee since the US are trying to regulate a decentralized space of bitcoin.",

Back in 2017 or so when i first entered the crypto space, big banks and governments were still pretty much making fun of cryptos and did not take it seriously at all. Nowadays crypto currencies get adopted by big companies more and more and therefore also banks, institutions and governments have no other option than to really look into cryptos. They are not doing this because they are fans of cryptos, but they simply also want to earn from the trend. Big banks are doing everything to make money.",

And the good thing is that we can have a choice and used both of them for our advantage. So not necessarily we should have each institutions specially the banking system.",

Some people have been wary, even critical, of cryptocurrencies, while others have been more accepting.Many large institutions have previously been cautious to adopt bitcoin, citing worries about its volatility and lack of regulation. However, opinions have shifted in recent years, with more and more mainstream organizations becoming interested in bitcoin. Companies such as PayPal and Square, for example, have begun to enable their users to purchase and trade bitcoin, while large banks such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have began to provide bitcoin-related services to its clients. Furthermore, institutional investors are beginning to include Bitcoin and other crypto assets in their portfolios.",

In my opinion, banks have been in bitcoin for a long time, since about 2018. Back then, they were actively dumping tons of hate on bitcoin in order to drive the price down as much as possible and make a good profit. Now they are already openly interested in bitcoin, but don't rely on them too much. Banks will always stand up for their own interests first of all, for the interests of traditional finance, so if some crisis happens, they will get rid of all their bitcoins without a second thought and redirect the money into gold, for example.",

Centralized exchanges and other brokers have already implemented or adopted stable coins and different fiat payment gateways for years but crypto didn't slow down because of those things. Issuance of CBDCs won't stop them or cause a slow down either.",
