  "content": "Link Collection of links regarding legal actions for UST and LUNA holdersThere are several legal actions ongoing regarding UST and LUNA holders.Some focus on exchanges, some other focus on TFL, Do Kwon, LFG, Jump Trading and other VCsIn many cases everyone in the world can join, in some cases it is for u.s. cases first and international follows at a later date.Most of the class action is free for the victims (contigency based). In case of Fatman and Kyle Roche laywers, Roche gets 33% if they win and they pay the laywer fees themself if they loose. Also laywers taking such a case if they are confident to win.3 Laywers i know:- Kyle Roche, currently sueing us exchanges (currently us customers can join, other countries will follow). Free (contigency based,)- Scott and Scott sueing TFL, Do Kwon, Jump (currently us customers can join, other countries will follow) (Free, Contigency based)- Drewnapier: Singaporean laywer, mainly for Singaporen, but other countries can join as well (I joined from an other asian country). Fee for the injunction is about 15000 to 25000 SGD shared between all claimants on a pro ratio basis, means someone who has 50000 UST claim should be paying about 736 SGD (530 USD). The fee will go lower the more people joining. Currently 1,7 million USD (on 21.06.2022) in claims have singed already up there.

I still wondering, the asset of treasure money from Luna/UST is only Crypto Asset?Or there has some other asset like USDT Treasure while they spread not only by money.",
