I've been to Dubai once, spent week there and honestly I never plan to go back. I wasn't impressed with absolutely anything there and the worst of all was the climate. And I wasn't even visiting Dubai during summer and it was hell. That is literally one of the last places in the world I would spend my time in if I had shit load of money.Sure, city is good for business (especially if you are starting a crypto related business) but everything outside that is just awful as for me its completely soulless (expect the old part where gold market is) and artificial. Maybe if I was 15-20 years younger I would have a different opinion but at this point in life I value some other things more.",

Because we all also know, dubai can be big like now it is oil and not all countries have it.You forget to bring a comparative burden on the success that has been experienced by Dubai, so that what is exposed is only a problem of luxury, destination for tourist destinations and economic wealth sourced from oil, but you forget that the source of state revenue also comes from the tourism and aviation industries. Dubai adheres to a constitutional monarchy system and if I'm not mistaken at this time led by Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, so it is not surprising that the negative side in Dubai is not exposed to the media widely. Because there are limits that continue to be controlled for the media in making news, if you have friends who have been living there for a long time you can ask the negative side in Dubai.Of course it is good to develop a crypto business in Dubai, because there is no company or personal tax that will be worn by the government there, for this reason people are encouraged to enter the region and build any profitable business.

The security is definitely a good one because people here are afraid to do bad things as they will pay worse if they are found guilty. IMO, it's only a good place to do business but not for vacation or enjoying family time. When it comes to that I'd pick a tropical place where the heat is just enough and so does the coldness of the night.

A good alternate option could be to dig large holes in the ground and develop real estate and living centers within it. In an area that will naturally be cooler, without requiring large amounts of energy generation to offset high temperatures. Trees and agriculture may also be easier to develop and maintain in dubai if they are grown inside trenches or pits which offer shade and low lying areas for water to condense and accumulate.While dubai may be financially deregulated and law in some respects. There can be a downside in terms of some aspects of financial law having harsher penalties in contrast to western nations of the world. One example of this is the large number of exotic sports cars which are dumped and abandoned in dubai. Due to financial laws imposing harsh penalties against those who can't pay the monthly costs of luxury items purchased. Dubai is definitely an interesting place filled with many intelligent, wealthy and knowledgeable business people. There are definitely opportunities and valuable connections which might be made there for the right person. Which is one of the reasons why many travel there.",

Where else you can treat someone who might come to visit you in Dubai like king with so good price you get private driver and rolce Royce driving to airport.And If you Are youtuber influencer you make more money getting more followers by posting content how you spend money in Dubai and what Luxury things you enjoy so you make connections Also.Dubai is not about nothing else then just the people who want to make money and live Luxury off course without working for low money but to get highest money.Compared to Monaco Dubai is way cheaper and you have a lot more people and many things to do there.It's a dream to be there",
