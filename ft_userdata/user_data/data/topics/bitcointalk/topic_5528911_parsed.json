In 2018, Nobel economist winner Joseph Stiglitz says cryptocurrencies should be shutdown,QuoteJoseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-Prize winning economist, says cryptocurrencies should be shut down. He worries that they enable illicit activity by making money transactions less transparent.So this is not the first time that we have heard Nobel prize winner criticizing Bitcoin or crypto itself. But the thing is that so far those predictions or anti-crypto sentiments makes the market stronger.In any case, let them talk as much as they want, the market is not going to be affected by this naysayers. Perhaps they are right, however, crypto is too big to fall specially Bitcoin wherein many countries for example, are talking about it making a national reserve.",

From his statement Quote from: https://www.coinim.net/nobel-laureate-eugene-fama-bitcoin-is-doomed-to-be-worthless/ he said. The economist argued that bitcoin cannot replace traditional currency since financial assets must serve a practical purpose to retain value.And yes we know that bitcoin wasn't created to compete with any fiat rather it was created to assist fiat, where there seems to be a barrier bitcoin would definitely create an easy access to finance. Again it doesn't required third party as fiat whereby banks questions you for every single transaction you carries out from your personal bank account.",

      "body": "According to my understanding of the article, he could be right if the Bitcoin (investor) community continues to use BTC in the same way than today. Pure speculative use would eventually lead to a long term peak, and Bitcoin would have a hard time to revert a bear market of more than 5-7 years in this case. If the old growth pattern with the 4-year cycles is broken, profit taking of one of the next cycles could be followed by an extreme panic.However, the community can revert this, in my opinion. At least, I'm not convinced about an \"automatism\" described in the following part:Quote from: coinim.netFama’s skepticism stems from bitcoin’s reliance on speculation rather than intrinsic value. He noted that with a fixed supply, its price is entirely demand-driven, making it inherently volatile. (Source)He is here not referring to the supply on the market but to the complete circulating supply which is fixed. Current volatility however is largely unrelated to the circulating supply but more reliant on market supply and demand.The game of market supply and demand depends entirely on how investors behave, when they buy and when they sell. This means that if the dominant investment pattern changes, volatility could go down drastically (and it's already decreasing quite steadily).I believe that he's a bit correct that Bitcoin will be a bit more volatile than fiat forever. But if Bitcoin had the volatility of gold -- which has also a very limited \"circulating supply\" -- then it would be very useful to save money for almost everybody, and also useful as a medium of exchange.",
