I was preferring to use another way like dex or cex directly rather than bridging an asset into the unreliable platform like that. This hacked cases happened so many times. Will this company go bankrupt? Nomad gets rekt. Those who still bridged their assets into the nomad wrapped tokens got rekt.",

That depends on the solution they are gonna do. Yes Ive seen some desperately trying to convert too and some take advantage of this scenario to dump their bags as some no choice on the bridge but to convert their usdc to any asset like diff and evmos. Those who hold evmos are dumping on them. Unfortunately Im still on delegate so cant really sell some too for juicy profit. But its fine dont want to use those who trapped for an liquidity. Hope nomad have some sort of compensation to those got affected.",

      "body": "The developers of the Nomad cross-chain bridge promise an early restart, users affected by hacking will need to pass KYC in order to receive partial compensation, verification can take from one day to one week. After its completion, users receive an NFT, taking into account the type and number of assets to be returned., but in any case, based on what the Nomad team managed to recover after the hack. The beginning of the procedure will be announced on the official Twitter and Discord channels.Source: https://medium.com/nomad-xyz-blog/nomad-bridge-relaunch-guide-3a4ef6624f90",
