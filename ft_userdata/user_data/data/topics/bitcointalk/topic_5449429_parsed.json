  "content": "FedNow, a brainchild of the federal reserve system, is a digital payment which promises to hasten up payment and other services. Although not yet in operation, since it will be officially unveiled in  July  it has a promising future as believed by Richmond Fed president, Tom Barkin. And according to a statement by Fed reserve governor, Michelle Bowman yesterday, it looks too that she has her doubts on the possibility of creating a CBDC since such an action poses it's own risks; causing a restriction to freedom of choice to citizens who want to make use of their money and also intruding on the privacy of users. This has further pushed the thought of a US CBDC to the back burner. Notwithstanding, she acknowledged the importance of CBDCs and it's advantages which are: - presenting opportunities to those without access to traditional banking activities- and catching up to the Fed's global counterparts like the People's Bank of China which has its own product (the digital yuan) in place. However, a creation of a CBDC could become harmful when it becomes interest oriented as they present a difficult competition to banks, sidelining their ability to lend. My confusion though is this: the Fed reserve operates independently of the US govt and it's monetary policy decisions are not approved by either the Congress or the US president. Now while this helps them operate free of political pressure, it also limits it's accountability rate. Won't this FedNow service also suffer such, since the apple doesn't fall far from the tree??

This has further pushed the thought of a US CBDC to the back burner.I do not understand how FedNow has back burned the US CBDC thoughts because it is the CBDC in type of FedNow! And i think this cannot be fully implemented other than a few states but will not be accepted by the majority of people. That's a curious thing to observe because my thoughts were Biden was behind the CBDC because he always supports it unlike Trump and his companions. Even Trump and his companions had tried a lot to go against BTC and CBDC (indirectly using BTC). I think now i understand why they were against BTC from the start because they know CBDC will halt their (not accusing but we all know money moves from here and there in the dark) money flow. so they use BTC as bait to stop the implementation of CBDC (FedNow).Quote from: Majestic-milf on April 19, 2023, 12:08:19 PMWon't this FedNow service also suffer such, since the apple doesn't fall far from the tree?? Your thoughts.https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/fed-governor-bowman-casts-doubt-on-the-need-for-a-us-digital-dollar.htmlActually, FedNow had started back in 2019, and from then, feds have made really great efforts to make it sure to function proper. well in my sight, the odds are in favor of CBDC implementation. apart from its implementation success, if we talk about its flaws and shadows, then they are distinct for each user, like for some pros and cons and vice versa overall, decentralization with full transparency is more acceptable than transparency with centralization.",

Not, oh to bad so sad someone got into your account and send all your money away.It's also going to be cheaper for banks to use AND since it's not run by a bunch of banks other banks / credit unions will be able to get in easier then they can now.Eliminating BTC / crypto for a moment.

Do we want Big Brother watching our money moves? And don't get me started on banking monopolies.Let's face it, the Fed Reserve might be independent, but politics can still mess with it. If CBDCs become more about making big bucks than helping people, we're all gonna be losers.So, let's take it slow, weigh the pros and cons of CBDCs. In the meantime, let's build a financial system that puts regular folks first. Trust me, it's the best way!CBDC will be very disturbing for those who want freedom and data security, today's world community is aware of what banking does in controlling the economy through policies that can kill them, maybe yes Big Brother will easily monitor the financial activities that we do.Independent only on paper, they only hide in that sentence to cover their cover, who is willing to be a loser in plain sight.Actually we really have to be slow in understanding this innovation, maybe what we think is also wrong about their intentions in a financial system like that, maybe we have to look at the reconstruction of the Fed because we need a revolution in a fair financial system.",

They shouldn't try to do something just because China's doing it, and people who aren't using banks probably won't use a CBDC either (either because they're old and/or in rural areas, preferring cash, or because they don't use banks for privacy reasons and will trust a CBDC even less than they trust banks). My guess is that the decision to launch will be postponed or the launch will start only experimentally, on a very small scope to see how it goes.",
