Check that the email isn't ending up in your spam folder. If that doesn't work, email recoveries_2021_xxlgg@bitcointalk.org, ideally from the account's email address. Include your username. A signature will likely be required (see below).Having a digital signature option is not a requirement, particularly when you have access to both email addresses as mentioned. Simply make sure to send an email to support from your old email address.",

A notification will be sent to your old email address containing a link to lock your account. Once clicked on, your account will be locked. Even the hacker won't be able to access it using the new and old email address. Only way of unlocking it by contacting the recoveries team.QuoteDoes that mean you can't also receive a recovery process email if you click the \"forgot account\" button?I don't think so.",

Some evidence is required for the account recovery process, and it may take some time for you to get your account back if the recovery team agrees with your reasons and evidence.Email registration is required, some other supporting evidence is also needed, especially if you have ever posted something like a bitcoin address or something. I think the bitcoin address you posted via pm is also useful in your case.",
