  "content": "Hello everyone!I am writing this post to complain about a problem I have had with bitcasino, and since they don't answer me by email, I am writing here so they can give me a solution. A few weeks ago I deposited about 2k $ (about 0.05643 BTC) to play for a while and enjoy. After confirming my account with my identity, and winning a game, I doubled my balance, so far so good, after a while they sent me an email asking for more information about my account, and verify some information, so far so good, all verified. What was my surprise when after a while, I got an email telling me that my account was using \"Double Spend\" (if you win, then confirm your deposit on the Blockchain and attempt to withdraw, all winnings will be confiscated and your account will be closed permanently).  At this point I checked on the blockchain that the deposit reached them correctly in full, and I asked them for more information and I am still waiting for a response after 2 weeks, and I still can't access my account.Is this the treatment they give to their clients who win? Ask for a thousand information and accuse them of something not to pay them? Surely if I had asked for my money, there would have been no problem. At the very least I demand my money back (since I have not lost it). I have read that more users have had something similar happen to them. We demand answers.Scammers Profile Link:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2087138Reference Link:http://bitcasino.io/Amount Scammed:-0.05651041BTCPayment Method:BitcoinProof of Payment:https://prnt.sc/_TTONBPW1QCaLast email:https://prnt.sc/L5nFpPDfJ21wI demand a refund of my deposit at least, as I will not use this casino again.Thanks for all.",

I tried quoting, but the site you uploaded is not supported here. Sorry for the inconvenience, as I know how it feels for your money to get stocked somewhere with excuses that make completely no sense. But when they talk about double spending and you trying to withdraw all your winnings all at once, does that mean people are prohibited from getting all they got out all at once? „If yes, no one will be aware of this and still want to play in that casino when they know they can't get their money out.“ \"Well, let me not go further. Let's wait for the casino representative to say their own side of the story, not to conclude and make judgements just from one side.",

It's a case where a player deposit during a bitcoin congestion, which pretty much the same as current situation. That case seems to be solved with Steve of Sportsbet [the case was with SB] asked for the account to be re-checked, given OP of the thread didn't update their complaint.",

In other words if all you say is correct, they knew if the deposit was confirmed by the time you started playing. Did you by any chance try to do what they say you did: sent transaction >> saw your account was credited the moment the transaction hit the blockchain >> tried to withdraw immediately? Maybe you did and they labelled it as a scam attempt and banned you? I'm just wondering what went wrong.",

I guess this issue came because of the congestion and OP tried to rebroadcast the transaction and accidentally considered as a double spend.https://bitcasino.io/help-center/help-your-transactions/how-is-my-transaction-confirmed-",

I am also pretty sure that Bitcasino or their partners would not just accuse this bettor of an action without good reason. Their reputation is worth way more than $2000. There has to be more to the story that the OP hasn't given us. I'm not calling the OP a liar and I'm not saying a mixup couldn't have happened, but let's all remember that more than half the accusations we see in this section are false and intended to try to pressure a site to pay or smear a reputation.

Surely if I had asked for my money, there would have been no problem.Casinos only treat the users in this way when a user does anything suspicious. Bitcasino team has accused you for Bitcoin double spend attack, which is a rare case. I believe they have done it for having enough reasons or evidences. It can be seen that RBF was enabled on your deposit transaction. It isn't an evidence though, but RBF gives a hint that double spend is possible on that transaction.Quote from: holydarkness on December 16, 2023, 04:22:30 PMFor BTC, they require 3 confirmations. I guess this issue came because of the congestion and OP tried to rebroadcast the transaction and accidentally considered as a double spend.It is the number of confirmations which makes your deposited amount withdrawable, not the number of confirmations which is required for the deposits to be credited on Bitcasino account. Based on my personal experience, Yolo group casinos (Bitcasino, Livecasino, Sportsbet) credit Bitcoin deposits without the need of network confirmation.",

Ill do bullet points here and then if the Bitcasino rep wants to add anything further, they can (but i think they honestly consider this case to be closed)>> Due do the generous ZERO confirmations BC offer this enables people to come in, deposit, and start playing immediately without waiting for a confirmation. Unfortunately, some customers,  if they lose the bet, double spend the deposit back to their own address.>> In this case many accounts were linked to this customer. The BC team are confident in their investigation and as for this case, will not reverse the decision.>> It seems to be normal practice for old scam accusations to rise back up at every Bitcoin ATH, and this is no exception.Thanks for your time here guys. Im replying on behalf of BC as a gesture of good will to a few customers who reached out personally to me to get a response up for people to see.regards, Steve.(on behalf of Bitcasino.io)",
