  "content": "hello guysI will pay 50$(usdt) for code in python which can generate BNB-bep2(bnb beacon chain which starts with bnb1...) address from a mnemonic wallet 12 words.I mean assuming mnemonic 12 words example as: \"venture fitness paper little blush april rigid where find volcano fetch crack label polar dash\"the code should be able to give bnb bep2 address output as: bnb1zfz67wkqvzx0gdtrp42dhygcsnd6urye9f6xec this is also the output in Trustwallet for above mnemonic wallet.using only HDwallet lib(https://pypi.org/project/hdwallet/) would be so appreciated but not limited to.------------------------------------------------update: This project is done.",
