  "content": "We have been talking about address poisoning hack on this forum. It happens in a way hacks create an address similar to your altcoin address. It has happened to me when I was sending coins like USDT and some other altcoins which are not stable coins. But I understand about it and I easily avoided copying the address I sent coin to, instead I go to the receiving wallet or exchange to copy the address. You can know the hacker's address by noticing small amount not worth up to $1 sent to you with the hacker's address. If you check the address, it will be similar to your address but not you address. Avoid sending coins to the address. I do not know if it happens with bitcoin too, but I have not seen it while sending bitcoin. But if sending any coins, check the address you are sending to, make sure it is the same as the address you are sending to.Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/safe-wallet-scammer-steals-two-million-address-poisoningAddress poisoning is when an attacker creates a similar-looking address to the one a targeted victim regularly sends funds to — usually using the same beginning and ending characters.A crypto hacker specializing in “address poisoning attacks\" has managed to steal over $2 million from Safe Wallet users alone in the past week, with its total victim count now reaching 21. On Dec. 3, Web3 scam detection platform Scam Sniffer reported that around ten Safe Wallets lost $2.05 million to address poisoning attacks since Nov. 26.According to Dune Analytics data compiled by Scam Sniffer, the same attacker has reportedly stolen at least $5 million from around 21 victims in the past four months.Scam Sniffer, reported that one of the victims even held $10 million in crypto in a Safe Wallet, but \"luckily\" only lost $400,000 of it.",

With Bitcoin, it is called as Dust attack.Dust Attack, what it is, why it is dangerous and how to prevent falling to itPeople fall to this type of attack because they use one wallet for many tasks. They must do it more safely, like a main wallet is not used for exploration of new platforms, new projects. Explorations must be done with a new wallet and small one that will not cause them big issue with address poisoning scam attack or dust attack.",

Yeah it looks the same but there is difference in the two attacks this address poisoning is actual slightly different and easier for the scammers to attempt. The clipboard virus is harder because the scammers needs to find a way to get the malware into your device and then it changes the address when you copy it, this common with window OS and you they OS are not usually affected. But for dust attack or say address poisoning the attacker just looks at your address and create a similar address like it with similar beginning and ending and then uses this address to send you dust coins and when next you try to copy address you will actually mistakenly copy the hackers address from the transaction history without know since it’s similar. In this attack you’re actually copying and pasting the right address but it is that of that an hacker. Also dust attack can be use to monitor that address it is sent to even if you don’t make mistake to sent back to it which makes you to lose your privacy",

There are lot of Bitcoin scams and fraudulent activities of which in a common sense we wont think of it to be possible. There is probability that a scammer will be able to generate a similar address like yours. I have encountered this before and i mistakenly sent to that address. I waited and taught it was my network issue that i have seen the coin. Before i traced and saw it was a scam attack. The remedy to this, is to always get the address directly from the exchange or wallet whenever you want to make a transaction.",

The best way to beat this scam is to start scanning instead of copying the address, some people also like storing the address somewhere online like inside their email, which is a bad practice, and also it's good to cross check the address very well, because once you send the coin it's not ever coming back if it's the wrong address. It's because of this hijacks and malware problem that I have running crypto software on computers, they just feel more vulnerable to these attacks than other hardwares, even a mobile phone is steps ahead better than using a PC, I can't count how many times I have formatted all my files because of one malware or trojan, even with a premium antivirus running.",

I only look at what the wallet started with and the ending letters, and I feel it's risky doing that because of this wallet poisoning attack. In the case of the clipboard virus, it also has to do with a simple situation where, after copying your wallet or someone else's wallet that you want to send funds to, the virus will convert your copied address to some other address, which, if you are not very careful,  will result in you sending your coins to a strange wallet that you will only realize later.",

I just wanted to write that this virus is probably most dangerous on mobile, but you beat me to it. I don’t use a phone when sending, and in my opinion, a computer is most convenient, since you have a field to carefully check the address. Likewise, I just can’t imagine how to do this on a mobile phone, constantly jumping from window to window (but I have no experience, and this is probably the reason)On the other hand, I agree that Windows is so unreliable that the likelihood of catching a virus or stealer arises with any accidental click on a link, which can hardly be expected from mobile systems.I will not repeat myself about Linux (although a couple of words should always be noted), however, I believe that you always need to blame yourself, and your inattention, since sending coin addresses requires the owner, not two eyes, but several checks, but much more.",
