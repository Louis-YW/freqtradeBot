I'd like to keep my email address private, but I'm sure I can forward these to the winner somehow if they'd like. The buytrezor links in the email are dead now and just redirect to https://trezor.io/ Unfortunately I don't have the box it came in or associated paperwork if there was any. I definitely see how device tampering is a concern with hw wallets, but like you said I don't know why someone would open it considering they are fairly cheap brand new direct from trezor. Trezor support may be able to review and authenticate the package/holographic seal if the winner decides to ever open it for some reason. Also, the trezor is white, not black. Apologies for the title saying it's black!",
