      "body": "Following a plan like this on a narrow scale will make you realize a real loss because you will not collect any profits and will try to sell when the price drops.When you enter $ 22,200 - $ 22,400, the stop loss will be $ 21,859. These are not points of support or resistance, and the price moves between them, and therefore you will not benefit from anything from the stop loss order, except to sell at less than the price.The best possibility is to sell at 25,859 then either the barrier will not be broken, and then profits will be achieved, or it will be broken, and so on, ensuring the bottom of the next time, and so on.",
