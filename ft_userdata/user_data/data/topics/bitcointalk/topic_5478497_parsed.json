      "body": "Exchanging bitcoins in Vietnam shouldn't be too much of an issue because it ranks 2nd in Asia based on crypto volume held. As @mk4 has said, despite its popularity, it's illegal as a medium of exchange. Even though the government has not set out clear laws against it, they criticize it, as expected of course. Aside from Binance and Binance P2P which have already been mentioned, BitcoinVN and Vbtc are credible exchanges you can use to exchange your Bitcoin to fiat or from fiat to Bitcoin. Just make sure not to leave your coins in any exchange, not even Binance. Treat it as a marketplace where you buy coins and move to your non-custodial wallet or where you exchange for fiat and transfer the money to your bank account.",

Maybe try doing some research on Google to find out what you should do.

So as long as you follow the rules set by your country and transact Bitcoins, you won’t face any problem. Regarding where to buy the coins, then I would suggest try P2P exchanges like Binance or Paxful. Both have user friendly UI, and you can buy/sell coins in few clicks.",

But this should be best known by the citizens. We only read from the news.However, there are local bitcoin exchanges like the P2P platforms that are operating in the country. Like the BitcoinVN amongst others. I also heard that Cryptocurrency enthusiasts within the country through meet ups or events that they organize locally.There are other international exchanges like Binance and Coinbase that are equally being used but I don't really know whether they are restricted or regulations from the government of the Vietnam.",

According to Decision No. 27/2018/QD-TTg, the bitcoin industry is neither currently included in Vietnam’s system of economic sectors, nor is it included among the business areas in which foreign investment is restricted under the Investment Law 2020.As a result, it is understandable that Vietnamese legislation does not explicitly allow the trading of bitcoin, but there is also no specific regulation prohibiting these activities.Vietnam: Is it illegal to purchase or trade Bitcoin?Bitcoin law in Vietnam is almost the same as law in other neighboring countries, so the conclusion is as in the quote above.Quote from: addmeisme on December 19, 2023, 03:47:41 AM1. what is the best place for changing bitcoins in Vietnam?（bitcoin to cash）Maybe this topic can be important information for you.* Topic: Cash2VN - Crypto Remittance to Vietnam [cashout to local bank account & cash]Quote from: addmeisme on December 19, 2023, 03:47:41 AM2.what is best site for online exchanging?You can see here: Topic: BitcoinVN - Vietnam's first and oldest Bitcoin Exchange., Maybe that could be important information for you.",

Every country has its laws about digital currency or cryptocurrency and based on their laws someone will conclude whether it is legal or not. Both of your questions are very difficult to answer for a person who is not from that region but as according to my short research I came to know that if you are keeping cryptocurrency as an asset then it is legal but if you are using it as a medium of exchange it is illegal and a website I check said that Bitcoin is illegal here is the  Link of the website you can go and check it.Also if you are willing to know more about this then go to your local thread where you can easily get your answer from your country mates.This is the link to your local thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=60101.msg699542#msg699542",

LOL! Kidding aside, yeah, they aren't coming from Vietnamese or from people residing in Vietnam, but I guess it's not really a question of complicated legality. It's probably enough that OP knows that Bitcoin is legal in the country and that he/she can purchase some without violating any laws. OP, I guess tranthidung here is Vietnamese. She's probably one of the most, if not the most, prominent and active Vietnamese here. You might want to consult with her for first-hand information regarding Bitcoin in Vietnam.",

With this situation, the crypto market is actually booming as I have seen before many projects being introduced from Vietnam. Now, it would be different if the government can recognized this sector but then again this can be a lot better than the stance taken by the Chinese government in banning crypto. I am hoping to see more people from Vietnam talking and accepting cryptocurrency so one day Asia can be considered as the big leader and the bedrock of this new digital economy.",

Instead of saying 'Google might provide misleading results,' why not say 'Google can assist in finding valuable data from other websites'...that makes sense too, right? National media in Vietnam is undoubtedly a reliable source of data. It's better to trust that than avoiding Google forever just because we think it might present unreliable data.At least it's better than sticking to limited information that won't yield any results.For more detailed information, we can check out the Vietnamese-language thread on this forum.
