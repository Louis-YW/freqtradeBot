I have noticed that you are posting a lot of new threads in a last few days. Are you just after merits and views or something? I mean, have you thought about whether your contribution is really worth sharing on the forum? How do you even come up with all these ideas? It doesn't seem very natural to me.",

Don't go fast and in a hurry, take your time you cannot learn everything overnight, check what interests you more not because of the requirement on the signature you are eyeing to join, discussion should be natural and not redundant you should input your very own ideas not just the idea of the other posts that you have rewritten.If you want to know more about terminologies we have a section dedicated to that subject and Youtube has a lot of resources for those terminologies and we also have a lot of articles online.",

That's why I want to know how you get much familiar with all bitcoin technologies? What should I do? It's really hard in the beginning to grasp everything at one sitting, so my advise will be, just take it easy.1. if you encounter terms that you are not familiar then Google is your friend. Try to find out the meaning of that word2. read everything first before you post or answer3. just go around and play around the forum to familiarized your self",

Its not like everyone here at expert with that but when you continuously hearing and reading some terms and understand how does it work, slowly it become a knowledge to you and you already familiarize with it. If you arent aware on the topic, dont force yourself to engage but instead ask questions which is quite normal I guess.",

I wonder how you come up with such topics. For example, what if you don't know a term? Did you study at school? Did your teachers tell you that reading is the best tool? Today the world is flooded with the Internet; isn't it easier to explore it every time and strengthen your knowledge than to ask such questions and look like a fool?There is a good thread on the forum about smart search; try it.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5276341.0Although if you are not friends with Google, I doubt that this will help.",

That's why I want to know how you get much familiar with all bitcoin technologies? What should I do? If you got confuse about the words used on crypto scene you can simply search it up in google since it can make your life easier to understand those words.Also try to stick on the sections where it catch your interest since topics there can help you familiarize on how to use this forum then search other information you need outside of that board. To many things to do before you can fully understand how this industry works and you need to do months of study to be prepared on ventures you want to do.",

The truth is that nobody knows everything, but with someone's constant research, the knowledge develops. It is a process that takes time; nobody needs to rush through it. Many senior users of the forum who are knowledgeable about many discussion sections also began out at one level.Therefore, when you learn more about  entire Bitcoin, you become more familiar with its various sections, However, to make things simpler for you to comprehend, always focus on the sections that got your attention always, we not are expert in all sections of Bitcoin that why arguments do occur.",

That's why I want to know how you get much familiar with all bitcoin technologies? What should I do? Simple solution is to ignore boards that you are not familiar especially if you are not interested on it. There is no need to get involved on every topic on the forum and just focus on topics that caught your interest. Make it a step by step process to learn different branches of crypto to avoid confusion and mixed up knowledge.You use the ignore board option of the forum to temporarily hide all the boards that you didn't want to see so that you can focus only on topic that you want.

Getting familiar with threads is actually simple.Keeping it real and natural, making a contribution inline with the thread and not just looking for merit.When you see a thread that interests you, take a little time and go through it, there are many threads, you can always fine one and make a contribution. Do this every day and gradually you will be much familiar with the threads.Getting familiar with the thread has no special strategy other than finding a thread that you can make a good contribution on.",

The best thing to do is to take your time and study the thread, I believe most threads created in this forum are useful and important, as well as informative and knowledgeable, especially the technical threads, they speak a lot about Bitcoin technology, privacy, and security of our Bitcoin wallets, so if you take your time you will gain extensive knowledge in the thread, and there is also room for questions if you have a question regarding the thread.",
