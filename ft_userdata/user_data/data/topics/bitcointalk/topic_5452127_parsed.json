  "content": "I have always looked forward to the day that Nigeria will call off their Bank ban on crypto, but I fear that the value of our stored Bitcoin will reduce. What I mean is that, the price of dollar or usdt in binance or other exchange P2P is roughly #743 but the official price of dollar/Tether if we buying via bank is lower but the ban on crypto in Nigeria has ruled out using our local banks. Now when(if) Nigeria releases her ban on crypto, it would be possible to not only buy via P2P but also bank. This I believe would reduce the price of USDT and thus reduce the value of our stored crypto (Bitcoin) since Bitcoin is still being measured or expressed internationally in dollar.Lets say for example, A person buys 1BTC for $27500( #20 432 500 ) with a dollar = #743Assuming after the ban, buying from Banks is #500= $1Therefore, the true value of a stored Bitcoin (Keeping Bitcoin price Constant) will be #13 750 000.This is my personal thoughts on the subject.You can assist me in locating the flaws in my thought's.The #500 I used is just hypothetical, stated price is #460.44 currently at the point of writing.",

If you want to exchange to naira, you can create a thread about it on our board here. You can use Brainboss service. Igebotz also has is providing such service. But you can create a thread about it on our local board too.Quote from: She shining on May 09, 2023, 06:27:37 PMDoes that mean that the spike in the price of Dollar in the parallel market is as a result of Inflation or the high demand for dollar or both?Inflation is part of it. People are demanding for more dollar.Quote from: She shining on May 09, 2023, 06:27:37 PMIs there a way a thread can be I don't know Deleted?You want to delete a thread. No need for that. But there are sometimes you may want to delete a topic, example is when you make some changes and nobody has posted on the thread. You can edit it to 'del' or 'delete' and report it to be deleted.

If you keep bitcoin of 0.009 BTC in wallet for 10 years and if you go and check it the unit would never change but price of bitcoin might change.Quote from: She shining on May 09, 2023, 05:04:46 PMWhat I mean is that, the price of dollar or usdt in binance or other exchange P2P is roughly #743 but the official price of dollar/Tether if we buying via bank is lower but the ban on crypto in Nigeria has ruled out using our local banks.

Even after then till now nothing has changed. Although I understand the point you are trying to make  but I believe  it does not affect our assets.Where I was beginning to see your point is towards the enaira app. If binance should accept the enaira app integration as a payment processor then there lies the problem because government would likely be bent on them using the official rate and other members too would want to buy with it since the official rate is cheaper than the black market rate and it would cause a little panic in the Nigeria Crypto community.",

Though It's difficult to predict the outcome, but the value of Bitcoin may decrease if buying through banks becomes more accessible and the value of USDT drops. It’s also possible that more people using Bitcoin could increase its value. Stay informed and make decisions based on intensive research.",

Secondly, you have to take a look at the availability of physical dollars at the official market compared to the availability of Bitcoin or any other coins you want to sell in the local market. Just as Charles TM said the price of the dollar in the official market vs the black market has not been the same long before the cryptocurrency bank ban,  and this will not change even if the ban is lifted,  so there is no need to panic as to what becomes the value of your bitcoin if eventually the ban is lifted. What you should also note is that,  if going by Bitcoin's decentralized nature and privacy orientation,  no one that is good knowledge of the price differences between the official market and the black market will option is to choose a bank over exchange for Bitcoin transaction,  this is the more reason why even after the Bitcoin/crypto ban in Nigeria it transaction still increase in volume on constant bases because even before the ban on bitcoin and bank transactions,  not many use the bank to either buy bitcoin or sell bitcoin at that time,  so this is just your imagination and bitcoin p2p market has gone far above what you are imagining at the moment.",

It also means the banks would have to claim taxes from the P2P or businesses who operate as individual banks.It would also mean that crypto has been accepted as a legal tender for businesses and others that depend on it for commerce. Our stored BTC will not loose its value, I believe. Instead, we might see changes in prices of charges being reduced of course, new payment processes added and new blocks or forks added to the network.New agencies might be set up too to monitor the market as well as upgrade on KYC verification. This has been their original call to action to check hackers and scammers and terroristic inclinations from users, inorder to know who does what, who sent what, how much was sent, to whom it was sent and other inquiries. It simply goes beyond what a decentralized idea stands for, hence why nothing can happen to our stored BTC because it is out of their reach and in our hands to transact at our rate and at through the medium we deem best suited.",

Because I could remember back then when my Access bank card had a dollar card limit of $3000, and recently due to the new cashless CBN policy, the limit was reduced to $300, of which still small compared to what most people trade per day on peer to peer, because I think that was the reason why black market had the most trade volume simply because it allows for unlimited trade. Because of what benefits will it be lifting the ban on crypto when the only dollar people could afford is either $100 to $300 per month",
