Your intentions is different from mine and that's how it differs to every other person. Another thing is nobody goes into anything for losses it's either for the knowledge or for profits. And for a privacy supporter like me I just realized this recently that im more into Bitcoin because of its privacy and freedom, I don't like being controlled so I chose to be free with my finance with the help of Bitcoin.",

It recovers, establishes new ATH points, and it's still adopted by less than 5% of human population, so there's a huge growth potential here. Unlike fiat, which loses value over time, Bitcoin does the opposite. I also enjoy having at least some money that I can keep to myself, without relying on banks and monetary policies. Bitcoin provides financial freedom, so owning some is a way of partaking in it.",

The technology, profits & thrill are related to each other. Let me break it down a bit:1. Why are we here, it is because we have the hope of getting profits offered by bitcoin, remember that bitcoin has a very limited supply and this will affect its price.2. Why do we believe in bitcoin? the technology. That's what makes us confident and believe because with the support of bitcoin technology, it will elevate value of its small supply.3. We love the thrill, the thrill of being in the midst of financial evolution.Come on, don't lie to yourself, we are all here basically to get future profits.",

If people don't understand what they invest for, they will never feel safe at anytime including when they're sleeping. When people can feel safe by investing in Bitcoin because they believe in decentralization, knowing they're almost impossible to get hacked, and know where they hide their back up, those are the real Bitcoin enthusiasts.",

Some people bought it and see it as a currency, so that they can use it to buy goods and services due to its decentralized nature.I am into bitcoin because I am using it as a store of value for my savings, since my country fiat currency is depreciating everyday, since bitcoin serves as a hedge against inflation. We all know that if you hodli for a very long time, there is a certain profit that your investment will generate for you, and that is the most important part.",

And since bitcoin is an investment and the reason for holding should be for profit. Holding permanently does not really make any sence to me.

And at the end of the day you might even lose everything. And no profit and a scattered capital. That is perfect way to do things buy when it low and sell when it is high. I don't think I can wait for 10 years to sell. Once am okay with the profit then I will sell. Then wait to rebuy.",

Don't also forget that those of them that are buying and holding, they are doing so because they want their investment to increase in profit, and subsequently take their profit hence they feel like, so the idea of being a holder for life is something I'm not really getting clear, because as some point in life, you would want to make use of your investment.",
