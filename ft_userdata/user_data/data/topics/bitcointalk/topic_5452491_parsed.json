      "body": "On facebook streaming page, problem only is a bit of a delay with the match but that's fine with me as long as the fight is continuous and there are no interruptions with the vid. I am one with those who cannot afford spending money for pay-per-view also, not really that of an avid van to spend more than what I use to bet. Result will come out in the first place and it is enough for me to just watch the game or fight with some delays. If it is just ethical concerns, live streams of a fight or match on facebook are stolen from the main service provider. So if such thing matters that much on your end, go with PPV to atleast give support to the operators of that much or the management itself. Also, on other platforms, such thing is prohibited which pushed me to settle with what I can access.",

And for a couple of reasons too!For one, the whole site is becoming less and less moderated due to the decline in active users, which means unsolicited fight streams get away with just being posted in there, and with no issues or fear of getting caught and receiving the ban hammer too!Second, it’s much like twitch now with all these donations and stars coming in that helps a streamer get by, and even though it’s not much, it’s definitely something and could inspire the streamer to do more of those in the future. Lastly, it’s free, and you can run it even in the weakest of computers. Facebook being built for much older devices makes it very friendly for users across the planet. So it generally offers high quality streaming, without taking up too much phone or PC ram. And yeah it’s cross platform too so you can watch it everywhere!",

I think in watching free live matches on Facebook we should be careful, sometimes there are malicious links that they put into it that could be at risk to our devices. I think some sportsbooks offer a free live match to watch as long as you are a player to them.",

If not you can use a VPN and the stream should be available. If the VPN is a free one with a low speed, the stream may lag though.",

There should be a sports section there.Sometimes, there are good samaritans there that share free streaming links. It's better to hunt those links as it has the same quality as live match (in most cases) and are almost synchronized with the live match. There's no also annoying streamer there like on Facebook shared streams.Anyways, if you are used to watching Facebook shared live stream if you have time, try also to browse a stream where there is no commentator from the live sharer. Sometimes, it can be found on the small sports page. But if no choice, then will really end up at those with have streamers.",

Although i could afford on paying up that PPVbut i could just simply go into my friends house not to have some freebie or free of charge watch but to enjoy it together with friends. If i dont able to see it live then there's always that replay as long im not really that get spoiled early.",

IPTV subscription is the one I’m using right now because it cover all the premium sports channel without the need to purchase the actual premium cost. I’m tired clicking on the ads from free streaming website while facebook streamer usually interrupted when they are detected by facebook moderator.There’s a lot of users offering IPTV premium subscription with minimal cost. I still have some that will gonna expired this November that I get on our local forum that is related for gadgets technology. Try to browse on your local forum(outside forum that focus on tech) because some user typically drop some free IPTV subscription in there to save money although the premium subs is not that expensive compared to the actual cost of the channels subs.",

A lot of websites do offer free streaming but I would be careful with them if I were you. First, in the advertisements, a lot of pop-ups will come out. Then, there's the security issue, you don't know what your computer could get with those websites. Instead of that, I would rather watch full replays and there are a lot of websites that also save copies of the fight without ads coming out. Just try to google full replays and you will find it in the first page.",
