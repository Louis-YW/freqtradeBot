First and foremost how will you establish the trust between you and your users? In a licensed exchange users are trusting the license providers at least.I don't think creating an exchange even from the scratch is a big deal. In fact these days you can have ready made scripts from trusted sources and run your own exchange with a little knowledge about crypto and it's tech. QuoteIf anyone's interested in helping program the site and help run it in exchange for a percentage of the profits please let me know. Why will anyone need you? They can have their own exchange without expecting a percentage from you.",

      "body": "First of all, do you have at least some experience with dark web that you want to open exchange there? It's completely different thing than opening exchange on \"surface\" web.Building exchange it's not a problem. More important how you're planning to build your trust that people would use your service? Don't get me wrong, but I'm not sure that you're realy serious or it's just random business idea without any knowledge and plans how to make it working.",

Who is going to bank roll the project for you when you can not even read computer code to know what a developer is using for your project. Do you think building an exchange as you have said is something you could just one day start talking about when you have no knowledge about? I will suggest you take your time to look into it and try do a little study on it .",

      "body": "I agree with @Cantsay that you need to do some more research and planning before you get started.A few things to consider:What is your unique selling proposition? Why should people trade cryptocurrencies on your exchange instead of another one?What kind of users are you targeting? Experienced traders or beginners?What features and services will you offer? Margin trading? Derivatives? A variety of cryptocurrencies?How will you ensure the security of your users' funds?How will you comply with applicable laws and regulations?Once you have a good understanding of these things, you can start to think about programming your exchange. This is a complex task, so it's important to find experienced developers who have experience with cryptocurrency exchanges and the dark web.",

It is true that you will not be able to collect IPs and tracking data, but the users who will use your service will have better technical knowledge and therefore you need to create something special to make them use your service, and you will be under the eyes of the authorities as you are running an illegal activity that contrary to licensing regulations.To start with exchange, you need a lot of liquidity and a good technical and marketing team, but to succeed, you need more than that, so provide more details.",

I will take everyones ideas and support into consideration.Everything starts with what you want all the previous recommendations and suggestions here in your thread are to make you aware of the many obstacles that you're going to face, you have a different idea because honestly, this is the first time I've read someone wants to work on the dark web right away with ample knowledge about the dark web.I think it is better to explore the dark web since this is the place you want to work, explore, and learn everything about the dark web and how they do business here you will need a mentor who has work similar to what you want to aspire to.",

If anyone's interested in helping program the site and help run it in exchange for a percentage of the profits please let me know.Just a question for you, why do you want to open a crypto exchange on the dark web and why not open it on the normal Web? What is so special about the exchange business in darkweb? Do you know any existing dark web exchange   Also opening an exchange requires a lot of money, not open to setup the exchange only but also to run it and of course, you need a budget for marketing too. Do you have that much budget? I hope you know the difference between trading on an exchange and owning your own exchange.",
