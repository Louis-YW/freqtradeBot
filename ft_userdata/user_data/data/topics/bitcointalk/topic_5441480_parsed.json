The next stage might be during the trial of Sam later this year where some witnesses will be put on the stand to speak about what CZ did on FTT without giving the whole information on why CZ liquidated their position on FTT.Binance’s Asset Shuffling Eerily Similar To Maneuvers By FTXWhen you’re the world’s largest crypto exchange in a largely unregulated market, it is easy to make up the rules as you go. In its latest backroom maneuver, Binance transferred $1.8 billion in stablecoin collateral to hedge funds, including Alameda and Cumberland/DRW, leaving its other investors exposed.Source https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierpaz/2023/02/27/binances-asset-shuffling-eerily-similar-to-maneuvers-by-ftx/However, this article with more information makes me shake my head. Is this media attack by Forbes real or fud?Forbes, yet again, investigated the on-chain activities of Binance and discovered that the exchange transferred $1.78 billion in users’ funds to various hedge funds. The article reveals that the Changpeng Zhao-led exchange completely emptied its collateral for B-peg USDC without reducing its supply.Binance issues a B-token to facilitate the usage of other blockchain tokens in the BNB chain. The exchange is supposed to issue B-token only after storing 100% collateral of the original token. For example, for every 100 B-USDC, it must have 100 USDC as collateral.However, the exchange broke its rules on Aug. 17, withdrawing $3.63 billion from its peg wallet to the “Binance 8” cold wallet. It then returned $1.85 billion to the peg wallet but transferred the remaining $1.78 billion to a Binance 14 cold wallet. Later, the exchange distributed the funds to a trading firm, Cumberland, Amber Group, Alameda Research, and TRON founder Justin Sun. When Binance withdrew $1.78 billion USDC on Aug. 17, it did not decrease the supply of the B-USDC. The collateral fell to zero, and the exchange did not correct it for four months.The article also states that B-USDC was deficient by over $1 billion on three different occasions. Forbes believes Binance is misusing customers’ funds, similar to the bankrupt exchange FTX.Source https://beincrypto.com/binance-misusing-customers-funds/",

The next stage might be during the trial of Sam later this year where some witnesses will be put on the stand to speak about what CZ did on FTT without giving the whole information on why CZ liquidated their position on FTT.There's been a lot of attack on Binance since FTX downfall so I definitely see this scenario plausible. Either way, anyone who still has money on any exchange after everything that has happened is playing a dangerous game. Since Bloomberg article is paywalled, here is the archived version. Quote from: mindrust on February 28, 2023, 04:26:52 AMI think binance is a serious exchange and they won't go down easily. FTX was a clown since the beginning. I've never ever created an account at FTX and the moment I heard people talking about FTX, I was like wtf \"where did this thing come from?\"Just because you never used FTX doesn't mean that others didn't. FTX was being mentioned quite often here on bitcointalk, people liked \"no withdrawal fees and no KYC approach\" and it was even dubbed as a \"new Binance\". After all, if many people didn't use FTX, it wouldn't have such an impact on the market.Regarding this \"where did they come from\", Binance also kinda came out of nowhere back in mid 2017 and just 6 months later they were already the exchange with the biggest volume so when FTX showed up, their  growth was nothing that we haven't seen seen before. Quote from: mindrust on February 28, 2023, 04:26:52 AMBinance on the other hand has real users. Real trades happen there. So it is not one of those wash trading exchanges.All exchanges do that to some degree. Some more, some less, but I don't believe reported numbers one bit even if it comes from Binance or Coinbase.",

I think their goal is beyond that. They are seeking to completely hit Crypto, I guess. They are following Binance's mistakes aggressively because they know that hitting it will be a very painful blow to Crypto.Some are happy with what is happening to Binance because they think it will reduce the centralization in Crypto that Binance is trying to create by controlling the market, but at the same time I fear that hitting Binance will be like an earthquake in the Crypto market.",

It would lead to many shitcoins being expunged from the crypto market. Many people believe Binance is infallible, a collapse would make them know better that self custody is the only right way to store BTC, it would also make many BTC users more interested in decentralized p2p exchanges and start using them for their trading.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on February 28, 2023, 06:46:23 PMsupporting competitors and having strong competition is the solution.Centralized competitors are not any better.",

This is exactly what FTX were doing to \"balance\" their books - they simply created a fake user account and then loaded it up with $8 billion in liabilities. And even if their Merkle root is not tampered with, it does not include any institutional liabilities, loans, open trading positions, and so on. Binance could be massive in the red and we would never know, regardless of what the proof of reserves says. And let's not even touch on the fact that they moved billions of dollars of crypto in to their account the day before they submitted to a third party audit, and then moved it all out again shortly after.

There will be $50 billion in BNB and countless more billions in centralized tokens on the various Binance centralized scamchains people will be dumping and trying to convert back to bitcoin. There will be an unknown number of small alts where Binance makes up almost all of their volume, which people will be dumping and trying to convert back to bitcoin. And long term, there will be an awful lot of people who learn a hard lesson about centralized shitcoins and stick to bitcoin from then on.",
