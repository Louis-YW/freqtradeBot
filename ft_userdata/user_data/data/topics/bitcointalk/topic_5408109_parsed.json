I worry that I am holding non-compliant crypto in my portfolio Non compliant to the authority right? I think thats fine, bitcoin is decentralized and not totally following any rules or whatever standard the government are asking them to do, also founder is nowhere to be found so likely no one to talk too about terms and prerequisite of it. For me, you are holding major coins, its not gonna collapse just like that.",

I worry that I am holding non-compliant crypto in my portfolio Thank you \"I am holding ADA, ATOM. In my opinion these are 2 tokens with very good potential and future growth. ATOM, I have nothing to discuss with what they are doing, but with ADA today they continue to announce the delay in updating cardano visil. ADA's team seems to be quite slow in keeping the schedule for ADA. This is the 2nd delay, but i believe they are still doing their best and ADA will catch up with the others soon",

I didn't like the fundamental of this coin. I hope that you can understand what i meant in my post. ADA's ecosystem was growing so fast compared with another token as well. If the bullish market will come back again and im sure this coin will be growing so fast. ADA may become the next solana based on the growth of its ecosystem and so holding it will become a very good choice for now.",

It's better that you don't go trending with the hype in this market. In the long run, I see safety as well as a good profit with the things you mentioned. Hold on to it and don't panic, but in my opinion, you also need to invest more in the basics of this market to avoid being confused by false news.",

I worry that I am holding non-compliant crypto in my portfolio Good set for investing, but I would exclude Stellar from this list. The coin has been underdeveloped for the last 5 years and the fact that they never managed to update the 2018 ATH suggests that it is not a promising altcoin, but one of those projects that is stuck in the past, it is stomping on one place. You should also wonder what you expect from this investment. If x100 or something like that, you picked the wrong coins. You should choose from new altcoins and not from those that have already grown by thousands of percent. If you are considering these projects in the long term, they are good options, except for Stellar.",
