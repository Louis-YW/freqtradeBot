  "content": "website - https://tonlottery.siteAbout the projectTON Lottery is the first numerical decentralized lottery operating in the \"The Open Network\" network.The fundamental principles of the lottery are freedom, transparency, and honesty. These concepts are achieved by using the capabilities of smart contracts.The source code of the lottery is in the \"smart contract\", which is part of the TON network. It cannot be closed, deleted, or changed.A smart contract is the same wallet as everyone else, but with the ability to run algorithms. Anyone can look at all incoming or outgoing lottery transactions.The contract is completely autonomous, it does not require the participation of third parties, everything happens automatically on the TON network. Even the organizers of the project are not able to influence the result of the drawings, or withdraw funds to their wallet. The source code of the project has been verified, and anyone can also get acquainted with it.Advantages of TON Lottery:Participation from anywhere in the world, with any citizenshipFully open source project codeInstant payouts (even large jackpots)Guaranteed prize (after the jackpot draw, the next jackpot will not start from scratch)The commission for maintaining the product is only 10 percent, compared to state lotteries, whose percentage is 30-60 percentCOMPLETE anonymity. No registration, no bank cardsThe rules cannot be changed, since it is impossible to edit the source code of the productGuaranteed payouts - all winnings are sent automatically, they cannot be canceledwebsite - https://tonlottery.site",

New bie really do not have reputation so hence there is every possibility that members would find it difficult paying attention to your offer because of your rank as a new bie but since it is a new project, I think you get registered for a copper member account and seek the expertise of a reputable signature campaign manager to help promote and advertise your project because it would call attention to your site as it is being done by a good manager. Lastly I checked your website but there seems to be no concrete information about your terms and conditions, license and team behind the project. It will be nice you look into this and help fix them up.",

I have successfully moved to the correct boardI could not reproduce this error, moreover, the certificate was issued by AlphaSSL CA, for some reason your browser does not trust it. Could you try from another browser/device and give feedback?",

But still there is a big difference with playing our product and the state lottery: Honesty (open source), the instant of any payments, a game from any country, etc.Quote from: Broadanbig on February 02, 2023, 07:13:00 PMIt is good you are here and welcome onboard.

It will be nice you look into this and help fix them up.Thank you for the feedback.We considered it superfluous to load the site with additional information. The website is only a visualization of the data stored in the lottery smart contract. Further rule changes are not possible. Of the things that really need to be finalized (and what we are going to do) is to improve this visual part (the ability to play through a telegram bot, statistics, analytics, etc.) [Moderator note: consecutive posts merged (separated via horizontal lines)]",
