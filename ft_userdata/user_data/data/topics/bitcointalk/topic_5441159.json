      "body": "Why the choice of the domain, though? It doesn't bring out the first impression that it's related to p2p trading of cryptocurrencies like the way Localbitcoins or Localcryptos would.Your project also needs a lot more exposure if you are to get volumes. So you are going to invest so much in promotions and adverts if you want to have a chance of pulling numbers.",

      "body": "First of all, welcome to the forum, its nice to see a new addition to the bitcoin p2p platforms. Would you like to mention any key advantage(s) of using your platform rather than binance's p2p service which is even totally free compared to yours (which takes a 0.5% fee)? Quote from: MySecure on February 24, 2023, 11:38:17 PMBe part of the new MySecure DEX community.I guess dex and p2p are not the same ?!I would also recommend you to do some promotional events in the forum like giveaways for most active traders, sig. campaign, etc. It will help build your brand image  Hope you consider it. Good luck!",

      "body": "Setting up a Bitcoin P2P is very nice and hopefully it's secured as much as possible. I do believe that much marketing is still needed for this platform for a massive adoption and ratings. On the other side I don't know if 0.5 commission is fair because many CEX will alow you use P2P for free, unless the 0.5 commission is coz of no KYC, but I will prefer to do KYC and use P2P for free than Withdraw P2P with 0.5 charge without KYC",
