  "content": "I hope you all are having a good evening.  I have decided to share this over here because I searched about this apparent new service on the forum and I did not find anything.I was checking the Trezor hardware wallet webpage today (since there was a new update available for their software), I decided to explore the web and I realized Satoshilabs listed a new project I had never heard about before.It seems the creators of the Trezor hardware wallets are currently working on a non-KYC, private and possibly open-source marketplace where people would be allowed to exchange their Bitcoin for FIAT (electronic and cash).The name of the service seems to be Vexl and it is focused on privacy and discretion. If you feel like checking it out, feel free to visit Trezor's official webpage and move onto the \"company\" section. I prefer to reserve the right to share any links due to the nature of this application and concerns on people's privacy around here.What do you think about this initiative by Satoshilabs?If their app manages to accumulate a decent volume, would regulators get involved?Would you use it or give it a try?Do you feel any enthusiasm at all for private Bitcoin marketplaces?I personally feel curious about it, but I'll let Satoshilabs to properly work on it more and let the volume grow before downloading it.",

It is not a good beginning, I admit.Eager to see if they release it next year for more countries. If they remain on those stores I am sure the IRS, FBI and CIA will ask Google for the complete list of Android users who downloaded it, basically a honeypot.",

They also have their code on GitHub[1] so that's also a plus! The few references to this company / service that I was able to find was this job post from Satoshilabs[2] (if we assume it's the same post that their LinkedIn[3] page did, it was posted 2 months ago) and this[4] post from ~ 3 months ago at r/Cryptocurrency. Do note that the Twitter alias first registered on the platform in 2011 and the first tweet - I may be wrong on this one - was done on 10th of September by replying to this one[5] from Pavol Lupták.

Každý je u nás vítán!...and it may mean that they only allow Czech, Slovak, Polish and Hungarian. But I may be wrong.(...)I think you are somewhat right NeuroticFish (at least for now). If we check the Twitter profile of the CEO of SatoshiLabs (@slushcz) we are able to find this tweet[6] from 10th of September regarding Vixl country restrictions:QuoteCurrently only Czech and Slovak numbers are allowed, as Vexl is in public beta and we are testing it in our countries first.My guess is that they are starting in a low profile and see how the service behaves in a limited audience while at the same time gathering data/feedback about the service. According to their FAQ[7] they currently do not add a fee to the transactions made in the app (probably will be implemented in the future) to cater users to use even more the service thus increasing their database (within the selected countries).Oddly their donation page[8] appears to not be working as of now, perhaps this means that they have a good funding from Satoshilabs?[1]https://github.com/vexl-it/vexl[2]https://satoshilabs.com/job/416040-react-native-developer.html[3]https://www.linkedin.com/company/vexl-it[4]https://libreddit.spike.codes/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xt11wp/satoshilabs_just_released_a_new_app_to_trade/[5]https://nitter.net/wilderko/status/1568583861713387521#m[6]https://nitter.net/slushcz/status/1568617430020247557#m[7]https://vexl.it/faq/others[8]https://pay.satoshilabs.com/apps/2jSjLWx4uVsXcGZNRUSiv9tpzh7X/pos",

      "body": "Can anyone else see a crypto based app called vexel in their app store? This feels like it could've been a confusing name choice. There are reviews for it dating back to August too unless they're part of satoshi labs or not a competitor.Given its description as a social network, I could imagine it either feeling very centralised and controlled or being prone to scam (without the software doing a lot of hand holding).I don't think they expected many people to find their app either (based on how hard it is to find) so there's a good chance it'll be a long way down the line. I thought most hardware wallets already had some forn of immediate exchange too but I could be wrong on that one (I've normally used cexes or p2p for the lower fees).",

I thought that this is going to be a marketplace, where goods and services can be bought and sold for BTC, something like Openbazaar(which failed years ago). I guess that this is going to be just another decentralized exchange.Selling BTC for electronic fiat seems very risky, because electronic fiat transactions can be reversed. I wonder what kind of security measures will be taken in order to protect the users from scams.Let's see if Vexl can offer something more than the other big p2p crypto platforms.",

It looks like much more to something like localbitcoins but in a decentralized version without the hassles of KYC imposition. It looks like the innovation here is that they operate out of a Bitcoin mixer which allows a certain degree of privacy for buyers. It leaves us to know if they will allow swaps between users.",

Vexl website appears to be similar to Craigslist. It appears it only allows users to publish advertisements. Cash payments and face-to-face transactions might be successful, but online payments are likely to be rife with fraud. I keep a close eye on the Pandora Cash project, a new privacy-focused initiative. Recently, I discovered a peer to peer marketplace that is decentralized and private by default. I believe moderators are there to help defend you against bad actors. All payments are made anonymously by using Pandora Cash for every transaction. This marketplace is called LibertyTown. I think you can even use BTC to get in and get out. I believe that is what BTC needs. A quick and secure method for conducting offline transactions.",

Not necessarily the Satoshilabs will succeed in this area, but the main thing is they are trying to develop the area of cryptocurrencies in this way. Without trying to create something new, we wouldn't see bitcoin these days. So, my attitude to this is only positive.Your question about the actions of the regulator is very relevant. I also have fears that when the trading platform grows and gains prominence, regulators will definitely come to them. As is usually the case in such cases, this marketplace will undergo changes and the privacy of their users will be lost. I would not want it to happen that way, but in this regard, I have negative forecasts.I think I would try this marketplace when it's ready. It's still too early to talk about it. We'll see.",

I think that this \"we don't know\" approach is pretty much asking for troubles...I agree.I would have expected Satoshilabs to have some kind of escrow system, like that implemented on Bisq. Having a platform like this one without some way for people to counter scam attempts is to ask scammers to come around.Perhaps, Satoshilabs wants this app to be based on the sole reputation of the merchants on-app (something similar to what we have here on Bitcointalk with the feedback system) probably that is why the app requires phone number?, however that means some people will get inevitably scammed. Also, besides phone number the app needs other kind of verification layer to prevent SIM-swap attacks.",
