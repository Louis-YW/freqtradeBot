  "content": "Today, the genesis block, also known as the first bitcoin, was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto 14 years ago. Millions of blocks have been mined into the blockchain by bitcoin miners since the currency's creation. It was created as a substitute for centralized fiat money, which bitcoin is decentralized. History indicates that the first block was mined almost instantly because it had a difficulty of 1. Unlike the vast majority of Bitcoin blocks today, the genesis block was almost certainly mined by a computer using its central processing unit (CPU). As of June 2022, there were roughly 19.07 million Bitcoins in use. Accordingly, only 1.92 million Bitcoins are available for mining, and more than 90% of all Bitcoins are already in circulation. According to experts, the last bitcoins will be mined by 2140.We still have a long way to go before we can completely mine the entire bitcoin blockchain. Despite the controversy, bitcoin is still prevailing and gaining global awareness, with the hope of being accepted globally in the coming years.https://www.blockchain-council.org/cryptocurrency/how-many-bitcoins-are-left/https://learn.bybit.com/crypto/21-million-bitcoin-limit-mined/",

Maybe, it will give him clarification on some matters towards bitcoin. But in any case, 2140 or earlier, it is only suggesting that most of us will not be here on Earth anymore when that happens. So wonder if btc will really live that long or will there be new technology that will arise and replace btc? Who knows?",
