If I'm the apprentice what that will come to my mind is to establish something without letting anyone know that i won bet",

I will never give the boss anything but just little amount if I appreciate him as a boss.",

      "body": "1. My first question to the Girlfriend is will she had splitted the money had the guy lost? Although it was stingy act by the guy to gave her only 10k even its now his right to add more to the money or not since he took the risk alone. If it was me like 10 million will be going to her because I know she will still come for mine even if I gave her more so I will just use the rest I have on my to give to buy stuffs for her.2. Its actually a self centered attitude by the boss, he played no role in the bets nor was the apprenticeship any way related to winning that bet so any money giving to the boss by the apprentice was just a gift and nothing more attach to it. Personally I will be gifting the boss 3 million of that amount",

Giving her 1 to 5 million naira is not a bad idea.I think we should consider the other side of the story had it been he lost in the bet, I believe he gave her back the same amount that he stole simply because his girlfriend is not worth giving more than that. May be before he won the gamble she has said a lot of bad things to him thinking that he was going to lose and pay her back the amount that he stole or her attitude towards him when she realised that her boyfriend is a gambler has not been fare, probably there must be something that is not clear in the story of OP.",

      "body": "Well from me if I stole my girlfriend money and she's not aware of what I used it to do then it is better for not to talk much but rather plan well with her and make a good business for her although is dependent on how serious our relationship is before I could go that extent otherwise, I will give her 10 percent of total money won from the gambling site. Then talking of an apprentice well I won't split my money because it wasn't from my boss or do I stole from him to make my bet, but what I will do is to help him with at least little percentage from the total amount won rather share my money into two, I might decide to leave the work and an enroll myself elsewhere if he didn't accepted what I gave him as an offer from my mind besides who will open to him I win such amount of money. I do care about my security coupled with the compromised system in Nigeria lack of insecurity etc. So it would be better for me to remain silent.",

For me the request from the girl is a fair deal. But the cheap way is to cut that relation and get a new gold digger.On the second story, even if he was an apprentice he doesn't owe anything to his boss, this was the apprentice win and he deserve to keep the full prize.",

The gf would probably even bar her bf on betting on normal days, and would only allow it to happen if he wins anything.2nd, the boss is just a vile mofo that wants to get everything in his plate. Prolly should just be the devil and ignored everyone honestly. Go somewhere far and be done with all the shit they are throwing him.",

The boyfriend should acknowledge that without her money he wouldn't have had the means to place the bet. And if he had lost the money, the girl would have been affected negatively. Maybe 5 million dollars wouldn't be a bad idea because no bank would give her such interest. For the second story, if I was the apprentice nobody would force me to split the money in half. He is my boss on the job and cannot control my finance. I would have to give him willing and not forcefully. If he is insisting that he must dictate how much he must get, I don't think he is not the only one that can teach the skills I am learning. If I am very interested in acquiring the skills, I would go to another person to gain them.",

First man  if i stole my girlfriend’s money  (which i don’t have    )  and won 100M i will surely split the money with her and apologize to her that i stole the money, it’s big money so enough for both of us to live a luxury life without the need of fighting each other’s because i want to take the whole prizeSecond man even that I’m an apprentice to that boss and won 16M i wouldn’t share a penny with him because it’s my right and he is not involved in it no matter what people said i wouldn’t care, I’m sure no boss will share a big prize with his apprenticesAnd also thank you for sharing these interesting stories",

Second, assuming you were the apprentice in the story, would you abandon your training or would you have given in to the pressure to split the money with your boss?One million sounds like a lot, but in this context we're talking about the Nigerian Naira which has an exchange rate of 436 to 1 US dollar according to Google. Still some sizable sums involved and no doubt these amounts would go much further in Nigeria, but in the global context in a place like Europe 16 million is about 37,000 euros - maybe 1.5x the average salary. Large but not necessarily life changing amounts and it sounds like in the first story the girlfriend found out her man is not really decent after all, I guess she is one of the lucky few who at least got her money back in such a situation as most would have lost it all. Unless we're talking about half a million Euros (or equivalent sum in local currency) then you might be better off keeping your profession and just buying a nice house to use.",

If I in that position, I would to leave.
