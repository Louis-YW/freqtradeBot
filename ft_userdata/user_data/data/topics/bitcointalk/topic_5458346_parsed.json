Kind of odd how they promote these competitions so much then when someone wins something they don't even get anything and no one is willing to help them...EDIT:Casino: BC.game Contest: Cash-X Game was playing: Forever 7's by Red Tiger when message appeared which don't make sense because Cash-X is supposedly only No Limit Games but I had been playing No Limit games before Disturbed, Tombstone, Whacked and I think Serial. Proofs: The only proofs I have is the screenshot I took of the message it saying I won prize. I never got any email or any further info. https://imgur.com/a/7B8U8MsSorry for the lack of info previously hope this clears up everything. Thank youiUPDATE: BC support member staff Eila has told me to contact Event Host Support but I do not know who this is or how to contact them.",

      "body": "Do you have proofs? 'coz if your intention is to catch the attention of the ones who organized and started this event, it would be helpful. However, ofcourse it would be better to first try contacting the providers of the contest. And as you have mentioned, you already did. Try a couple of times and if they won't be responsive then they would be subject for scam label. Unfortunately, I am not familiar with this contest. One thing is for sure, if they won't be sending rewards to eligible participants, then that is already an answer. But be sure as well to get things straight specially with the rules and instructions 'coz you might as well have a mistake.",

That way forum members can properly judge the case if we're to just rely on your words we might end up being bias.",

There is usually some process involved, which can vary depending on the specific contest and platform. Typically, after winning a contest, you may need to follow certain steps to claim your prize. Have you checked the contest rules or terms and conditions? Sometimes, the information regarding prize distribution or claiming process can be found there. By the way, which particular contest are you referring to?",

That is part of the reason why I avoid them as much as possible third party games I prefer the in-house games from the casino because if you have any issue with the in-house games you can easily get answers and possible resolutions unlike the third-party games that you are left in the dark to figure out what the reason for the bans are but if it casino games most especially those casinos that have a good reputation. They will always give information and explanations as to why you get banned or even the crime or offences and it is possibly a solution if the offence is not up to the one to ban your account. So is a big difference between in-house games and third-party games providers.",

Might as well direct this one to their thread if you want answers quickly. Yes, you don't have to do anything when you win a contest prize, either airdropped or a tip will be their method of sending the prize but try to check the terms and conditions too if you are eligible for their contest.Some event participants should only be VIPs and some with a minimum rank requirement and they don't allow the lower ones. Wagering amounts are sometimes a requirement too. So if you could only provide more information then perhaps it will be answered better either here or in the thread of whatever casino you played it.
