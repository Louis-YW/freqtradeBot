  "content": "Hi Everyone,My name is Richard and I am founder of 4K.com (We turning physical items - collectibles - into NFTs/tokens)I am here to ask the community and get feedback on what to do with this Casacius Coin when it comes back to Earth?Packaged and ready to go! https://imgur.com/91UjX362012 Brass Unpeeled 1 Bitcoin - Authenticated by Elias Ahonen (https://www.cryptonumist.com/encyclopedia/)This particular coin has a lot of history as well. Originally owned by the founder of Defcon. More info here: https://vault.4k.com/collectible/ethereum/0xEBf19415d94be89A1d692F82af391685dC1Bff79/68----I have the opportunity to send a personal item on top of a Falcon9 rocket into Space and have it retrieved. So I thought it would be awesome to launch a Physical Bitcoin up there!\"First Bitcoin in Space\" We will receive a certificate from SpaceX stating that this has been into space and back. We are most likely going to NFT it.My current idea is to donate it (along with NFT) to a museum like the Smithsonian Institute. Is there somewhere else where it could be better displayed for people to visit/view?Open to feedback and other ideas",

It will be vacuum sealed.And the coin will come with the SpaceX certificate. We do not plan on selling it, want to use it as a case to promote Bitcoin. Afterall, this coin has the chance to blow up (hopefully it doesn't!)",

This coin's value must have already surpassed all of its Bitcoin content, premium, physical value, collector's value, etc. added together. Its value should be very high now. A rich collector might be willing to buy it with its price multiplied several folds. But with its historical value, I agree with you that this coin should be displayed somewhere public where everyone has the opportunity to have a look. The Smithsonian Institute must be a good place for it, but how I wish it could also be brought into exhibits all over the world so that other curious supporters will also have the opportunity to see it.",

That's great help by your friend like giving up his spot for you that also for free but my concern is are they given chance to carry these physical items only or they are taking them in person to the international space station?

I'm still wondering how to let most of the world enjoy exhibits too -- I'm more well-travelled and more opportunitied (I know it's not a word) than most and still haven't been able to see Smithsonian (likely will never).I also never really got this fascination with sending BTC to space. It's out of reach for me and most people, so how do we relate? I sort of get the true why (marketing), but why hasn't anyone sent anything down to the Mariana Trench (random other thing out of reach)? Or tried to teleport it? As you can see, I could come up with a thousand different \"near-impossible\" things to do with a representation of Bitcoin without actually really using it If I get a SpaceX friend and ask him to shoot a pink ribbon with a blue spot to the moon, will it really help increase awareness of breast cancer in men? Or will it just make my pink ribbon with blue spot stockholders richer? (Maybe I'm asking seriously).",

However, I would say that selling it and donating the money to a charity would be a lot better.You know how much it should worth and wouldn't sell it for a cheap amount, if you give it directly to a charity then they will most surely sell it for cheaper than what it should be, even with an auction. So sell it, get a good amount of money for it, and then use that money to help someone, must be some crypto charities out there somewhere, give it to them.",
