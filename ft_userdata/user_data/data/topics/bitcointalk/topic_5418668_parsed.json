      "body": "A good place to start might be to learn a lot of stuff yourself for if he has questions you can't answer (and they're not too hard) he might just get annoyed by the process.How does he learn best? Actively doing:If he learns by doing then send some funds to each other over a period of time, get him to sign messages and encrypt them (electrum has encryption with public keys and private keys).Actively learning:Introduce him to encryption or teach him about it. This doesn't have to be done directly, finding cryptogram puzzles (caeser cipher) or mathematic ones can be a good place to start (applying functions to change numbers into something - maybe a code for letters that spells out a word based on their position in the alphabet).I'd advise starting with programming too though at some point, don't teach stuff that's too advanced, a lot of the time if you learn a skill when you're young you have to wait to fully realise its potential.You could also just mention it to him every so often or find some interesting news to start a conversation at some point (that might be the best way to introduce it more slowly, make his learning more organic and give him additional skills - most people can find it themselves if they want to and have the means like a laptop/smartphone it might just take a while - the person who first mentioned it to me waited 2 years before I started looking into it more and actually engaging with the crypto community).",

Teach him how to use a software wallet like Electrum and then send some money to an address, write the private key on a piece of paper and tell him that if he manages to add it to his wallet he'll have the money. Find a place that accepts bitcoin, take him there and show him how to pay. Keep sending him money for sweets and stuff and he'll continue to transact.If there's no such place, take him to an ATM and show him how to withdraw the money you gave him.",

Depending on how smart a child is at that age, then it is okay to put these steps into process. Most of us at that age knew little about computers let alone cryptocurrency. It is good to see how the development of bitcoin has enabled future gen z with opportunities many of us still dream about as it concerns earning online, without having to do a white collar job. A child at 10years of age can be allowed to learn from observation from the parents who trade or do some other legit business online that requires crypto exchange. With observation, kids learn faster.  Getting the kid to do simple task that involves computer, bank ATM withdrawal and funding of accounts, prepares them for the  daunting task of crypto exchange.",

You need to ask your kid if he has the interest to learn about crypto and blockchain technology first. Because if that kid wants it, it was easier for you to inject the necessary things he/she needs to learn. Though your kid is smart but must be fed up gradually so it will totally be absurd on his/her mind. As the kid once ask you about it, that was the perfect time to teach what you have learned and explain everything. He/She will probably dig deeper and do searches alone because of his interest and desires, not because you pushed to do it.",

Dont pressure him about blockchain if his not that interested yet. You know his just 10yr, and thats too young to be expose on something like this. Yes blockchain is good but at his age the knowledge on blockhain negative side could be remembered like scam activity and hacking which we dont want our child to push through when they knew it.",

You are not just introducing him to bitcoin and crypto, and the learning process ends there. He has to learn about cybersecurity, online safety, how to recognize and avoid hacks, scams, social engineering techniques, how to keep his coins safe. Kids learn that if they make a mistake, mummy and daddy are there to correct it. That doesn't apply to Bitcoin. If you make a mistake, your money could be gone forever. Kids are innocent in their way of thinking and seeing the world. They are full of love and trust. I don't think your kid's brain is evolved to a stage where he can understand the various ways someone could attempt to take advantage of him. And he simply doesn't have the life experience to guide him in the right direction.     Educational videos about Bitcoin are a good start. You can watch them together and based on his reactions, you will be able to understand if that is something he likes and feels attracted to. Or if he doesn't care or can't focus on the content.Quote from: darkangel11 on October 28, 2022, 09:23:53 PMMaybe tell his parents to buy him a hardware wallet...

If your child already has an interest in computers, there is a high chance that sooner or later he will pick an interest in bitcoins and blockchain. Your major job as a parent is not to rush the child into what you think will be the future but to guide them carefully after you've watched them pick their interest, that is good parenting. Don't be too much in a hurry to force your child to learn about Blockchain to the detriment of the years where you are supposed to help them develop their interests. An introduction to blockchain for them in the most friendly manner can be thoughtful but do not in any way put them under any form of pressure.",

But it might be improper to preoccupy a child with the complexities and dynamics of blockchain technology. At this time a child should be playing around with friends and doing some other activities that he enjoys. I am sure computer studies is part of every primary school, let the child keep learning from the the the school's scheme of work until he gets to 15years when he might become mature to understand complicated computer packages.",
