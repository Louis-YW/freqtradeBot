      "body": "There are no college courses devoted towards acquiring assets and building wealth. Which is a major focus for most hungry and ambitious youth. Most would benefit financially from abandoning higher education asap to pursue being licensed as a real estate broker. That appears to be the most popular entry level path for aspiring millionaires/billionaires who lack an engineering, vocational or science background. Of course there are always exceptions where some might need to complete their university branch study as an important and necessary life goal. Although it could a rarity in this day and age given how most high paying jobs have swung back towards skilled labor in tech and other industries. There isn't much point to university unless its to pursue a skilled labor degree.Most would do better building a social media, onlyfans or youtube presence than they would pursuing a liberal arts major in college. There aren't many courses which cover this process. There is a question of how cost effective university courses can be considering there may not be much if any increase in salary that comes from most curriculum courses.",

If it will cost roughly the same amount of money for the both of them to go with what they like and both choices are prospective, who would you advice to reconsider, and who would you encourage to continue? Everybody would not have a Post Graduate Degree and not everybody would be an artisan or entrepreneur. Choosing a career is based on individual passion and interest. Each field of profession have their entry or employment requirements. It is important to identify the skills and qualification required for the career you want to pursue and get them. Like for those that have passion to lecture in the university, it is advisable for them to pursue a Masters Degree and even a PhD. But others that are interested in maybe blockchain technology might not need any form of certification because the only requirement might just be to acquire the skills. QuoteIf it will cost roughly the same amount of money for the both of them to go with what they like and both choices are prospective, who would you advice to reconsider, and who would you encourage to continue? As long as they have interest and passion for the path they have chosen, I would advice them to continue pursuing their goals. The truth is that the focus shouldn't be about how much one can earn from a job, but how much fulfillment and impact one can get or make from that particular profession. Every skill or profession is important, therefore no one should discourage anybody from pursuing a particular career because we feel that it is not high paying or important.",

Considering today is a different era where people prefer to start a self-business or work as freelancers, academic degrees are starting to be less important for private companies especially if you have a good portfolio especially technology based. That is, the embedded capabilities are more future prospects.",

This will help me when in school, I can also render services to people around or even my fellow students in the area that needs service in my skill field.These days in my area,parents are sending their children to school,after school when they are back, they send the children to the place where they have already registered them to learn a skill.

The world is just revolving round about the same axis because we have failed to set the right priority, a graduate will spend four to five years in the university without having a practical application of these acquired knowledge, we need to have skills to learn along with our academic qualifications in other to make a balance of it all, it has been found that graduates couldn't exercise the theoretical aspect of what they have learnt in school in real life, both having a blend of both educational qualification and skills acquisition is the best and will make available more open opportunities for graduates.",

This will be a minimum necessary to get a more or less good job. And only after receiving a real life experience from using skill that I've got from school and college (because what we study there is just information from books and other sources, while real life experience is much different), I would consider getting MBA or higher education. I consider having period of real life working experience is a must, because it helps to understand what person wants in future, what is demanded, which skills are necessary and which are not.",

But for people looking to gain status they go further in there education persuit. They are also people who are determined to be the best in there field or are determined to study a specialized course which might either be lacking in there community and the specialized the course the higher the pay and the higher the position in a place of work.Even if skilled people finally establish a work they still need people with knowledge to do some certain works. Clear example is contract works are given to notable Engineers (this are people with higher degrees) while Artesian's do the work.So my advice everyone should prioritize his own ambition but having both isn't bad",

I would say that degree is important here because most job here requires a degree from a school, that is why I am having difficulty applying for a job in my own country, now let's go for skills, it is known here that in other countries mostly first world they don't care about your school background or you have a degree (but still its a plus to them if you have it) as long as you possess the skills that they need to improve their company. Let's take an example, let's say a programmer job, you have a degree on it and still stay on old languages (I will not mention what language this is), then couldn't hire you because you don't possess the new language or skills that can compete in today's technology; otherwise, if you have skills on it, you will be getting hired even if you haven't had a degree. Overall I will still say still it depends on the situation and place; if you want to get into government, then go for a degree but if you want to proceed to other stacks like NGOs or private sectors or other companies, then go for skill but still takes a lot of time on you and patience.",

They say in order to be masters of a thing you need to spend 10 thousand hours on it, if we spend 5 hours per day (give or take there will be some days missing) on something that means 2000 days which is about over 5 years to be master, and I mean literally be a master at it. That means if you spend about 6-7 years, you will become a master in that field.If you graduate at 22, and start learning something at 23, you will be a master at it when you are 30, and you can learn another thing and be a master at 37, and another right after makes it 44 and another at 50. So by the time you are 50 years old, you are not just \"I know how to do it\" but literally \"I am an expert at it and very few people are better than me\" on 4 things + whatever you learned in college. That will make you rich for sure, not many people are masters at that many things.",
