  "content": "With the introduction of ordinals to the Bitcoin protocol fees have skyrocketed.  They have been as high as $190 US and currently are averaging $7 per transaction.  For the last few years fees have hovered around $1 US.  The current fees are a 700% increase.My question is who do these high fees benefit?In a Bitcoin transaction you have the sender and receiver of Bitcoin. The sender is the party paying the fee and they are definitely not benefiting from the fee.  The receiver does not pay the fee nor do they receive the fee so they do not benefit either.Most Bitcoin transactions also include a third party like an exchange or the organizations that hosts third party nodes if they are not self hosted. These third parties do not benefit from higher fees either.The final participant in a transaction is the Bitcoin miner.  Bitcoin transaction fees are paid out to miners with the block rewards.  When the fees go up miners make more money so it is clear that miners benefit.This month the miners rewards were cut in half due to the halving. At the same time fees skyrocketed due to increased volume as a result of the introduction of Runes.  I think you would have to conclude that ordinals which include Inscriptions and Runes were introduced to increase the transaction fees to offset the loss in revenue to the miners because of the halving that just occurred. It was no accident that Runes were  launched on the day of the halving.There are a couple of key points to consider: First, If miners can change Bitcoin to increase the fees is Bitcoin really decentralized? Second, and most importantly, do these increased fees help bitcoin to be a better form of digital cash?",

The fee rate now is around 23 sat/vbyte. Having 1 input and 2 outputs in your transaction will cost you not up to $2. Just like before the halving that occurred recently.Runes is gone for now.

Second, and most importantly, do these increased fees help bitcoin to be a better form of digital cash?There is no denying the fact that biggest benefactors of this high fees are the miners and that’s why I say they definitely like what’s happen to the network when it is congested. But that doesn’t mean that they set the fees. It is the users that set the fee they want to pay for their transactions. When the mempool is congested those That want their transactions to get confirmed faster increases or set a very high fee and that’s how it goes. Reason been That miners prioritizes higher fees when picking transactions from their mempools. Another weird benefit of high transaction is that it promotes more miners to come into the network and thereby increasing network decentralization and also reducing chances of problems like 51% attacks",

In my opinion mining pools benefit the most during periods of high fees this is because it takes quite a lot of hash power to add transactions to the next block and in comparison, only a few solo miners are able to generate such hash power.Sometimes higher fees can occur with significant increase in price. The truth is a typical Bitcoiner who is not a miner isn't happy about high fees as it can make transactions become extremely uneconomical like the congestion that occured in the last halving block.QuoteIn a Bitcoin transaction you have the sender and receiver of Bitcoin. The sender is the party paying the fee and they are definitely not benefiting from the fee.  The receiver does not pay the fee nor do they receive the fee so they do not benefit either.As for this a receiver can also pay fees as a way of spending the coins that haven't be confirmed using a larger fee so that the parent transaction (the initial one) gets confirmed faster since the parent  has to be confirmed first before the child this is known as  CPFP (child pay for parent)",

First of all, understand that there is no way to tell of a truth, or be sure that ordinals, runes and so on, were introduced by miners to increase bitcoin fees, there is no way to be sure about this. But then, even if they did, bitcoin is still decentralized because those project being launched on the bitcoin blockchain are actually independent on their own, this means that, the miners sure have to promote the project to a lot of investors, who carry out alot of transaction on the bitcoin network, to result in a clog of the mempool which brings about the high fees. It is just same as in 2019/2020 when cryptokitties shut down the ethereum blockchain due to a lot of people participating in the game, if miners launch a project on the bitcoin network with intent to increase fees, if no body give attention to such project, fees won't increase, it's as simple as that. Quote Second, and most importantly, do these increased fees help bitcoin to be a better form of digital cash?Yes of course, the high fees means, mining is profitable for miners, and this encourages them to stay, and others to join, the more miners on the bitcoin network, the more decentralized the network becomes, and this also makes bitcoin a good digital cash to completely trust.",

It's enough of an excuse for them to hold on instead of risking paying that high fee. No matter how we look at it, I don't see any advantage to the high fee for any Bitcoinner; it's just the miners revenue increasing.",

Second, and most importantly, do these increased fees help bitcoin to be a better form of digital cash?You are right, miners and third parties like centralized exchanges are the ones making profit from the fee that a sender pays. As different centralized exchanges have different rates according to there structure. They all are making different profits from the extra fee that sender pays. Well, at the end all the fee goes into the hands of miners. I was reading a thread on another forum where they says, miner made more than 40+ BTC in a block I think it was the halving block. And they made 40+ BTC in fee only. I mean the blockreward at that time was still 6.25 I suppose, and miners made 40+ BTC that gives me different thoughts like I thought miner might leave this passion as there will be less profit but nah with an increment in the fee more miners will join. And speaking of runes, I still think its on purpose and many things will be in front of our eyes soon on purpose just to increase the price of fee.",

And these tokens on Bitcoin blockchain are possible because of the features that always existed in the protocol - it's an oversight, not an intentional change. It would take us a fork to kill these tokens, but the devs are very conservative and try avoiding changes as much as possible.Higher fees mean more profits for miners and as the result more competition and more hashpower in the network - so in the end more security. But these tokens didn't raise the fees for long term, it's just a mania like with tulip bulbs, when it's over they have no effect on fees.",
