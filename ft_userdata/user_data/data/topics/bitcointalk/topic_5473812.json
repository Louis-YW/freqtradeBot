  "content": "This might not be directly related with Bitcoin, but it should absolutely concern the community. So, Europeans in this board must have already been familiar with the on-going process of the EU enforcing the adoption of European electronic identities (eID)[1]. While the modernization of our identities isn't evil per se, it appears to be the case. Recently, there have been new legislative articles in closed-door meetings that virtually threaten the Internet's security by granting EU state members the permission to approve and disapprove which organizations can issue cryptographic certificates (like the one you and I use to read and write this privately right now). In other words, it gives them authority to surveil on their citizens. Movement began from cybersecurity experts[2] which describes in even more detail what's going on. Read it. This is truly important to protest. A variety of scientists all over the EU have begun writing this open letter which opposes the position of EU parliament[3].

This is the parliament's proposal amending regulation as regards to establishing a framework for the European digital identity: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:5d88943a-c458-11eb-a925-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF.QuoteIn order to ensure that users can identify who is behind a website, Article 45 is amended to require providers of web browsers to facilitate the use of qualified certificates for website authentication.Providers of web browsers (like Mozilla) will be mandated to facilitate the use of public key certificates with governmental-issued qualifications. Here's another:Quote To that end, web-browsers should ensure support and interoperability with Qualified certificates for website authentication pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. They should recognise and display Qualified certificates for website authentication to provide a high level of assurance, allowing website owners to assert their identity as owners of a website and users to identify the website owners with a high degree of certainty. Sounds like the users must be able to identify website owners, otherwise website owners will not get approved for a certificate. This is a bureaucratic nightmare.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on November 12, 2023, 02:37:07 PMWouldn't it be better to have used the title that Europe wants to impose digital identities?That isn't what I want to emphasize. Digital identities are where we're heading towards, everybody knows that already. But, this law is insane and it appears to be the case that they're voting for it in secret.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on November 12, 2023, 02:37:07 PMYou put ETEE in the title but then you don't explain what it means. It means end-to-end encryption.",

They've already established a common regulatory ground where they allow themselves to safely regulate cryptocurrencies and projects at the same time, while allowing the industry to flourish within the region. To ban end-to-end encryption even for cryptocurrency is a clear violation of this agreement and will become one of the biggest players in the state of crypto within the European Region. Pretty sure they're just banning ETEE to some degree so as to not cause hackers and other falsifiers to use it for their personal gain, which is a good thing.

This is one of the most well-known fallacies in security. \"Security through obscurity\" principle -- AKA \"closed-source software being more secure than open-source\" -- is entirely debunked. As I have already said before, believing that this provides security, besides false, is a sign of utter arrogance. Believing that you'll obscure the source in such a way that it will be impossible for third parties to discover your obscurity is just plain dumb; and once they do, your system will be vulnerable. Most exploits aren't found by using the source code in the first place. Quoting my past self:Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on September 26, 2022, 07:30:14 PMClosed-source software is nowhere close to better than reputable open-source software in terms of security. Being open-source doesn't mean more vulnerable than closed-source. Most attacks, from dynamic which work as a black-box (push inputs, observe outputs) to static which use pattern matches against binaries require no source code. Even if source code is necessary for an attacker, they can use disassemblers to reverse engineer part of the source code they want.Now please don't derail this, or I'll have to use the Delete.",

In the words of Klauss Schwab \"you'll own nothing and be happy.\"The aim has long ago been to create one big happy centralized country in Europe where you don't get to travel, unless you pay tax for your carbon footprint and carbon tax is added to every carbon producing activity. You own a pet - tax. You collect rainwater - rainwater tax. You drive a car - emission tax. You live in a house that isn't up to their standards - tax. You travel too much - tax. You cut a tree in your yard - tax, and don't forget to ask for permission, otherwise it's a fine.They started with their new crypto guidelines last year and told everyone that these are good because they're pioneers in regulating cryptocurrencies. You'll see how that goes in a few years. And for those who didn't know, all EU laws are above the local laws of member countries, unless you're German because they outvoted it and are now the only country in the EU where it's the other way round. Please sir, you sound like a deluded conspiracy theorist! Don't tell me you don't like cameras watching you everywhere you go and video feed inscribed directly into the BSV blockchain! Some people around here don't like hearing the cold, harsh truth... So I guess you don't believe there's a conspiracy at all. It just doesn't exist. There's no need to extradite Snowden and these guys at WEF talk about sharing their wealth with everyone, unicorns and rainbows.If you want to contradict me, please prove that I'm wrong. I haven't noticed any questions or contradictions in your post that I could address.",

This is basically the whole EU in a nutshell. You're not going to be allowed to do anything, unless we approve it, but we'll go about it slow.

Read it again, from top to bottom:Quote from: cryptosize on November 12, 2023, 11:38:13 PMI remember telling people since 2020 that EU's Digital ID initiative is going to have some serious repercussions in the society, but few people believed me back then... they were too focused on the COVID plandemic. Average Joe/Current Thing NPC: \"Hey, this is good for my convenience, no more paperwork! hurr durr\"Skepticist: \"Sounds too good to be true... where's the catch?\"And you haven't even seen what's coming next with CBDC (social credit score, carbon credits), which will be tied to eID...People are going to rationalize everything to feel \"comfortable\" (psychological coping mechanism) -> \"What's the big deal with social credit score? Ebay already has had ratings for many, many years! Are you a criminal or what? What are you afraid of?\"\"What's wrong with carbon credits? Are you a climate change denier? Why not eat ze bugs and save the planet by reducing your carbon footprint to zero?\" Oh well... if people want a China-style sci-fi Panopticon dystopia, who am I to argue with them?",
