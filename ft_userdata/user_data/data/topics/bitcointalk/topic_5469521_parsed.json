Change is a constant thing in life and thats what no one can fight although am not sure of whether bitcoin can take over the world but if eventually it does then I think the impact of positivity will be more than disadvantages.",

In fact, the employment problem is a classic reason that is brought to describe the causes of unemployment. For me, another cause of unemployment is because human resources are not diligent enough to utilize the existing potential as a source of income.When the world is dominated by everything digital, on the positive side it will make things easier.Bitcoin is part of a currency that can be useful, not a big problem.",

That's why it's important to have measures that will ensure that people who are suddenly suffering from the change receive support to adapt to the new normal. But let's see the specific points the op raised.1. Banks won't necessarily be miserable, they'd just have to rebrand and provide services of crypto holding. Some people will always choose centralized services because they don't want the responsibility of securing their own funds, making sure they can restore access if they lose it, etc.2. Some people would probably lose jobs, but that's where unemployment benefits come in, and perhaps special programs to retrain people who were employed in the industries that are no longer relevant would be required.3. Actually, there doesn't seem to be a correlation between the strength of the economy and attitude toward Bitcoin. Some strong economies embrace Bitcoin, some weak economies are against it, but the opposite is also true.4. Those who don't trust the banks would be delighted to know that they can hold their own cryptos in non-custodial wallets, and they don't have to trust anyone but themselves this way.",

Still there's a number of people that are confused about the system of Bitcoin, so employment rate would be affected as well the economy of a country. While for the banks I think they could still manage when Bitcoin started to get mass adopted, cause here in my country PH, There's already banks that are open and acknowledging crypto which gave them a high rates and good feedback.

Because they can't open a bank account due to lack of papers as banks ask a lot of information before you can open a account on them.

But in my opinion, you look at crypto, especially bitcoin, only from an opinion point of view that is seen from a negative point of view and not from a positive point of view. So although I can't deny that this could happen. However, I personally see crypto (bitcoin) in a more positive direction. Because in my personal opinion Bitcoin has a very good financial system and will also be far from cheating from any party, because Bitcoin has a decentralized system. Because as we know, if you look at the negative side of the current banking system, there are lots of frauds that often occur. For example, a manipulation system or an interest system that burdens customers. So even though currently the banking system has become commonplace for everyone. However, without these people realizing it, they have been cheated by the banking system.Therefore, be it a banking system or a system that runs on crypto (bitcoin). Both have their own positive and negative sides. So if you think that if crypto (bitcoin) goes global and the results will be very bad, I personally think that opinion is very wrong. Moreover, as you have explained in your post, you still don't understand crypto or bitcoin, so to conclude this opinion, in my opinion this opinion is very inaccurate.Quote from: Alana Arden on October 07, 2023, 09:57:03 AM~SnipAnd based on the reasons you explain, this might happen if cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) quickly takes over the world's financial system. Because people will definitely be shocked and shocked by this. However, if bitcoin spreads slowly as is happening now, I am sure that society will be able to adapt to cryptocurrency (bitcoin) very well.",

If Bitcoin will one day dominate the world, there'll be disruptions which might be interpreted as sheer havoc wreaked by Bitcoin, especially by its critics. The truth is that these will be minor ones as compared to the continuous damage caused by fiat. And these are necessary, too. But we surely won't be crying a river when the money printer operator would finally lose his/her job. Quote from: Alana Arden on October 07, 2023, 09:57:03 AM1. When virtual currency or crypto-currency reigns all over the world, the banking system will be miserable, and a group of people (who do not know about crypto-currency or bitcoin) will be unemployed all over the world, who till now were working at the convenience of various banks.I think the banks won't go. Their roles may significantly change, though. Custodians will never be completely erased from the face of the earth. Plus there are also banking services that Bitcoin might not be able to replace. But, again, that the staff of banks will have to move jobs because of Bitcoin is never a heavy toll as compared to sticking with the status quo in which the people's currency is devalued nonstop. Quote2: Unemployed people (due to a lack of knowledge of currency requirements or benefits) will not be able to handle this shock in the first place, due to which they will face various financial, lateral, physical, and mental problems, which is a big challenge for them. Don't liken Bitcoin adoption to a bomb dropped from the sky. Why would people be surprised when the growth of Bitcoin is gradual? Right now, we're heading that way already. This has been going on since Bitcoin came into existence. It has been 14 years already. So, why would they be shocked when Bitcoin reaches a certain level of success? Bitcoin is a movement.    Quote3: Many developing or underdeveloped countries (especially those with low leverage) will consider cryptocurrency a curse rather than a blessing due to their lack of proper understanding of its importance.Lack of understanding is easy to address. They only have to spare some time learning about it. Governments must have already heard about Bitcoin. They can easily invite experts to provide them better enlightenment. What's hard to address is stubbornly sticking to the fiat standard despite fully knowing how damaging and poor of a monetary system it is. The only way governments are closed-minded is when their leaders are benefiting so much from a rotten currency. Quote4: I have seen among my acquaintances who still cannot fully trust the bank (banking is some kind of rigging or fraud) and therefore leave their valuable assets (gold or money) on their own instead of depositing them in the bank. For those who do not believe in banks, how exactly will they accept this currency system?Gold and cash may be good but hard to keep. Moreover, they can easily be seized or stolen. They can also be damaged in many ways. They can't easily be moved anywhere, especially across international borders. They can easily be confiscated as well. As to cash, it might be replaced with a digital version sooner or later. As to gold, it can't be used as a currency. In which case, Bitcoin is much much better.",
