  "content": "The increase in the rate of natural disasters such as earthquakes, flooding, wildfires, etc. has got me thinking of how safe my seed phrase is when I store it physically. The recent wildfire in the US nearly destroyed the entire town of Lahaina, Hawaii. The recent earthquake in Morocco almost wiped out the entire region of Marrakesh. In Libya, the flooding devastated the entire city of Derna. I have learned in this forum that it is not safe to keep or save your seed phrase online, on the phone, or on the computer. We are also advised not to keep them with third parties because they can be stolen or accessed by anybody. Rather it is better to write them down and keep them in different safe locations. Another option is to write it on fireproof and waterproof material like steel and keep it safe. My problem is that these natural disasters happen without warning signs. Recently we just woke up to see that our entire neighborhood has been flooded because of the collapse of a dam in the neighboring country. The earthquake in Turkey, Syria, and Morocco,  and the flood in Libya were impromptu and everyone was only concerned about saving lives and nobody cared about personal belongings like seed phrases. The destruction caused by these disasters is so widespread that it could destroy all the safe places where you safely kept your seed phrase. Recovering these seed phrases saved on disaster-proof materials after a natural disaster is somehow difficult because recovering them with machines like escalators and other earth-moving machines will be close to impossible. In the case of flooding, these materials would have been washed away into rivers or sea.  I know that the security of our wallet is very important that is why it should be personal. I have heard of saving encrypted seed phrases in the cloud or online personal files. I know this is also risky but is there any means of saving my seed phrase safe from these natural disasters? That could atleast give a Bitcoiner access to a wallet after the loss of seed phrases during or after natural disasters.",

To recover an encrypted file, you need to have some sort of PGP private key. How are you going to back this up? You won't do it digitally, as it's a bad practice, and you will neither do it on paper, as that would be the equivalent of writing down a seed phrase in paper but with extra steps. And that's if we ignore the intermediary and the fact that if he disappears, you can't do anything.If you're living in a country that currently experiences climate disasters, like fires and flooding, then I think your best course is to use metal and back it up on multiple places.",

That could atleast give a Bitcoiner access to a wallet after the loss of seed phrases during or after natural disasters. Nothing that can be done rather than a saving it up at a different geographical location, when earthquakes or all this natural disasters happen even if a washer or any damage proof happens definitely they will be lost with them due to damage. So when storing large amounts of bitcoin look for three or more place at different cities if possible to store them. One thing again is to be careful of redundancy because ones it gets too much the seeds becomes vulnerable to been discovered. To reduce the risk again is to add passphrase which is probably known to only you such that when someone gets access to the seed phrases, without the passphrase they cannot have access to the funds on the wallet.

However, they balance security and redundancy.I like this multi sig idea but my concern is it will not be easily implemented for wallets that are used to store regular used coins. Anytime one needs to make use of the funds you need to reach out to Atleast one of these storage places. Regular asking about it makes it obvious. So I still go with the idea but store only funds in which you would be holding for a very long time there and then have an extra wallet for small holdings. This way you reach out to this locations on rare occasions. Another thing is make sure the locations of those other seed phrases or keys should be at regions that are not prone to any of disasters. In setting up the multi sig wallet you can follow the backup tips by Charles-Tim as they seem perfect to cases like this Quote from: Charles-Tim on August 31, 2023, 10:55:51 PMIf you want to increase the security of your wallet, you can go for multisig. Although, it is very useful for multiple users purposes. For individual, we have suggested 2-of-3 multisig wallet several times on this forum with the appropriate backups like this:Seed 1, MPK 2Seed 2, MPK 3Seed 3, MPK 1Backups in different locations. If you lose one of the backups, you can still use the other two to recover your wallet.",

In Libya, the flooding devastated the entire city of Derna. When we look into the recent occurence of the natural pandemic we are having this days, storing our private keys could just be a little way needed more careful attention when we are saving them using a physical approach on materials to hide them where others cannot see, nature disaster will only render us no access to these keys from where we kept them if such should occur because we may not know when it could happen or how, neither are we aware of which one may occur in where we lived, the best thing to do is to always have a two different means of keeping the backup to our seeds.Quote from: Fiatless on September 13, 2023, 07:22:31 AMI have learned in this forum that it is not safe to keep or save your seed phrase online, on the phone, or on the computer.

Another option is to write it on fireproof and waterproof material like steel and keep it safe. If we are to broaden the means to how we can recover our seeds incase of any of these natural disasters, using mettalic sheath material like washers could have a long durability and can be indestructible, which means fire, water or wind can not destroy or displace this means, but am not sure of earthquake because these involved a massive opening of the land mass and the depth of the rubbles could be unpredicted by the scenario, yet having another alternative means to secure them is a good ideas.",

Approximately 2 out of 4 would be ideal, and you can do the following:Encrypt one of these private keys and place it in a secure cloud account, so that even if it is hacked, the hackers still need a second key.Store the second seeds in metal and keep them in a safe place in your home.Encrypt the third in the form of a hardware wallet and keep it in a secured bank vault somewhere else relatively far from your location.Encrypt the last key and keep it in another state or another country.add more keys as needed, but keep all scenarios in mind and then start developing solutions using multi-signature wallets based on that.",

Of course, it also depends on where you live and whether it's an area that's prone to natural disasters, but aside from natural disasters, there are also political instabilities that can have the same effect. For instance, I live in Ukraine, and while we don't have tsunamis or big earthquakes here, we frequently have fires and destruction of property due to missile and drone attacks by Russia, so the concerns about seed phrases are relevant as well, just as in case of natural disasters.I'll admit that despite knowing that yeah, storing a seed phrase digitally is unsafe, that's what I do because I personally feel that the risk of getting hacked is lower for me than the risk of locking myself out of the wallet because of a physical seed phrase copy getting misplaced, lost, or destroyed.",

However, as humans we must protect and take good care of this nature.For the time being, storing the seed phrase by making it in water-resistant and fire-resistant metal at least with the estimated time of arrival of the extinguishing unit is the best in my opinion. Of course, by estimating the storage location in a place that can be taken when the building collapses to the ground and is not carried away by large water currents.If you store it in a place that has internet access, it is very risky.",

Take note that there is no security in obscurity and trying to go overboard to mitigate instances like natural disasters can make you lock yourself out of your funds, without ever being affected by one of those disasters. Just do it the traditional way, write your seed phrase down or engrave it in steel; make multiple backups of it in different locations, and if you are ever affected by a natural disaster, take it as life; if you survive a natural disaster, you may not be so sad that you lost money, but it'll be a sad event if you use unrecommended solutions to mitigate disasters, but lose your funds because of that without ever being affected by one.",

In an environment where everything online is at risk, people generally think that physically storing passwords is safe. But as you said, many disasters can happen and we may lose our passwords.Here are some of the ideas that came to my mind for this. - After writing down our passwords somewhere, we can give them to someone we trust in another city or to someone who is not very familiar with the internet for safekeeping. For example, to an elderly relative. - We can keep our passwords in a small safe.After taking all the precautions, sometimes it is necessary to let things go.",
