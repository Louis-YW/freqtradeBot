So you can't hope any moderators will take care against this case, moreover adding a new features where the user have certain limit to move a topic will not an easy to do. Regarding this thread, he's breaking the rules of post in duplicate board and I have report it to moderator.Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM12. No duplicate posting in multiple boards (except for re-posting topics in the local language boards if they're translated and re-posting marketplace topics in the altcoin boards if altcoins are accepted).However, if you have moved a topic so many times and it's not belong where it does, you will got temporary banned like Nutildah caseQuote from: hilariousandco on November 08, 2021, 09:25:41 AMQuote from: nutildah on November 07, 2021, 10:50:30 PMI will continue moving the thread back where it belongs. If I am banned for that, it confirms I shouldn't be wasting a single nother second of my time here anyway.Look, I'll give you the courtesy and tell you that staff members aren't going to continue playing cat and mouse with you and if you move it back again you'll get the same ban as the op did. You've done this many more times than him now and many other members have been banned in the past for repeatedly moving their threads back where they don't belong. I've given my reasons why the thread doesn't belong there above but something tells me for some reason you're looking for a ban so you can feel a martyr for something. I'd suggest you just move on. This really shouldn't be a big issue.",

People are free to create a thread to respond and I would encourage users do that if people are trying to stifle discussion in a way that suits them.Quote from: examplens on June 14, 2022, 10:14:38 PMthe same user also opened a topic (and lock it immediately) where he offers a cash prize for the personal data of another user. (the administrators seem to have deleted it)Well that would be against the rules and was probably reported and removed for such. People should be allowed to lock their topic and bump it as long as it's within the rules. I've seen genuine users make use of locking a topic and bumping it likely because they don't want to deal with spam comments etc. Of course, scammers and idiots will make use of both locking their topic and deleting any comments they don't like but that's just how it goes. If you feel a user is doing something purely to troll or be abusive then you can try report the thread if you feel it breaks the rules. Users can already abuse the self-mod feature to delete comments they don't like but should we modify that or get rid of it too? I don't think so as users should be allowed to moderate their own topics however they want even if that does mean nefarious users will abuse it. If people are abusing these features, and especially to scam, then either create a thread in Rep or Scam Accs and/or use the feedback system to give warning/leave a note of why you find their behaviour suspicious or untrustworthy.",

      "body": "I like the idea, this should prevent somehow but not sure if this is possible. Because there will be a couple of issues when implementing something to prevent bumps for lock topics. 1. Disable the bump option permanently for the locked topic. This means if a user locks a topic for a one-time bump option will be disabled forever. But still, the user can bump using a new reply. 2. If disable bump the topic even make a new reply for a locked topic then we will have another issue. Locked means this topic shouldn't discuss longer. But maybe sometimes we need to unlock the topic for some reason. So in case of that, we will lose the right to bump the topic. Although the idea is good, I don't think the admin is going to take any action. That's why DT Network exists on the forum to prevent or tag scammers.",

What's that for? It means they're hiding something they don't want anyone else commenting on. It's not even like a self moderated thread where everyone can post in but being censored by OP.
