There is an unlimited resource. All begins in man's mind. If every nation does a scale of preference ranking the needs and wants, prioritizing the necessities and which are not then every people will wrestle because every government or authority will take the power to distribute the needs and resources. Though resources are limited to the planet, ideas aren't.Â  Scarcity is true, but there would be another or new way of thinking to overcome that.Not to get too far to the opt of OP, economic problems just require economic solutions. There is no lack of resource, only lack of ideas.Quote from: hugeblack on April 16, 2023, 12:10:38 PMI do not think that this saying is correct.

I guess what OP is trying to say is that \"human wants are insatiable\". Since resources are limited and scarce we should have a scale of preference is the only way to make sure the resources we have available are enough for us. This is actually true because no matter the amount of money you have, you always have wants, and since resources are scarce we can't have everything we want at every given time, so we have to forego some things in other to get the most important things at the moment.",

There is no lack of resource, only lack of ideas.People are lazy to think and look for ideas when technology is getting up to date. Poverty, economic needs and everything depend on the resources of the mind itself. I totally agree with what you said economic problems require economic solutions. Because basically we always look far away but forget the important aspects around us that can still support needs beyond what is needed. Usually caused by being too ambitious to see the achievements of others and do not see the abilities that can be done alone. The result is when we have found a solution but are still looking for problems, and assume that solution after solution always ends in incompatibility.",

It's not only to satisfy our needs as a human but also experimenting for us to find the most convenient things that might saved us energy and help us such as cars, motors, machine and many more. But despite those improvements, the more we greed for improvements the more resources we eat. This will lead to scarcity, people find that we could circulate the resources as we return what we took. For example, for every tree we cut, the 10 tree plants we plant for the trade. Since it will take years for trees to grow as they help us to give oxygen that's why most country side have a nice fresh air and unpolluted.",

This scarcity is man-made because I think nature gave enough resources to each nation. But greed and materialism have made some people control these resources using the instrument of government or businesses connected to the government. These set of people make laws that will favor them and their cronies to enable them to have more access to financial power. An example is the intentional acts of the government of my nation to frustrate the businesses of other entrepreneurs because they want the business of their financiers to enjoy a monopoly. For one to survive in this world currently, financial planning is a topmost priority, except if you want to live on credit and loans.",

That's why I would say there is a lot of difference when it comes to managing needs and ultimately spending money as a form of planning rather than fulfilling a lifestyle. A simple preference scale is to arrange our needs in order of priority, but everyone's priorities will be different and never the same in terms of arranging needs.If people know the level of priority needed, then that person must have a pattern in managing finances and most people are stuck with an excessive lifestyle that doesn't adjust to abilities, that's why financial chaos is getting more complicated and difficult to control.",

There is the aspect of human wants that I think law has curtail in regards to how people would desire to live their lives and treat other people. Left for human crude nature, some desires and want may be weigh out of board. Some certain cultures may have been sustained if not for abolishment through law. There is also a place of modernity in the scheme of things to the rise in the human wants. During the medieval period where the economic sustainability of the society was majorly built on trade by barter, I think these wants were suppressed not that they didn't exist.",

It's because not everybody is having fortunate things in life and that can be seen that there's a scarcity of resources because even for basic needs and necessities, there goes a lack for those unfortunate people given the situation of their lives. But we don't go stop from there because it's a discussion that will get a lot of good points being the actuality of it and then the meaning of opposing thoughts about it proving that everyone has a valid point. On the early days, there have been explorations and expeditions made by those great travelers through the seas and I agree on HB that soon, we'll go travel and get resources outside the Earth and getting those materials and new discoveries through the other planets.

When our requirements were primitive... so the next wealth may be close or even outside the planet. I also do not agree that your saying is true (no offense) because there are three types of people in the world, they belong to high, middle and lower class. The people of high class face no problems in availability of any needed resources like USA, Saudi Arabia etc. Why? Understand this with an example of electricity. There is 24 hours availability of electricity in both countries but middle class countries face 6 hour outage of electricity while the lower once face 12 hours outage of electricity isn't it a big difference between the availability of a resource \"electricity\"?Yeah there is no doubt in saying that necessity is the mother of invention. As the invention occurred then there comes some people who try to control that resources accordingly. The last that might be true, as I have heard scientist have found a \"Golden Asteroid\" in space which contains $10,000 quadrillion worth of assets in Gold, Nickel and Iron.(source).

I don't think viruses are any type of discoveries instead they are inventions of bio-scientists. One thing i had heard a lot that, the chances of atomic war is zero because the next war is going to be the bio war (war of chemicals). COVID-19 was just an example. I also hope this comes to an end soon. Ameen.",

Humanity produces enough, but the distribution is so wild and ridiculous that millions are still dying from hunger and there are lots of homeless people. As for the wants, I suppose there's never enough to satisfy the total wants in the sense that there are always some people that simply want too much, but there's also this aspect that with many cases, people don't know what they'll want in case something is created. I guess it's a point similar to what hugeblack is saying in the thread.For example, nobody in 1950s wanted to be a TikTok influencer (because there was no Internet, no social media, no market for all this), whereas now it's a thing that many people want. But while our resources are growing, and sometimes new products create new demand (not just the other way around), the wants probably outweigh the resources, but that's just because humanity needs to work on the wants.",
