  "content": "Just theory:21 million Bitcoin and 100 million Satoshi per Bitcoin  was chosen in order to simplify calculations and involve floating-point arithmetic.1. 64-bit IEEE754 double, all integers up to 9007199254740992 == 2^53 can be exactly represented. In the range 2^51 to 2^52, the only non-integer values .5Below 2^51 we also have .25 and .75, so comparing a number with it's rounded counterpart in order to determine if it may be integer or not starts making some sense.If we want to test whether result may be integer, you must avoid numbers larger than 2^51 == 2251799813685248Simple test:Code:for (uint64_t i = pow(2, 52); i >= 0; i--) {        double d = i;        double sat = 100000000;        double d1 = d / sat;        double d2 = d1 * sat;        uint64_t i2 = round(d2);        if (i != i2) {            std::cout << i << std::endl;        }}for (uint64_t i = pow(2, 51); i >= 0; i--) {        double d = i;        double sat = 100000000;        double d1 = d / sat;        double d2 = d1 * sat;        uint64_t i2 = round(d2);        if (i != i2) {            std::cout << i << std::endl;        }}Sure, Satoshi could choose  2200000000000000, but 22 is not triangular number.2. So, for the purpose of optimizing calculations, he had to choose the triangular number closest to 22 from the sequence: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28,...",

      "body": "From what I remember, sorry a bit of faded memories, the first important metric for Satoshi was the block time target of 10min. It was likely a compromise but mainly focussed on security. To my knowledge a smaller block time, particularly in the beginning of the Bitcoin blockchain, would've had less security and stability (don't press me on that, though). The likelyhood of certain attacks rises with significantly shorter block time. Much larger than 10min isn't nice either, not in terms of security but user experience (nobody wants to wait too long for stable and secure confirmation of their transactions).Initial block reward of 50BTC seemed like a sweet spot for Satoshi, large enough to trigger interest (and maybe some greed ) and attract more distinct miners to increase decentralization and security by more proof of work of more individual miners.And then chosing a halving period in the time frame of about 4 years resulted in the metric of 210,000 blocks (a rounder value than 210,384, taking a leap year into account; otherwise 210,240). It could've been that value of initial block reward and halving intervall are intertwined. But, frankly, I don't know or remember past discussions about that and I'm only mildly interested in those.In my perception the most important metrics for Satoshi were stability and security of the blockchain, a reasonable length of the halving period and not reaching max cap too fast or too far in the future.",

The 210,000 blocks and 21 million Bitcoin just resulted from this.What you are talking about is a specific implementation of approximating the logistic function (Wt[t]). To implement it, you first need to conduct mathematical modeling and define the function you will be approximating. The choice of 21 million is not random. Satoshi could have chosen any parameter W. 4 years is just \"approximation step\" of the function (Wt[t])Code:The generalised logistic function or Richards' curve (1959) was developed for growth modelling (extension of logistic). The model has been modified by Sugden (1981) and Satoshi (2008)Wt[t]=W(1-(1-m)Exp[-k(t-T)/(m^(m/(1 - m)))])^(1/(1- m))W=21000000k=0.00265m=0.3909T=165.6https://twitter.com/TheoryBitcoin/status/1232224207838359553",

It was only with the first generations of alts that we found out how low block times can be pushed. Litecoin's 2.5 minutes worked fine while other alts that went to blocktimes of less than a minute tended to suffer from high orphan rates and reorgs. While later alts have been able to successfully go to blocktimes below one minute, they arguably could take lessons from earlier failed attempts.The bigger question IMO would indeed be why satoshi then chose 210,000 blocks per halving period, resulting in the 4 years between each halving as pointed out by LoyceV. My pet theory has always been that satoshi had a hunch that 4 years would be the perfect interval for boom and bust hype cycles, ie. enough time for people to forget about Bitcoin and the pain of having bought at the top, but not so long as to completely drop out of the collective consciousness. But in hindsight it's of course always easy to see deliberate choice in what might have just been serendipity.",

All things considered the halving is one of the easiest concepts to explain to a newcomer.Apart from that a smooth emission curve wouldn't have resulted in the sudden supply shocks that lead to Bitcoin's notorious bubbles which in turn placed it on everyone's radar. Add to that a cycle of predictable, publicly known, future supply shocks and you get yourself a self-fulling prophecy -- not only because one \"knows\" when to expect the next price increase, but also because price increases are expected by most market participants at roughly the same time.Quote from: Carlton Banks on August 20, 2023, 03:05:19 PMWhy was satoshi so obsessed with the number 8?
