      "body": "What he gets right:Blockchain, as an architecture, has had zero non-crypto design wins, and it's a stupid thing to use for the \"enterprise\" or whatever.Blockchain performs a lot of \"reputation washing\" for what is ultimately grift: \"it's perfectly secure because it's blockchain\", you will hear people say all of the time.Blockchain will never scale to anything approaching a mainstream everyday transaction load, and thus will never \"take over\" existing currencies and payment methods.Because of Bitcoin's rise in market value, investors and venture capitalists invest in a lot of stupid things because they say \"blockchain\" on them.All of the non-cryptocurrency applications for blockchain are simply retarded and pointless.What he gets wrong:Blockchain is not a \"scam\" anymore than TCP/IP is a \"scam\". It's an architecture, and it has specific uses. If you tell me that TCP/IP will cure cancer, then yes, that is false and likely a scam. But that doesn't mean that the architecture itself is a scam.He uses the terms for blockchain-based cryptocurrency and Bitcoin specifically interchangeably. In particular, he implies that Bitcoin is used for cyber-extortion even though it hasn't been the choice for criminals and terrorists for a long time since there is chain analysis. Today, the preferred currency for criminals these days is Monero et. al., or they use Bitcoin with a mixer product.He seems to imply that all of these scams and this misinformation is Bitcoin's fault when it's not. Yes, there's a ton of grifters out there doing grifting and saying false things in order to fool people, but this isn't the fault of Bitcoin itself. The NSA employ that invented Bitcoin and called himself Satoshi (my new favorite conspiracy theory ) never meant for any of this to happen, nor could they have reasonably predicted it. Bitcoin was designed to solve a single narrow problem, which it still partially does. But it tapped into something that made people billionaires so the hype went crazy--but that was all an accident.Very generally, he doesn't understand the use case that probably 99% of Bitcoin users use it for, i.e. as a speculation instrument. Yes, a scant few use it for criminality, and there is a lot of hype around it's usage to do a bunch of things it cannot do, but most people use Bitcoin in a very innocuous way i.e. to simply make a profit from an investment in Bitcoin.",

      "body": "I think it’s essential to differentiate between the technology itself and how it’s been utilized or misused in various contexts. To label blockchain as a scam seems overly simplistic. Just like TCP/IP, blockchain is an architectural framework with specific use cases. It has its shortcomings, particularly in terms of scalability and mainstream applicability, but that doesn’t inherently make it fraudulent.Stark's equating of Bitcoin with all blockchain-related issues misses the nuance of its adoption. Many users engage with Bitcoin not for illicit activities but as an investment vehicle, an asset class in its own right. It’s important to acknowledge that while the environment may attract grifters, that doesn’t reflect the intentions behind Bitcoin's design or the legitimate use cases that some individuals have found.",

In his very long paragraph, he repeatedly says that he believes blockchain is glorified for marketing purpose and not because of its actual usefulness and value. I know some people will believe him as his name has been synonymous with cybersecurity but some of what he claims are untrue. I don’t want to fight with people like these. They have made their research and still refuse to accept how valuable blockchain technology can be not only to financial aspects but also to other sectors of the world. Just let blockchain be adopted worldwide and watch people like John Reed Stark eat their own words.",

All I did was post a link.And just because something is distributed doesn't mean it's secure. Lots of and lots of distributed networks have been hacked.Bitcoin is secure because it's central governance is secure: the code base is carefully locked down and the people in charge of releasing the new cores are very careful. After that hurdle, there is the security of the nodes themselves, which depends on both the core software and the administration of the nodes. After that, it's the redundancy built in to the network that will mitigate a partial failure of the second factor here. Net-net, Bitcoin itself is very very secure, but that has nothing to do with the blockchain architecture per se.",

Blockchain, like any innovation, is neutral at its core—it’s how people use it that matters. While there have been some negative examples, dismissing the whole technology as a scam overlooks the legitimate use cases and potential it has to revolutionize industries.Bitcoin, in particular, often gets unfairly criticized because of a few bad actors, but that doesn’t erase the fact that many people see it as a valid investment or even a way to take control of their own financial future.

It is using an old technique to use a known fact (Blockchain's limitations) to build up a case against it and by extension bash Bitcoin covertly.I'd say reading that wall of text is a complete waste of time. I skimmed through it and as I said it is just using a fact to build up a fake case. And when you reach the part where he is basically comparing SWIFT with Bitcoin and concludes that the shittiest and most centralized IOU payment processor on the planet that the world is already abandoning because the centralized authority (US regime) is abusing it by stealing other countries' money is better than Bitcoin, you know how little he understands what a \"decentralized payment system that is resistant to censorship\" means.",
