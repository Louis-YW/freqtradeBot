What would you do with a virtual deck?",

But I think it would be hard for a normal individual, perhaps I, to  create a game with it since I'm quite having a grasp of its idea and is still struggling to cope up with your example. But if it is virtual card, this involves coding right? Thr only thing I know id that this would more likely work with non-mobility kind of gambling games?I guess? I tried searching about this ASCII and it showed me characters which can be manipulated in colors and shapes;basically that's coding. I think this would be fun for those who are having fun of coding, but to yhose who are not, like me, Id probably choose convenience and just play with my gambling website.",

I might be overwhelemed by characters. Anyway this is interesting especially if the would be a presentation or video I think with steps for more people to be used to it. Also, if it would be a game, I think it is better (if possible) to put the hash generator and a virtual gaming table in one platform to avoid being dull with tab shifting right? If I get it correctly. Honestly haven't tried it but will do this weekend 'coz it caught my interest. Will be also awesome if other players would share their takes on this one. But one last question, what software/app to be used if you'd be playing poker using ASCII deck to run the game smoothly?",

From what i understand there are not a software for it, but it would be nice to build one. Too bad i'm busy as hell right now, but when i find some free time i will start building it and make it opensource. It would be nice if i can include games like Texas and BlackJack, the logic behind texas is simple because we always use the same amount of cards, but since we have a dynamic number of cards for each BlackJack game it would be a little more complex, i will figure out a way to code that one.",

To have the tutorial first we have to create the game, let me explain what would i do with the current tools i have, but the idea is to see if other users can create one...Lets say we create a virtual texas poker table for 7 users, the first step would be to shuffle our deck:Code:$ echo '🂡🂢🂣🂤🂥🂦🂧🂨🂩🂪🂫🂭🂮🂱🂳🂲🂴🂵🂶🂷🂸🂹🂺🂻🂽🂾🃁🃂🃃🃄🃅🃆🃇🃈🃉🃊🃋🃍🃎🃑🃒🃓🃔🃕🃖🃗🃘🃙🃚🃛🃝🃞' | sed 's/./&\\n/g' | shuf | tr -d \"\\n\"🃙🂧🂺🂲🂭🂣🃑🂪🂢🂳🃂🃛🂽🃘🃔🃞🂴🃋🂶🃄🃝🃎🂮🂻🃇🃕🃓🃒🃚🂵🃃🂫🂾🂦🂡🃖🃈🂨🂸🂷🃁🃗🂤🃅🂹🂥🃉🃍🂩🃊🂱🃆Then we sha256 that deck:Code:D39832C0A131C77A01087E77C62249A6BB832300AF1E6EADC3D4AA87F52EC57FThen we select the cards for the game, and for each user in consecutive order...Game:🃙🂧🂺🂲🂭🂣🃑🂪🂢🂳🃂🃛🂽🃘🃔🃞🂴🃋🂶🃄🃝🃎🂮🂻🃇🃕🃓🃒🃚🂵🃃🂫🂾🂦🂡🃖🃈🂨🂸🂷🃁🃗🂤🃅🂹🂥🃉🃍🂩🃊🂱🃆User1:🃙🂧🂺🂲🂭🂣🃑🂪🂢🂳🃂🃛🂽🃘🃔🃞🂴🃋🂶🃄🃝🃎🂮🂻🃇🃕🃓🃒🃚🂵🃃🂫🂾🂦🂡🃖🃈🂨🂸🂷🃁🃗🂤🃅🂹🂥🃉🃍🂩🃊🂱🃆user2:🃙🂧🂺🂲🂭🂣🃑🂪🂢🂳🃂🃛🂽🃘🃔🃞🂴🃋🂶🃄🃝🃎🂮🂻🃇🃕🃓🃒🃚🂵🃃🂫🂾🂦🂡🃖🃈🂨🂸🂷🃁🃗🂤🃅🂹🂥🃉🃍🂩🃊🂱🃆...And that way the game will look like this:Table:🃙🂧🂺🂲🂭, P1:🂣🃑, P2:🂪🂢, P3:🂳🃂, P4:🃛🂽, P5:🃘🃔, P6:🃞🂴, P7:🃋🂶.And the winner using the Texas Hold'em rules would be: Player 2 with two pairs: 🂺🂲🂭🂪🂢The way to roll the game is by posting the Sha256 code in the thread and letting users choose a number between 1 and 7, and to make it fair you post the shuffled deck when the game is over, that way users can verify the game.",
