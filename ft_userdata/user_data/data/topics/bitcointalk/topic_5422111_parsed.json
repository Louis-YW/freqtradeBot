  "content": "Algorand was one of the first Crypto I purchased when I began investing 9 months ago and have been DCA weekly since the June crash to a point now where it is the third biggest position in my portfolio, my average buy price is now Â£0.29. As one of the sponsors of the world cup which begins in a few days I am hoping to see some positive price action but with the way the bear market is going won't be surprised if we don't. Currently number 28 by market cap I am hoping Algorand becomes a top 10 crypto by the next bull run.I do not hear much talk of Algorand so would be interesting to hear everyone's thoughts both good and bad?",

But I changed mind and decided to take profit when it came back and went a little the price I bought it. I sold all, held it only for a month. Regardless, this coin is a project that I liked because of it's pros, like being green.",

You'll start to hear something good from every crypto in the market when the bull run has begun.But as of now, you'll just see and hear speculations about that here and there but you won't mostly get the opinion that you want to hear unless you're in the same atmosphere as the other holders that has the same coin as you that they hold which is algorand.",
