Whoever invented this , he or she  can reverse ? SHA256 is one-way. One way means it cannot really be reversed. Maybe this helps somewhat: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_functionEven more: don't you think that if this could have been reversed, people's money would have been already stolen and bitcoin would be already worthless?",

In order to understand why they are irreversible I like to use this example:I have two numbers (x and y) and I add them. The result is 10. Can you reverse this simple operation and tell me what x and y were? The answer is no because this very simple algorithm (x+y) is irreversible. Now imagine if there were hundreds of such operations happening in sequence where you add values, have overflow, move bits around, mix bits, etc. and you have what a hash algorithm looks like.",

It's not deemed irreversible just because no one knows the algorithm; the algorithm is available to the public.It's irreversible because of the method and the amount of computation required to reverse a SHA256 hash.If you want to literally see how complex it is, try this demo site: https://sha256algorithm.com/You'll see the relation to pooya's example where it's extremely hard to guess those \"x+y\" in every step to reverse because the values have already altered by the previous steps.Quote from: BitMaxz on December 05, 2022, 11:40:13 PMThe question is more likely decrypting the sha256 hash no one has yet been successful to decrypt it.SHA256 isn't an encryption algorithm, its hash isn't encrypted.",

Whoever invented this , he or she  can reverse ? The National Security Agency or what we commonly call NSA designed the SHA-256 first ever back in 2001 but as you said it can't be reversed even by them also because it's designed as one way hash function which is completely irreversible which is why it's used as hashing function not encryption.If it was possible then we could also get private keys from public keys in bitcoin and many more things that use it but it's not possible and which is why it's safe.As others have already provided you with enough resources and example of how we can't determine the value of inputs from the output we get because there are lot of possibilities.",

OP is confusing hashing (one way functions) with encryption (two way functions).Hashing functions are irreversible. pooya87 already explained in simple terms how it works and I'll give you a practical example:The output of a hashing function is always a hash with fixed length no matter what the input is. For example, you can take a terabyte file, it's sha256 will be a 256 bits long hash. Do you think it's possible to extract a terabyte data from a 256 bits string!",

No. The SHA 256 is one of the most common cryptographic hash functions out there, so you'll also see it in lots of applications and other algorithms in cryptography. It's a fast, one-way function, and it can not be reversed. This means that there is no way to recover the original message from its hash value. It's also very hard to modify the content of the message without completely changing its hash value. And, of course, its uniqueness makes it a perfect hashing algorithm for digital signatures.",

Even rainbow tables, which were helpful to crack older hash functions like LM hash, MD5, and SHA-1 seem to be useless against it now. As you can see in the link posted by nc50lc and in this one the algorithm is not simple and use several combinations of xor, rotate and shift functions.",

By the way, @udayantha11 if you are looking for a way to \"reverse\" one sha256 hash, sometimes Google is the most easy and fast way to get that. There are also some databases available online with millions of hash stored : https://md5hashing.nethttps://hashtoolkit.comhttps://md5calc.comhttps://privatekeys.pw",

So, it's not the same thing.Another thing, rainbow tables is used to crack passwords and even if you find a match, there is a slight chance the initial input is something totally different (collision).",
