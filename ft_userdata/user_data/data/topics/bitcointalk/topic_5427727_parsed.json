  "content": "Hello everyone!I'd like to meet and discuss with fellow bitcoiners who have children. I think that the ideals of freedom begin with the family and only make sense when looked at through this personal lens. Many people within the Bitcoin community, beginning with Satoshi himself, subscribe to the ideal of individual sovereignty and the Austrian School of economics. All of this is fantastic. However, when does a developing child become a sovereign individual? If you defend the ideal of freedom and free market capitalism, should you not begin by protecting the children's individuality from elders who threaten it? Why rage against \"the government\" when there are actual people around you wielding a much greater power on helpless human beings? There is no easy answer to this question, but this is precisely the reason we parents need to research and talk. A related topic, I think, is our troubles as adult bitcoiners dealing with parents and relatives who do not understand. Traditionally, parents have trouble granting their children the freedom we crave. There is an interesting interplay between our relationships with our parents and our relationships with our children. I hope to be able to discuss and share our experiences in this legendary forum!",

After all, nobody other than the parents (except for God) had a hand in making the children. So, why are the children not more like their property than simply children?",

To summarize it up,parents are just the children guardian and provider but government controls everybody and is suppose to provide for everybody including the parent and their children.The point is, who is your government? Outside of your parents when you are underage, God doesn't tell anybody who his government is... outside of God being the head of all government, that is.So, let's say that you have a government. How did that government get to be your government? Several possible ways:1. It was your parents' government, and when you became an adult, you simply kept it as your government out of habit;2. You selected it as your government for whatever reason. So, it was by agreement, even if that agreement was only with yourself;3. You were forced by a government military to be part of a government... like a hostage situation, where your captors tell you to obey or die.There are possibly other ways that a government became your government. But in every case, it was by your own choice. In the extreme, you are always your own government, although God is first, above yourself. If you don't want a government to be your government (as in a hostage situation), your only other option might be to maintain God as your government, and yourself next in line, by dying at the hands of your captor. To see what I mean, read 4 Maccabees in the Apocrypha of the Bible.In all governing of yourself, you must live by your agreements if you are to be honorable, and live by God as your top government. As shown by Zedekiah breaking his agreement with Nebuchadnezzar to be his vassal, God is against those who break agreements.",

I hope to be able to discuss and share our experiences in this legendary forum!I have a hard time decrypting what your point was. But one of the rasons adults won't give their kids freedom (and guns) is because we are responsible for them, that's what being a parent is; being responsible adult. Kids brains are not developed enough to make life altering decisions by themselves so obviously we wont give them as much freedom as they would like.",

They give them bicycles, and the kids ride them around all that automobile traffic, often alone.More importantly, learn to use and respect guns, yourself, rather than being afraid of them. Then, train your children in their proper respect and use. Why? So the kids can protect themselves... and you in your old age.",

Are you talking about protecting children from elders or freedom begins at home? It is to protest children from from adult, it would have been better you made mean the area the children should be protected then talking of the area of freedom, yes children have from but there is a limitation in it. If you give them excess liberty they will misuse it. Related to bitcoin, you can teach them bitcoin and it is only when they matured enough from the mind that you have to do that if not they would misuse it. So you have to protect them in setting area of life.",

This is why in-laws are annoying and why we have political left and right.Parents ARE government over their children. The parents didn't fight each other when making the children. They did it by mutual agreement, even though they might not have been expecting or hoping for a child. HOWEVER, if the parents aren't the owner, why should the government be? Government didn't have any hand in the actual creation of the children, but the parents did. If we leave the children without a government at all, they will die in a few days after being born. If the parents neglect the children, they have essentially abandoned their ownership. Government might take over because there are some loving people in government directing it that way.It's like you. You own some canvas and brushes and paint. They are your property. You paint a picture. Isn't the picture your property, as well? Or does the government own you and your painting property, and they can own your painting because of this?There are all kinds of things that go on around a family... politics and otherwise. It doesn't have anything to do with ownership of the children except if the parents give up the ownership. People/parents don't always agree with THEIR parents and extended family.Quote from: maanmieli on December 27, 2022, 03:25:16 PMLet me edit what BADecker wrote, for illustration purposes:Quote from: BADecker on December 11, 2022, 05:11:07 PMSo, let's say that you have a God.

God became the God of everyone by HIS choice. Just because they don't acknowledge Him, doesn't mean that they are suddenly outside of Him and His authority. And they really don't want to be, because they couldn't hold themselves alive outside of His power and authority. It is God Who is holding us all alive all the time. God, out of love for His creatures, maintains them even though they are against Him, or totally  ignore Him.",
