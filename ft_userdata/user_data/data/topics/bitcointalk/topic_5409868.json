LIFETIME in terms of the many years we are in business. We do have long years of plans, at least from our Roadmap it is clear that our goal is to become the #1 in the year 2027. Once we achieve that, our real journey will start then. Before achieving the ultimate goal, we are hustling. In short by LIFETIME we are meaning that the Initial Bitcoin Chip Offerers' will be receiving their portion of revenue as long as Casino Critique project continues.Taking your question in mind, we will add a response in our F.A.Qs section soon. Thanks again.Quote from: bittraffic on August 16, 2022, 07:17:18 AMHow much are they expecting to make every month? ¬†Because the 10% that will be shared will matter when this is recognized. According to our observations and investigations, leaders in the industry are making over $200K per month if not over half a million. So it's not question about how much we are expecting, it's question that do we have the mindset and planning to be one of the leader in the industry? We are working hard to prove it, words are not good enough to convince.QuoteMassive marketing is on thier plan.Massive marketing is what we are working for but we do understand that marketing itself will not help if we failed to provide quality in our service. Our product is Casino review. Until we create the reputation of being completely unbiased and BOLD in our reviews the massive marketing will not sustain the project in the long run. So right now our focus is to create quality contents before pushing harder for Marketing. Please check our Roadmap which will give you some idea.There are some real interesting questions and discussions from members above. Due to not having much time, We are unable to response everyone. But when we get time, we will address all of you one by one. We are scheduled to launch signature campaign and bounty campaign soon. Please stay connected and good luck to all of us. Looking forward to have you on our IBCO. You can contribute as little as 1 Chip to maximum 1000 Chip",
