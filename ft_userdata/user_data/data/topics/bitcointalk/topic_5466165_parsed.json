  "content": "As a regular poster in the gambling discussion section here and also a big sports fan, I frequently engage in bets with my friends and relatives on many occasions and sport events. For example last week my cousin insists that Haaland will win the upcoming Ballon d'Or award, while I'm also confident that Messi will secure his 8th trophy easily in this edition.From that I noticed that we don’t have any friendly wagers here in gambling section which I haven't observed before, So let me give you an example of what we can establish if you like it: So by following several sport threads here such as LaLiga. Lets say one user posted his opinion and analysis about the next match between RMA against RSO and he thinks that RMA won’t win that match, another user reply to him and disagree with him…. From that both users can agree to do a friendly wager or a bet between each other and set a value for the bet, and after the match is over the user who lost that bet should pay up to what they both agreed on. It should be a fun thing only with small amounts and hopefully everyone keeps his word, I know many people would say that it’s better to just bet on a casino but I think it’s more fun here and also sometimes you can agree on better returns.What do you think about this? I hope it’s not breaking any rules here.",

I hope it’s not breaking any rules here.If you check the gambling board you’ll see that there’s a thread where users wager on their Fantasy’s premier league, It’s been managed by some reputable forum member and it also includes my campaign manager and the user that’s manger the Op signature campaign but I doubt it’s open for everyone though, but at the start of this premier league season we received an invitation to join but I decided not to join because I didn’t pay much attention to my Fantasy Premier League team which means I’m in no position to compete with anyone.If you feel like you want to run a bet with someone on a specific sport with forum members you can do it but the only issue is the pool funds, it’s either you’ll look for a casino here in the forum that supports your idea to sponsor it or you’ll just use the money of those that are interested in betting in your little game. Btw, it’s not against the rule.",

      "body": "From what I've seen, there's something similar in this section, but the problem with this idea you gave is that if all the members of the forum were betting against each other, this would take customers away from the casinos, so it wouldn't make much sense to have the casino. The function of the casino is precisely to be a means in which people can place bets and the casino guarantees that if these people get it right, they will be paid what is their right, but here on the forum it is not a place licensed to be a gambling platform and there will be no one to guarantee that everyone will receive it when they win, so as you can see there are 2 problems with your ideabut the biggest problem with your idea is the issue of license, using the forum as a sports betting platform would require the forum to have a gambling license, and I don't know of any forum where it is a forum and at the same time have a gambling license. other things and that the market would be very limited, for example if there was a real madrid game against barcelona, if you tell people to place bets on this forum for this real madrid game against barcelona, then all people will have as an option to bet will be on betting which team will winbut in the casino people will be able to bet on various markets such as over and under goals, cards, corners, who will win in the 1 half, who will score a goal first, who will score a corner first. So there are many options to bet on this Real Madrid game against Barcelona, but all these options I mentioned will not be available here on the forum. that's why I see your idea being difficult to implement without causing problems and constraints",

I've seen a lot of regular collectibles folks that underdelivered or never delivered goods at all. The thing is, you'll never know who to fully trust as some people are just trying to build their reputation to hopefully jump on to bigger figures, and that's when they'll disappear.

It is also unlikely someone who is engaged in a signature campaign would risk to be tagged as a defaulter because of a relatively small bet, and those big enough can always get escrow. It could be used for small amounts, but I'll be wary in trying to deal with someone with huge bets. That, perhaps, will be something that can be handled by an escrow should this come to fruition (hopefully).Quote from: Hispo on September 08, 2023, 11:39:48 PMBut would not this section need an additional sub-section where people can set their addresses and terms of the bet, as it is usually done in the lending/borrowing section? It could just be another thread wherein people can stake their 'gambling' address to, similar to the one in the Meta section of this forum. I doubt theymos will ever consider creating a sub-forum dedicated to just this one thing.",

      "body": "It would be fun. I oftentimes challenge others to a bet whenever disagreements arise, not just in sports but in almost all things. And I'm also often challenged this way. I guess this has kind of become a culture here in my country. Ever since I was a child, many disagreements, even in a quiz or an exam item at school, ended up in a bet. But the problem, however, when it comes to sports disagreements is that odds are available. To somebody who favors the favorite team with lower odds, say, 1.50, it would be to his/her advantage to challenge for a bet. But to the other who sides with the underdog that has odds of, say, 2.90, he/she better bet through a platform.",

Because on the gambling site, the gambling site can make money for the service rendered for the bet two people are betting between themselves, but maybe it is not going to be profitable like the way it is on the gambling sites now.

Although, you said it's just small money so I don't think it is worth it. Maybe a list of the people who will just gamble with other members of the forum is better but like I said it could still lead to a scam especially when the bet gets higher as time flies by. The good part about betting against each other is there's no handicap included most of the time. For example in basketball, if a gambler is so sure that his team will win the game then he could just directly bet against those who oppose him. I've done it before but not in this forum but with neighbors. Although I know the team I am rooting for is the favorite and want to give a plus to my neighbor as his team is the underdog, he didn't take it and just wanted a direct bet. He actually won though and I am surprised then we had fun discussing about the game.",
