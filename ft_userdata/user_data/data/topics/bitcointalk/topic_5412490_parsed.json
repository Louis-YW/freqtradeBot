Why even country wants power while there’s no known enemy? Country like China, US and other strong country is just creating there enemy by themselves while there people only wants to live normally.",

And in view of the trade war between America and China, America must guarantee that Taiwan will not cut off its supplies of these products to the American market, as dictated by China, which it considers its province.Fueling the conflict between Taiwan and China is an attempt to cut off Chinese power from the island and let it control its decisions.",

War will ruin Taiwan like Ukraine. China doesn't want to rule Taiwan in ashes. Russia is now on Arctic region exhibiting war games, I think Russia is about to bring the war in the US soil near Alaska where is just about 90 miles away from US. Russia is actually closer to America. They wanna see if US is willing to also destroy Alaska and Canada in a war.",

More or less this war will gonna change the history of the world because this will gonna trigger nuclear war for sure and also the allies of both countries will join the war. If this is just a small thing, we already see both countries exchanging missiles against each other but both are careful not to further escalate any major tensions because when one of them push the button, it won't be easily turned off like what we see with Ukraine today.",

US had been making wars everywhere in the world making border conflicts worse when instead keeping the peace. China, like any other country is a proud country developing magnificent projects all over the world. if US wants the friendly competition, developing projects on other countries will also be good for them.

All that America seeks is to create tension to isolate China, as it tried to do with Russia, but of course it failed.With a new chaos, China will not be able to buy Russian oil, and therefore the sanctions imposed on Russia will achieve its goals, weakening it.The Russian-Chinese connection is what binds the two conflict areas together.
