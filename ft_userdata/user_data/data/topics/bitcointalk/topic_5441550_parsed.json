  "content": "Hello everyone!In the last few days, russian mining community raised hype about unfair payments from WoolyPooly side.According to investigations and proofs, there is an conclusions that during last months, miners wasn't fairly rewarded up to 20-40% on popular coins  (KAS, NEXA, etc...)Pool administration confirmed, that there was a problems and wrong calculations on ~20th-25th February and trying to resolve thoose. I really don't want to blame anyone, just stay safe and check your mining incomes by independent calculators and other pools.",

It's also how state actors like Russia spread misinformation.\"People are saying\" there's so much proof. There's a lot of hype about it, but no actual evidence. Show me.",

Off topic posts are not appropriate, political discussions are off topic. I did neither, I made comparisons usingcurrent world issues with political overtones as examples. My main beef is people don't do what you suggested, they just amplify the nonsense. As one previous poster said they weretoo lazy to do any fact checking themselves, but still say it's true. More ignorant people saying it's true doesn't make it so.Update 2023.03.10Well it looks like \"the biggest pool fraud in history\" has fizzled out. Why am I not surprised? That's a rhetorical question.It's just another example of people recklessly spreading false information. It's called \"going viral\" for a reason and it's not a good thing.It has become weaponized in politics and it works because of what I said above.Sigh.",

      "body": "Would you buy a product from an online shop that shows no address, country, or employees?Several pools are not legal entities so they have no laws they are required to follow or taxes to pay, and obviously you can't chase them if they rug.Do your due diligence, and if something looks suspicious it usually is. I think checking for an address is an obvious thing to do when choosing who do to business with but it seems like people lose all common sense when they get into crypto.",
