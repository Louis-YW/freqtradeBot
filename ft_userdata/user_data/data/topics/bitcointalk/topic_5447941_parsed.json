  "content": "Few days ago Metamask announced development of new feature with the help of Opensea and Blockaid in order to help people not connect their wallets to known scams and lose all of their money that way. I am sure that people will still lose money this way, but I think that this feature will help to some degree.Â  https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1643702565140348929?t=72HVnQNG2zmRbCqlVM0Krw&s=19",

If this new feature will be live, hopefully they can start to block hackers/scammers wallet though at least give them a chance of legitimacy since many might be affected by this even if they are a real wallet holder.",

It is still our fault if we get scammed and the maximum effort that metamask and other wallet can do is to provide warning just like what metamask did. I agree that this isn't a fully scam proof feature but at least we have this kind of feature that is offered to us to potentially avoid these scams. Newbies are the one who I think will mostly benefit this kind of feature as they don't really know much on how things works and they are the target victims of these scam projects. This feature is great indeed.",

      "body": "Metamask coming up with a feature like this is a great one, which will help a few people a lot to some extent, but according to what they state, it will only help detect scam sites that have already been flagged, which means if the site is newly scam, they will still be unable to detect it as a scam, so what they are actually doing is blacklisting some sites, which they won't allow to connect into their database. People who will misunderstand this might probably think every site that Metamask allows them to connect to after adding this feature is safe, and they will feel less of a concern than they should have, exposing themselves to more security risks than they could have ever been exposed to. It's a good thing to see that Old Metamask is still constantly working to safeguard their customers.",

This feature is good enough but i wonder how fast the feature updates with the latest scam that discovered by people in the market. Let's see how effective that feature is. The accuracy actually depend on the what kind of scam that already reported and submitted to the database. The good thing is if I think that if metamask is reliable enough to detect so many scams. The community must be so active to report any scam that is being discovered. The hackers will always come up with new ways of scam others. I think that if the most important thing is never try to believe in someone who you didn't even know about him.",

Though, one question arises is how fast would those 3 projects will be able to analyze and confirm a scam or malicious contract, because that span on time will also affect the number of potential scammed users.Anyway, this kind of feature is surely a good thing for users but as both of you said, it does not address one of the root causes which is the user itself that lacks securities concerns. Also, those scammers certainly won't stop improving, I'm sure they would try to find a way to bypass this prevention system.",

The question is whether this wallet will remain as secure as before or if hackers will have more opportunities to find vulnerabilities. Of course, I understand that the developers want to make their brainchild into something more than just a wallet, additionally attracting more and more attention to metamask, but nevertheless, I began to have more doubts that it will work perfectly and there will not be some data leakage.",

The permission grants access to data that is being surfed, the site info and certificate access. This might be making it easier for MetaMask to join the force with opensea and blockaid. This sort of improvement may not be possible with the bitcoin wallet. If they do it then they will have to kee marking all the generated addresses which is tedious task with decentralised management. MetaMask might be getting upper hand there as well. Great feature.",
