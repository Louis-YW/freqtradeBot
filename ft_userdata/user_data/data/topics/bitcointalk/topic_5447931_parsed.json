Remember, we can not identify what addresses belong to a specific owner.There is a Pareto principle that says 80% of assets belong to 20% richest people. It is biased by lost BTC in early days when people considered it is a joke and did not back up their private keys.Power, I guess you implied about power on the network, by owning hash rate. You must have 51% of network total hash rate to attack their network. It's impossible. Cost is expensive and community, nodes, exchanges will do react to this very quickly.How many Bitcoin confirmations is enough.

Still, they are the ones with the coin and they are at some times giving it away or selling it at their discretion.Quote from: thecodebear on April 07, 2023, 12:35:16 PMUhhh 1% does not own 99% of Bitcoin. No idea where you got that idea from.He might be right, but it's according to some of the articles and general saying on the internet. Is this really true? I don't know, but the myth is verifiable. However, their point is that 99% of Bitcoin addresses don't have the coin in them or have so little to be recognised. Nonetheless, this is an old saying which might not reflect the present-day status of Bitcoin.You can read more here: ‘1% of 100%",

Sure people will have more than you but you can offset the divide in fiat wealth by buying as much bitcoin as you can whilst it’s still relatively cheap.This is the right answer.First off as I said above, 1% don't own 99% of BTC, because that would mean the tens of millions of bitcoin owners in the 99% combined own less than 200k Bitcoin, which is obviously absurd. If that was the case I'd probably be in the 1% lol cuz that would mean I would have thousands of times more Bitcoin than the average of the 99%, and that would also mean the average holding of the 99% would only be a few dozen dollars worth of Bitcoin and that is probably more like the bottom 10% not the bottom 99%. This is all to point out that 1% does not own anything remotely close to 99% of BTC.And naturally people who were already rich or who got into Bitcoin extremely early (like those who were mining 50 BTC at a time back in 2011 or buying it at $1-$10 back then) are going to have a lot more Bitcoin than the average person. That's natural. But as DeathAngel here says, anybody in the 99% can get a head start now buy accumulating Bitcoin because plenty of those 1%'ers from outside Bitcoin aren't even gonna get into it for many years and they'll be buying in at far higher prices, and thus supporting your wealth gains with their wealth.Finally, Bitcoin isn't PoS, and it isn't run by politicians or a company. It is decentralized. So no amount of wealth in Bitcoin can be used to exploit the network. That's one of the beautiful things about PoW - supply ownership and mining ownership are two entirely different things that each require significant capital investment. And that's also the beauty of Bitcoin being decentralized. In the fiat system wealthy individuals have sway over politicians who control the fiat system, but in Bitcoin you have no say over the network no matter how much Bitcoin you own.",

Also, we have to keep in mind that around 2 million bitcoins are left to be mined and we don't know where will these two bitcoins end up.Also, stronger or richer will always outperform weaker or poorer, it's just a rule of nature.",

ThanksNew coins are mined and distributed to existing and new holders. Existing coins in wallets who hold the most will always be traded or spent in the future. Considering that Bitcoin's supply is limited to 21,000,000 and it is impossible to centralize or manipulate its creation and distribution, it is unlikely that a small portion of holders will control its supply for an extended period of time, or even if so, at least some of the supply will always be in the hands of a free market.The reason why wealth centralizes under capitalism in fiat money is because there are so many flawed concepts which fail to make it fair for everyone and viable in the long term.
