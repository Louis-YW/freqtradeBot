One thing that makes Bitcoin unique is its limited supply. It was possible that it could have been manipulated long ago, and the limited supply is what contributes to its price value as demand increases, so it will become scarce in the market.QuoteWould it be positive for the currency or could bring some caos?If that is ever made possible to increase the supply for whatever reason, there will only be negative impacts on the network.

Lost Bitcoin can still be found if the private key lost or wallet password was found. Even in the case of Fiat.  If you lost your money at your personal disposal the government ain't compensating you This also applies with Bitcoin I see no reason for compensation for something they have no fault in.",

It is highly unlikely for the system of bitcoin to change just so it can add more. Plus, the supply being limited helps in case of inflation and this allows to drive up the demand more.If bitcoin were unlimited, its demand might not be as high right now.",

It doesn’t matter that Bitcoin was once not so expensive, if the coin has value, then the owner will care about maintaining access to his coins in any case.Another thing is that I admit cases when the owner could, simply out of caution, or simply did not have time, hand over the keys to someone close to him, and these coins could be lost forever, but it’s hard for me to believe that the number of lost coins can be calculated millions.",

      "body": "OP,The lost bitcoin are not nearly 5 million. People like to exaggerate the number of lost bitcoin. It's probably about 2 million, maybe slightly over 2 million. The way people get really exaggerated numbers is they just assume any coins that haven't been moved in a certain number of years are lost, so with time these estimates will continue getting higher even if no more coins are lost, because lots of people hold long term for many years without touching their bitcoin. So it's more like one tenth of the supply is lost, not one quarter.And no the lost bitcoins will never be added back to the supply.First off, there is no way to know how many bitcoin are lost, so it would just be guesswork.But the real reason of course is that this is not how Bitcoin works. The 21 million supply cap is one of the most fundamental things about Bitcoin. And so is its decentralization. You lose those things and you pretty much lose the value of Bitcoin. And to start adding coins to the supply you would lose both of those things, because obviously adding new coins means the supply is not capped anymore, and that suggests that now people are able to control the supply of bitcoin, no different than fiat currencies, which also means people could decide to add more bitcoin for other reasons. If Bitcoin were centralized you could technically do it, pretty much any other cryptocurrency could make this sort of change, but Bitcoin is decentralized and nobody can just decide to make some change in the protocol, the community must agree to it and the community would never agree to such a thing. You ask if it would cause chaos, well it would basically destroy much of the value proposition of Bitcoin, making it much more like altcoins or fiat currencies, so yeah I'd call that chaos, in addition to the fact that it can't even be technically done!And the other main reason is there is no reason to do this in the first place. It's not like there has to be 21 million bitcoin in circulation. There is nothing wrong with some bitcoins being lost. So even if it were possible to do it (which as just explained, it isn't), and even if it wouldn't completely destroy some of the fundamental tenets and value of Bitcoin (which as just explained, it would), and if it was even possible to know how many bitcoin are lost (which it isn't), there is simply no logical reason why it should be done. There is no reason to create new bitcoins to replace lost bitcoins. Hell, not even fiat currencies work this way - if you burn a $100 bill you don't contact the central bank and tell them to print an extra $100 because you burnt it.So it is neither practical, possible, desired, nor logical to do this.",
