So i have no doubt about It's Future.It's not a complete win and the decision is on appeal the last time I checked so maybe rethink about giving your 100% confidence in this coin. There will always be people who will FOMO on this so it will probably take little time before the new supply dump is absorbed by the market. I personally wouldn't go heavy on this since it's already one of those top coins and will have 2x to 5x at most in the next bullrun. That's good markup but will be lower when compared to newer tokens.",

      "body": "Any unlocking of such a large number of coins means only one thing, that a large stream of XRP will pour into the cryptomarket, which before could not be sold with escrow. Undoubtedly, XRP will sell and under this pressure, the price of it in the cryptomarket will fall. 100%. How strong? - It's not known because people like you are planning to buy, which will act as a deterrent for XRP to fall further. Should XRP be bought at this opportunity? I doubt. I would get rid of this shitcoin as soon as possible and not even touch it. I would not associate my future with XRP and hope for this centralized coin with an endless issue, in which a new batch of 1 billion coins is periodically poured into the cryptomarket. Why hold a dubious asset?",

Ripple have a huge liquidity that can absorb this amount while the team will surely not gonna sell-off thiese tokens since it will create FUD in their token which they will not benefit on it. I don’t invest on XRP since it has huge supply and the team controls huge chunk that will use my money for liquidity. I doubt this will gonna result a dump. Invest only when you are interested on Ripple and don’t use this kind of news as signal for decision making since this is a regular occurrence in ripple.",

One billion XRP isn't really that much from total supply.Yes, might be another reason for the dip, and obviously what the OP said, them unlocking one billion XRP could also have a huge impact.Anything we heard about unlocking from any project will cause the price to decline in my opinion, as the supply goes larger, (basic supply and demand law).And maybe the ripple effect that Bitcoin has to altcoin market, as it goes down hard again in the last 24-48 hours and so other it had domino to altcoin or even in some stocks as well.",

The news about this is important because its the right of investor to know why they are unlocking the supply. If they are doing this for the preparation for their update then we should know it, or else they are just doing this to liquidate their assets and dump the market.",

It's not all of unlocked coins will be going to the market as well. The dumb from the team to grab cash may still happen but as far as i can see that if nothing happened with ripple. The recent dump that happens to the ripple triggered by bitcoin. It's not from the token unlock. I saw that if the token unlock doesn't give impact to the price. I would prefer to use XRP as long term investment. It seems like that if court sees crypto as one of the important thing now. SEC was so crazy by blindly accusing everything related to the crypto.",

This is an open manipulation and I still wonder why do we even consider this centralized coin as crypto, I think we all should give up on XRP and switch to other promising altcoins.Doesn't have a fixed supply? Base on Coingecko, and Coinmarketcap, it has 100 Billion supply. So you're saying that both these websites are wrong then? I agree with you that they can pump, and dump it though, but what's making me curious is that, despite of the backlashes that Ripple has received over the past few years, it has been on the top 10 still in terms of Market cap.This just shows that the community behind it is large, so large that it can't put the project down despite of all the negative thoughts that surrounded the project for the past 3-4 years I guess. Open Manipulation? There's always a chance for that since it's a centralized project so it might be, or it might be not. I don't know why people here are very pessimistic about Ripple, and it's unlocking of 1 Billion XRP. Are you long term holders of Ripple thus you see this as a negative one. Increase supply, same demand = price goes down yes, but what's the best thing to do when the price is down? Isn't it to buy more to at least grab the opportunity? I mean I'm not a trader, or a holder of Ripple as well, but I believe that this move by them is an opportunity for us investors to get some profit at least. This news didn't have any effect still on XRP right now, but I might take the opportunity to at least buy it for short term if it will have a negative effect.",
