What is your opinion. Btc might be illegal in our country like you said but that shouldn't stop crypto users to participate in politics or aspire for political positions, contesting for a position is a thing of choice and no true citizen is deprived of such so far you meet up the requirements for such position and have the  support and funds to pursue your aspiration. However there are many crypto whales capable of challenging most of the high ranking politicians for their office and money won't be an issues to them cause the have lots of funds stored in cryptocurrencies.  However asides from the high level of corruption in our government Nigeria @ 62 have gone beyond that stage where politician with greater wealth stand a high chance of winning, we've failed to practice the Democratic system of government of the people for the peope and by the people and gone to a point where democracy is now for the rich alone where, the rich use their wealth to pay and bribe their way into government positions just to loot the nations treasury and make themselves richer, a time shall come when the sons of a nobody would become somebody and hold high positions in the government sector, that's what we all hope for, only time will tell.",

In Nigeria, things goes easily underground, because these popular politicians have bitcoin in their wallets and they're not the ones control it themselves, rather a third party is there to foreseen the entire operation and take full responsibility for every single trades. Ofcourse the standard of been a crypto investor and also a politician, although it depends on the laws in that particular country in question, because not all country permits the regulation of crypto activities, it remained banned and if a politician got caught up in all of this, he might lose his position as governmental body, that doesn't sound right.",

What is your opinion.For sure Nigeria politics is all about who get the funds to push for electioneering process and not about the character of individual that is why we find ourselves were we are today. I am not surprised that our politicians are fully into crypto but are not coming forth to say it publicly and this might be the reasons why they kicked against anything that would attack the existence of bitcoin in Nigeria. So far there are many crypto enthusiast in politics, some are even sponsors while some are contestant, some are appointees, etc depending on how the connect is.In essence, as a smart Nigerian, you have to play safe and be on low keys although btc is not illegal in Nigeria but the ignorant agencies are out to get their own share of the cake without minding the law.
