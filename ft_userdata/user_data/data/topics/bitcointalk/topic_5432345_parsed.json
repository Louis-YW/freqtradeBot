  "content": "I want to make my ignore list explicit, something I have seen that sometimes it has been done and also so that no one is surprised if I do not respond to certain people. It is clear that if I do not respond it is because I do not read them. naim027franky1Timelord2067Royse777nulliusarielbiti_am_viralslaveforanunnak1KTChampionsOpenCryptoSystemteam87kaziataul80Timelord2o67Polo7cryptoboss2020RainbowKunEbedeeXPHorizonZAINmalik75onooksPizzalover420b94I325btcSanni_wI'm going to leave the thread locked for now, although I may open it for discussion in the future, but as of today this ignore list is not open for discussion, as it has no implications other than to make my forum experience more bearable. My feedbacks are, because they have implications for the people to whom I have left the feedback. In the hypothetical case that I have to review a negative feedback to someone I have on ignore, I could temporarily remove them from ignore.",

      "body": "I am going to respond to the crybaby who is crying that I have left him another feedback and such and such.I have the crybaby on ignore, what happens is that I read him when he was not logged in. The crybaby doesn't seem to know or doesn't want to learn that two negative feebacks from the same person look like one from the outside. So at this moment he still has -3.It seems that he doesn't want to know that I could redo it and put it all in one feeback, but this way people can see the temporal order better.Stop crying, crybaby, I already said at the time when I left you the red tag and said that you were behind Casino Critique that anyone who wants to distrust me should do so, I don't care, as if everyone distrust me. You deserve more tags and you have not received them because many people have been paid, are being paid or expect to be paid by you in the future. I will leave the thread open for those who want to discuss my feedbacks, not my ignore list.",

It only calls into question the rationality of your other tags.Quote from: naim027 on January 11, 2023, 02:48:08 PMI would like to see @LoyceV's Point of view here.you, me, Poker Player or any other member of the forum should have their own opinion, and not ask for it from LoyceV or anyone else. if you need to hear someone's attitude, it means that you are not sure of your own. If you are not sure, do not leave feedback, especially not negative.",

      "body": "I forgot to say a couple of things.Scum is not allowed to post in this thread and neither are the ones I have on ignore. I haven't even read what they have written before deleting.As I trust LoyceV's great knowledge of the trust system, I have changed the last feedback to neutral.I will lock the thread and if anyone thinks I should change any feedback they can PM me but I will ignore the scum and those I have on ignore.One last point with respect to what the crybaby was asking for. Whoever distrust me, I'm not going to take it personally. Nor am I likely to make any changes to my trust list in the near future.If someone distrust me, obviously, that could be one of the reasons for me to distrust him in the future because I trust myself. But I am not going to make automatic retaliatory distrusts if it happens that members in DT distrust me. In fact, Nutildah did it and I haven't even bothered. Edit: unlocked for Nutildah.Quote from: nutildah on January 12, 2023, 04:08:05 AMI would address this in his thread where he mentioned me but it kind of on-topic for this thread seeing as how you are a campaign manager and I assume you've also been escrow at the same time before.I see Poker Player changed this most recent red to a neutral but I disagree with his initial red on you if only for the reason that it wasn't supported by a reference link. Your reputation is obviously important to you on this forum and since you've been here for years longer than him, he owes the courtesy of at least supporting his negative trust with a reference link.I'm generally wary of new-ish users (2020 reg date is new-ish IMO) who are quick to use their DT powers for reasons not entirely justified.Do you mean that is the only reason? I thought you would have more motives than that.I didn't put a reference link because I would have to put at least 3 and they don't fit.",

The only explanation I can see for what you are telling me is that as far as I remember you were a few months away from the forum and apparently you didn't find out what happened after that neutral feedback. It is that the rest who have followed the story do not need a post with links. But I will surely make tomorrow an explanatory post for you on this thread, well for you and for the ones who didn't know about the story, and I will leave the negative feedback, which will appear again on top, and the crybaby will cry again.On the other hand I am going to update my ignore list with naim027. I will put his alts on ignore if I see him using them. The known ones, because I am sure he is farming other alts.",

      "body": "Since this thread is about my feedbacks in general, I will say a few rules. If you want me to review my negative feedback, you will have to wait at least one year, unless it is a factual error. If in addition to the feedback I have you on my ignore list, convince someone else to ask me for the feeback review because if you yourself post here, I will delete your post. If you are also known forum scum for scamming or something like that, I will delete your post, even if you are not in my ignore list yet.I will come by the reputation section with a spaced frequency, maybe I will leave days without coming here, but I will keep an eye on it. Mostly to defend myself if some lying, whining scammer comes out telling lies about me. If this doesn't happen, I guess things will calm down.",
