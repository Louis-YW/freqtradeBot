  "content": "I realized before that I’m always winning huge amount on slot whenever my gambling account is inactive for a long time compared when my account is actively playing slots in daily basis. I have 3 different casino account and all of them gave me same huge win when I first time play slot on same game. But now I’m consistently on lose stroke for more than a month in daily basis on all of my 3 account with same slot game.With this previous experience. I decided to do an experiment to prove whether the inactivity of the casino account affects the winning rate on slots game. Here’s what I’m going to doI will allocate 30$ per day on playing same slot game for 14 days consecutively. I will use the 0.2$ bet per spin. I will stop after reaching 200 spin or when my bankroll depleted first. My target is to hit atleast x500+ multiplier since that’s my personal highest win record on the slot game.After completing the 14 days. I will make my casino account inactive for a month before I will play again then repeat the process.I might do this for a year or more to gather more accurate data for my experiment. I will update this thread every month with my gambling result for recording purposes. I will start this experiment on February for me to have a time to save funds. Wish me luck!PS:This thread will be on self-moderated mode to avoid spam.",

What exactly are your expectations from doing this? Do you somehow think the probability resets to zero and house edge doesn't affect your play that much?",

But when I start 3Doge with my martingale, that's when I experience losing streaks. Well, good luck. We'll wait for the update.",

I do not play slots every day, and prefer to play once or twice a month, spending about $100 per game session (unless of course I increase the deposit by 50-100%), so I have no way to compare whether the payout ratio changes and I think it all depends on luck rather than account activity, but I could be wrong. It will be interesting to see your experiment in the long run.",

Betting more after the win (Or deposit back) is gambler psychology, because you see an easy money to be made.---Good luck for the @OP, my advice trying to playing on some easy slot provider since you have a low bankroll.",

Then you could just compare the profitability of those 2 groups.And 14 days sessions seem a bit long. You could probably reduce them to not more than 7 days unless there's a good reason you want to go for that long.God luck!",

I dont think so and would rather believe that it would really be just purecoincidence but well good luck OP for this experiment and hope that you wont be spending more that $30 per day when you do play slots  Technically, it was really a coincidence and no such thing as luck percentage was based on the account's inactivity.However, there's really a time when inactive accounts (not dormant), sometimes hit huge wins once return to action. That was the purpose of this OP's experiment but others shouldn't be misled and really considered that account activity has something to do with winning chances.Also happened to me but not that often. What I have noticed in my activity when in terms of determining the chances of winning, is the \"time\" of my session which requires another discussion.",

If your experiment is correct, then that is also the reason why I got quite a lot of profit at one of the casinos that I haven't played for a long time and played because I was tempted by the Christmas giveaway, the profit that I got was really beyond expectations, even in mental slot games, which is difficult to make good profits.Good luck with your experiment and waiting for the update.",

From OP's words, I reckon any \"big win\" is considered a success, and the number of times it happened would probably be the only thing worth noticing from each cycle. Any losses or small wins would probably be disregarded since we're testing big wins anyway and not constant wins. I actually reckon this could be done by playing for maybe 3, or 4 days instead of 2 weeks, since as you've said, it seems to be too long of a time.",

This is just my personal POV and it doesn't backed by facts that's why I do this experiment.Disclaimer: I'm not encouraging to believe that is why this is a self experiment.Quote from: madnessteat on January 04, 2023, 03:48:12 PMIn your opinion, how long is the period of inactivity of the account for the casino to increase the rate of return? In my previous case, I didn't touch slot games for a month when I try to play and win big at that particular time. I do play on 3 different casino at that time with a day interval and get same good result. This is why I use a month for period of activity on ths experiment.Quote from: Gozie51 on January 04, 2023, 08:23:27 PMI don't think being inactive was the reason you won the other time when you came back so don't think this is a come back strategy.

You won when it was luck for you to win and your winning stroke reduced because you are running out of luck.Please don't get me wrong. I'm not doing this experiment as an strategy for my future gameplay but rather just to answer question on my mind about the subject that I'm going research. I know exactly hw gambling works cause I play for more than 7 years mate. This is just a fun experiment for my own satisfaction. I included my name on the title to imply that this is personal and not to influence anyone.Quote from: Wexnident on January 05, 2023, 03:48:04 AMA question though, is there a reason for choosing the cycle? 2 weeks for a playtest of winning big seem too long, that is unless you're measuring the time it takes to get that big win after that instance of break. Good question. I assume long period since I'm not expecting that I will win in short time but you are right that I will stop when I hit the target big win within the 14 days period. 2 weeks is just my maximum duration to play this experiment due to my current budget size. I'm now temporary locking the thread and give you an update once the experiment commence. Thanks guys for appreciation.",
