All you have to do is to download Electrum, verify the PGP signature and import your seed phrase and you will be able to spend your coins if you want.If you do not have it, then you can go for the hard drive to see if it would work or not. But I think it would work.As Findingnemo commented already, you suppose to backup your seed phrase, it is very important and it will be helpful in this kind of situation.",

You can't change the seed phrase. A different seed phrase gives you completely different addresses. Do you mean you created a new wallet with a customized seed phrase and you moved all the fund to the new wallet? If so, you need the seed phrase of the new wallet or its file and if you have none of them, there is no way to recover your wallet.",

Is the seed phrase on the Electrum wallet on old laptop the same as the seed phrase on Electum wallet on new laptop? You need to answer this in a way it would be clear for us to understand.If the seed phrase are not the same, you need the backup of the seed phrase of the Electrum wallet on the new laptop to recover your wallet. If it is the same seed phrase, you can go for the hard drive and see if you can recover your wallet with the Electrum on the hard drive.",

If you don't remember the password and it's not complicated, you may be able to brute-force it. If you can't do so and you don't have the seed phrase, there is no way to recover the wallet.",
