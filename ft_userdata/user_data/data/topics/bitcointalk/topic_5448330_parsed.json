It should be mentioned that for those who wish to fulfill the minimum requirements for a possible airdrop, the commission costs will amount to about $20 per wallet. If you decide to perform more interactions on the zkSync Era network, accordingly, your costs will be higher, since the commission in this network is not much less than in the Ethereum network.",

Optimism and Arbirum gas were very low but if you want to interact with Zksync then you have to pay 2$-4$for every transaction you made. bridge to Zksync will also charge more than 15$. Airdrop can be big and hopefully at least 4 digits, but you have to make interaction with mainnet first and become an early supporter.There are 5 big project which can give airdrop to their community. Some has already deployed their token and there is tokonomics where they mention allocation for community and i think we should not miss them if we afford.1: ZKsync Era Mainnet2: Starknet3: Layerzero4: Arbitrum Nova5: SuiWE have to Bridge to mainnet, swap in dapps, perform minimum 5 transaction, provide liquidity and remove, mint nft, join discord and twitter, jjoin crew and mint Galxe oat if available. we should do one transaction every week because some time they make rule that first and last transaction there should be one week gap. if we follow these simple strategy i hope every one will be eligible for their airdrop",

I doubt it's gonna be a year til comes out.  Airdrop could come in around 6 months or so at the earliest imho.  Latest would prolly be around the holidays on December?  Dunno...  It's just it seems like it's gon a be good year for crypto and project devs might not want to miss out on the opportunity.Anyway, another possible airdrop from a project in zkSync is SyncSwap.  Not sure how much they money raised from investors but SyncSwap's TVL is at 68m USD rn...  Increased by around 130% in a week.  Something's up.  :/",

So trade, lend and buy NFTs and you should get the air drop. It's better to be early than late so that we are sure that we are eligible just in case there are airdrops that will be conducted by the team. I'm not only sure if it's worth the wait and effort as some airdrop hunters of the past projects are complaining about the high fees when interacting with the platform and some of them spend more money in the process.This is the same as playing with gambling because there is no guarantee that we will be qualified and there is no guarantee that the projects will be doing an airdrop. Again like gambling, it will be better to expect less and interact only with the project because you are genuinely interested and curious about them.",

Many thought that it is going to happen last month after a series of tweets from some well-known projects in crypto but that was the time when they launched Era. I made transactions in the bridge twice and did some transactions in their test net. Maybe I should only trade and then of course use Era for better chances of being qualified. We still have nearly a year to do these tasks. That is a long period of time but that time the market will be in a bull run so this one should not be missed.",

People like riding the hype. Airdrop guides are massively increased after the ARB airdrop. There are so many speculations on airdrops nowadays since project owners doesn't like in spoiling the fun by giving out the requirements in order to join their possible airdrop. Most of the airdrops nowadays are not even sure, It's mostly an undetermined news. I personally have tried participating in several airdrops last year and some in this year and unfortunately I haven't got any profitable reward yet. I also missed ARB which is a disappointment. Today I don't really anticipate much on airdrop as I realized that most of those airdrops are just speculations from the public and those \"influencers\".",

Even real users don't use on-chain transactions weekly. Many people simply buy and hold and they only make on-chain transactions for buying or selling. With users who have long term approach, they are not to actively on-chain.Requirements can be monthly, quarterly and not like weekly as you told.Quote from: tvplus006 on April 17, 2023, 10:58:58 AMI think there will be many more disappointments waiting for you when you see once Layerzero, zkSync, Starknet and Arbitrum Nova generously distributing airdrop. I believe that it is necessary to perform at least a minimum of interactions with these networks in order not to experience Fomo later.I will try to prepare it by myself but only do it like bi-weekly or monthly. I will wait for Gwei to be cheap enough to do on-chain transactions because if it is my main tasks for potential airdrop, I don't want to spend to much cost for transaction fee.In addition, I will filter good tokens to swap on-chain and hold them 2 or 4 weeks, then swap back again to ETH to enjoy a little bit profit from swapping. It can be used for my transaction fee too.",

Ethereum will be crazy expensive. Use something like Polygon, I think it was around $2-3 to bridge to ZkSync lite.Then you need to pay like $1 per address you want to spend from, don’t know why.
