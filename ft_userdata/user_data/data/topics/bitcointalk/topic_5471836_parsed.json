  "content": "This is related to a stuck tx issue I posted about that got moved to a different forum so I will make this post more specific to the Mycelium wallet.I am trying to confirm the derivation path that mycelium uses for getting the private keys for ethereum wallets, and more specifically when you have created multiple ethereum wallets.When I try and use a standard derivation path on metamask or MEW only the very first eth address matches, and the rest of them do not.I have also tried the iancoleman tool as well.Thank you for any help or anyone who can point me in the right direction.",

Only difference between ours is one less zero, idk if it makes a difference. Quote from: libert19 on October 28, 2023, 04:21:40 AMQuote from: kstunna86 on October 27, 2023, 11:28:11 PMOk thank you for highlighting that setting. Didn't know that was in there.  It seems that my derivation path for the specific wallet is:m/44'/60'/22'/0/0or the very first eth address I created is m/44'/60'/0'/0/0Using the 44/60/0/0/0 one again only nets me the first correct address, and all the others are different. Ok, do this. Go on MEW wallet website, import your mnemonic, add this derivation path without quotes, \"m/44'/60'/22'/0\" — select it and the first address you will see there will of your mycellium wallet.",

Only difference between ours is one less zero, idk if it makes a difference.Not much of a difference if the reader knows the BIP44 standard which describes each level of the derivation path.The extra zero is for the 'address_index' if going from seed to private key/address.Link: github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#user-content-Path_levelsThis is quite technical for newbies so I've just instructed him to change the \"account\" in BIP39 tool accordingly where he already successfully derived the address of \"Ethereum 1\".The path you've given him should be correct without a doubt if it's his \"Ethereum 23\" wallet.because as I've mentioned, each of those ETH wallets in the 'accounts' tab are derived with successive 'account_index'.",
