By using a seed phrase which was generated in a hot wallet on an online machine, and stored for an unknown amount of time on the same online machine, then the seed phrase has still been exposed to the internet and any malware on OP's device, even if he now deletes it from his device and sets up a watch only wallet instead.

In fact, you might even expose yourself to more risk if you are going to have to import your seed phrase in plain text back on to that online computer every time you want to make a transaction, as opposed to having it stored encrypted on the same computer in your wallet file. If you want the real security that a watch only wallet brings you, then the seed phrase/private keys need to have been generated securely in the first place.Quote from: Lucius on November 28, 2022, 02:35:16 PMI just suggested him a completely free option so that he can sleep somewhat peacefully, but he should definitely think about a relatively cheap investment in a hardware wallet, or even better an airgapped device.Yeah, this.

Quote from: Ultegra134 on December 01, 2022, 07:49:38 PMBuying a new computer was already on the schedule, but honestly, completely isolating it isn't always possible, and in my case, it probably isn't, because a functioning laptop is always handy. I understand what you are saying. Dedicating a laptop just for a bitcoin cold storage is not for everyone. In that case, keep checking for a better promotion to get your hands on a good hardware wallet. The current one from Trezor isn't special compared to what we had a few days ago. But if the price suits you, go ahead.",
