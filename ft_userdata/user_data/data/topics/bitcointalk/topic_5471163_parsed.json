Well we only hope for a better tomorrowIf the average Nigerian can’t survive it, we wouldn’t all have been alive to witness another year like this. This has been happening for a long time now and will continue for years to come. I am yet to know what causes the price of foodstuffs and household items to increase. At the end of every season, I thought things should always come down  since new items will be arriving the following year but in Naija the reverse is the case. What pains me more now will be the scarcity of fuel that will come in 1 and half months to come from now. It has always been like that, I pray there’s a difference this year which at the same time I feel they won’t be any.",

Well we only hope for a better tomorrowIt is a regular thing in Nigeria and is entirely driven by the forces of demand and supply. There is usually high demands around the December period and this is what is responsible for the high prices. You know Nigeria do not even have price control against that I'd effective. So people inflate prices as a result of the rush. The average Nigerian will survive just the way they have been surviving. It is just a matter of adjusting because there will always be commodity for any level of income.",

Well we only hope for a better tomorrowThe main causes of the high price rate of commodities in Nigeria at the end of the year include increased demand during festival season, supply chain distribution due to transportation challenges, and seasonal fluctuations affecting agricultural products, which can be controlled. For instance, companies in Nigeria reduce the amount of goods and commodities they produce at the end of the year, and that is the time when demand is high, which is also applicable to the petroleum sector. The main factors that cause the high cost of commodities are solutions and mechanisms to control this, which include improving infrastructure, promoting local production, and also implementing an effective supply chain. Also,  this will be done by the government, which controls the fuel price, and it should be enough to supply various parts of the country.",

You are right; the Nigerian government can control all these but they need seriousness and time because the damage has been made already and to providr solution take so many stages and steps, and we citizens need to contribute as well.Nigerian government has abandoned one of the easiest and less expensive means of transportation which is through train; now that petroleum products are expensive, coal might be affordable and the train transportation is safer than road. If we have been using both of the for long, the government would have alternative ways to provide proper solution to the problem.Nevertheless, if our Nigerian Refineries can start to refine crude oil, all these hardship will be reduced as the price of petroleum products will reduce which will have effect in almost all prices of goods.",

The price of things going up during this period is not something that is happening only in Nigeria, because it's normal even in the normal business sense, because once demand is high and supply is low, then the price of things will eventually sky rocket and that's the case with this period, because at this festive period the demands of things tend to be on a different scale that's slightly higher than the average and this result to cost of goods and Commodity and I believe it's happening every where but since surviving is actually the feature of humans that you cant be altered, I think we are good and we will survive just like the previous times we have been doing.As for a better economic, we can only hope that we get that soon because if it's all the necessary resources for a country that actually possess this, I think Nigeria has all but the issue is just mismanagement of funds and I think until we tackle this issue as country, there will be always be a thorn in flesh we can't get rid off.",

But however there are most people who have intentionally decided to increase there items just to take advantage of the current situation perhaps I blame the government of  that one because it was supposed to be there responsibility to enforce a price control measures in other to stop people taking advantage of the poor. Things that use to be very cheap has now become a Hortcake for most people to afford.",

At this point they seems to lost hope because it's very hard for an average man to survive or woman to survive with at least 50k per month.Again, for those waiting for month December to come first should at least start buying their Xmas things now maybe it could reduce expenses because a bag of rice (50kg) currently is sold for 50 to 60k and I am very sure by first week of December it would cost 90 to 100k , that is why it's very wise to start projecting some of your Xmas things now.",

Well we only hope for a better tomorrowThings more than this happen, and we people survive them, so even with this one, it is just a matter of time before it passes. However, things get high based on how people demand it. During that period of time, if the supply is slow and people that need such things are plenty, then definitely things will change. However, if you look at it, you will understand that companies in Nigeria are now producing less of these things because people that demand them are plenty, so you can see that since the supply in the market is slow, people who get these commodities will double the price because they only have a few people that have them in their stores. And the reason why the supply is low is due to PMS, which is high. Suppliers are unable to push out goods for the people that will buy them, so the less they supply, only a few people get them, and it's a high cost. And all these problems can be solved by the government.Quote from: Jegileman on October 22, 2023, 12:05:46 AMIf the average Nigerian can’t survive it, we wouldn’t all have been alive to witness another year like this. This has been happening for a long time now and will continue for years to come.You can’t say it will continue happening for years to come, mate. This is one of the reasons we cannot get to solve our country's problems. We are the ones to pray for a better Nigeria, but at the same time, we don’t do that. We always have things that cannot be sorted out in the country, which is wrong for any problem that happens in a country. If you see that the government doesn't solve it, they don't want to solve it. If not, there is no problem in Nigeria right now that our government cannot survive. But what is happening is that the kind of leaders we have, most of them are there to make more money, not to do better things for us, and that's why you will see that things are going the other way.QuoteI am yet to know what causes the price of foodstuffs and household items to increaseThe reason why things get high in the country is obvious, man. The main reason why things get high today in Nigeria, I will say, is the PMS price. If you look at it, it’s been happening before every end of the year. You will see that the PMS price gets high, and you will see that everything, not only good stuff but even clothing material, gets high at that time. So the reason why Nigerians are panicking this time is that the price of PMS got double because of the subsidy removal since early 2023, so we are not used to it, and that is why every single thing in the market gets double in price because suppliers use the PMS to supply goods to the market.",

We all need to try hard to make things better.Sharing money for people as dem dey plan in the name of cash transfer na just waste of resources. No sane country dey do that kind thing to alleviate suffering. I don't know where Nigeria dey get that kind useless and unfruitful idea and policies. Some people go hide under that to enrich themselves while the suffering continue hitting the poor masses. Use the money for something meaningful like subsidizing food items and implement policies wey go make people comfortable. But all hope is not lost yet since we get God, we continue dey survive.",

Tinubu regime now again he just remove subsidy for fuel everything just increase price like crypto because without fuel foodstuffs and other things cannot be circulated in the country i think he will be among things that make things cost in the country because even if you went to the makers and buy something and you complain that the product is cost they will say fuel as increased price, and fuel is among things that make the country great because without fuel there will be no transportation, And in order for all of this to be affordable the price of gasoline must be reduced, as it has risen by about 640# per litre now, am very sure if fuel reduce price all this foodstuffs and household items will decrease too and the country will be more better again.",

But come to think of it, price of goods will not just increase there's something wrong with Nigeria economy.Firstly if government can make a conducive space for our marketers I think price of things will subside. I came across a video on arise news where some market women where  seeking assist from the government, calling the government to creat a condusive environment where they can grow and get loan. I sure say everybody dey stay for naija, you fit testify say everyday price of goods dey increase, why?Transportation: transportation na the major problem wey our marketers dey face even we as individual. As transportation don dey expensive like this marketers go need to increase price of goods to stand their business. Demand and scarcity: the population rate for naija don pass be careful, this thing wey you talk no dey for only Christmas season e dey for Easter season too. I don observe say every festive season price of goods dey increase because na the season wey celebration dey, every family wan celebrate. Let's take rice for example, half of naija population go cook rice on Christmas day and marketers dey very trickish sometimes wetin you wan buy that season no dey rampad na only one person dey sell am due to high demand, na so the only person wey get that product go add price 5× for that product.

For the cabals that are benefiting from the continually dormancy and dilapidation of the refineries in the Nigeria would do anything within their strength to perpetuate the status quo just for them to keep their benefits flowing while the timid masses that would have been benefiting from the productions of those refineries if revamp and maintained just keep suffering.There are cabals that are enlarging their pockets through the exportation of refined crude oil that was supposed to be done in the home country where the material is located and not until these cabals die a natural death these problems of increase in fuel price leading to constant increase in food and  prices of other materials will not end. They just keep making promises each year with no corresponding actions to promises made.

It’s something that happens always in this country, so we are still expecting it to happen during this festive period. All this is caused by poor management. The government should have people that are going to regulate the prices of food items, but they allow everyone to sell at individual prices, so the more the demand for a food item is increasing, then everyone will keep on increasing their prices. If there are people monitoring them, then it shouldn’t be like that. The government should be blamed for things like this happening, but we should also blame ourselves. We the poor are not trying to help each other, any little opportunity everyone is having, they will want to miss use it, which is very bad, the food items might not increase money from where they are getting them, but due to festival period, they will want to add money to make more profit, which is very wrong.
