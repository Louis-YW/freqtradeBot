Just simple, go to electrum.org and download it, 1. after downloading go to wallet and select import private key like picture below: 2. in the next step, you have to be careful, because you don't indirectly insert the private key, you have to look the tab info how to import the private key following the address, 3. add p2pkh:L5m9u72Js3FiGt63dki5w3rf5ay4DLCvhGewFagHm16B6VV51ye4 on colomn like picture below;4. And next, create password then, wallet already to use.And important thing to do all step (step 1 - 4) above is do it OFFLINE or use the PC without connecting to internet.",

Knowing the difference between importing and sweeping is also important, see Importing Vs Sweeping Private Keys; What you need to know.Importing means, you'll get access to your original wallet (which you are importing) = you'll make your original wallet accessible in Electrum. Sweeping means, you'll create a transaction sending your coins from your (paper) wallet to your preferred Electrum wallet = coins are transferred.",

This is kind of off-topic to this discussion but I just want to make something clearer about this which I know you know. This may depend on the wallet, on Electrum, replace-by-fee is set as default on the desktop version, while also it is default on the mobile version except you mark the transaction as final. Which means replace-by-fee is set by default on Electrum, but this might be different on another wallet just like you meant.",

Offline for signing transaction while online for making PBST (which is the unsigned) transaction which is signed on offline wallet, and broadcasted online using the online watch-only wallet.

Use Knoppix or Tails for instance, or any other distribution that comes with Electrum pre-installed.Unplug your internet cable. Close the curtains. Reboot your computer and start up from that DVD. Don't enter any wireless connection password. Keep it offline.Start Electrum.

Check the fees, check the amount, check all destination addresses (character by character).If all is okay, sign the transaction. Copy it back to your USB stick.Turn off the computer.
