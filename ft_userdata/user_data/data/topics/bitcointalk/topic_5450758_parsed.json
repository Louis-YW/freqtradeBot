I think is just last year ending i began to put efforts so don't judge me by merits because many of us as we started has long abandoned this forum for long because there no mentorship and guidance, Bro na all this experience make me come here dey talk oo so no just reason my matta, you self fit put hand increase am for me Â  at least if you show me love e no go pass you big man.

HeheThe reason I posted it is because I do not wish other people to start creating advising topics. I did that in the past on the main boards in beginners and help and reputation board. But I was newbie and showing to people that says it is difficult to rank on Bitcointalk, and that only established members are sharing the smerits, that they are sharing the smerits within themselves. I brought such topic up to let them (the upcoming newbies) know that they can do it too.",

Many of us started on the same lane as well before we get to this present position wey we d now. Anyway all those things happen to us based on sae we be newbie and we no get any mentor or guidance for the forum. Peso mind then na altcoin bounties na where better dey pass(wey be sae na lie). Peso no d even focus on building em account. Wetin peso know na to make that 10 posts per week that's it, to the end of the bounty campaign. One thing I find out for this forum and I keep telling newbie be sae, you go fit get to any level wey you think or dream of someday. Just be patient. There is no hurry sae you go reach to a particular rank as soso time. Anyway, in case if you d among those wey d think sae them don spend years for the forum and they are still a junior member or member rank, no try feel bad or give up on the forum sae nothing come out for you for the forum. Wetin I go tell you be sae make you try find out where you are getting it wrong. Whether you d among those wey dÂ  focus on altcoin bounties especially without putting much efforts on building their account on making quality post. Whatever the case may be, there is still hope for you to start afresh now to be the best version of yourself for the forum",
