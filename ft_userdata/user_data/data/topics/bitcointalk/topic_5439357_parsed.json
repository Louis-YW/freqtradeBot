Moderators may just want to prevent this kind of thing from becoming a future trend among forum users because at the same time they need to be neutral towards all users.Anyways the main purpose of the thread wasn't about donations but somehow yahoo posted his bitcoin address there (I didn't follow the progress of the thread) which then made mod ask him to delete via pm.",

Please do not send me any funds. If someone is well off and can afford it, i'm happy to accept help, but I do not want anyone suffering to help me. I will make what I have work regardless of the circumstances.Does he ask for help directly to users here. of course not, only members have the sincerity to donate to @yahoo62278, it is their right as long as they want to give, without any element of coercion. Is not it.Try to think positive, @yahoo62278 one of the campaign managers here, he has hired many members, not a mistake, for those who want to make a small donation for him $10-$50 for the suffering he experienced.Do we need proof @yahoo62278 in the hospital, what is it for. did he ask for a full donation for his heart surgery to the members here, he just told his life story, believe it or not it depends on the members themselves.You donate will be calculated later for kindness and if you don't donate it will not be counted later, you do good all in return, regardless of everything you say.You give, it's your right and you don't want to give your rights, everyone here is an adult, Of course you can think about what is good and what is bad before giving something to others, try to be professional and think positively.",

It's really not about providing sufficient proof of illness or whatnot. I don't know if you're trying to make a point of something with this thread but it's a good example of what would be wrong with allowing begging threads because everyone would then try them for all afflictions major and minor; real or fantasy. It would then become the oppression Olympics with people feigning all sorts of things just to try solicit sympathy donations. Quote from: Ucy on February 10, 2023, 05:12:09 PMI think yahoo deserves the necessary help he/she needs to survive the health problems as long as its true. He is a longtime member who has supported this forum in his own way.The money involved isn't a small one. Extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof  and once enough proofs are provided the forum must rally around one of its own to help him/her survive. Life is worth more than the amount he/she is asking for. He could also be helped to get the desired treated/cured at the fraction of the cost or free of charge. Nothing is impossible It will be really sad to see another important member vanish just like that. From his own words he doesn't seem to need the money and he has health insurance. From what he said recently it seems the donations were essentially just to cover his doordash expenses:Quote from: yahoo62278 on February 09, 2023, 05:38:11 AMWhat you are is 100% impulsive and pathetic. If you are going to try and throw shade at a user, you should at a minimum, read the whole thread. Just a suggestion. If you had, you would see that I have not had a heart transplant at this point. I did have an almost 1 month stay in the hospital. Jan 4th-Jan 29th 2023. The initial post also said that money donated would be used to help with expenses such as food, gas, hotel rooms, or anything else. All of which is what the donations helped with. I was not on a special diet in the hospital as I never held water or showed any signs of swelling in any of my extremities. With that being said, I used doordash for 2 meals a day most times. Roughly 30-35$ per meal each day. That's 60-70$ a day for food for 25 days. Do the math and that comes to 1500-1750$ just for food alone. Well above any amount that was donated. Noone begged the community for anything and in fact I told many users not to send anything. Not that I owe you any answers but I didn't want you to think I didn't see your post. Quote from: Ucy on February 10, 2023, 05:12:09 PMBegging (also panhandling) is the practice of imploring others to grant a favor, often a gift of money, with little or no expectation of reciprocation.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeggingYou might not like the term but that's a perfect definition of what the thread essentially was. OK hilariousandco, I liked your judgments and I respect them and this one too. I just truely hope it's OK.By the way, whenever I find tough issues in the forum I sometimes check your post history to see if you have contributed. Your contributions are typically fair and readable. Thanks",

It was active for veryyy  a long time until yesterday.This why I ask what exact cause about what happened. If the user needs treatment like this, he should  be able to post and ask for donations. I completely against closure if he he provides the documents.Therefore, I ask if the closure. Is it lack of evidence?If I need some of these treatment it will be cool if I will be able to ask donation here:Do I  need to provide supporting documents and it will  be ok then?I'm not going to speak for all mods, just myself. And my voice has no more value than others.Giving documents or invoices about a heavy operation doesn't prove anything. Everything can be easily faked.As a mod or just a member, I don't want to have personal and sensitive information about other members. And above all, I (we ?) am not a doctor and how can I judge if this or that disease is eligible for donations ?Heart transplantation. OK ?Cancer. OK ?Amputation. OK ?Sex change. OK ?Breast implant ?My dog needs surgery. Is it OK ?Where is the limit? What if you are rich in a poor country or poor in a rich country ? What do we do? Do we have to ask for a tax declaration as well ?If you want to talk about your health problems... why not. If people are touched by your story, they will contact you by PM to ask you for an address to make a donation. That's all you can hope. Because if we open this Pandora's box, there will be abuse.",
