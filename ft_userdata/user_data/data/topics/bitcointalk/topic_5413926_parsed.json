  "content": "Regulators have been paying close attention to the development of the \"De-Fi\" space, especially when the Terra/LUNA implosion left many investors \"rekt\" in the process. After the Tornado.Cash mixing protocol was sanctioned, the US' OFAC agency told American citizens would be able to withdraw their funds if they'd provide them with personally-identifiable information. That makes me wonder if \"De-Fi\" platforms would be required to comply with KYC/AML laws in order to prevent being shutdown for good (they are hosted on centralized servers anyways). I believe governments (especially the US government) will be on developers' tails to force them to make \"De-Fi\" platforms that are regulatory-compliant. If successful, every \"decentralized\" lending platform or even \"decentralized\" exchange would ask for users' identities, greatly undermining crypto/Blockchain tech's core value proposition (which is eliminating the middleman).Will this be the future of \"decentralized finance\"? If not, why? Knowing that most people prefer convenience on top of decentralization, I'm afraid \"De-Fi's\" future is not as bright as many thought it would be. Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

Thanks in advance. There will always be future for the defi. To be honest almost all of defi were actually centralized finance. I think that people will always be falled into the word of defi. I think that if you are talking about how defi can exist in the crypto and it has proven if defi already exist since a few years ago but the question is whether the regulation will be hurting defi or not. This must become the main concern caused by regulators are always pushing defi to be compliance with regulation. Remember that some defi that already taken down by regulators in the past. that proves that if defi was not actually decentralized like what already mentioned.",

It will happen if there isn't any innovation done to remove them from the way. So many factors they can try to reach to make Defi comply like the CEO and the server of the defi platform.  What I think defi need is a platform that we can install as app on phones or computers to make it more decentralized.  But what will protect us from a platform that will likely scam us as well?",

After all, they can only censor frontend and not the smart contract itself. That's quite incorrect, censoring on the smart contract level is possible and plausible. If we take a look at Solend past histories, whereas there is passed governance that makes an attempt to take over someone's account, I don't think DeFi communities would fight back if they have government/authority pressure. So it is somewhat possible. I know it is too generalized, but if there is significant pressure, the developer and some community will likely just follow the regulation.",

If you start a project and you doxed your identity, that project is never a truly decentralized project. Whatever you do with that, you are powerful person that can be caught by police, receive request to halt your project and so on.

We pay fees on every transaction on defi, such as a swap or exchange, because we don't need to pay huge fees like in decentralised, but if a third party is involved here who is obviously using defi, it will be a confusing decision for us.

After all, in order to register another token, one can remain anonymous and do anything. Everyone remembers the actions of Sushi's creator, for example.

Same thing I was going to say. I don't know if there are Ce-Fi's too other than De-Fi but if there are then KYC/AML policies can only be applied to them and not to De-Fi's but if let say it will be applied, then that De-Fi service will changed its brand and will join the Ce-Fi category.There are big scams which had happened on De-Fi but I think some of those scammers have been caught out and the money have been recovered. See? It's still possible for them to be hunted even without those KYC and AML thing. Even if the service is decentralized, the governments are not ignoring them but they still do care for the possible harm that it could dealt in the innocent users.",

These are my thoughts as well, if we're going to use those platforms and still have to go through KYC policies then what it's the point of DeFi at all? I might as well just use a centralized exchange which has more volume and which has great reputation so the chances I get scammed become very low, so this is something that DeFi platforms must resist and if they don't then I wouldn't be surprised if they lose a great deal of the people that use their services.",
