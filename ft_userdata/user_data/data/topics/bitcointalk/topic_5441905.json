  "content": "There is a lot fear right i do understood this becouse average person dont look behind the scenes.I'd like to explain something here: Central bank do rate hikes it Will make the people who borrowing money to pay higher % of their loans for example mortgage owners.Now people like to correlate \"rate hike situation \" with bear Market and falling of the assets prices.Yes If central bank and Fed start this process of \"rate hikes\" it Will make the prices fall like gold sp500 btc and crypto in the beginning becouse it's just profit taking and big sell off.Now we the intrsest are higher coused by rate hikes.What it also means is that we have even more capital on the markets the Lower we go the bigger will be the buying pressure. In other words the money cost more the money is more expensive now the rich indviduals want to put their money to instutions and instutions Will pay them higher return becouse \"rate hikes\" coused the end of the cheap money.Now the big hedge funds have more money then Ever before the rich indviduals now give out to banks and instutions their money becouse intrsets rates are higher.Now the hedge funds and instutions have so much money so they will use that money to buy up all the assets for cheap.So we have situation when we have bull Market in the economic downturn.When everything closing down people getting laid off and business closures and people struggle paying bills and struggle with mortgage payments the sp500 and crypto do some rally. Do not hope for the bear market there is just too much money on the Markets the buying pressure is too strong becouse big instutions buying now Even If they dont buy all one at time they do DCA but it has impact over the assets prices becouse the money they have it's huge ammount.We have the situation in the world when most of the money is in the markets now and Market Will rally a lot we Will see many Green days and a lot shorts gets liqutated.People try to guess the top becouse they been told we are on the bear Market but Actually we have bull Market and also the altcoins season.And i say this things becouse the money Investment capital and btc and exchangers and Fed aswell the wall Street it's the topic what i know about.I decided to enlight you guys and make some things clear becouse i read so much speculation what is not based on any of the fundamentals or facts.I Do look for the facts and fundamentals",

Therefore, try to divide the topic into main headings and under them your thoughts.Unfortunately, economics does not interact like chemistry or engineering laws, but is very variable.Without a division of wealth, saving and investment, the economy will always play against you, and therefore if inflation occurs, you will be the loser, and the same thing if a recession occurs, your financial situation will be good in the normal situation of the market, but even then, when you have surplus money, you will either invest it in a useless investment or waste it in luxuries .",

Elon Musk was in the news for having lost \"$100 billion\" in 2022.QuoteElon Musk's net worth dropped $100 billion this year. Here's why.Elon Musk's net worth has dropped to an estimated $195.6 billion, according to Forbes. Musk's net worth dropped on Tuesday, hitting its lowest point this year. This is the second time since Oct. 1, 2021, that his net worth has dipped below $200 billion, except for a brief drop to $199 billion in May of this year, Forbes reports. His net worth is still astronomical – and enough to solidify his spot as richest man in the world — but Musk's worth was once larger. In January, he had an estimated worth of $304.2 billion, Forbes says. At that time, his worth had increased about $32.6 billion as Tesla stock soared. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-net-worth-decreased-100-million-tesla-stock-sold-twitter-acquisition-richest-man-in-the-world/There were other billionaires in the news post 2020 for having their entire fortunes wiped out trading stocks and other assets.Even Warren Buffett was unhappy with stocks in 2022.QuoteWarren Buffett rips Wall Street for turning the stock market into ‘a gambling parlor’Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett lambasted Wall Street for encouraging speculative behavior in the stock market, effectively turning it into a “gambling parlor.”Buffett, 91, spoke at length during his annual shareholder meeting Saturday about one of his favorite targets for criticism: investment banks and brokerages.“Wall Street makes money, one way or another, catching the crumbs that fall off the table of capitalism,” Buffett said. “They don’t make money unless people do things, and they get a piece of them. They make a lot more money when people are gambling than when they are investing.”Buffett bemoaned that large American companies have “became poker chips” for market speculation. He cited soaring use of call options, saying that brokers make more money from these bets than simple investing.https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/30/warren-buffett-rips-wall-street-for-turning-the-stock-market-into-a-gambling-parlor.htmlI think if you want to make a case for financial institutions not losing money post 2020.What you would be describing is financial institutions who are known for hoarding large quantities of gold.",

      "body": "You're probably wrong. If there is a hike in interest rate, instead of having more capital, the opposite is probably true. Credit has a vital role in the business sector. Raising the interest rate means companies are discouraged to borrow money because the interest is high. As a result, finances are limited. Therefore, purchases and spending and investments are curbed. In other words, economic activities slow down. While it results in the prices of goods and services falling down, it could also mean businesses are not anymore facing a huge demand. Cutting of jobs might, therefore, ensue. That's why it is recommended to reduce spending and save money during these times.",

      "body": "I think the Central Bank is actually raising interest rates to keep inflation down. I don't want to think complicated or anything like that. because we have to know that during the Covid-19 pandemic the government continued to print money to distribute to the people at that time who were forced to stay at home (isolation/quarantine). and these steps are taken so that the flow of the economy continues even though the pandemic is hitting. and these steps are indeed effective. but the problem happened afterwards. that is too much money circulating in the community so that it becomes one of the causes of inflation starting to occur. and the Central Bank is only trying to pull back the excess supply of circulating money by raising interest rates. so that people are interested in depositing their money in the bank. and this move is also considered pretty good so far. because the rate of inflation began to decline. so that gradually interest rates will be lowered little by little. But the impact of raising interest rates can indeed result in a recession or not. but I think the economic conditions are now starting to recover. so I think the government is considered quite good in dealing with the current economic crisis. although maybe in some countries there are those that don't work. and it goes back to governance in the country itself. It is the level of corruption and the like that actually makes it difficult for a country to recover from an economic crisis.",

Additionally, while there may be a lot of money in the markets, it's important to remember that there are always risks and uncertainties that can impact investment outcomes.",

It would be nice, if you try to summarize your thoughts in a few sentences.Do you mean that there will be a bull market despite the interest hikes? Which market are you talking about? The stock market, the FOREX market or the crypto market? Your opinion is yours. We just have to wait until the end of 2023 and see whether or not your were right.Statistics about the German economy are showing that Germany might be entering a small recession. The same news are coming from the USA.You can't have a recession in the economy and bull runs on the financial markets at the same time. This doesn't make any sense.",
