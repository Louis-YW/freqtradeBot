Did we have less trouble with millions of worthless jpgs, that such madness was brought to bitcoin network? Honestly, we didn't need BRC-20 token functionality here. We were good with ETH and polygon for these dying NFT markets. Now the bitcoin network will remain clogged forever unless these things are taken down completely. Someone is saying innovative, what Innovation you are seeing here other than stupidity?",

But everyone who has been against progress proven to be wrong in history so I am going to just shut up and wait for it to either solve the issue it created, or just go dead like everything else that got hyped for a while.So far in the crypto world we have seen so many things that got so much hype and all of them died down eventually, I bet that this will be another one of them and nothing different without a doubt. I know that many people are trying to make money from it currently but I bet that they are not going to be doing that for many years, its just these few months and then it will be gone and nobody will ever think about it again.",

People forgot that if ordinal inscription was only making the bitcoin blockchain become even slower. The fees will never go down again for sure. Ordinals shall have used L2 blockchain rather than peg with BTC. It's only making people tired to use btc due to the unstable fees.",
