It takes a lot of time to login and check all the wallets you mentioned, a person has to work continuously for about 15-20 days to finish checking them.QuoteIs there anybody who could help me? If I get bitcoin, I will give you tip.Checking them is a long process. But what if there are no bitcoins after checking all the wallets? Then all his efforts will be in vain. So you have to offer salary to do this work. Since you have confidence they are around 4 bitcoins it won't hurt to spend your $2k on it.  If you offer $2k I can do it. And you can keep them in escrow.",

The OP's purpose is not to check these addresses' balance too often, it's my guess. Depends on the purpose, Electrum or Bitcoin Core full node can be used.With 86k private keys ~ addresses, we can split it to 9 parts and check each of 9 parts. Do you think it can avoid Dos-protection and won't be too slow and time-consuming?",

This way if any transactions exist it would find them as it downloads the blockchain. No re-scanning the entire change for 86k+ addresses. Also if something happens it will pick up where it left off.
