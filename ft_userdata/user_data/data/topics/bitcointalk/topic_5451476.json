PS, anyone that can report this to a moderator should please do, or show me how.Thank YouUPDATE:    I was able to contact the MEXC Twitter handle, and they confirmed that there will be a listing on the 9th, and also showed a new tweet they made today;                                                                                                                                                       A: https://imgbb.com/bgM2xvZ        B: https://ibb.co/0XrxKX9                                  seems, I was worried for nothing, But that does not confirm them to be legit without doubts, So here's hoping for the best.New Update  Chart  https://poocoin.app/tokens/0x4bc99635f7cd965069ae7142d66784ea518995e3It turned out to be a scam after all, a coin dump kind. its barely a day and the chart is this way1: https://ibb.co/tx7n9K2          2: https://ibb.co/zSJB4fwThe question is why even list if they were gonna dump it this Bad",

(The delay was not any demand by community it's just made up. I followed the last scam closely, everything made sense until it didn't, just gradually shifting the launch date one good reason and another until they ran)",
