  "content": "Introduction: Welcome back to the Cypher devlog! This week, we've made significant progress on block generation, database integration, and the foundations of our messaging system. In this post, we'll discuss our recent achievements and provide a glimpse into the next steps for the development of our decentralized live-messenger.Block Generation Progress: We've successfully prepared the basic block generation mechanism, which selects 100 transactions for each block and constructs the block from them. For now, the generated blocks won't be shared across the network, as this functionality will be introduced at a later stage of development.MySQL Integration for Block Storage: To ensure reliability and accessibility for developers, we've decided to use a MySQL database for block storage. MySQL is widely used, performant, and has a long track record, making it an ideal choice for our needs. The permanent block storage implementation will be completed once we have achieved proper validator and forger selection.Building the Messaging Foundation: Our next steps involve creating the necessary endpoints for sending and retrieving messages, laying the groundwork for our Proof of Reception Consensus mechanism. We will delve into the details of this mechanism in a future blog post. As a brief overview, messages in Cypher are not sent over the blockchain; instead, they are transmitted through the infrastructure that runs the blockchain. Nodes are rewarded for messages they successfully deliver to the receiver, making the process of sending and receiving messages completely free.Conclusion: This week's progress on block generation, MySQL integration, and messaging infrastructure marks significant advancements in the development of Cypher. As we continue to work on the messaging endpoints and our unique consensus mechanism, we move closer to our goal of revolutionizing communication through a decentralized live-messenger. Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, thank you for your support!",
