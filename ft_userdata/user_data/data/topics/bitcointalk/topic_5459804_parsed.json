  "content": "BlackRock the world's largest asset(10 trillion funds) manager is interested in the Bitcoin Spot ETF. If we check the history of Blackrock track record then they have applied for 575 ETF and only one rejected previously. No one has power to stop Blackrock. I was watching video where one Youtuber claims that whenever the USA wants one country to go up they ask Blackrock to invest and vice versa lThe US is playing double gaming at this stage. At one side SEC Charges on Binance and Coinbase and on the other side SEC are in the favor of approving Blackrock spot ETF. Let go a little deep in this matter. When People Withdraw funds from both these  big exchanges then the trader will use this fund in other sources but the US doesn't want these funds to go off shore (out of the US). Now the US wanted an alternative system for crypto exchange so if anyone wants to invest in btc then instead of using crypto exchange, the alternative way of buying given to these traders. The block rock is looking the part of this plan and it looks like Blackrock has received any green signal from the US Government before applying. Blackrock wants, no exchange to survive in the US and traders choose ETF for investing because if people use exchange then they will withdraw BTC to own wallet(hard or soft) and US have no control on it but if they invest in ETF then then they have full control over it. Pros:If Blackrock is able to launch the Bitcoin ETF successfully, many of its competitors(JP MORGAN, Fidelity and many others) will also apply and then big Banks will also apply. This will increase awareness of BTC among big traders because the stock media will share this Many big traders which are already in the field of stock market and didn't has knowledge of crypto exchange will be able to buy btcHighly chance of btc price pump in the short term. Cons:People will not hold real btc because ETFs could not be called real Bitcoin holders. Etf trader are not holding any btc in their wallet. An ETF is just a contract in the form of paper.If prices increase then these big asset managers can dump the market to stable Price. This will decrease the interest of crypto users. In short the growth in price will be very slow just like goldBitcoin will not remain totally decentralized and the Government will be able to control it.They also said that we will not be bound by the rules of Satoshi which he mentioned in whitepaper that's mean in case of Bitcoin fork they can choose any chain for their price backup. What you think about this? Is Balckrock ETF should be approvedIf it's approved, which platform(Crypto exchange or ETF) will you support and why?",

But i think by launching these ETFs they cannot get all of those users because most of the users had already moved to decentralized exchanges and wallets. when they sued both Binance and coin base then the effected users moved to DEXs. Even when the SVB bank was bankrupted then the customers migrated to use of DEXs. so i do not think there would be left any to attract towards ETFs. but still many stock traders do want to invest in BTC ETFs plus those who are traditional traders and still didn't bought any BTC. Well, let's see what happen i think if Block Rock ETFs got accepted then we might see BTC at around $40k it's just my speculation. Like the yesterday news of XRP only put great positive impact on the market so i think Block Rock ETFs approval deserves to put more impact on the market.",

I understand the cost to mine in 2023 is not as compared of what it was in 2009 however buying ETFs to acquire Bitcoin is stupid in my very honest opinion. If it brings that 1o Trillion Dollars to Bitcoin Marketcap, that will be amazing. If not, it's not that big of a deal. Any big venture can directly buy from OTC like Coinbase and Binance.",

In short, the growth in price will be very slow just like goldBitcoin has been dumped several times but later absorb the pressure and recovered, so even without Bitcoin ETF there is no guarantee that Bitcoin will continue to increase in price without dumping at some juncture, in this case,e is normal. They can manipulate the price by owing Spot ETF but the good news is that the real Bitcoin isn't in their hands.",

ETF are for peoples employment pension funds to be invested in. you know the stash of money they cant touch for 40 years but just dont want it sitting in some bank account losing value due to fiat inflation. putting their pension pots into bitcoin can raise them out of poverty when its time to retire, if done rightQuote from: HONDACD125 on July 14, 2023, 12:17:05 PMBlackRock the world's largest asset(10 trillion funds) manager is interested in the Bitcoin Spot ETF. however even though people scream $10trill company.. that company diversifies its portfolio into hundreds of investments. thus i would say bitcoin would only be a 1-5% of the companies assets. so think about $100b not $10trill being used to buy up bitcoins.. but not all at the same time",

They are very clearly going to reject it just like they've rejected every other BTC ETF proposal. I don't understand why people are so hyped over Blackrock. The head of the SEC hates Bitcoin. This ETF will not get approved. As long as Gensler is head of the SEC there won't be any Bitcoin ETFs. I can't even imagine where you got the idea that the SEC is favoring approving Blackrock's ETF. The only statements the SEC and Gensler have made thus far about that application have been negative. There is no double gaming, the SEC is very anti-Bitcoin and anti-crypto. It is a very obvious single-sided straightforward game they are playing.In terms of the cons:1) Anyone can still own Bitcoin. Only the people who don't want to own Bitcoin but want to use it purely as an investment property will buy the ETF. I don't see any problem in this. Sure none of those people will be 'using' Bitcoin, but it'll still increase adoption of bitcoin as a financial asset, which will increase the price of Bitcoin, which will get more people interested in Bitcoin, which will increase adoption of Bitcoin more generally, including people who want to actually own and use Bitcoin.2) You don't seem to understand what an ETF is. An ETF is not a financial firm trading Bitcoin (and thus being able to dump it whenever they want). An ETF is a firm buying Bitcoin on behalf of their clients. The firm cannot just dump the Bitcoin in the ETF to keep the price stable. The people who invest in the ETF would have to sell their ETF shares for the firm to sell that amount of Bitcoin tied up in the ETF. Has nothing to do with the price appreciation of Gold.3) Don't see how you are going from an ETF existing to Bitcoin not being decentralized and the government controlling it haha. I can't even imagine how you made that leap of fantasy, but an ETF has nothing at all to do with Bitcoin's decentralization or govt controlling it.4) I keep seeing this idea of Blackrock forking Bitcoin. I don't know where this idea comes from. Did Blackrock say something about forking? Regardless, Blackrock has no more nor no less ability to fork Bitcoin than anyone else - meaning sure they can do a useless fork and create an altcoin like anyone can, but nobody can fork Bitcoin away from itself, so I don't see where their fear comes from. Nothing about a financial firm having an ETF has anything to do with being able to fork Bitcoin away from itself.That should pretty much dispell all of your concerns. But anyway, the Blackrock ETF is obviously going to get rejected and there won't be an ETF approved until Gensler is gone from the SEC which is 3-4 years from now so all this talk about ETF's is kinda silly and no different than all the other times people got excited for ETFs over the past five years.",

I didn't say they sifted to DEXs for holding purposes and i also didn't say in the first place that they are using CEXs for holding purposes. They are using CEXs for trading purposes and they will migrate to DEXs for trading purpose also. And only Binance and Coinbase was sued so other CEXs were also working.  And you also asked to which dexs they will turn. There are a lot of dexs such as Bisq, Robosats and peachbitcoin etc. There are many other on the list but these might be enough for your understanding.",

It would be impossible to see them hijack all the nodes and control the majority of the mining power.Quote from: DeathAngel on July 15, 2023, 07:47:53 PMMany people say they don’t want Blackrock anywhere near bitcoin but if they even manage to convince their investors to put 5% of the total value of assets under their stewardship it will do wonders for the bitcoin price. We are all for self sovereignty but come on, the reason most of us got into this game was for financial freedom & to be wealthy. I am happy to let Blackrock have 20% of my coins for $200,000 each.As long as they don't attempt to alter the governance of the network by any means, it's a fair deal in my opinion. ETF has always been desired for Bitcoin for as long as I can remember and the previous ones were not approved but this time being spearheaded by Blackrock.  Let's hope it gets approved and no adverse effect on Bitcoin.",
