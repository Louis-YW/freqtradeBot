Merit system is just about 5 years old. The wearing of avatar to newbies were change sometime when the forum was hacked, and the loophole when uploading an avatar were used[1], or maybe way older than the hack incident.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nmdq4/bitcointalk_hacked",

But then, even if they're old accounts and try to do that today, the feature of wearing avatar is no longer available to all of them. Those that you've seen have wore it and never changed/removed their avatar long time ago and that why it stays there.",
