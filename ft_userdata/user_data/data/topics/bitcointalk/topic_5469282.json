He cannot pump the topic (keeping it on the fist page using that bot) without the help of an old account, and without a useful discussion NO ONE will help him to make the promotional campaign successful or at least good introduction to the service.",

We always strive to provide quality service to our users and trying to solve all arising issues fast and polite. But if we are facing unreasonable rudeness - we will interrupt conversation. But it doesn't mean that problem will be ignored. We will solve it anyways.2. We have a partnership with CEX we are using to process crypto transaction. This CEX has its own AML service which check the \"cleanliness\" of the assets. If there is a suspicion that funds may have illegal origin - CEX will report it and we will have to ask customer to provide a confirmation regarding the source of the funds.",

Considering that we are listed more than on 8 monitoring services - it’s obvious we passed it and submitted all the necessary info.Regarding KYC for the users - it’s required only for 2 directions (USD card and EUR card). We are not forcing people to pass it if they do not want to. Moreover we are not going to use this info in a personal purposes. KYC verification for this direction - is a requirement from CEX we are working with and it is stated in our Privacy and AML Policy.All other directions DO NOT require the verification of the user.P.S. Sorry for the late answering, we launched recently and we are now working on to fix all bugs and mistakes to get the quality product for our users. That is why we may not notice or miss something, but we will try to pay attention in the future.Thanks for all the opinions and interest in our business.",
