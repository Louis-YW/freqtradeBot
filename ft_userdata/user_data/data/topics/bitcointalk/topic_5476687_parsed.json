Most famous person / member in Bitcointalk can be known by you but unknown by others. Because forum members have different interests with their time in Bitcointalk.If they are more actively in Meta board, they will know about theymos, one of the two head admins. They also can know about LoyceV with many threads in the board and regular updates for his threads like weekly updates.If they are more actively in Wall Observer thread, they will more probably know about phillipma1957 who has most posts in the forum and very actively in that thread.If they only actively in their local boards, they will know more about most active members in their local boards.",

Satoshi, Hal Finney, Gmaxwell, Vitalik, Charlie Lee, theymos, are among a few of those names that comes to mind, all of whom have been mentioned already. There are tons more active users who have some sort of fame. For example, current campaign managers have fame as they are the ones hiring and letting people earn bitcoin. Gambling site owners have some fame as well. Too many to list but check the gambling section, most of the sites topics are active.",
