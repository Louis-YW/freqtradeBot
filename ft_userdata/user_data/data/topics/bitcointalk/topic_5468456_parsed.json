Since wey I run my own NIMC registration many years ago na de NIMC slip wey dem give me, I don wait to receive de ID Card and I don tire. So with dis information now I go try make I get my own ID CARD as de slip no dey presentable. But wen I see dis information I bin get some doubts about de authenticity of de news because I no dey comfortable inputting my details into any random app online. So I had to do some search and I don confirm say de information dey legit and I go advise you make you add dis link to your post from their official website so that many persons go take your post seriously, de tiktok link alone no too dey convincing.
