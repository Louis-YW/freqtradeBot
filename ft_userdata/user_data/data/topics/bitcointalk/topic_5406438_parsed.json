So now no fiat no btc.Sad but it is what it is when you go with centralized exchanges. It's the risk you take. It is advisable to trade P2P. If you are with bitcoin for long time then you should have a close circle who always buy sell btc. You can easily ask them fiat in exchange of BTC.What was the exchange name?",

So now no fiat no btc.It often depends on how much money you want to exchange. The mere suspicion that it is an attempt to launder money will prompt the platform to freeze your balance until the verification procedures are completed. This is, of course, given that the platform is reliable.As suggested to you by the rest of the members, the best solution is to use the peer-to-peer services provided by many platforms such as Binance. It is also advisable to split the amount if it is large.Please give us details about the platform you used .",

MIXING IS LAUNDERING..now here is the thing.if your funds are locked because you received a letter from a government authority saying you are under investigation and to seek a lawyer to explain the origins of funds to the court.. then thats the usual process..but if there was not a court order.. usually an exchange, if legit and regulated, cannot and should not STEAL your funds for their silly internal business policy reasons. they should atleast ask you for KYC to allow you to continue using some of their services within the exchange(by you providing more info to sway their suspicions down a few levels)..but whether you provide info or not they should allow a option to take your funds out and close your account.(apart from court order scenario previous paragraph)they should not just confiscate your funds. (again unless their is a court order which you then apply to the court to explain your case, to get funds back if funds are legit funds not related to a crime)..check an exchanges small print of their service agreement terms and conditions. a ethical, moral trusted exchange wont and should not have any reasons to steal/confiscate or not allow withdrawal of funds for their business internal reasons. at worse case they can stop you from \"trading\" but still allow an option to withdraw and close account if you do not wish to answer their questionsif they are claiming their terms allow them as a business to steal funds without a court order because you signed/agreed to their terms when you signed up.. then they are not a trusting or ethical business and in most cases probably are not actually regulated because many countries regulations do not let their licenced exchanges just steal funds without a court order",

Freezing and locking people out of their funds is just one of those things. What's even worse, by accepting their terms of service, you knowingly/unknowingly agreed to all the nasty things that they can do to you.

But he’s talking about storing coins in an exchange, so I think he's got a point. Even as a day trader, I don't think one gets to trade their entire equity at once, otherwise it's a bad practice if anything happens from an exchange shutting down or making a poor decision and the asset price does not go as expected. So why send all the coins in an exchange if you are going to trade only, lets say a tenth of the equity.",

If they do it, they must choose biggest and most trusted exchanges to store their money on that and trade there.Decentralize money and trading on two to three exchanges.

Withdrawal should be made after you get enough profit and make sure you reuse your initial capital to trade in future. Another step for safety of your fund. If you lose all from trading or exchange has issues and you lose all fund on it, you still have profit part from withdrawal.QuoteSo I believe that when we say, \"not your keys, not your crypto\" we should remember the traders because that statement can make sense to a long term investor, but not to a day trader - but I guess that's their own risk to bear. No. It is for all, investors and traders.Don't store money on exchange if you don't trade. Traders trade more, investors must trade to buy and sell at least so they do need exchanges.Try to get initial capital out of exchange. In most terrible case, you will not lose capital, not lose all.Because you can win 10 times, 100 times but if you always store all your money on exchanges and in most terrible case, you will lose all, no capital in hands at the end.",
