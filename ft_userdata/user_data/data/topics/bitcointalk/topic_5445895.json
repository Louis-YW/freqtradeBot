  "content": "What happened:Megapari (they are same scam as its brothers 1xbit, 22bet, etc) kept and stole my money. They are real thievesFirst, they kept a deposit of 150usdt that I had to claim so that they would transfer it to my account several times. After 3 bets, the odds were automatically lowered and they put a limit of 1€ for no reason to every bet I wanted to make.After that I tried to withdraw and it has been a real hell, asking for insane surreal proofs. I have even had problems after sending everything that has been requested.Finally, they told me that they only let me withdraw what I deposited, but not the winnings from the bets. But even that is a lie! They have only let me withdraw half of what I deposited with them and when I contact them by email they only put this message all the time:\"Dear user, all consulting on the matter of your request was provided earlier in this mail thread\"If you do not want to be robbed, please fly from this house of scammers, thieves and scammers.I have proof of everything.I deposited 250usdt, and the only allowed me to withdraw 148usdt.Scammers Profile Link:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile%3Bu%3D3508147&fbclid=IwAR1ZsHNbT6bxxWt920-kFKOdiB39lSwQ0pKfwSbA-8IvhkBS0dVeT6w-zWQAmount Scammed: 100usdt deposited + the sum of won bets Payment Method: usdtProof of Payment:https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/dcba2163197c532b142916797da636394727116d3a43cd3d6b2ecd7128f7b94ahttps://tronscan.org/#/transaction/1acb188eb99dba01cc7391300ad10f76e95fec2011465d80fc2436cb07d06495",

The verification failed as the team has traced multi-accounting activity in accordance with the provided documents.

In that case, we get 262.21  USDT minus the amount of winning = 148.83 USDT that are successfully credited to the player's bank account. [image snip]I think it would be best to re-upload the image with OP's email address censored, just to be safe and sure you're still giving your best to protect their privacy. I understand that you also asked for Mr. Marcos' KYC and thus know that the same ID are shared on both account?Thanks, i've uploaded another file. I still can see a name. It's better if you remove that part using an image editor and re-upload the file again.",

The verification failed as the team has traced multi-accounting activity in accordance with the provided documents. This is T&C violation....I have a question about KYC, I want to understand something. Is KYC mandatory when registering on your site? Why was KYC verification not required upon registration before depositing?If this is true, I think it is not fair that you do not require KYC when the player makes a deposit, while asking him for KYC if he wants to withdraw!!!",
