      "body": "Altcoins can be considered as risky and meme coins are riskier and it is because of many of the meme projects in the past and even up to now will just evaporate into nothing leaving trusting and naïve investors behind wondering what happened. However, because there can be a few successful meme coins, people are persuaded that they should be looking for that next big, shining meme coin and make a x1000 killing with the tokens they receive for the money they throw to developers or promoters of the project. And this story will not stop in 2023 all because in 2024 there can be new meme coins to take a good hoard of money from the market. We have become hopeless and addicted to meme coins!",

Unlike other coins with huge promises and plans, meme coins are simple, community driven and fun way to come together. If chosen correctly, they can make you rich overnight.Take an example of pepemo itself, being a successor to famous pepe coin, it has if not larger, a comparative community with daily participation.",

Of course it's a one in a thousand chance of getting \"rich\" with just small profit. Not every meme coin has the same chance of getting big and majority of them just dies because of lack of attention to the community and the market. It is because of a ton of meme coin in the market, there are a lot of meme coin on the market already and it is increasing day by day. It is also known that meme coins are just shitcoins and crypto investors that wants to put their money on real project absolutely won't invest on meme coins having the less chance of meme coins getting a traction on their project. The trend is what makes other meme coin fetch a high price before but today, it's obvious that meme coins isn't a trend anymore.",

It's a kind of lottery where early investors profit and late ones lose money to the first group.I agree with you, especially with your headline suggestion. He gave us a reason to not buy meme coins, at least for people who wish to invest in some meme coins. I think that it's not all about investing and earning as much as possible... that part is very important, of course, but there should also be some support for something without the need for profit. Simply said, we use some coins because we like what we can do with them, and in that way, we become part of that community and we support that project. So maybe the answer to OP's question from the headline can be \"Because we wish to have some fun\".",

They think meme coins can make them to be rich suddenly, but they are not aware that meme coins are riskier. If people understand how meme coins work, they don't dream something impossible with meme coins. Buying meme coins are almost the same as gambling with crypto coins. It is because meme coins have no clear fundamentals to improve its price in the future, they only rely on the hype. If the developers can maintain the hype a long time, people who invest in meme coins have the chance to take good profits. But if the hype disappear very soon, no chance to take profits on the new meme coins.Quote from: Jocuserious on August 19, 2023, 06:14:04 PMThis is not really normal because meme coin is more dangerous in this crypto market. They always collect money from investors by showing amazing attractive offers.Basically, all altcoins are risky, we must know that investing in crypto coin is a high risk. So, whatever the coin is, it is always a high risk. But I agree that meme coins have a higher risk, it is because they have no clear future. How we can expect its future if it has no fundamentals? In reality, altcoins with strong fundamentals can fail, even worse the meme coins with have no fundamentals/weak fundamentals.",

This showcases the \"capability\" of meme coins to make someone go from zero to hero, when in reality said capability is actually nonexistent. And while I guess some people do luckily profit off of some of these shitcoins, they're closer, if not already a gamble imo. They might as well just go to a casino or hope to hit the jackpot on a lottery really, heck that's a lot cheaper compared to buying shtcoins imo.",

They aren't thinking of the other way around which is the risk when they are investing into this type of coins. Meme coin being the most dangerous coin? It might be, but you know what's more dangerous? It isn't a coin, but it's how investors think. I just hope that most of the investors will wake up, and think that investing not only into meme coin,  but into coins that we already know are very risky always end up as a loss for the investor most of the time. On the other hand, not all meme coins are like that because we have DOGE that has been there for a very long time, SHIB that has been there for I guess 1-2 years already. Most of the meme coins don't last long I agree, but there are still some who lasted for years. Meme coins in general aren't a good type of coin to hold it for long term. Maybe if you want to flip then I guess, but beware still because most of them are just cash grab.",
