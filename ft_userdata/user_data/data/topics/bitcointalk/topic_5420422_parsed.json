I wasn't around when this happened, so I cannot give an exact explanation beyond this.In 2022 we had a series of unfortunate events (TM) instead of a natural bubble. Yes, $69,420 Bitcoin price was a bubble, so was $60K earlier before Tesla with Elon Musk popped it, but everything else was a completely artificial crash - from $40K or $30somthingK, some shitcoiner managed to indirectly bring the entire market at its knees.",

S2F is a good example but not the only one. Benjamin Cowen, one of the most popular and respected cryptocurrency market analysts, has admitted that his flagship market model “is dead.” He did so in the context of Bitcoin’s falling price, while also falsifying the hypothesis he has been arguing for since 2019.https://beincrypto.com/benjamin-cowen-lengthening-cycles-are-dead-end-of-a-great-narrative/I like charts that you can find on https://www.lookintobitcoin.com They can give you a perspective of where we currently are compared to other years.",

On most exchanges it was a drop of about 4k BTC that made us go all the way from 19k to 17k. 4k is nothing when you compare it to the total supply which means the circulating supply worldwide is less than 10% of the total supply. People who had money frozen on FTX sold in panic but their money remained frozen - they gained nothing.Possible scenarios?Their money gets unfrozen and they move to another exchange and buy back. If only half of them buys we'll be above 19k in an instant because we went from 16 to 18 on money from other sources than the dying exchange so other people bought the panic. If the panic calms down and get back on the market the situation will return to what it was before the drama. Levered longs got liquidated so most people are now either shorting or out of the market. A short squeeze to 20k is possible.It looked like BTC was bottoming at 17k and recovering. This situation is not a normal macro trend but rather a black swan event. I wouldn't look for macro lower lows here. If we get lows these are going to be a result of further drama with exchanges.",

While different market factors have made things not as clear cut as they’ve been in the past, I think the future will still rhyme with history. You can’t deny the block reward’s effect on the exchange rate over time and so far things are performing about as expected if you are a believer of the fractal pattern. I would feel better buying here than at $50K. Unless the crypto experiment is over, now is a time to be a buyer and not a seller.",

The trend that they are expecting must be the down trend and it did happened actually and there are different reasons about it. The wars, economic crises, the collapse of the exchange. These are only the few id like to mention.At some point, the decline would stop because people are also actively buying when the price dips and then there are now positive news that we are seeing. This brings a confidence again for the people to continue their crypto journey despite of the hardships that they are facing. Last year was a bull time and there's no FTX issues yet that time. It's only just a bear which prevented BTC from climbing at the $100k mark.",

I'm not a fan of studying patterns in the first place, but I hope that users are taking the recession, and the unprecedented times into consideration when they're investing, and managing their expectations based on that. I imagine pre 2024 when the halving is coming, we'll see some optimism, but it might not be to the level that we've seen previously.

I see a lot of talk about patterns, but none of us are ever able to capitalize on them. Since, as you correctly point out; if we did we'd be stinking rich. Obviously, you need the starting capital to make that happen, but I think a lot of users here rely on that four year cycle pattern a little bit too much. Halving's are generally quite a exciting time though. Both prior to it, and after. That's simply just because people are optimistic, other than any sort of pattern though.",
