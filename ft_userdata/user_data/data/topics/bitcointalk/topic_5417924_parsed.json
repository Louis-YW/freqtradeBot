Or even higher?!) you want some protection and you are ready for KYC or anything else that can/will help you if some problem appears!When it comes to us small-time gamblers avoiding KYC is probably some kind of rebellion, between everything else, we can pass it but the question is why do we need it? We like crypto because of the freedom it gives us... and some of us are not ready to abandon that freedom. Anyway, if you are a fair player you will be treated fair, with KYC or without.",

There is nothing we can do with that, that's part of growing if you're looking at the growth of cryptocurrencies being used by casinos as their currency to gamble with.There are still some exceptions these days and some casinos that don't ask for it if you're just a small time gambler. And that's what you just have to look at and try them if they won't ask you further to verify your identity with your stay there.",

KYC has become a sad reality that we can not avoid because there have been so.much limitations that are tied to KYC, so I won't say KYC is entirely a stupid thing to do as a crypto user in some cases.",

I do want to make a point about gambling not available in certain areas though. I feel like it's our money, we should be able to use it however the fuck we want.

Well, if you are a gambler and understand cryptocurrency already you don’t need someone to tell you why, because you can easily do your own research here. There’s a simple answer here, if you don’t like KYC then don’t gamble. The more pressing issue in that image is the fact that crypto has been advertised as \"anonymous\" or \"private\" that's why they mock anyone who submit their identity. Using crypto in casinos or any other platform that asks KYC is in contradiction or defeats the purpose of why it's been created.",
