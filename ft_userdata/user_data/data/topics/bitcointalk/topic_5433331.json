This tweet might mean nothing to me because who does not know that Bitcoin has been active 100% since many years ago? And what happened to 2010 and 2013?All these would have made more meaning if the tweep could back it up with technical explanations, but none was attached. Transactions are always actively going on with the BTC blockchain, and no bank or payment system in the whole world could compete with it.",

In the same way this got me laughing as well because bitcoin has always been ever volatile and during this periods we experienced high and low in bitcoin price, i thought OP could have just used the title that says bitcoin highest peak periods of each year and stated the month this was observed, but going by his kind of way it may not really give clearer understanding because in these same year we've got the dips as well just as you fan see from this history of bitcoin lost https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1593676869336973316?t=d1f-zlVEZdTD4SoAH4btmw&s=19 i think his real way of conveyance of desired information needs more improvement because bitcoin has not only been up during the said years, but rather being volatile with bears and bull.",

      "body": "To be honest, as best way to see Bitcoin growth in value and price (value is reflected on market by market price) is looking at Bitcoin Min price of each year.Rather than looking at tops, all time highs which are more sensitive to hypes, greed as well as market forced liquidations, Min Yearly Prices more correctly show Bitcoin growth.Yearly candlesAnother way is looking at Bitcoin price in bear markets. I am sure you can see solid upwards trends since 2014, 2018 and 2022 bear markets. I played with it some time in 2021.Fact sheet for bitcoin price (daily low, high, close price over years)",
