  "content": "Do not rely on your windows 10 or 11 security, it's not very active like you believe, trust me, I am talking from an experience.I used to update my windows security just to make sure my data are save but a day ago I battled with something new, I detect under my windows settings that memory integrity is off and the whole OS starts behaving abnormally.Memory integrity prevents attacks from malicious code but once it's off you are vulnerable, to cut my story short I found out that my PC is infected with Adware, I scanned the whole PC but windows security still tells me that everything is normal.I used a premium adware/malware software I found three adware trojan on my PC, one has something to do with crypto hijack and the other two are like driver something, I am a very careful user and this still happens, this is why I don't use my PC to store crypto.",
