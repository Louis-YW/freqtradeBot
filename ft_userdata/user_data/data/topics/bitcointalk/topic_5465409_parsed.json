I just feel horse racing has fallen from grace when comes to what actually is appealing to the average online gambler nowadays.When I think of horse racing the images that come to my mind are those of my grand father or my old uncle dressing up, picking up his money towards the closest betting please where they can partake in such activity. To me it would be much of a hassle just to wager money on something I don't personally find to be entertaining.The current generation of gamblers seek for more immediate and fast paced experiences, I guess; I like dices and plinko, since they are game where I can choose how much risk I wanna take and hot fast I want to go, with horse racing I cannot be in control of many of those characteristics which make online games to be attractive to me.It would take someone really passionate on horses to make the time to bet on races, it is easier to be passionate on football, baseball or even basketball, imo.",

Unlike sports betting like football,basketball and boxing where anywhere in the world have access and majority love this sports that's why many sportsbook commonly offer this since this is most adopted and have huge demand to people around. Availability is for sure the main reason for this question and its not surprising to see that this is not popular.",

Plus talking about a thrilling experience, one 2 miles 4f long jumping race with 16 fences that your horse can blow any time is more thrilling than the 11-meter penalties, It's one jump and all over not like you have the chance to recover. Probably it's just me but horse racing looks like chucking down monster energy cans one after other while roulette is sipping Aperol.Oh, I'm not trying to convince you to strat betting, just lol, just pointing out things!Quote from: Eternad on September 02, 2023, 02:32:26 PMI once bet on horse racing but have a hard time finding a live stream to watch the match online especially those horse racing from Japanese. I believe this sports will be popular if the streaming for the live match is accessible including the horse stats. Not going to promote any website but almost every one of the established ones offers live coverage, I watch all UK and Irish festivals directly on the betting platform. For Japan and Australia, different time zone that's a pain in the ass and ruins everything! Same with stuff from US like the Kentucky Derby which I never, neverrrr! managed to see it live in the last 10 years!Quote from: dimonstration on September 02, 2023, 02:39:14 PMHorse racing is very popular on oldies because my uncle is still into it u til now.

I get that these days, there are likely regulations in place for the treatment and better standards of care of these animals, but it wasn't always like that. In the past, animals in sports often had a rough time, and some were even pushed to their limits.The difference between sports involving humans and those involving animals is choice. Human athletes willingly participate and make their own decisions, but animals don't have that luxury. They're compelled to perform. I'm not an animal activist or anything like that, but I do believe it's inhumane to use animals for human entertainment.",

Another possible reason its kind of considered as rich people game even though it is somewhat true but new era people are not really interested in wasting their time gathering knowledge about all the horses and riders and predicting out of it, they simply lean towards fast forward games Click = Bet = Win or lose.Running a prediction event will surely attract more people but I bet it's just to meet the quota not really going to be people who are actually into the horse race tradition but there is no harm in trying and seeing how it goes.",

People would rather watch sports or other kinds of relatively new sports than horse racing. Though I may be bias due to the fact that I have no experience in this field, but I think those reasons are what stops me from actually exploring/trying this field.I remember when I was a kid, I visited this gambling house where a group of people were watching a single small television with horses racing. Whenever a certain color or number wins, some get mad and others rejoice.Maybe one of these days, I would actually try or consider horse racing but as of now, it is off my radar.",

Ahh, what a country. I was in New Castle and used to travel to University of Sunderland. It was the Chester road that caught my eye with William Hill and Coral. Both of them were popular amongst us and we used to spend plenty of time on weekends to bet on cricket, play roulette. However, I would like to point out my experience that is related to this post. There were many many old peeps that used to sit and bet on the horse racing and greyhound racing. As you would guess I did ask one of them how do you play it. They said you gotta know the horse and the player who rides it. Then only it is possible for you to understand who’s gonna win the game. At least predict that more accurately with that info. They even had news papers with them, I’m sure they must have studied it. I had more fun betting on other games rather than horse racing because simply I did not understood the game. So I am not really sure if this game is going to be very popular amongst the other game loving peeps or perhaps the youngsters.",

In this part of the world where I come from, we barely see a horse so the idea of horse racing games does not really interest us in any ways. We do not see such as big deal and come to talk of it, for the fact that one would need to know the performance of the horses before betting one would constantly stay observant to watching out for the performance of the horses to always bet for which I think is not feasible so therefore this is amongst the numerous reasons I think people do not pay interest on horse racing.",

This will likely be the situation of the larger youth gambling population and of course they make up more of the gambling population. My point also is that it looks like horse racing is dying out and most casinos also don't usually include it on their games, they prefer card and table games like roulette, slots, blackjack. Moreover, majority of gamblers like the soccer game, I guess that is where the attention is and that is where casinos chase the gambling population to.",
