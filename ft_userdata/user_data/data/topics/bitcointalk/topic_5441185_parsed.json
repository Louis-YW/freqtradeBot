One could never believe that helps could come from different people all over the world to assist Ukraine, to be frank with you, some individuals would have thought that NETO are the only ones helping Ukraine.According to Ukrainian deputy digital minister Alex Bornyakov, the country has been using crypto to purchase fighting essentials like bulletproof vest, drones and other military gadgets/equipment.https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-accepted-by-60-of-ukraine-weapons-suppliers/",

It's all about the usage but sad to see that this war is still going on and everyone is wishing that this have to come to an end.",

QuoteRussia has become the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency mining country this year, the Kommersant business daily reported Friday, citing Bitriver, Russia’s largest bitcoin mining provider. While the United States remains by far the world's largest crypto miner, boasting 3-4 gigawatts of mining capacity, Russia’s generating capacity reached 1 gigawatt in January-March 2023.In taking second place for the first time, Russia took a spot previously occupied by Kazakhstan, which introduced restrictions on crypto mining activities in 2022 and now ranks ninth, Kommersant cited Bitriver as saying.https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/04/07/russia-becomes-worlds-second-largest-crypto-miner-a80749",

If there is instability in the world, people will not invest in any currency which is volatile.And so are traditional markets, but what bitcoin does though is to hedge their against this inflation due to war in Europe.Precisely. With every major fiat currency being heavily inflated, expectations of global recession, precious metals' prices being manipulated (via \"paper\" gold/silver) - Bitcoin is starting to look much less scary than it used to be. Especially when it looks like it might have hit the bottom and the new bull run is on the horizon.Quote from: virasog on March 11, 2023, 06:38:49 PMYes, Russia has no option but to use bitcoin as a payment solution if all other doors are closed for them but they need the other party (government) to accept bitcoin payment too.

That is how immature is the bitcoin market at the moment.Russia doesn't have to use Bitcoin as they have an alternative banking system that can function outside of Swift. But bitcoin can still serve as an emergency back-up plan. I think there have been rumours about Russia using Bitcoin in the early stage of the war, when the sanctions were introduced, but it has never come to that.The bottom line is - if other countries don't want to trade with Russia- they won't, even if they operate on compatible banking systems. If they do want to trade - they will, and they will use Bitcoin if there's no other option. Similarily to how few European countries decided to open bank accounts with Russian banks, to bypass the Swift ban and be able to trade.",

The other block will be forming as an Anti-US country that may use Bitcoin as a main currency to trade/deal between them.Check out some of the latest developments like Saudi Arabia Considers Accepting Yuan Instead of Dollars for Chinese Oil Sales and you will see where we are heading in next few years.The dollar will eventually lose its importance and it will eventually be replaced by Bitcoin. Also, countries are expected to launch their own CBDC, but i don't think that may serve as an alternative to Bitcoin.",

So still a win-win for them to go and become the second biggest mining country.Many people in the financial system in Russia consider bitcoin to be a pyramid scheme. You can argue a lot on this topic, but a large number of bitcoins have already been mined. If Russia invests huge amounts of money in the construction of mining centers, then the US could at any moment ban bitcoin and make Russia's investment in mining useless. There are a lot of natural resources in Russia, and it is better for the government to develop more promising areas rather than bitcoin mining.Yes, but if there's one thing that Bitcoin can do with Russia right now is to circumvent the US sanctions on them and they could used BTC to their advantage by being the mining capital or hub right now. China for once has ban Bitcoin trading, and it has no to little effect on the market.Probably US will put a big dent once they decided to put the hammer ban, but I doubt that the government will do it. There are a lot of US that is going to be crypto friendly and even Bitcoin mining booms in Texas. The US government is more intelligent than just putting the ban on bitcoin and everything that relates to it. On the contrary, I'm thinking that they will have to embrace or adopt it the sooner to stay ahead of the game.I see the world is moving in a direction where it will be divided in two sections, one would be US supported countries that will continue to use the dollar as their main currency. The other block will be forming as an Anti-US country that may use Bitcoin as a main currency to trade/deal between them.Check out some of the latest developments like Saudi Arabia Considers Accepting Yuan Instead of Dollars for Chinese Oil Sales and you will see where we are heading in next few years.The dollar will eventually lose its importance and it will eventually be replaced by Bitcoin. Also, countries are expected to launch their own CBDC, but i don't think that may serve as an alternative to Bitcoin.The United States consumes about 40% of world GDP, and produces 2 times less, but there are problems with the medology of calculations. How will the world be divided if the US and China are partners? The main consumption in the world is the USA and Europe. The United States has already lost the economic war to China, and is trying by all means to transfer a large number of industries from Europe.There are a lot of questions about how the world will be divided. I named one scenario, this is a single government for all countries. Another scenario is long and bloody wars in all parts of the world except the USA",
