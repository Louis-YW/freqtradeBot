It’s not necessary that you need to go to professional in able for you to become successful but it will an advantage if you will. I think only user here in crypto done studying with professional trader and instead DIY on learning the basic on trading. Having a professional mentor you doesn’t guarantee success on trading but it will increase your profitability if you have a proper background on trading.",

Seek knowledge first before you dive into the market because newbies always lose a lot of money when trading without a proper knowledge. You can't just trade if you don't know what you are doing since you are just basically giving out your funds/capital.Just like what the other's suggested there are free courses online that you can read and learn about trading.

The most important thing is that basic lessons about trading must be mastered, don't assume profits can be obtained without any knowledge. Technical and Fundamental analysis are the main requirements and train your trading method so that you can determine what strategy is suitable. I myself even started trading self-taught without any professional training, just watched a few videos about the basics of trading that had to be mastered and followed all of them. then it's just how you want to learn. You don't have to be a trading professional to make a profit, trading with just basic knowledge but understanding what you are doing will certainly bring you profits and also practice psychology and do risk management and financial management.",

I made some good profits from doing just this, and even with a busy schedule I still manage to get 5-10% profit from my funds per week just because I let a bot copy a trader's moves for me in the platform.Then again, if you really want to make money out of something, you still have to learn it at the end of the day.

That's how it works. Right now BTC price is low so selling what you buy today in the next 3 years then its called trading. Thats how  possibly you can make it. If you want to be a day trader then that's when you need to learn more of how it works. There are indicators that you need to learn, start learning about them and binance even have tutorials for it. You can search their youtube channel.",

Only buying and HODL is one option other than that it's just sheer luck which can give you gains in trading without professional training. By professional training it doesn't necessarily means learning from a professional but it includes consistently training youself with any system which gives you profit, practicing a lot of trades until you become sure of your system. This is the only way to earn from any trading.Now that there are already free courses and videos online that can help in starting to trade better try what will suit best to OP that he’ll be able to understand. There’s no need now to hire or to enroll to learn we can learn thru experience and on our own dedication. Though, this may require more budget in terms of learning what method will matters to us thru experience. Before I tried only to trade with simulators or free trial trading platform but there is no thrill when there is no money involved, it adds excitement when we know that there is real money at risk and we really able to focus to understand how we can manage to gain profit or how we can minimize the lose.",

Gambling is totally dependent on luck and while trading, there is a matter of analysis. And in gambling if you loss the bet you will lost the fund at once on the others hand in trading the loss depends on the market.  But I am agree with that some fundamental knowledge can bring some profit but even then it is still risky So it will be better to earn knowledge about analysis and reading chart then go for trading other wise you may have to face loss .",

Also it's for long term hodler, not for quick profit makers.  Is the profit that you make from the bot regular ? Sometimes we think that bots do a clean trade but usually it is not that way. If you are making a reasonable margin of profit using bot then you are good. Longtime hodlers, quick dumpers or traders are suppose to give some measureable profit margin only for you to decide on what to go for.",
