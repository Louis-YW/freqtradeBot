I was not contented on my profit and tiring way that's why I seek some alternative way that make my gambling experience more hassle free.

It is YouTube, I believe not that the person is making money from gambling but just looking for people tolhat will click on his video and generate money through monetizing. Sorry for your loss, it was long time ago but I know how it would be painful at that time.Quote from: dimonstration on May 15, 2022, 04:49:38 AMWhats' your epic fail experience in gambling?Let's see your conclusion and re-evaluate your decision making after the epic fail experience.I like to bet most on football, in-play matches if I should be more specific, I was a kind of person that can start a bet with $5 and later make $50 through staking all my money including the money won at onces. I could have won big like 10x or more, it will get to a point I stake all my money and it would be gone at once after losing it all in just a single match after I have played several in-play matches and won. It was what further got me into addiction, but it would have been better for me to just stake, won and remove my profit, it would have been better.",

      "body": "I rarely play using huge balance so I can't share much loss experience but I have too some mistakes on gambling that I can't forget until now. One of them is betting the amount that I thought in USD but in reality the currency I'm betting is in mbtc. I made 3 consecutive bet before I notice that I'm actually betting the whole balance on my account. I made 1 win and 2 losses in proper order, At first I was surprised that I can't bet anymore while I'm assuming I only bet 1$ per bet then after I check my betting history. I realize that I'm using mbtc as currency and it stop immediately my gambling session at that time.I always check currency of my bet after that moment. Luckily I'm not playing with huge amount ever in all my gambling games. I'm sure that this is a complete disaster if happened to someone that has a huge balance.",

The consecutive number promotion is what I participate before but I never win any of those promotion. Your case is a typical result which the casino expecting for the result of there promotion besides attracting new players to enter. We have natural greedy attitude as part of our human weakness. I think many of us got wrecked on gambling because of this greediness.",

In my opinion, your main mistake is not that you listened to the advice of the weird guy from YouTube.  Your main mistake is that you think that there are winning strategies in gambling (games based on luck).  In my opinion, this is not true.  Martingale is not a winning gaming strategy in the long run.  Just like any other game strategy.  In my opinion, in gambling you should try to win a large sum of money and then stop playing.  That is, your mistake is not that you listened to someone else's advice.  You had to end the game and start a new one (hodl BTC).",

The only thing is that to try to earn that large sum of money you have to do it with money that you have left over, that you don't need for anything at all, unlike many people do. I would suggest the following personal finance management strategy... You save 10 percent of your income and invest it in high-risk projects (including gambling).  You agree in advance that the probability of winning is very small, but you understand that if you are lucky, the amount of money won will be very significant.  In my opinion, there are no mistakes in life.  There is no instruction on how to live your life correctly and what actions will definitely bring results.  A lot depends on luck.  At the same time, luck also needs to be given a chance.",
