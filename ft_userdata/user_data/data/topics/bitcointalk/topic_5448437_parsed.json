  "content": "Hi Guys!I have an S17PRO miner that I wanted to flash back to stock firmware, as I will sell it. I used Braiins tollbox to unistall and it worked like it should.The problem is that the miner get a S17 stock firmware instead of S17PRO, when using braiins toolbox. How can I now flash the miner from being an S17 to a S17PRO miner???I have tried with both adding the S17PRO firmware on a sd card and updated by interface och web, without any success. What to do?Thanks in advance!/Mag",

It worked for me with some miners.I found another way with Braiins. If I wanted braiins toolbox to download stock firmware to S17PRO, then I put a hashboard from that model before starting the uninstall process with Braiins toolbox.",

      "body": "You are supposed to go to the upgrade tab and use whatever fw from the manufacturer you want... It is written in the documentation that when you uninstall it puts something that doesn't hash but is unlocked.You just got lucky that the S17 and the S17 Pro are the exact same thing, but normally the miner would have not hashed at all waiting for you for the next step.Since you didn't use the support thread, you got a late response. I made the support thread for a reason. Worse, you didn't even mention Braiins OS in the thread title.",

      "body": "What? want to try to flash S17 miner and you are using S17pro firmware? Is that right? Because based on your story, you don't seem to know the function of the two. Don't you know that's not possible, because their hardware configuration is different.      s17 pro firmware won't work on an s17 miner even vice versa, did you know that? Then if you want to sell it you also need to flash it back to the original firmware as far as I know. But you can't do it without using the Bitmain firmware flashing tool.",
