It sparked off a massive altcoin rally and ICOs, bounties, airdrops, spamming, account farming and scam were the thing of the timeAirdrops and bounties were so profitable to bounty hunters at that time, and it's probably a period where there was a very high account registration rate ever. It took a lot of time in 2018 for so many to realize that the bear market had set in after the rally. The spamming went on for a long time, and it led to the introduction of the merit system later on in 2018What you see afterward are a result of ;- Death of ICO hype, - Less profitability of bounties and Airdrops, - The long crypto winter from 2018 to 2020, - Less account farming and spamming due to the introduction of the merit system,- much improved moderation where one-liners that were a thing back then will get deleted in no time etc",

If you check Google search statistics for Bitcoin you probably see similar pattern. Many people met Bitcoin at that time and started researching it. New ICO's are always introduced here. Most of the messages sent back then were also unnecessary spam posts. Even after 5 years, we clean them when they are reported.Even if the Bitcoin price rises to new ATH's, the forum won't be that active again. Most of the attention has shifted to other platforms on social media. Bitcointalk will no longer be the platform where cryptocurrencies are discussed most actively, but it will remain a boutique venue.",

Sometime I search about old thread and check of few old accounts, actually they're login for few times only but their last post mostly on 2017/2018.Although total posts are greatly decreased after 2018, but I'm just curious does it's really good for the forum? a lot traffic will boost the site rank, but it's full of low value post, it's really annoying for many users.

But I'm sure the Merit system that was implemented was quite successful in reducing the old spam accounts, only increasing activity to be able to rank up. however things don't work anymore, and that leaves quite a few accounts in 2017 inactive.I'm sure now everything looks better, even if not with a large number of posts, forums with useful and quality posts will look better.",

ICO investors lost their money and the teams were becoming millionaires. Crypto for individuals at it's worse time I think was in between 2017 - 2018. But overall the publicity and media coverage increased as a result many people heard about it. From 2019 to until now it seems things are stable. Even last ATH did not make any major impact",

Number of accounts doesn't represent number of actual users. In the \"pre-merit\" era, account farming was a big thing. And it's quite normal that a lot of people would just quickly create an account only for one-time use purpose and never come back, this is not unique to bitcointalk.Quote from: Vyeon11 on January 25, 2023, 02:02:55 AMmaybe people who are active on the forum in 2018 are just following along with what's trending, they just want to know what's interesting in this forum, and after they get bored, then slowly stop again from the forum.Don't take it seriously, I'm just assuming.That's also a normal cycle, very few people would have consistent level of activity throughout their lives. People join, leave, come back again etc. Normal thing.Quote from: Plaguedeath on January 25, 2023, 03:04:06 AMAlthough total posts are greatly decreased after 2018, but I'm just curious does it's really good for the forum?Not really, iirc the level of spam was becoming unbearable. That's what you get when when you provide incentive to posting (bounty campaigns etc) without any quality expectations. It was not uncommon to see i.e. someone just copying someone else's reply from the middle of the thread and posting as their own. Many such cases.As mentioned above, ICO dying natural death helped the most, I would imagine implementing the merit system played a good part, but it was introduced at the beginning of 2018 so if it had any effect, it was delayed in time.",

It's a news website and a community at the same time.Call me crazy, but User Interface plays a huge role in websites' success. This forum looks kinda very old for 2023.

Several users have done this in the past, and reported quite a hefty amount of posts. So, it's not something revolutionary. It's more for de cluttering the section, and allowing users to actually take a look at older threads without being bombarded by the typical spam. I've used some tools though, I've got a userscript which highlights certain words, and I've got a ton other userscripts for various things. I've sometimes found spam through other third party sites which have search functions. The typical stuff. I utilize the user notes userscript that was posted to note down findings, and I review that periodically. I've only really started streamlining, and getting a cohesive way of moderating though, it's take a few years. However, it seems to be working fairly well recently. There has been users who have mentioned their process, and methods before. Since, I can remove a lot of the crap I find, my process will be a little different.

Because I don't understand how they all disappeared right after the initiation of the merit system. I think the ban on spam accounts drastically reduced such people from using the forum. Moreover, they can farm accounts and merit their alt accounts to support their activities if they were concerned about merits, since accounts with many posts were rewarded with appropriate merits, according to their rank. Looking at the drop in posts after 2018 I'd say that coupled with the above listed ico and bounty hunters, I noticed that some threads in the service sections were abused and bumped multiple times a day without any punishment or sanctions. The spam bursters helped alot in keeping the forum neat and reducing the numerous spam posts, which amounted to over 15m posts in 2018.",
