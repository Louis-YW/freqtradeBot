Employers are always attentive to these details to avoid problems later.When you have better options, it doesn't make sense to keep a job where you get paid less than what you deserve.  The problem begins when there are no alternatives or the country's economic situation is fragile and does not allow you to launch your own project.",

That normally happens every year as per evaluation depending to the company's regulation about increasing rates and promotions. And if I feel that I should leave my job and hop in to a better paying company, I'll do that. That's where the negotiation might happen if the current company you work for thinks that you shouldn't be let go. They'll negotiate with your terms and asking salary.",

      "body": "This has been a typical occurrence for many years, even decades. The root causes of which have long been known, studied, ignored and forgotten.If inflation is 3% annually. All employees must receive a 3% pay raise to break even, and not experience depreciation of salary. Lack of pay raise to maintain parity with inflation, results in declines of wages. Which translates to decreased purchasing power of consumers and declining standard of living over the long term.There have been a few major causes of US employees receiving pay cuts over the past two decades. Can anyone guess what they were? To offer a hint, these pay cuts affected middle class americans more than any other income bracket. It is likely middle class america who understand best the form and shape these pay cuts take. As they have been hit by more of them than any other demographic.While the main causes of these trends are known. (As I have seen them discussed for the past 15 years over the internet.) Most of the discussion appears to have gone offline. Its not nearly as common for people to discuss these topics on internet forums or discussion groups. But judging from recent trends, it would seem that people are becoming much more knowledgeable, despite the lack of internet participation. They are much more knowledgeable on topics like this one, than they used to be. It shows in choices relating to things like immigration and voting patterns, becoming more informed over time.",

But this is not the dilemma from where I am right now. I generalize that majority of workers here in my country don't love their jobs, and they are also underpaid. And not only that, they are also overworked. They are thoroughly exploited but not properly compensated. But the option to leave and move to another job is close to nonexistent. All of them are dispensable. And it's not hard to look for a replacement. A request for an increase is pointless as they are even underpaid. Even the required minimum wage is low.",

It seems like a strange law for those regions to have but in reality that is probably what companies were paying the average person recruited with exceptional cases hitting the highest in the range. Frankly if a job is advertised for $50k salary, then you would expect that to be what you'll be getting and I'd personally be avoiding companies that have wide ranges. It is a bit disappointing that you often have to move companies to get your true worth in certain professions because companies are by design going to pay you the least amount they can retain you for.",
