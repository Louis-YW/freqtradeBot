Besides the amount of money you made using it, which everyone seems to include nowadays?Specifically, why should someone sign up for a sports (betting) arbitrage course, when most of the information needed for executing one successfully is not only freely available, but also intuitive?",

Besides the amount of money you made using it, which everyone seems to include nowadays?Specifically, why should someone sign up for a sports (betting) arbitrage course, when most of the information needed for executing one successfully is not only freely available, but also intuitive?The idea of arbitrate isn't new and is readily available like you mention. However actually executing the arbitrage is not easy which is why most people aren't doing it. Finding an arbitrage in sports is not easy if you don't know where to look. Also, sometimes an arbitrage is there, but you don't want to take it because of associated risks that you wouldn't know. I've been arbitraging for 2 years, so with my course you're learning all of the lessons I had to learn the hard way. You also get access to live webinars that you can follow the arbitrage hits. You get 1:1 help, and best of all if you don't have any sites currently you can use the sites promotions in my free guide posted in the OP to make a thousand dollars and pay for the course free. Â I can help anyone who lives in the US and in a legal state make money off the site promotions. Just message me and I would love to help.",

      "body": "In this era where almost everyone is in one way or the other into sports betting, I find it difficult to believe that an institution will exist to offer courses on it .In another lens, it's a welcome development as it somewhat informs people as to \"how to\" in the speculation business but I also have worries, one might say you roped him into what happens to be a problem in his life when he finally gets addicted. It's almost impossible for someone not to practice what he has learnt and its worse when it's gambling",
