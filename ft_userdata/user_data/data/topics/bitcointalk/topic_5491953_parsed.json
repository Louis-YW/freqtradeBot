  "content": "Months ago someone had posted here with some evidence that the mixing of the a mixing service was inadequate to mask transactions but nobody seemed to take it seriously. It's weird how many users on this forum were ready to overlook on-chain evidence while the platform in question was pumping thousands of USD every week in advertising directly towards forum users at the time. Now that there's some credible accusations of fraud it's hard to ignore these older accusations. Admittedly I've never made any transactions that I would feel need mixing... But not to tout any supposed ethics from my side, it's very likely that if I knew of a mixer's mixing being bad while I was getting paid a substantial salary by them to make some forum posts, I'd likely also avoid contributing to their downfall. But maybe also if we apply hanlon's razor here (Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity), since most people probably don't care or don't need to use mixing, they probably wouldn't bother to check either. But this begs the question, if such basic blockchain forensics had exposed this mixer months ago, how did they stay operational till now? Are the majority of people who transact with bitcoin, even users of this forum, completely unable to do even the most basic blockchain forensic research? Because according to the post I linked, it was really obvious to pick up the trail of the lackluster mixing going on. The real cost of mixin'One has to also consider, at what cost are mixing services operating? Many of them end up having their Admins arrested with unknown fates in international trials and jails. Others end up exit scamming. And would they do so if they were making profits in the first place? Thinking about it, is there ANY fee that would make it worth it to give out bitcoins in exchange for potentially tainted coins that are possibly connected to crime and fraud? Especially given how easy BTC transactions are to track? Based on the above knowledge, many suspicions can be raised. What motivation would someone have to provide a mixing service if he was to risk life in jail or even running it at a loss? Credible suspicion against mixersCould mixers be honeypots? It's not an unlikely possibility that mixers are created and operated by state agencies as a way to catch high-profile criminals that are under the impression of \"masking\" their transactions. But in fact these services could be used as evidence later.Another really suspicious event that happened only around a month prior to the aforementioned mixer's demise is the revelation that the infamous Lazarus hacker group appears to have been using the mixer's coins for their own benefit. This revelation gives some credence to theories that mixer services might not just be government honeypots, but rather hacker honeypots. Where hackers gather a bunch of coins that definitely must be cleaner than their ill-gotten fraudulent coins, attracting users under the illusion of \"mixing\" only to hand out their very tainted coins to regular users in exchange for coins they can easily deposit into exchanges without issues. And after they're done exchanging everything, they can just start using the service for exit scamming to gain even more money.",

I’m not knowledgeable on how Bitcoin technicalities work but there’s something like a smart contract which we can stake our Bitcoin as liquidity pool for mixer then this might be possible just like how DEX work with their liquidity.

People who used mixers in this forum either indirectly by being paid through signature campaigns or as a paying customer have in the past faced issues. Tainted coins aren't just an issue when having to deal with state authorities, civil society often enforces filters voluntarily also. And if banknotes could be traced back so efficiently as bitcoin I'm sure many institutions would refuse transactions with them too. There's no denying that traceability is a feature of bitcoin. That can be good or bad at times. But not that great for criminals who seem to meet their fate one one way or another with mixers. So no, the concept of \"tainted coins\" isn't a scam. It's a real thing. Ethics is also a thing and money doesn't always trump it either. I remember in this forum people used to get tagged as scamers if they accepted payment to promote ponzi schemes for instance. And well, by the notion that ponzi schemes are unethical, one might as well say the same for coins taken away from someone else via means of hacking etc. So when the traceability of BTC is used to catch criminals and seize their ill-gotten gains, we should consider it a great feature imo.",

That money is lost according to blockchain analytics Coins will always get mixed because there won't be a time where every single exchange and centralized business checks deposits for taint. It will never work with or without mixers. The difference is that without them analysts will have to allocate less resources to track the same transaction, but why should we make it easy for these companies and governments.

But when Mixers exist, it means that there are many people who really need them, willing to pay 5% fee to get \"cleaner and safer\" BTC.

You're the one who's making the claim that privacy erosion is sometimes beneficial.  Quote from: alani123 on April 07, 2024, 07:21:04 PMOn a more serious note though, have you considered that passing your coins through a centralized \"mixer\" service isn't a real privacy enhancement? I know.  I'm a proponent of decentralized mixing, like Monero.  I didn't argue about that. Well I'm sorry it took so long but that's the main point I'm trying to get across here. Mixers are risky, trust based and to a large extent negate the whole point of bitcoin's existence. It's part of bitcoin's functionality however that transactions are public. We knew this since day 1. QuoteWe need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earliertransactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't careabout later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is tobe aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions anddecided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must bepublicly announcedSource: Satoshi's bitcoin.pdfPassing bitcoins through a so called mixing service introduces risks and likely doesn't even solve the issue of traceability that well. Because the reasons someone might want to use a mixer is disassociation coins from certain activities. Even through many false positives though, coins through mixers might even be easier to detect as \"suspicious\" to those looking. And the only reason I'm examining from this approach is because when talking about the disadvantages of using mixers, I believe that one has to also address the thought process of a likely user of such services.",

I stop using mixer after the multiple seize on popular mixer and decided to use P2P exchange instead. Bitcoin Q&A: Blacklists, Taint, and Wallet FingerprintingAndreas M. Antonopoulos talked about basic steps from centralized platforms to detect tainted coins and understand about it can help you to avoid problems with exchanges and casinos from your deposits. You can do it by yourself and don't have to use mixers for it.I understand your concern because casinos with licenses have obey to regulations and one of them is AML. Exchanges can have problems from DOJI like Binance, Kucoin with accusations and charges from DOJI recent months.",
