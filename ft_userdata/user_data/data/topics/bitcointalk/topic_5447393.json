      "body": "The dollar is already losing value, and there is a lesser possibility for any country to choose the Chinese yuan over the dollar. The Chinese yuan is not an open currency that can be easily accepted as a global currency. The Chinese economy is doing great for its people, but it's not bold enough for everyone. It can only be accepted by a few allies like Brazil, which is already planning a trade deal to ditch the United States dollar, if this has not already been concluded. Debt-free and a stable economy are not just what make the United States dollar a generally accepted currency; there are also other criteria that should be met.The euro stands a better chance than the Chinese yuan over the replacement of the United States dollar. But dedollarization is not going to happen anytime soon; the global economy is not ready for it yet.",

It's hilarious that you think countries like Brazil, India, Russia and China might come together into a single currency union similar to the kind that you find in Europe. They have vastly different economies and China would dominate the currency, which is why all the others would have zero interest in such a solution. It's also contradictory to suggest that China is heavily pushing the Yuan and also imminently expecting to join a new currency.

If this is nothing then you can simply ignore. I respect your opinion but you should direct it towards the news article that pushing it globally and not the person who compiles all the news that being talk now. You might have a point technically but a FUD can simply use all this news to make this all possible.This is just a warning and not a guarantee that will happened. I believe all this news will not be published online if this is just nothing. Just ignore the thread if you don’t believe it.

This has a pro-inflationary effect and this forces/enables further increases in interest rates, making it even more difficult to run a business. Increasing costs (employment, credit costs), decreasing profits (custommers Credit Card Debt ATH). This is the perfect scenario for the beginning of a crisis. In the next stage, companies go bankrupt, unemployment rises and the problems deepen.",

The United States is a powerful country that makes decisions in the global market, and they would not stand by and watch this happen. In the global market, the majority country always wields the most power in decision-making. Even if this occurs, there will be a period of competition before the Chinese Yuan reaches the peak of US dollar dominance. Amidst all of this, there is no doubt that bitcoin will only be the world's number one reserve currency.",

That's where I got all this info.The global economy is totally about to take a dive, my dude! Credit card debt is through the roof, and the interest rate is soaring like a bird, just like what went down in 2008. Sure, unemployment might be low, but don't get too happy because things are starting to look like the 1969 and 1974 crashes. Even the US housing market is in shambles, with the lowest mortgage applications in 28 years.To make matters worse, the Federal Reserve is pumping a massive $300 billion into its balance sheet, which is gonna lead to some major inflation. Plus, Jerome Powell's 2% goal is totally screwed, and Russia and Saudi Arabia might start using the Chinese Yuan as their reserve currency. The interest rates are the highest they've been since 2007, and there's a new BRICS currency on the horizon.Bruh, these times are wildin' out! You gotta be careful and stay woke.The Bitcoin surge ain't no guarantee for safety. We gotta keep an eye on this messed up economic system and be open to new possibilities. The future's all kinds of uncertain, but it's up to us to adapt and make a dope world for ourselves and our peeps.",

The primary reason was covid and completely halted supply chain in the process. The war broke out and it worsen the situation even further. However, if dollar is getting affected then so as to Yuan and other currencies in the world. If dollar is losing value then it’s gonna ultimately affect the economy in all 360 degrees no matter what. I’m pretty much sure that US Fed will start printing more money sooner or letter. They will impose some weird sanctions and control the economic outburst again. They have already started the process from halting the immigration. The US Visa site is always down. Everything is planned.",

The economy was basically messed up but stocks kept hitting highs and everybody was acting like nothing was wrong. The last fed meeting JPow said they won't be any cuts this year, but if you look at the bond market they are saying there is a chance of a cut in July and maybe 100 bps cuts at the end of the year. Why is this an issue?Well its because what JPow says should be reflected on the bond market but its not. So either the bond market thinks JPow is lying or they know that something bad will happen and they are pricing in lower rates for the future. We will see which side is correct in a few months.",

At least Bitcoin has proven itself to be a safe haven in the pandemic, that's one true case and we passed it with flying colors.

I lost my job, but luckily the company gave us severance pay. And then I got back my job after two months. So I've learn a lot of that experience and it seems that history will repeat itself again in the coming years. The good thing is that now we have Bitcoin as a hedge for all what is happening right now, and I think it will still be safe, in my opinion.",
