What I mean is that we should know at what age and intensity should children learn about this things. As innovative as it to let our kids learn about this things early, there should be a well researched basis regarding this as it may cause issues (mentally and psychological) to kids if we push them to something that is too cognitively advance.",

Don't be silly, stablecoins don't need to be deepened because the point is that it makes you not move freely with your finances and is subject to policy. You will be taxed, your finances will still be monitored, so what's the point in the future if you still don't have your own financial freedom?",

We can widely use fiat anywhere we want compare on stable coins where we are able to do limited transaction with this. I may rather choose kids about bitcoin and other volatile crypto since high risk, high rewards and its good that they know how to handle investment struggles since it can help them grow.",

If you want stablecoins that badly, then what is the difference between stablecoins and it's transaction with you fiat(dollars) and invoices? Is there much different, has that change the economy so far, I don't because it's the same thing that is been circulate over the years, stablecoin is not what you need to get your kids ready but understanding the financial system of the government and how to escape it by investing early on yourself.You can choose to gift your child some stablecoin and to keep it for years until they become of age but by that time, the stable coin will worth penny by the time they come of age, they will not have much to buy with it but if you have invested it and keep it for them, if they see how it appreciate over the years, they will grow with that confidence for the rest of their life, they will appreciate you for that route and gift because not every child get financial advice at their young age and that turnouts to be a problem when they grow.I wouldn't be selective with investment for your child but in anything you do, include bitcoin for them, not necessarily only bitcoin but add a fraction of it to see how important it will be for them in the future because you are starting something big for them.",

      "body": "Stablecoins have significant potential for a decentralized economy model. However, explaining stablecoins to young children can confuse them. First of all, when explaining the economy to children, it is necessary to explain the economy through the existing system. When they will start their business life in the future, they need to know basic economics and i am sorry to say that economic relations in the world do not take place through stablecoins.It may be thought that i am an anti stablecoin person, but on the contrary, i think that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies will open the door to decentralized finance that i have always wanted. For now, it is enough for stablecoins to fulfill their purpose. What is this purpose? To provide protection from the high volatility and loss of value in the market. But if stablecoins are fully integrated into the economy, governments will have the luxury of monitoring every transaction. This has many positive and negative aspects.",

If you are referring to him in the present, if he is not in the presidency, then how can he initiate that program? Maybe to initiate that program, he only has to move some things here and there (I hope you understand what I mean). And by doing that, he might accomplish the goal of enabling the teaching of BTC to younger people.Just like El Salvador's new teaching program for young ones. This would be a great opportunity for all of us (of course, those who are young ones), but it will also be a great opportunity for the parents who are dedicated to the BTC or cryptosphere. But of course, if there is good, then there is bad too. That means if there are people who believe in crypto, then there are those who don't, and they will definitely not want crypto to be taught in schools. But to be honest, I will have only one suggestion for those.You should at least have the opportunity, as in school only things will be told not to be forced on children. It must be added as an extracurricular activity that is optional, and kids based on their preference, interest, or approval from parents could join this, and those who do not want to can ignore it.PS: You should check for spelling and grammatical mistakes using some tools maybe I do not know how but please correct them.",

The world is moving pass that stage and the young need to be more abreast with blockchain and cryptocurrency education.

If we want to teach our young generation we must explain the value of having financial independence, which can only be attained with bitcoin rather than a stable coin that is centralized and subject to manipulation.Stable coins are fine in my opinion, but we need to teach our young generation the fundamentals of bitcoin and the blockchain before going on to explain the impact of centralization and the importance of decentralization in the cryptocurrency industry so that they can comprehend the motivation behind the invention of bitcoin.",

But if you are so determined to teach them about it, you have to have enough time because after introducing them to stablecoins, you also have to introduce what networks are supported by stablecoins such as USDT and USDC.I think this will take quite a bit of time because those who receive crypto knowledge also need time to understand it well and don't forget to tell them about the risks involved in crypto so they can understand this from an early age. Because often new people who learn about crypto often forget about the risks that exist in the crypto space, which makes them unable to stay in crypto for long when they start facing risks. Even though stablecoins are not cryptocurrencies that have more risks like other coins, they also need to be explained so that they can understand them well when they start learning.",

Donald Trump is rather an economical dinosaur, who believes that blockchain technology is a scam, even if he actually held Bitcoin or Ether, he would not openly admit it.Rather than helping stable coins and Bitcoin, Trump is probably going to push for people to ditch Tether and use the CBDC issued by the government of the USA instead.

I mean you don't see schools teach their students how to use the internet, and we all know how it is one of the top factors in trying to adopt a lot of new technologies nowadays. Let it stay the way it is, I hardly doubt fiat would disappear, or if it ever did, I don't think stablecoins would replace it. The way/method to use money would ultimately end up being taught by how their surroundings live their lives, kind of like a natural development at this point. If, for some reason, they needed to use stablecoins, look it up. I don't think anyone below 16 would have a reason to, but anyone above would probably know how to look things up so I don't see a problem with just leaving it alone.",

USDT is fiat which is and every country has their fiat currency. The young generations need a decentralized currency (bitcoin) that is censorship resistance and a hedge to inflation and not stablecoins that is the opposite. Bitcoin is a store of value and will aprreciate in price with time,this why the younger generations should be thought so that they can have financial freedom from governments and banks. Not stable coins that can be affected by inflation and can be controlled by the government.
