And that's it: that's what he wants to do with his life. He will say or do anything for the sake of making a dollar, and I doubt he actually holds many convictions.Its fine to root for Saylor as a voice for Bitcoin to help number go up, but all the simping for him I've seen over the years makes me nauseous. I wish bitcoiners would think for themselves & stop idolizing this type of behavior.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-02/microstrategy-s-mstr-saylor-loses-motion-to-dismiss-income-tax-suit",

If we really don't give any damn on statement they are saying and just forget about what possible actions they wanna do then for sure it cannot create any impact to the market and we can't change those people to always think positive even at this point where bitcoin is so strong since for them having bitcoin is just an invest so they will do anything they can to take advantage of everything and possible to take advantage on possible news that they can create.Lets value all the positive news they release but ignore those possible negative approach they create since for sure they just want to stir up something and spread negativity so that they can possibly move bitcoin at the lowest price so they can accumulate more of it at cheaper price as they can.",

I appreciate that. However, other things like idolizing him are definitely not my type. In this case I am neutral and do not care whether those words apply to him or whether Saylor is currently the largest investor in Bitcoin. He was a businessman and as long as the money he spent had significant profits, then so far he had only seen one side.",

I take whatever influencers says about Bitcoin with a grain of salt. They have no love for the technology but just to make money off it. Whatever you're building isn't their concern, as long as they make money, anyone else can burn. They have no moral values towards it. I can't depend on such a person to give me the right opinions.",

People who are experienced in financial markets don't publicly tell you what they are doing. When they tell you about that, they already did something before that, secretly and only let you and the crowd know when their plan is mostly done and they want to go to a net phase, hype the market and take profit.Saylor said many times that he will not sell Bitcoin but is it realistic to believe him?He and MicroStrategy did not buy Bitcoin like their jewelries and consider Bitcoin as what they will bring down to earth when they die. They bought Bitcoin to take profit, enrich their wealth so they will take profit in future.",

Regardless of the fact that some consider Saylor a very smart man with business sense - it is hard to imagine that 10 years ago he was quite pessimistic not only about Bitcoin, but also about online gambling. Even then, he was an adult with enough knowledge to understand that people will always gamble, as they have been doing for thousands of years.Of course, it is not realistic to believe that he will never sell the BTC he bought (and is still buying), but maybe he will sell only a part when the price is such that he will be able to return his total investment, and at the same time he will still have enough BTC left.",

Saylor is doing Dollar Cost Averaging for buying Bitcoin and he will apply DCA for taking profit his bitcoin too.I agree with you that he is smart enough to not dump all bitcoins he has on the market with one order or within one day or a couple of days. Doing DCA for exit price will help him to get better profit by don't have to find market tops and can avoid panic on the market because of selling pressure from Saylor and Micro Strategy.(SSS) - A Sane and Simple bitcoin Savings plan.SSS plan looks good for Saylor to take profit.",

I also searched the quotes of Saylor on the internet but they did not show up, At first I thought, the OP had mistaken it, but to be honest I don't trust the new website, as the BTCTimes website has few visitors (less than 50k). I think Op might have come to know about this news from this tweet of Paul Sztorc:https://twitter.com/Truthcoin/status/1716674000938512681As this post is only 1 day old. Well, thanks you for confirming the date, as I did not notice the date in the first place. Overall, you have already said to OP that Saylor has supported the BTC maybe back then he doesn't but the present and the future that most matter.",

If you post about public figures who think BTC doesn't have any value, the community would oppose such ideas, if you post about public figures who praise BTC, the community would appreciate them for their understanding of the network, that would always be the reaction because this is a BTC community. Michael Saylor was in the first category of people above, before he changed his ideas about BTC, and he is free to do that.I feel that since people can change their ideas at anytime, we should not dwell on what public figures say or do about BTC, for example Tesla were accepting BTC at one time, then they stopped saying nonsense about BTC destroying the enviroment.

Bitcoin does not care about who holds it nor does it have an entry barrier to accommodate the rich. It only recognizes the data and ensures that data is immutable. People who hold bitcoin also should not care who else is holding and should not allow anyone else determine their decisions made. Check the data which is publicly available and make a decision on it. Someone being rich enough to buy a bunch of bitcoins and influential enough to make a public show of it does not mean you should take advice from them.Do your own research!- Jay -",
