Also what is newbie jail just heard it lol.Newbie restrictions are basically called newbie jail in forum terms LOLAs a newbie a user can not post image, make posts in between 360 seconds, can not PM users and many more things that I can not remember. All these restrictions combinedly called newbie jail ðŸ˜‚",

I think no though I'm not sure. In case of logged in users, it's very unlikely I think because only a very few person uses the forum through TOR (guess without stats).",

Although, I always put it down my old laptop that was running on 8-12GB ram, and trying to run several virtual machines at once. Thus, potentially the requests were bundled up together. Interesting that you'd run into it on a normal computer setup. Since, I've now got a better laptop, and haven't run into this problem in a while. Specifically, I run into this when ctrl clicking the delete button. Since, I've removed the prompts. What exactly were you doing for this to ping up all the time?",

We had newbie jail, I guess it's not something to do with Legendary jail LOLI faced the same error 503 last year which i mentioned it here 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable, however in my case it says 503 Service temporary Unavailable while in your case it is saying a bit more precise error \"Too fast / overloaded\" but both error msgs have the same code 503.Also, this error has nothing to do with Legendary status, as anyone can face this issue. I would not call it an issue as a few minutes later it gets fixed automatically. A quick fix can be to close all the tabs, close the explorer or in some cases restart your computer.",

It was just an average day. But the error was showing so many times that at some point it was bothering me to create the topic. It was weird though. I can not remember if I had the same problem before but that was the only time and since then the error did not show up again.I will be concluding with couple possible guesses that I can make from the whole discussion.1. It could be the forum server which was overloaded 2. The same tor exit node used by a group of people at the same time.Quote from: UmerIdrees on December 17, 2022, 05:11:08 AMAlso, this error has nothing to do with Legendary status, as anyone can face this issue.I was sarcastic knowing that nothing to do with any rank ðŸ˜‰. It was clearly a server side error. Anything 5xx means it's an issue coming from the server.",
