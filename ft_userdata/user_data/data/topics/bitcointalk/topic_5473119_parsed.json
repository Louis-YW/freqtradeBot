      "body": "Hmmm this is an interesting question to ask. If I ever bet on an underdog and he knocked down his opponent in the first round, I'd probably risk it til the final bell rings coz if he dropped his opponent in the first round then he could do it in the following rounds. But one thing to consider is how did he knock his opponent, like a lucky punch, sucker punch but counted, accidental headbutt or just a counted slip then I'd probably think about cashing out after this. However, with Fury vs Ngannou fight I'm hundred percent on Ngannou on this, won't even think of cashing out if got dropped.",

Ngannou had so high odds that I would probably use cashout immediately. If cashout is attractive for me, I use it and if it only gives me 10% or similar cashback, then I simply risk because there is not much to lose but there is a lot to win if I risk.I don't know about Prograis vs Devin match but if I were you and I had an option to use cashout button during count that 8 seconds, I would push it if strike was very hard and I would also consider how often and how easily that person gets knocked out. There are people who have good chin and don't get knocked out easily. You have to consider everything when you make a bet or cashout decision.",

      "body": "I'd personally consider cashing out after that lucky hit and just watch the fight pan out on its own eventually. I know that in most cases in boxing, if one is already down for the count, there's a huge possibility that they cannot continue the fight, or if they can, they're already at a slight disadvantage against their opponent and will just lead to an eventual lost. Not to mention that it also adds to the points of the one who scored the knockdown. But personally, I want to be safe on the bet, and I'll just get the bread and watch the rest of the fight out of curiosity.",

In some fights one of the boxers will show more skills or they will look more fighting fit for the fight in the beginning... but the more professional fighter might be holding back to deliver a strong ending, when their opponent starts to get tired... so that strategy might fool some people to cash out early.",

Unless the underdog knocks out the favorite, the match is still anyone's game still and there are a lot of times that the winner have been knocked down or sometimes slipped so that's not a good indicator that the underdog might win, for me it's who is more consistent on landing power punches and aggressiveness, with that parameter it's more likely to know if the boxer is likely to win although given how corrupt the boxing federation is, there's a possibility that the likely winner wouldn't be declared the winner, look at what happened to the Ngannou vs Fury fight, didn't Ngannou knocked down Fury? Who's got the belt anyway? In terms of cashing out though, it depends for me because if I'm not betting a lot in the fight, I might not mind losing my money riding it out till the end but if I bet a lot and I can see that the amount I can get out is pretty significant then I might consider depending on the circumstances surrounding the fight.",
