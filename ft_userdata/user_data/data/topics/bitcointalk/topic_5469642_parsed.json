We were told the scheme will Foster peace and unity in the country. The aim of the programme has been achieved,  why is it still there?  Even the NYSC officials have compromised the whole process. The insecurity in the country is a major thing to be concerned about.  The government is only putting the live and future of Nigerian youths at risk. Especially those posted to States very far from their place of residence. On one hand too, the scheme has helped with connections as youths get to meet people from all walks of life, but then lots of youth have lost opportunities because they have to compulsorily serve the country for a whole year.  Instead of scrapping the scheme (because a lot of people will lose their job if the scheme is scrapped), NYSC should be made optional.",

To large extent, the scheme has recorded success over the years. Just that recent times, government policies haven't been too favourable with scheme, because they just post corper's to go and teach even when they are not trained teachers, some they post them to places that are not befitting for graduates.",

No graduate go de willing to serve in parts of di country wey insecurity de, because dem no want to be kidnapped or even killed. So for dis reason alone make me to de get a second thought on di relevance of di scheme, because of di wahala  wey de di country. Anoda reason be say if dem post coppers to a state wey dem no like, na so dem go bribe to put dem for dem preferred state. So if a copper go fit to decide where im wan serve, den di original plan of di scheme don de defeated again. Me I for prefer say make our government make di NYSC service to de optional, so fresh graduates go decide if dem wan do di service, instead being mandatory as e be now. Because as some graduates no need am, others de look forward to di service. Because of di high unemployment rate for di country I no surprise say many graduates go like to go for di service, to enjoy some government alawi for one year before dem go come face di hard reality of unemployment wey de wait for dem.",

Nigerian has gone a long way to scrap NYSC. This progress has been in existing for so long, according to what you guys said that it's functional was to bring unit among the ethnic groups in Nigeria which aim was Achieved. Forthermore it became a fun and salary was also included.Through this program many got a permanent work in their primary place of asigment. Some learnt skill where they were posted. Some got friends that help them to Achieve their goal after service. Some got married from the program. So to Everything that has a disadvantage also have an advance. We can't use because of the disadvantages and jump into conclusions.You said many died in their process of service, and some landed in prison. Talking about death, death is inevitable and people must die so death is not an excuse. the prison aspects. most people Landed in prison because of their atrocities. No one is above the law and if you think being an Nysc member give you the right to misbehave the law will take it causes.Quote from: Onyeeze on October 11, 2023, 06:02:31 AMI have not seen the essence of going to youth service again, because going to services is like wasting your time, and that time have to utilise by you by acquiring a skill that will help you because Nigeria government is letting us know that your educational qualifications can not get you job and you have to do another work that will give you a daily bread.No time is waisted. It depends on you, government can not do every for you. Normal one needs to aquire skill before going into higher institution, if you wear unable to achieve it before going, try to learn before coming back. And make sure the alawi given to you should be save for starting up something after service.",

During NYSC, several things are performed which are beneficial to the country at large. It brings about unity among youths even if wuna ethnicity differs. People from different part of the country are brought together to be one and work together. Skills are acquired too during the process which inturn will make you to be independent of the government and give selfless services to the community.During my youth service, I was taught how to make shoe by a professional which was very impact full. I was among the team that carried out awareness about HIV/AIDS, preventive measures for malaria and others to different communities in the state I was posted to.Am just baffled by some people saying they should scrap NYSC without putting it's importance in consideration. If it were to be scrapped, what will happen to the NYSC officials? Does that means they will lose their jobs forever?",
