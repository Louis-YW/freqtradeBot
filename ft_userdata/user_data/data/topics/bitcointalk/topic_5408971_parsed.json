  "content": "I have heard about online streamers and how they spend hours at their computer screen gambling and winning huge amounts of money. It looks fun because they get to earn money doing something they love. Positive feelings are generated when they gamble. Moreso, these gambling streamers also get a lot of views too. For example this this user - Coin_traderalready collated some data on how much viewers are interested in gambling streams compared to typical online games streams. However, with the little knowledge I have about the role that biological factors like dopamine and serotonin dysfunctions playing in fostering addiction1, I can't help but wonder if online gambling streamers ever get addicted to gambling. What do you think? And can the viewers who watch these streams tell if the streamer is addicted to gambling by observing some physical symptoms such as pale skin, weight gain/loss, acne and dark circles under the eyes?2References1. https://www.gatewayfoundation.org/addiction-blog/is-gambling-hereditary/2. https://www.algamus.org/blog/signs-and-symptoms-of-gambling-withdrawal",

      "body": "Hasn't this topic been discussed in another forum thread a week ago?1. Those streamers are probably promoting some casino, so they are basically gambling for free(the casinos pay them for promotion).Maybe it's easier to get addicted to gambling, when you aren't spending your own money? I don't know.2. I don't really think that the streamers are \"doing what they love\" all the time. Being a Twitch streamer is like having a job. You have to be consistent and do this every day. Some streamers get tired of this routine. There's no clear answer to your question. Do you think that the Twitch gamers get addicted to gaming? I don't know, maybe some of them get addicted, while others don't. Gaming is as addictive as gambling. It's kinda difficult to spot an actual gambling addict online. Most gambling addicts are really good at hiding their addiction.",

      "body": "Evidently YES because I watch a lot of streams and video about streamers turning to problematic gambler and lose all there funds in a single bet. This is understandable because they are always exposed to gambling and we know how addictive it was if you are doing it most of the time even if they are just doing it for stream. The problem is they still using real money and playing it in real life. They just stream it but that doesn’t mean they are different to typical gambler that don’t stream.",

But it also doesn't follow that since they are online gambling streamers, they will get addicted to gambling. Many of these streamers are primarily streamers rather than gamblers. They are promoters or marketers rather than serious gamblers. And they're paid as streamers. They're not simply wasting money. They're sponsored.",

But I think there are still online gambling streamers who are still addicted to gambling until now who have not been able to overcome their gambling addiction.

The symptoms may be the same as what other people out there are experiencing and they don't know if they are really addicted to gambling or not because usually they only know if they want to gamble.",

Are we certain that those are not just for promotion when they manage to win huge amount of money? I don't believe they are always winning when gambling because if they do, they must have some agreement between the casino that they will let him win to deceive people to use their platform which will definitely ruin his career if his viewers found out what he did.Quote from: Davidvictorson on August 07, 2022, 06:11:14 AMI can't help but wonder if online gambling streamers ever get addicted to gambling.

When it comes to addiction, IMO, I think it all depends on the personality of the person in question. If the online gambling streamer is someone who has a personality that is susceptible to addictions he may easily get addicted to gambling even without much engagements, but for someone that doesn't get easily attached or addicted to things, they are still at the danger of addiction but it may take longer exposure and engagements to their online gambling streaming activities.Quote from: Davidvictorson on August 07, 2022, 06:11:14 AMAnd can the viewers who watch these streams tell if the streamer is addicted to gambling by observing some physical symptoms such as pale skin, weight gain/loss, acne and dark circles under the eyes?2Viewers who are very observant and have been addicted before or know someone closely who was addicted and showed some similar physical symptoms can tell.",

It's like a constant reminder of sorts that you shouldn't let yourself completely loose but at the same time, let yourself loose. It's the middle ground so to speak and if you've been streaming other content for so long and gambling came in like later on, then you'd definitely be able to do this really well imo. And there's the issue that well, if they show negative signs they're entire career of streaming may go downhill and may even be sued or something, both by the company their advertising and the streaming platform (not sure about the streaming paltform though).",
