  "content": "BlackHawk v.2.0 + BlackHawk v.2.0 Linux---------------This is a version for mining 98% of different crypto currencies. (bitcoin,dwarfpool, ethermine2.0.org and other pools)Operating system Win7,10 x64, Win8 x64, Linux IOS.Capabilities:    - there is no need for a Dag file, it is automatically created on the GPU.    - high Dag generation speed    - a mining algorithm written from scratch gives an increase in performance, in comparison        with standard miner (best result for Kepler, Maxwell)The failover list options are functionally the same as the command line options.It is allowed to use only parameters in list parameters:-url , -wrk , -wlt , -emlThe algorithm for working on the failover list is as follows:The main address (Main) of the connection is the address specified on the command line.The addresses specified in the failover.txt file are secondary (failover). They are connected toif there is no connection to (Main) in the order of placement in the failover.txt file.When connecting to the (failover) address, reconnection to the main (Main) address occursonly if there is a stable connection to it, at least 5 seconds.LINK TO DOWNLOAD - BlackHawkMiner 2.0Using BlackHawkMiner is free.The values ​​of the local parameters overwrite the values ​​of the global ones!Use these command line options:-url Address and port of the pool. Only the stratum protocol is supported.        The character \":\" is the separator between the address and the port number.                    -wrk Worker name, required for some pools.        Example, -wrk 1-wlt Wallet number, needed for dwarfpool, for example.        Example, -wlt 0x98B079798640Bc175aF7E60b54b5cCec165dECC2            -eml Email address, required for some pools.        Example, -emlx-int Global. For all gpu.    GPU load intensity. Use 18 (default) if the GPU is used for more than just mining.    And 19, 20 for full GPU loading.        Example, -int 18-intg Local. Intensity for the listed gpu's.    Example, -intg g0 18 g1 20 (gpu0 will run at rate 18, gpu0 will run at rate 20, other gpu    by global option -int or by default.-wsz Global. For all gpu.    The number of threads per block. Values ​​must be multiples of 32. Use values ​​64, 128(default), 256    Example, -wsz 64-wszg Local. Number of threads per block for the listed gpu's.    Example, -wszg g0 64 g1 128 (gpu0 will run with 64 threads per block, gpu0 will run with 128 threads per block, other gpu    by global option -wsz or by default.-tsmg Locally. What architecture to configure the kernel (kernel) specified gpu. A two-digit value.    By default, the kernel (kernel) of each gpu receives a pointer equal to its compute capality. geforce gtx 1070,    having compute capability 6.1 will get pointer 61.    If for some reason the gpu does not start and the error \"FATAL ERROR GPU\" appears. Set value -tsmg    selected gpu to a smaller value. This applies to video cards with Pascal architecture.    Example, -tsmg g0 53lcg Locally. Use in mining the gpu specified in the list.    Example, -slcg g0 g3 Only use gpu1 and gpu3 for mining-ess Globally. Enable/disable the built-in statistics server. Enabled by default, equivalent to -ess 1    Example, -ess 0 Disable statistics server-pss Globally. Change the port for the statistics server. The default port is 10001    Example, -pss 8000 Use port 8000 for the statistics server.-toffg Locally. The temperature at which the selected GPUs will be suspended,    until the GPU temperature drops by 15C    By default, the stop temperature for all GPUs is 85C.    Example, -toffg g0 75================================================= ================================================Using the Etarstat Statistics ApplicationLINK TO DOWNLOAD - EtarStat 2.01) Launch the Etarstat application.    2) Add a miner using the <Add miner> button        In the window that opens, specify:        a) the name of the miner in Latin characters (of your choice)        b) ip address where the miner is located in IPv4 format (x.x.x.x)        c) the port on which the miner statistics server is located (by default, the statistics server uses port 10001)    3) Click <ok> If there are errors, the corresponding fields will be highlighted in color.The settings are saved when the Etarstat application is closed.    All miners are listed on the <Miners> tab    Miners from the list have access to operations from the menu by clicking the right mouse button:    -edit change miner settings    -remove remove the miner from the list    -view console view miner console    -restart miner restart miner with parameters    -quit quit the Etarstat application    The color of the Name field indicates the state of the miner    -red miner statistics server unavailable    -green statistics server is available, miner connection to the pool is stable.    -orange statistics server is available, but the miner is not connected to the pool.4) When you select a miner, the command line parameters with which the miner was launched will appear at the bottom of the window.       if necessary, make changes to the parameters and restart the miner through the menu.",
