'it will take time to secure all assets1:13:58 SBF parents gave legal advice and received payments which the committee is deeming to classify parents as employment1:35:35 the main trigger/cause of the FTX collapse was the unlimited ability by those in control of the co-mingled funds to borrow, take or deploy those funds for their personal use. such as margin(gambling) or spending of funds(real estate & lifestyle)3:00:43 after filing bankruptcy. employees (SBF & wang) moved funds out of FTX and they were not put into other FTX based accounts.(ill take a break here and watch more and edit later)",

A normal person takes a 1k loan and has to read and sign all the paperwork. This guy takes 1 billion with 0 interest like it's nothing and thinks he doesn't have to give it back. Then he wastes it all because he no longer has it and his net worth isn't even 10% of that loan so where the fuck is all that money? Looks like many people in the committee are having fun. They can't believe this is a real company. It all feels like a comedy until you look some victims in the eye and then see that chubby unfazed face of SBF. I'm not an antisocial person but if they were sentencing him to life in prison I'd feel nothing but joy.",

(lawyers+rents)(having funds in bahamas allows SBF a bit of freedom/escapism from personal debt. which explains the \"hack\" theft after the bankruptcy. as explained at the 3rd hour of my previous post)as for lifestyle stuffits why he went on a \"speaking tour\" of interviews this month to get paid Â .. but right now in jail he only has access to the commissary account to buy noodles and potato chips",

I am glad that details of this whole mess and the myriad of abuses that Sam and his minions committed is now exposed to the public so this can be serving as a big warning to people who got the same mindset or thinking as he has. Hope that soon people under Sam can also be arrested and prosecuted for the role they played in the FTX collapse.",

Poor SBF, the fact that he mismanaged billions of dollars had nothing to do with collapse, its someone else's fault.",
