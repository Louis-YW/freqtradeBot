Concept like metaverse project for now isn't really worth to invest since the tech currently not that advance and still small people that use metaverse thing. What the project you are talking about anyway",

Even with how potential the project is, without proper funding, good support, and unable to attract more investors, it might have a hard time achieving all those goals in the roadmap.",

Of course, a developer will say something promising in order to gain the trust and attention of the community making it believe that they can give the best thing possible. However, in many instances happens that they only just promise but have never happened in actual. This is why it was hard to determine if that project is worth investing in unless they will witness its performance. In fact, just like Bitcoin before, only it gains massive attention when it shows something different which makes people invest in it.",

In the past there were many projects that offered new technologies such as decentralized markets or metaverse technologies. This means that it takes in-depth research to see if the project is worth buying or if it will just be like several other projects that have failed.",

The only question is, is there any project who did that? There might be some in the past though I can't say the projects because I forgot them. I've seen projects in the past that offers a completely new technology, and it seems sustainable in the long run, but for whatever reason it is, it ends up as a failed project. Nowadays, a completely new concept is very rare already, and most of the new projects that are popping out of nowhere are just either a clone of an old project, or a project that integrates 2 use cases from 2 different old projects. I don't want to say that it's bad to copy, but that strategy will not be sustainable in the long run, and that's the reason why most of the projects are failing I think. Anyway, to answer your question on how to tell a new coin if it's worth investing in, there's no way to know it since you don't know the future of every new project. What's certain is that most of the new projects are ending up as a scam whatever the concept is, so in short it's hard to know.

Yes, it's quite understandable that NFT was originally advertised as: the blockchainisation of copyright; everyone could make all sorts of NFTs on the blockchain, but in reality it just created a lot of 'useless images'.I can't comment on the usefulness of this technology, as more than one blockchain exists.Maybe in some regions and countries, a great one exists.In addition, the term \"new technology\" in this context is only a concept, and does not specifically refer to a particular idea. As I replied to others, I'm trying to understand the market and I don't think it's a bad idea.",

Assess whether that new function is solving a problem that really exists. If it does, then you will not be \"able\" to get into buying it, because the demand from investors to grab some of it will be so high. If it does not, then its just another shitcoin in the cesspool. In most cases it will be the second one. Still if you are thinking that it might be good, observe it after it has launched and marketed for a couple of years before making the decision to buy some for your portfolio.Usually this type of tech comes once a lifetime.
