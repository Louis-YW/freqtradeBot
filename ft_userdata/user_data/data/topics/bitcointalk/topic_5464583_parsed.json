Then you build your pitch around that platform and the tools available to you there.Your pitch or ad regardless of the platform you post it in should be;CatchyProfessionalUniqueSelf explanatoryShould show your best angleIt should also be updated and not just reused over and over againYou can include banners or info-graphics if the platform you are marketing on allows it and it should also be done very professionally.This forum is a good place to get clients, specifically those willing to pay in Bitcoin. Head over to the Services[1] section and create a thread, but first look at other service threads and how they sell their skills to learn from others.You need to become at least a Jr. Member or purchase Copper membership[2] to post images here on the forum.You have a limited time to catch the eye of a potential client among thousands of other equally qualified ones and you should ensure your pitch gets their attention and holds it.Try to watch videos about marketing your skills and work using that to build yourself.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=credit;promote- Jay -",

I am a complete novice as regards freelancing and will like to know how best to set up a catchy profile that will be outstanding and unique one that will make my skills more marketable.I mean there are some platforms you could probably earn via freelancing but most of the popular freelancing websites on the internet just have online payments which is actually great already in my opinion since most of the clients are abroad or from other countries. If you are actually looking for a freelancing job you don't need to be lazy when it comes to payment, I mean it wasn't easy to find a good one online. I did try it and because of the pandemic freelancing jobs become more competitive and there are a lot of people who want freelancing jobs so if you have the skills you're going have no problem but if you're just getting started to this kind of job you gonna need to do the real work in order to create your portfolio and build your profile since reviews are important so that clients are going to hire you, as well as completing that deadline. So I just suggest you don't aim the cryptocurrency payment focus on building your profile and portfolio in order to actually start and earn, to make it your actual job or side hustle.",

Aside from those suggestions, you can post your service on the Services. Include all of your past works and projects that you've worked with as a full stack developer. Another idea is to visit every crypto company's career page like Binance career to see the openings that they have to see if the desired position you wanna fill is open and they have a slot for you. That's what you need to do if you find those crypto job marketplaces aren't too active at all. You have to go through each of them check all the openings that they have, so that's just the idea that you can start looking at crypto exchanges and so on.",

I am a complete novice as regards freelancing and will like to know how best to set up a catchy profile that will be outstanding and unique one that will make my skills more marketable.If you want to get started in the world of freelancing then first you'll have to learn some skills and master them at professional level. A freelancer always needs to have mastery over the skills that they are going to offer as freelancing services. I'm not sure about any such sites where freelancers get paid using Bitcoin, but only this forum is a place where freelancers can get paid using Bitcoin if they offer their freelancing services in services board of the forum. I would not consider this forum as a freelancing site because it has many threads which aren't related to freelancing at all and that's a solid reason for not calling it as a freelancing site.If you're very new in freelancing then first you need to learn about it and the best place to learn about freelancing is YouTube of course because many creators have already published great videos related to freelancing and those videos can be helpful for someone like you who is totally new to the field. I would also recommend you to read some books related to freelancing as those books will explain in depth that how a new freelancer should set-up his/her profile and how to make a best portfolio over time. I would recommend you to learn a skill from the basics and master it to the advanced levels and once you get confidence that you have completely mastered the skills then you should try to offer your services for free in order to get some rock solid review which would help you to gain more clients later on. The free offer will let others see that how good you're at that particular skill and you'll also get some public dealing experience by delivering those free services. The journey is a long one and you must have to do your best to be up to date with the skill that you have mastered because the competition is very tough at freelancing sites and only the ones will get clients who offer best service to the clients.",

One website nobody mentioned so far is Latium, I see they have lot of projects completed and they exist since 2017:https://latium.org/",
