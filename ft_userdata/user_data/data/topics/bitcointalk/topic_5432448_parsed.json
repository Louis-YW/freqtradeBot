I only know that tipsters only work for big tournaments wherein rich people are involved to betting since they are the ones who can manipulate a match and such. If it is just a normal sportsbetting wherein your highest bet is a thousand, I think it won't be worthy of doing so because it would seem you are buying other's opinion of the match itself instead of relying on your judgement given that it is your funds in the first place. I know many people here are seeking profit and are willing to spend that much but atleast be sure that it is worthy of your 'additional' investment.",

This type of bets is mathematically analyze to give +EV picks. This is not guaranteed win but user that betting on this value bets has a fair odds for the risk they will take. By betting on value bets consistently for a long time will give you a theoretical good return due to +EV.This value bets is the result of bookmakers having a mistake on placing odds. Services like oddsjam capitalize on this bets and share to there subscribers. This kind of tipster is profitable theoretically.",

But its your money you can decide to do whatever you want but be careful buying anything online since there are fake which they only got those from other group so you need to be more careful with that.",

In my opinion if someone wants to succeed in something he should study this field by himself. On this forum, as well as on the Internet there are people who share their predictions. If you don't want to make analyses by yourself, you can look through their prognoses absolutely free. And in my opinion it is the last thing, to resell tipsters' predictions.

Once we became a master we can also run our own tipster group and make extra money out of those lazy and greedy people who are looking forward to make money easily.",

I feared that there would be only random picks without explanations, but i like the fact that some of them at least explain why they chose their bets as they are. It gives the prediction instantly more credibility and depth. Because anyone can give random tips and then gloat how they were 100% right afterwards if they won. Even if they were secretly chosen totally randomly.",
