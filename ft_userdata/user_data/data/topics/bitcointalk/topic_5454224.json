  "content": "Greeting to you all my brothers & sisters from another mother. Omo, eh get wetin I just see now for the forum wey just capture my attention & need for me to write this article right now, bcos while doing my  normal activity for forum, I happened to come across one Turkish board wey just brow my mind, and wetin I see na how the Turkish board dey carry help their active forum members grow by giving merits to people wey just dey come up on a very low key wey nobody dey hear about am, wey the least post there get not less than 10merits, wey if na we Nigerians now, one Judas for don go cast am by creating a thread at either \"Mata\" or \"Bitcoin Discussion\". However, I know say we dey try wella for this our board, and I know say our senior men dey carry us along wella, but one thing I go like to talk be say, abeg make we no cast ourselves for this forum, because if you think say we bad, I bet you there are many other boards for this forum wey we no dey even do things up to 10% reach them, but yet they decided to keep theirs on the low key. Because one thing wey make me write this post as I see that thread be say if to say you dey put hear for radio, you suppose don hear say U.K govt don ban our Naija students from bringing their pple over during their studies just bcos one of our own go cast the update say many of our students wey dey go U.K no be bcos of the certificate oh, but na to get permanent work permit, and schooling is the most easiest way. And eh no make sense as such no for happen only if we been dey do our things on low key & not casting our updates anyhow on social media.Moreover, I know say \"Igebot\" dey try, \"Cryptoprenuerbrainboss\" dey try & same as \"Charles Tim\" dey try for this our local board with the recent monthly challenge wey top posters of the month below 1000merits are awarded merits so as to help us grow in our own little way as a new fresh board.So how is a link to the thread given below:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5156376.msg62145388#msg62145388And how I was able to understand the thread was that I was able to use Google translator to carry translate the thread from Turkish to English Turkish VersionQuoteÖncelikle şunu belirtmeliyim by rallier ve teramit'in açtıkları Merit başlıklarının Türk forumuna önemli bir momentum kazandırdığını düşünüyorum ve bugüne kadar foruma katkısı olup halen aktif olan arkadaşlarımıza ekstra bir motivasyon sağlamak için 3. Bağımsız Merit Başlığı'nı da ben açıyorum.Burada kendinize veya başkalarına ait değerli bulduğunuz postlar'ı paylaşabilirsiniz, her hafta merit vermeye çalışacağım arkadaşlar.Özellikle multi oyunlarına girmeyen ve bağımsız hareket eden, forumda özgün yazılarla değer yaratan üyeleri davet ediyorum.Forumda halihazırda aktif olan fakat uzun zamandır merit alamadıklarını düşünen arkadaşlar da varsa eski yeni gözetimi yapmadan onlar da mesajlarını burada paylaşabilirler.Türkçe bölümünde global forumdaki bazı tartışmaların da üzerine çıkan çok değerli yazarlar görüyorum, onları biraz motive ve teşvik edebilirsek kendi adıma çok memnun olurum.English VersionQuoteFirst of all, I must state that I think that the Merit threads opened by by rallier and teramit have brought a significant momentum to the Turkish forum, and I am also opening the 3rd Independent Merit Thread to provide extra motivation to our friends who have contributed to the forum and are still active.Here you can share the posts you find valuable for yourself or others, I will try to give merit every week, my friends.In particular, I invite members who do not participate in multi games and act independently and create value with original articles in the forum.If there are friends who are already active in the forum but think that they have not been merited for a long time, they can also share their messages here without the old new supervision.In the Turkish section, I see very valuable writers who go beyond some discussions in the global forum, I would be very pleased if we could motivate and encourage them a little.SUMMARY So in summary, the main reason for this thread be say in whatever we try to do here for this board, abeg make person no cast am, as no be only we Nigerians bad pass, there are other local boards wey worst pass us, but only just that they decide to put theirs on a low key. So abeg make we try be like them, & may God bless us all as we continue to dey work for the betterment and growth of Bitcoin and the forum. Amen",

My observation for this thing wey you bring now be say we selves fit run am but the major stumbling block go be lack of smerits. If you observe wella most of those people wey dem merit for that board na top people do give them merit. People like Ratimov and DdmrDdmr always Dey share merit there because na merit source dem be. How many merit source wey get here and if you check their allocation self small. Although apart from that most members here no like they give out merits here probably because of low quality posts.",

      "body": "Not only Turkish board but also in Pakistani, I have seen users that have ranked up to Full member or even more just because of the amount of merit the received from their local boards. And as for one of us going to Meta or Other section of the forum to post about it, that won't be an issue as it is not something Illegal or against the rule so they will only just end up fooling themselves there. Aside from that if you take a good look at those boards mentioned their language is impossible to understand without the use of a translator so that gives them more privacy but in the case of Nigeria board our pigdin is not that difficult to be understood by someone who knows how to talk english and msot times we make our post in english. I have seen a non-Nigerian merit a post here in the nigeria board more than once.Another reason we can't have somthing like that is due to the lack of merit source; to be sincere I don't fancy the idea of creating a thread for your psot to be assessed if a merit source (assuming we had one) comes accross one of your post and find it constructive he could just go through your post history and merit all those he deems merit worthy, because if a thread is created for post assessing you and I know that they will be so much abus in that thread as some users might be tempted to create an Alt account to become active here in the local board for easy growth.BTW, @CryptopreneurBrainboss I think it's time you reconsider applying to be a merit source because back then when you applied Nigeria section was just a thread but now it's a board so there is a high chance of Theymos accepting your application.",

Also the monthly review isn't recent, it has been there from the very beginning and even start self from the hangout thread as if you go back there you go see me meriting posts especially started topics. Monthly reward na just 10 but I dey send more than 30+ merits monthly for this boards although of recent e dun dey reduced shall as I no dey evey active for here but whenever I receive I dey throw am here especially for started threads. Now make we ask ourselves, all the merits wey we dey receive wetin we dey use the smerits do because I see Nigerian hot everywhere in regards to receiving merit yet the board they empty, leave topics but as you dey reply your brothers for here see say wetin him write good, YOU DEY MERIT AM?

The reason the reason why I just came to the conclusion that you were not a merit source was because of that thread I post above, at the end of the thread I was expecting some congratulatory comments there and since there were none I just copied the link thinking the application was still pending, which was a mistake on my path.",
