To my greatest surprise only few of them have heard about Bitcoin, but they don't understand how it bitcoin works. ¬† ¬†I will like Bitcoin to be adopted in my country as a ledger tender,just like El Salvador and Central Republic of Africa that are Bitcoin friendly. ¬†For this to be achieved,I have taken it upon myself to go extra miles,to start introducing Bitcoin and its basic concept to people in my locality and place of work voluntarily. If they have the awareness and understanding of how Bitcoin works and its Decentralization, then they can start giving a trial of investing or saving in bitcoin. ¬† ¬†From my locality and place of work, Bitcoin information will be spread to other places. ¬†¬† ¬†¬† ¬† If so many persons are involved in the Blockchain, when our government notice this,they will be left with no option than to embrace this new era ,believing they will be able to generate tax for the country. ¬† I have printed flyers and shared round for easy contact.

Most important is to share proper knowledge about Bitcoin. So they won't be misguided. Keep it up mate and help Bitcoin adaption.",

About investing, I think many will still doubt you on this not until they've fully understood what you're teaching them. That's okay but don't feel bad and down when those people who you shared with those brochures and invitations of yours will think like that. Many will tell you that they're interested and will praise what you've told them about bitcoin but in the application of the actual buying and investing, not everyone who said that will have to walk the talk.",

Simply show them what you can do, and the benefits of doing it, but don't tell them they need it. It's not for everyone, not in it's current implementation or state, and it almost becomes a little preachy when you come across as telling them why something's so great, and what they're missing out on. I find it a lot, spreading information is all well, and good or teaching someone something, but if it isn't being told or taught the right way, it can actually be detrimental.

El Salvador has legalized Bitcoin in his country but everyone in his country is legally aware of Bitcoin.So I think the role of the government of that country is immense in making the use of Bitcoin and the popularity of Bitcoin in a country.",
