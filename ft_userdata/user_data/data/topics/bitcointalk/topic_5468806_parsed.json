The state's minimum wage for all other workers — $15.50 per hour — is already among the highest in the United States.Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the law Thursday amid a throng of cheering workers and labor leaders at an event in Los Angeles. Newsom dismissed the popular view that fast food jobs are meant for teenagers to have their first experience in the workforce.\"That's a romanticized version of a world that doesn't exist,\" Newsom said. \"We have the opportunity to reward that contribution, reward that sacrifice and stabilize an industry.\"...",

One also may wonder what impact on the Californian Economy this raise may translate to.",

The California legislature continues to pull magic numbers out of thin air to gauge what the hourly wage of a fast food employee should be?You made an important observation Gyfts. An increase in the minimum wage might not affect government institutions but the private sector always bears the burden. Some businesses might struggle to exist, which could lead to the fall of some of them. Increasing the minimum wage leads to an increase in the cost of running businesses which might lead to the reduction of staff strength. However these businesses will transfer the burden of the increase in operation cost to the consumers. The price of fast food will increase to cover this cost. The last time the government increased the minimum wage in my country, my landlord visited me immediately. He congratulated me on the increase in my earnings and also informed me of his intention to increase my house rent. When I tried objecting, he drew my attention to the fact that there has been an increase in the price of almost everything in the country. Increasing the minimum wage is not the best economic strategy to improve the standard of living of workers.",

Increasing the minimum wage is not the best economic strategy to improve the standard of living of workers. There was a time here in Venezuela when regular increases of the minimum wage would lead towards an even rougher increase of the goods and services, not only because the reasons you mentioned, but also because our currency has been losing and sustancial percentage of the value through time.I am talking about prices of food increasing 100% in less than a week, people were desperate to buy as soon as possible or exchange for foreign currency. In such situations, it is not enough to increase the salary, enhancing production is a must, so the law of supply and demand won't flat the new salary.First one increased production and then after it has been successfully increased, one can increase minimum wage.",

If there is difference between those in the fast food industry and the general work force minimum wage, I think that will cause new chase of job to fast foods and abandoning of old jobs which will bring a little complications to employers. Workers like higher pay so maybe it should be made uniform . However, I understand it was meant to create value in the fast food workers so they are not treated as less value area to work in.",
