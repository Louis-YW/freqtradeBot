If you put $100k into bitcoin in 2015, you'd have had more than $50k last November.It's now a case of how much money you can get into an asset, it's how much you can comfortably HOLD in it.If you are able to, try to keep 3-6 months og an emergency fund away from anywhere you'll actually be able to touch it (such as a savings account) and then you should be a lot safer with any investments you make. Making investments that are too risky for your tolerance (or that are you can see yourself panic selling) might start to turn towards gambling and you may want to look up self help/therapy for that (attempting to fix a problem you don't have is better than ignoring one you do)",

It's not like we're going to just shoot up to all-time highs next month dude, take your time. Obviously we don't know how long we're going to stay in 'lower' prices, but the last bear market, it took almost 3 years to recover.Take. Your. Time. and manage your money responsibly. When emergencies come(hopefully not) and you're forced to sell your bitcoin, it will definitely hurt especially if you're selling at a loss. You definitely don't want that. In my first year of learning about bitcoin, I put literally everything to BTC as well; but the difference is that I was a fresh grad living in my parent's basement. I could literally lose everything and I'd be fine.",

You both are absolutely right. We don’t know when we are going to stay at these lower prices but it’s not like we are going to the moon next month. Not 100% but pretty sure we’re not. You always hear about how many BTC there is left in circulation and all of these big companies and whales are buying now a days so it creates a sort of panic and sets a “get as much as you can before their all gone” mindset. Not remembering that people are constantly buying and selling. Thanks for the reinforcing advice. I’ll keep reminding myself. Over and over and over. Lol",

The fiat converted to bitcoin every week should be for long term and not short term, in a way you will not even think of converting to fiat for like 2, 3 or more years.",

That means paying all your bills in full, maxing out any retirement fund matching you can get from your employer, paying down high interest debt, and having an emergency fund of at least 3 months expenses. Once you've done that, then whatever money you have left over each month you can start allocating to where you prefer it to go: Retirement accounts, fiat investments, bitcoin, etc. If at any point you find something from step 4 or 5 (bitcoin) starts encroaching on something from step 1 (paying your bills), then you have done something wrong and need to re-evaluate your priorities.",

I like your destructive behavior and am open to learn from you. Its a good thing you are not addicted to drugs or alcoholism but to Bitcoin investments. It is good you are investing and not wasting. Although it seems risky since you might not have any fund to fall back to when there are emergencies but I like your courage. But you must always consider your immediate family because investing all is more riskier when you have dependents. Hence it important that you have savings to take care of uncertainties. It would also be advisable to invest in other sectors. Diversification is important in investment because it helps in risk sharing.        Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on May 23, 2022, 09:25:12 AMThe general advice of don't invest what you cannot afford to lose holds true here.

Tips and advice appreciated.It all boils down to discipline and self-control. Foremost, you should assess, evaluate, and establish your boundaries and limitations in investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. You should allocate a certain amount only intended for investment or your relaxation doing bitcoin buying. Everytime you have money, make a list of the things you will budget your money to. List all of it form your necessities such as rent, groceries, and bills, savings, emergency fund, allowance, cash on hand, and investment purposed in crypto. Make an intelligent division of these in accordance to your lifestyle.You shouldn't let yourself be emptied out of cash because emergency situations can happen. You cannot rely on anyone but yourself in dire situations, hence, you should be prepared yourself. Having cash every time is important because there are certain businesses and establishments that don't accept card or e-money. Typically, these enterprises are the small and local ones.",

What I meant by over leverage is now the crypto definition. I meant over leverage as in putting more liquidity into assets that aren’t immediately available. Or to allocate too much into one thing. Yep, if I was to hoard cash savings like I did for Bitcoin in one month, I’d be doing ok, but it’s always in hind sight when looking at my budget for the previous month. I look at my investing category and go, “Jesus!!!” I needed to have this discussion because the more I talk about it, the more screwed up and ass backwards my actions seem. Thanks all for your kind words and advice. I consider myself done for the month except for the one weekly recurring automatic buy at the end of the month. I am going to work at this and also not try to watch the price so often as well, which I’m sure is a factor. If I see the price drop from 30k wick down to 25k again, I’m going to leave the house and leave my phone at home on purpose. Lol. It’s funny but not funny. But thank all of you for your input.
