  "content": "I apologize for the remake of the thread but based on the fact that some want funded and other want unfunded and the variation of designs (A, B, C or D)https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5410318.0based on the above thread, and that Smoothie is selling them in rolls - I have asked him if he would set some rolls aside while I gather funds. This is to provide the availability to those interested in getting a set but are not wanting to get a full roll.Quote4-COIN SETSrandomly selected MATCHING # ROLLS of 20 of all FOUR COIN types (80 coins total)PRICE = 0.18 BTC This puts the cost at .009 per set - the sets will be unfunded. Shipping will be handled once I have them in hand and will vary per individual based on whether they are in the US or international.Please post below how many sets you are interested, whether funded or unfunded, in and then specify which which design you prefer A, B, C or D (we are going to go with majority rules)There is no confirmation but Smoothie may do a 10 coin set - if you are interested in this set instead - then state it as such but then do NOT send any funding - if Smoothie confirms that he will issue 10 coin sets, we can add that at a later date.  ‚Äî this has already taken placeLooks like we will go with one 4 roll set of unfunded and one 4 roll set of fundedcost per unfunded set is .009 BTC cost per funded set is .049 BTCsend in payment to the following address: bc1qn37ly2yjla0thlnfsverzezrvxtxdsyvecp4esDO NOT SEND PAYMENT TO ANY OTHER ADDRESS EVEN IF YOU RECEIVE A DM FROM MEplease also include your txn id or send it to me in a DM",
