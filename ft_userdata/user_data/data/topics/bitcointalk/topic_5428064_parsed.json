  "content": "If we are to go by this recent update from gcko.io on binance and cz ¬†then their is likely going to be another melt down. The US prosecutors are at it again in their usual clampdown on Crypto currencies and exchanges thereby causing a drastic drop in the Crypto market. If binance should be conducting kyc for members onboard their platform how come they could not detect the money laundering activities going on onboard their platform. As it stands now, this would definitely cause another panic in the space as binance is the world leading exchange so therefore it would not be too long we would be up to hearing another news again. This year has been very rough and turbulent for the Crypto industry as it has it downs more than it it's up as it could mention or think of. Do remember the \"not your keys not your coin\" movement to safeguard your assets and funds.https://twitter.com/coingecko/status/1602283556633382914?t=T8vH06NLrciOV2OH1szWgA&s=19https://twitter.com/coingecko/status/1602283554536361985?t=ZCxAOsLgyz5ttWpgwu51zQ&s=19",

There were several methods before that they provided, and I doubt if the authorities don't know even those exchanges apply without the approval of the authority as the exchanges standard method. But when it comes to facts there are millions trading stolen identities and verified accounts out there.Criminals are always one step ahead of the police when it comes to ideas.",

We are surely doomed, by the end of this year 1 BTC may not be worth even $1 - but sir, that's good, isn't it? Everyone will be able to buy a whole bunch of BTC and be super rich when the price skyrockets again - of course with the help of your ultimate savior and leader Mr. Mars",

Binance policies have changed over the years and became more friendly or cooperative to the regulators so that may be considered as well. This may end in a settlement should the Justice Department file a case.",

If a squabble between a centralized exchange and government authorities is what it takes to push users to decentralized platforms, then that would be a welcome development, but I'm not that optimistic. Users would switch to other CEXes for the main time and even move their funds back to finance one the dust has settled down.",

If we find out that Binance gets attacked or bankrupt in anyway the FTX saga would be considered less to what may happen.But more dump of the market and some see the opportunity in such situations like the dump where they make profits.Could it be that because they refused siding FTX who have been links to banks and governments, they are now being targeted, I hope that's not what is going down behind scenes.Binance or not, exchnages will remain the same it's advice to go full self custody else we are seeing more people loosing fund's which would be a bad one for crypto adoption.",

It‚Äôs barely a month after FTX saga went down, now the US is gearing towards Binance. I personally think this isn‚Äôt about the credibility of the exchanges, let‚Äôs be honest the government do not give af about Binance mode of operation. Let‚Äôs not forget that Binance were forced to imposed KYC on its customers by the same US government. This is a ploy to destroy crypto exchanges and promote CBDCs. The centralized exchanges are coming under the heat because they are more popular and ofcourse centralized so they can easily be persecuted, when they are done with CEX, they will find a way to attack the available DEXs",

We've already been in this for about 14 months. About time for the struggle to end.People will finally learn after 12 years of watching cryptocurrencies that they shouldn't hold money on exchanges and that it doesn't matter what scam gets exposed as long as your money is safe far away from it.
