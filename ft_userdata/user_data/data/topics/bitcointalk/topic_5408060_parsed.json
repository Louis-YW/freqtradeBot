You post should read that you are willing to send first to large traders to prove yourself, not the opposite.People are actually funny though, a friend who works as a P2P Merchant on Bitget, Â Binance Â and OKX was sharing with me how people place order with him on OKX and end up telling him to release coin so that they can use it for Arbitrage and then pay him for than the actual price after theyâ€™ve sold it. It still ball down to the level of security on the exchange. Â How will I release coin without being paid just because you promise to pay after you sell my own coin ðŸ˜‚ even someone who is not smart naturally will be smart in such situation.",
