  "content": "I apologise if this has already been answered somewhere. But I'm having trouble finding best practices instructions for installing the bitcoin daemon (bitcoind) on a Linux Server (Debian 11).Requirements:No miningNo full nodeThe daemon should connect to the network via a VPN or TOR (both are present)I'm interested in a watch-only service that provides the complete blockchain online for me personally. I would like to be able to use RPC commands, e.g. to query the balance of a specific address. I have solid experience with running Linux servers. No experience with running Bitcoin services. My understanding so far is that the bitcoin daemon is included in the Core Client and can be started independently of the QT client. Thank you for your attention.",

Yes, bitcoind will run independently, and you can communicate with it using RPC or other methods.

You will not need everything of and you may skip certain Raspi specific things along the setup. I have done this on an Ubuntu box and it works just fine.A pruned blockchain will have its limitations on certain RPC commands, so it really depends on which things you're going to query.",

Quote from: ETFbitcoin on June 11, 2023, 09:59:53 AMMaybe OP wanted to say he want to run pruned node.In fact, I don't know exactly what a full node is. In the meantime I have done some more research and I think the option \"blocksonly\" does what I want (only download blocks and ignore unconfirmed transaction). I would like to limit the network traffic for the time being. And now maybe another stupid question: The Bitcoin Daemon doesn't do any mining? I haven't found any option with which I can switch off mining. As far as I understand, the mining software runs separately and only uses the Bitcoin Daemon to communicate with the network. Is my understanding correct? In that case, there would be nothing else for me to do at this point, because I don't want to mine.",

Yes, the mining commands generatetoaddress or generate do not automatically run since it's only recommended to use in RegTest.And AFAIK, even in the old versions, the \"Generate Coin\" option wasn't toggled on by default.",

You can use the listunspent RPC for addresses in legacy wallets or the scantxoutset RPC if you're comfortable with descriptors (it does not require creating any wallet file), and then add up the resulting \"address\" fields in the array.This method also lets you get the balance of some or all the addresses as well, and in the case of descriptors, even an extended public key.You can even get the confirmed balance by ignoring every item with confirmations field set to 0.",
