      "body": "If the face can be interpreted as a barcode then this barcode can surely be turned in a bitcoin wallet address. By using a brain wallet generator you can turn any aphaneumeric string to a bitcoin wallet address. An open source and audited project must be used do do that though otherwise other issues could be introduced. But even if we assume that some facial ID device is always to print out the same barcodes for each face... How about if someone else scans your face from a picture and gets your private key? This is a very fundamental issue with this. If your private key is your face then you have a useless address because anyone that has even captured your face would have access to your funds. Address generation is meant to be based on private data.",

      "body": "No, it's not possible to generate a Bitcoin address using a face share barcode. Bitcoin addresses are made up of a series of letters and numbers, and they can only be generated using special software. A face share barcode is simply a visual representation of information, and it cannot be used to generate a valid Bitcoin address. It's worth noting that some services may allow you to generate a Bitcoin address using a QR code, which is similar to a barcode but uses a different type of technology. However, a QR code does not use a person's face or other identifying information.I think what you're asking about is something called \"biometric identification\" or \"biometric authentication\". This is a type of technology that uses physical characteristics, such as a person's face or fingerprint, to verify their identity. While this technology is often used for security purposes, it is not used to generate Bitcoin addresses. The reason for this is that Bitcoin addresses are designed to be anonymous, and using biometric identification would go against this design. Additionally, there are potential security risks associated with using biometric identification, as it could be possible for someone to steal or fake a person's physical characteristics.",

On top of that, you have the idea to use your face/ appearance as where you store encrypted bar code for your Bitcoin public address. Everyone will know you are the owner of that address, IRS will find you and  you can be kidnapped or killed by criminals too.If you use faces, photos of other people, it is immoral.",

Well, in that video his companion share that people are creating bar codes with creative designs like symmetric designs.Well, if those bar codes with such designs can work then a human face can be designs in bar codes too. Because bar code consists of black and white dots that are captured by the reader and then translated to understand the meaning. Which mean a code is being decoded, but talking about BTC address, I think it can be made but it might require technical skills and we might have to hire professionals to do the work.",

Because once you have the entropy you can simply generate the private key and address as usual.However, there are two problems with this. First, this will only make one key because people's facial data generally don't change without plastic surgery and other extreme stuff. Second, the algorithm has to make sure that there aren't random variations in the entropy which would result in the private key getting lost (by means of a different one being created instead).",
