      "body": "I finished writing in June 2022. During this time, the concept of NFT is relatively popular, so when NFT is mentioned, it is mentioned as a bookkeeping tool. Summary: The core value of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is consensus.  The article expounds a path: use the consensus ledger to record consensus changes, and different people can participate in collaboration through the consensus ledger, so that fragmented and decentralized activities form an overall activity.  This process distributes risks and rewards to each line of the ledger, giving decentralized organizations a significant advantage.  This is the specific path in which Bitcoin is used.",

      "body": "SummaryWe believes that \"consensus\" is the core of forming decentralized organization activities; the \"consensus\" carried by the accounting book is the key to forming broad and universal distributed autonomy.=1.  Ledger and Consensus  (1)  The ledger carry consensus  (2)  Ledger and consensus are decentralized  (3)  Ledger and Consensus Updates（4） Changes to the ledger and consensus（5） Diversity of ledger and consensus（6）Competition for bookkeeping rights2.Risks and benefits（1） Risk（2） Benefit（3） Dynamic balance of risks and benefits3. Accounting aids（1） Simplify bookkeeping（2） Modular packaging（3） Main book and branch book（4） Other toolsDecentralized organizations decentralize risks and benefits, and all participants take the risks and benefits of each row in the ledger around consensus. Even if a certain row of the account book encounters stagnation, what follows is the dynamic adjustment of risks and benefits brought about by the consensus adjustment of the account book. Just as if the price of pizza is raised, someone will take over to fill in the account book, so if the risk is lowered and the benefit is raised, someone will work hard to fill in the next line of the account book. This means that in the decentralized organizational system, all problems are only the balance of risks and interests of the current bank of the account book. By adjusting the risks and interests of the current bank, they will definitely be solved after a certain period of time, and the problems will not be accumulated to the next row. Under the background of the current development of human civilization becoming more and more advanced, many complex problems and difficulties in the future may only be solved by means of decentralized organization.4.
