  "content": "Seeing in another thread that hashrateproducts is probably an alt account of two other accounts, I took a look at the post history and there is something that is interestingly striking. The account was created on April 26, 2013, by someone located in Vancouver, BC.Almost 100% of the posts in that first stage were written in Computer Hardware and the few that were not written there were written in CPU/GPU Bitcoin mining hardware. The guy ran a website https://www.hashratestore.com/ which is still up and running but looks like it has been sold and today has little to do with hardware sales. In the post history there is a gap between 2014 and 2017, where in 2017 hashrateproducts returns to the forum to write a single post in the Computer Hardware section, then there is another gap until 2022 and here comes the interesting part. From here on almost all posts are written in the Gambling section, mostly in soccer related threads. It is clear to me that whoever is managing that account today is not the one who created it.",

In the case of Blackened515 and Lordhermes, when the Martyns case came out they were linked as possible alt accounts, and I remember that I ended up changing the feedback from negative to neutral in their cases, as for example Lordhermes gave a plausible explanation.I have tagged most accounts as well, but in the case of Lordhermes it is not so clear to me, as it is not the same to deposit in the same wallet as it is to send funds from one address to another. Why do you think this proves they are alts?Quote from: nutildah on August 26, 2023, 09:18:02 AMInterestingly the chain continues backward to include a high profile bounty manager, but without more evidence connecting them to the farm I won't mention them by name.I imagine you are thinking of a high profile bounty manager who lives in the same country as those who manage these accounts, but you have to think that he has been running an exchange service for a long time, although I see the thread locked now. So, receiving transfers from members of his local board is normal I think. I would be very surprised if he was in any trouble.",

Rest of them- blackened515 and omgitshehe never approached me to remove the feedback which was a bit surprising as if the account owner doesn't cares if he loses this account as he has still got lots of these accounts. I have yet to update these feedbacks but I have actually put off Lordhermes from the ring connection because he proved to me that he was just doing some exchanges which got him linked to them. Possible that the transaction you got ^^ could be an exchange one but do verify this with Lordhermes. As for these accounts, I am also sure the one behind owns lot of accounts and probably has a team like the pic we had with group operating the alt accounts to earn from signature campaigns (it would be fun to have that back here again to know what we are dealing with  ). I would suggest picking some boards these alts have heavily participated in and look for low UIDS or someone with gaps in their post history and maintain a list to track these accounts and take necessary action.Quote from: nutildah on August 26, 2023, 09:18:02 AMIts no doubt in my mind all of these accounts belong to the same person.

Games results were battling and brilliant to some extent, like Tottenham trashing Southampton 4 goals to 1, Fulham drawing Liverpool 2-2. Chelsea managing to beat Everton 1 nil. I really enjoyed every bit of the premier league.(Archive.is: https://archive.ph/qTv88#selection-4086.6-4189.532)Quote from: blackened515 on June 11, 2022, 03:06:52 PMQuote from: Lordhermes on June 11, 2022, 08:42:22 AMZidane is set to manage PSG next season according to reports.Zidane is seen as one of the best coaches in the world,and PSG has suffered incompetency in the aspect of the coaches that manage the club,considering the high profile players at the club.Lionel Messi,Neymar and Mbape are three big recognised names in the club,and yet,they are unable to win the champions league,therefore,it is understood that if a good coach like Zidane should manage the team,there is every possiblity that PSG will win the Champions league.PSG were not able to reach the final of the Uefa champions league final last season,and all were narrowed down to the incompetency of the manager.Zidane will bring a new dimension of football to the club,and I believe his tenure will be the best.Zidane is considered as an experienced coach, who can probably take PSG to the Champions League final, and possibly make them lift the Champions League trophy. Yes, we all expected them to struggle for the title last season since they had one of the strongest squad. But, Unfortunately they couldn't. Although, Zidane will have to introduce a new strategy that will enable them to resist other tough teams which they might encounter next season, and also help them in win consistently in their games.(Archive.is: https://archive.ph/rzU9h#selection-8563.0-8571.500)You guys will find more posts like this. I am not sure how campaign managers sees this but that's for definitely not the right way to use the forum. Clearly they are doing anything for the sake of earning money.Who knows maybe in dire need of money they can use one account to escrow and on other one to start the deal and then scam. That's one account gone and then go to next one.Some of these accounts have been neutral marked by JollyGood for gap in history and there has been once instance where lovesmyfamilis has poked him too at his attempt to get into campaign by increasing merit count on the application post.My opinion: I think this is a big alt ring, Martyns is just a piece and there could be lot more. Right now my impression is that he just wants to earn as much as from signature campaigns and therefore he posts every chance he gets. Even if there is none, he creates one. I mean look at the address: https://explorer.btc.com/btc/address/33GPgbaJuSaMyBo8tuhe6HhRunptrE8xVS , there is 0.166BTC (approx $4,800) being moved to that wallet. That's not how forum is intended to be used. Is it? In addition to that, the one I have my suspicion on has been part of the campaign for 100 weeks and believe me its a good paying campaign as I have been part of that earlier. There are some more (including 1xbit one I mentioned above) but its based on just not much strong links I guess but I am still digging on those.Everyone should be given chance to explain themselves so I asking @blackened515, @LordHermes and @omgitsmehehe to post here to explain the situation here and will see how the community sees this.Further down the thread:Quote from: FatFork on April 28, 2023, 12:32:04 AMWhile analyzing the posting patterns of \"martyns\" and his alternate accounts, \"BlackViruse\" and \"Blackpussy,\" I stumbled upon a curious grammatical mistake where the term \"ideal\" was wrongly used instead of \"idea\". This error caught my attention since I've never encountered anyone from the English-speaking community who confuses the usage of these words.

As for what to make of it, I have a hunch that it might give someone some ideal worth exploring further.  You go on to explain that you were making P2P transactions with these other accounts, but on the BSC side there's more going on than that. If that story was correct, then 0x9e78Cb2DC4e38d5Ce920fE32Ba9E70F2C65f1528 would be your address, but it seems like you are entirely unfamiliar with it... What's more likely is these are all your alt accounts.Edit: here is direct proof of ban evasion, although it won't hold up with the mods because you already deleted one of the posts:Quote from: 9jaspyware on January 07, 2020, 09:45:56 PMWeek 1.Twitter campaignTwitter Profile: https://twitter.com/oficial_lytaFollower Count: 11400...9jaspyware is banned, thus this is pretty clear cut ban evasion.Further connections:Quote from: 9jaspyware on January 02, 2020, 10:59:07 AM#Telegram CampaignBitcointalk Username: 9jaspywareTelegram Name: @lesor506Language: English Quote from: Blackvirus on November 20, 2019, 08:17:32 PMProof Of AuthenticationBitcointalk Username : Blackvirus BitcoinTalk Profile link : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2701999;sa=forumProfileTelegram Username : @lesor506ERC-20 wallet : 0x254DC0c2C3c5Bd72A2866210347C8130f644c08eQuote from: lesor on October 09, 2019, 06:24:11 PMProof Of AuthenticationName of Bounty Campaig : TwitterBitcointalk Username : lesorBitcoinTalk Profile link : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1917921;sa=summaryFacebook Profile link : https://free.facebook.com/lesorjTwitter Profile link : https://mobile.twitter.com/im_tlandaTelegram Username : @lesor506ERC-20 wallet : 0x254DC0c2C3c5Bd72A2866210347C8130f644c08eQuote from: Kumasi on December 05, 2019, 06:24:34 PM#proof authentificationBitcointalk username :kumasi Telegram: @lesor506Finally, on the Ethereum side of things, there are several transactions between addresses belonging to Cryptohermes05 / Lordhermes and an address shared by lesor, Blackvirus and 9jaspyware:",

      "body": "Great job nutildah and FatFork. In the end, the conclusion I draw from this is that where there is smoke there is fire. As much as I have been labeled as aggressive when tagging, if you see that there is an account that has broken the rules in some way, and evidence starts coming out that he has alts, and that one of them was banned, etc. in the end it is because that account is untrustworthy.Being \"aggressive\" myself, I changed the tag on Lordhermes from negative to neutral because he gave a reasonable and plausible explanation, which has been dismantled thanks to your analysis.And the bad thing is that we don't find out even half the things that happen here, first because some rule breakers will be careful enough to do it without leaving traces to get caught. And another because of the general lenient approach that we have to treat these cases as if it were a murder case and not red tag someone unless there is evidence beyond all reasonable doubt. Add to all this not tagging people for having bought the account, or asking for a loan without collateral being a newbie, things like that.",
