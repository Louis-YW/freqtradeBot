It might be somewhere, but I don't think it makes sense because:First, if the centralized wallet is set to open source, it will open its own security vulnerabilities to a certain extent. The data displayed on the application is reflected from their servers which can generally be hacked, or even abuse the application system without touching the server at all.Second, usually they will protect the code from plagiarism especially from competitors. They simply gave a \"copyright\" reason.",

Yes, wallets like coinbase SDK is open source, and it was said to be self-custody wallet but I don't see them being self- custody. Nevertheless, wallets are either non-custodial or custodial. It's not called centralized like an exchange or crypto project.Quote from: Harchive on October 02, 2022, 02:04:33 PMWhich one do you think makes more sense? Decentralised and open source or Closed source and centralised? The best wallet is the open source non-custodial wallet because every flaw will be reviewed by the public and you're in control of your fund but you can also use a closed source wallet that's non-custodial wallet if you trust the dev team.Quote from: Harchive on October 02, 2022, 02:04:33 PMBecause I believe if a wallet is closed source then it's centralised, wrong ot right? Drop your opinions. That's wrong. There are a lot of closed-source wallets that are non-custodial an example is the Trust wallet. Although the dev team said it is open source but there's no code provided till now.",

Regardless of whether you use the wallet from your personal computer or access it through a web interface or mobile app on a web server, the wallet software is centralized.

Decentralised and open source or Closed source and centralised? Because I believe if a wallet is closed source then it's centralised, wrong ot right? Drop your opinions. Open or closed source doesn't affect how decentralized or centralized the system is. Open/close source is for how the code was save to its repositories. In open source, people or devs can check and see the code, while the other is the opposite. Being decentralized platform is something how the process is and how safe it is, that's why being open source for a decentralized platform is something necessary. On the other hand, a \"decentralized platform\" as a closed source is suspicious and should not be trusted but still subjected since it will depend on what company it is being used.",

Maybe a better term instead of \"centralized vs. decentralized\" would be \"self-custodial vs. custodial\". \"Self-custodial\" would mean that you'll own your private keys, while \"custodial\" would mean that someone else except you is managing the private keys for you and you are not owning these private keys. Classical \"not your keys - not your coins\". The term \"centralized vs. decentralized\" is better suitable for a comparison between Uniswap (Decentralized exchange) and Coinbase (Centralized exchange). While open source (code is publicly available) isn't directly related to \"self-custodial vs. custodial\", there are still wallets where: 1.) you'll own your private keys but the wallet is not open source (Exodus wallet) = self-custodial + closed source2.) you'll own your private keys and the wallet is open source (Electrum wallet) = self-custodial + open sourceWhile I would go for 2.), point 1.) is still by far better than a centralized exchange, where you don't own your private key. But 2.) is clearly my choice and all Blockchain experts will agree here.",

When you run a full node on your PC you become a \"peer\", in other words you don't have authority over anybody or anything, you are just an equal to everyone else running a full node.Being centralized means there is a single central authority making decisions like in case of services such as exchanges where the owner makes all the decisions.",

Example: Electrum is open source while trustwallet afaik is partially closed source.Centralized/decentralized terms are mostly used for networks architectures. The peer-to-peer architecture is decentralized where each peer/node has the same privileges and can't impose its rules on other peers on the same network.
