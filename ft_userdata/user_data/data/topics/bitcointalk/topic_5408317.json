Bitcoin HODLing during a price crash and/or a bear market can be considered HODLing as well.You make profits or loses only when you sell. This is basic rule in crypto trading(and maybe stock trading as well).Keeping an asset with a price, that is dropping might make you think that you are losing money, but in reality you lose money only when you sell at lower price than your buying price.",

Value is what we are aiming for. But these days, value is measured by how much USD is it. That's why. It will be difficult to make it as a currency like fiat as long as the volatility is intact but there are merchants who are taking this risks just so they could prove it is a currency and also an asset at the same time. Do we really need to define Bitcoin if it is an asset or a currency? USD is being stored by most people outside the US because of its high value in their area. Does that mean it is an asset although it is fiat?",

If we say that when it adds up (that is when there is increase in value) then it is bitcoin and reduction by inference to what you are saying means it will be fiat, no it is not to be taken as that. The volatility of bitcoin is what makes it different and when the value goes bear, it also bitcoin that is why people are having it as store of value and buy more when the price drops.It won't be regarded as fiat if it drops because at that point it still retains the characteristics that makes it bitcoin especially that it is not controlled or regulated and whatever will make the value increase is independent of any government control .",

Because bitcoin has not yet matured to such a level where it can derive the price of service or goods using the unit of bitcoin. It has to be derived on the fiat value. So bitcoin is on its right track. What Satoshi did is phenomenal. But when it comes to free market dynamics, a lot can change. That's exactly what happened to bitcoin. People preferred it as an investment than a currency. So be it!",

No matter what happens, a large segment of the population will always HODL BTC due to them lacking any other option. I don't think anyone is HODL'ing fiat. Everyone is in crypto, commodities, real estate or precious metals. US stock and bond markets are having their worst year in 50 years. The US dollar isn't doing well versus inflation, even if FOREX exchange rates are good.Loans are another good option. As long as the inflation rate remains higher than the loan APR.

Holding BTC which is a decentralized digital asset where no one is in control of your funds while the value is volatile which is either good or bad for investors as it might fluctuate up or down. Holding Fiat which is a centralized currency where the government can control your fund however the value isn't as volatile as Bitcoin. As we can see, security, control, and value are the upper hand for holding BTC. However, we must also think about the use case of fiat and BTC as not every establishment will accept bitcoin or any crypto payments unlike Fiat where you can use it to buy anything and anytime.",

Personally, I don't really care whatever usage people see fit on their bitcoins. It gives them options then it's good for them. At the least, they are seeing that fiat is not the only way to go for your transactions and traditional assets that they offer mainstream aren't the only ones that you can invest in. For me, it's the freedom that bitcoin gives to the unbanked that matters most, and not the use-case that each individual see on bitcoin.",

It's actually better when the price is down low and suppressed because it means more people are likely to use it for it's original purpose, as a functional universal currency outside of central banks for trading across borders. Speculators can actually be detrimental to the health of cryptocurrency, because they disrupt the price and make it majorly unstable - scaring away regular functional users. Speculators are also just the type of people who like taking short cuts or finding get rich quick schemes, so they'll quickly abandon it if something new comes along.",

I agree with your first part here that bitcoin should be viewed as a currency, and that’s something I’ve felt firmly about for some time, but your second part here I don’t agree with. You don’t have to be a high earner to buy bitcoin, even if it’s a little part of one’s net worth, if bitcoin goes up in value, it doesn’t matter if you’ve got a million dollars worth or 100 dollars, either way the % gain will be the same.",
