Use your feelings to choose the right topic to get involved and facts to answer. Remember this is forum and this is the place to socialize with other forum user based on the topic given because you can easily use google to search for an answer if we are only posting a content here with facts alone without human emotion. Being happy, sad, angry towards some reply here is normal as we are human. Forum is simply our hangout spot for all Bitcoin/shitcoin enthusiasts.",

The way the forum counter articles or post that lack facts have actually been why it's being doing great. If you share a bad info here and because of hurting your feelings it was left uncorrected it will lead many to live into the post as facts, feelings shouldn't be mixed with investment and some people pick points from the forum to excute in real life The usual corrections by this experience members shouldn't been taken as criticism even if the words used might be harsh.",

You must be strong while trying to grow, your emotions must be kept under control and you must not give up when criticism comes to make you stronger. Ask yourself if that's all you can do? Then put the pedals close to your feet, avoid a lot of hesitation and reach for it.Ideally, constructive criticism is needed but you should stay on the axis of having strong assumptions as long as you really know what you're doing. Motivation is important, besides your journey is still long and don't give up.",

All this came your way for a reason if you ask me and many of us has experienced it.But the truth is that many newbies aren’t learning from the replies they get, you shouldn’t keep making repeated low Brain post. There are pinned post that even require you to read them before start posting, you don’t post low logical post and never expect criticism and you shouldn’t cry over it but learn through it.",

Neither of these things alone is going to be the solution, or even the key factor in avoiding online trolling. But they are certainly a good place to start. Debate is healthy and important in society, but what is more important is providing quality information to people instead of baseless opinions. That said, if you cannot accept people's opinions and beliefs, I do not see how a discussion could ever be worthwhile. But if you can agree to disagree in this way, then the conversation will hopefully be able to move forward. My recommendation is to approach an online discussion with a balanced approach, acknowledge both sides equally and not solely from your PoV.",

There is still more to learn and at another stage you will understand that it is neither feelings or facts, it is being your real self.  Whether you are having feelings or you are rendering facts, you do it as your real self without fear. Then you will appreciate the blessings that comes with being able to do anything (possibly right things) without fear of intimidation or what people will say.",

I mean everyone should agree to disagree on every topic.
