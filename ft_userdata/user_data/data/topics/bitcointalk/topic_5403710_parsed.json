  "content": "If you guys are into a cross-chain future, sort of like the one being built by THORChain, then you guys are probably interested in the fair launch of the $CACAO token for Maya protocol, a THORChain alternative built to move native assets across blockchains. This launch will be done via the liquidity Auction model, where anyone can contribute supported assets, this will be done in a 21-day timeframe by sending them to a specific address (no KYC), also, no swaps and no withdrawals will be allowed during this period, only adding and withdrawing liquidity!all $CACAO tokens will be distributed to the participants proportional to their actual contributions, and then users end up with their $CACAO tokens.Why will Maya use this model to launch? Boosting decentralized liquidity even further, and allowing the opportunity for anyone in the DeFi space to participate, without any minimum entry ticket, and no special allocation for larger investors this really seems like a golden ticket into an incredibly promising project.https://www.mayaprotocol.com/fairlaunch",
