Also if it is stored can be accessed my mods or theymos?The reason i ask is i'm looking for information from one of my past deleted posts.ThanksEdit: I was kind of vague in my question. I mean a post that I deleted not a mod for spam or anything.",

      "body": "Rikafip pointed you to the right source. If a post gets deleted or edited you could always find an archived version of it as long as it has been scraped.For example, I would think at quickest a cron job would run every minute which means if a post was made and deleted after a scrape already took place but before the next scrape was due (within 59 seconds), it will not be archived.If cron jobs are not being used and some other method is being used for crawling then it would depend on the custom coding but I would highly doubt if in this scenario anything other than cron jobs are being used to scrape.Quote from: otrkid1970 on November 02, 2022, 08:19:22 PMQuote from: Rikafip on November 02, 2022, 08:15:47 PMYeah everyone can still see your posts even if they got deleted.

Those things won't be stored forever with different thresholds for live database, archive database and offline backups.Quote from: theymos on July 06, 2021, 01:49:49 PMDeleted posts are at first just hidden from public view. To steal the ID from such a post, the deleted post is given a new ID. The deleted spam post in this case now has ID 57394364.After about a year, deleted posts are moved off of the live database and into an archive database, and no longer occupy their original message ID in the live database. After about another year, deleted posts are deleted from the archive database as well, though they will probably still exist in offline backups.QuoteThe reason i ask is i'm looking for information from one of my past deleted posts.You can find your deleted post if it belongs to your last 100 posts and it is not more than 7 days old. After each 7 days, posts in draft page will be deleted automatically.Here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=draftsDraft (announcement from theymos)",
