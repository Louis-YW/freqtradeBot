And stuff like that. Not every solution needs a new chain.I'm surprised there are so many PoW coins out there, when there's so much propaganda against them (particularly by mainstream governments). It looks like PoW won't become \"extinct\" anytime soon. Unfortunately, most of the projects found on the link above don't bring anything useful to the world. They're clones from one another. Anyone who mines these coins would only be doing it for fun. Not to turn a profit. Let me tell you, PoW is decentralized but that doesn't mean it's perfect. PoW can be compromised if only a few players (such as mining pools) control 51% of the network. Bitcoin SV is a good example of a PoW coin that's highly-centralized. Maybe hybrid consensus mechanisms (PoW + PoS) are a better solution? Quote from: jossiel on September 27, 2023, 08:27:31 PMKaspa is what I am seeing that's commonly suggested by other altcoin miners.

I like the fact that the project constantly changes its PoW algorithm to remain ASIC-resistant. Sort of how Monero and Vertcoin are doing today. This enables higher decentralization, as nearly everyone has access to either a CPU or GPU. In countries where crypto is illegal, obtaining and running an ASIC mining hardware could be quite challenging. Coins like the ones mentioned before would allow people from such countries to mine \"under the radar\". Either way, expect PoS coins to become the majority due to false propaganda from mainstream governments. I wouldn't worry about this as long as decentralization wins in the long run.",

Yes, we're all for that as what crypto is started and that's for the decentralization. With all of these propagandas and consensus that's being shown to the public, there's also one belief that everything should be PoS.But little did these people know that this is what's going to kill decentralization and they gonna make these rich richer if they're pushing for it.",

Cheetahcoin (CHTA):  bitcoin's cat meme coin on sha256,  bitcoin clone with randomSpike difficulty algorithm.  The best mining device: gekko newpac,  gekko 2pac, gekko compac F.  solo mining favored.  This coin is not android phone mineable.  It used to be very profitable last year on android phone mining,  on latest version core, it is not feasible on phone mining,  mainly for USB ASIC solo mining with very high profitability on reset period. Both NENG and CHTA are new kind of pow coins.  The randomSpike difficulty algorithm are introduced to favor solo mining, reduce 51% attack security risk, and incentive the mining to small home based miners.",

You can still profit from POW projects up to the present moment, but the future is uncertain. ETH has shown the ability to adapt its mechanism from 2020 until now to maintain its top position, so POS is indeed necessary because all recent development projects are utilizing POS mechanisms. However, they are continuously addressing the decentralization issue concerning token distribution. Of course, everything can be resolved; it's just that projects that previously used an inadequate tokenomics model will be left behind, serving as a lesson for future development projects.",

Or they make another coin based on Layer 1 which is called Layer 2 for scalable like Polygon or arbitrum but Yessss I do missing the good ol days of mining. one of their struggles is when they created newly Coin with their own chain to get listed on exchange would be hard because they do need a lot of money to get listed.",

We know PoS is less secure than PoW, but we are hopeless due to drama.It's all the government's fault. They kept pushing the \"high energy consumption\" narrative, forcing developers to switch to a different consensus algorithm (mainly PoS). Now that Ethereum went full PoS (since last year), all other altcoins are doing the same. I'd say around 90% of cryptocurrencies have PoS as their main consensus algorithm. The rest are pure PoW. This means that most coins are centralized, while only a small few are truly-decentralized. If this keeps up, only Bitcoin will remain as the sole PoW cryptocurrency in the future. I'm fine with that as long as decentralization wins in the long run. Who knows how much time left do PoW-based altcoins have? Just my opinion",

It would be up to ASIC manufacturers to make their hardware energy efficient with every release. Not only that, but miners themselves would have to rely on alternative energy sources. Once PoW becomes \"environmentally-friendly\", governments will have no excuse to keep targeting coins with such consensus mechanism. There's been some progress in the mining industry, so I'm confident PoW coins will be here to stay. The more PoW coins we have, the more decentralized the industry will be. Unfortunately, PoS coins dominante a large portion of the market. Don't expect this to change anytime soon, especially when exchanges and whales are profiting from it. Money talks, right?",
