  "content": "Good day to everyone, I am actually writing this post prior to the recent happening on the local board and I know this would have been hard on some newbie who are actually trying to just get involved and atleast earn some merits to grow, but like other senior member have said, spamming the local board isn't actually the right way to go about it.The recent thread created about cleaning the local board shouldn't be taken as discouragement by any newbie or any lower rank like myself as to make them shy away from the Local board  but as a challenge to all of us to try as much as possible to be creative enough and improve our ourselves in discussion and creation of thread related to Bitcoin and other SUB BOARD that will soon be added to the LB, hopefully if possible.The senior member like agbe, Charles-Tim, brainboss, igebots, and so many more are just trying their best to help this board grow and improve our post quality here in the forum at large but the fact that everyone was once a newbie is still there and must have faced the challenge one or more times. NOTE:: please all newbie should not take update as discouragement but as a challenge to improve their post in the forum because anyone who shy away from advice never seem to grow in knowledge and other aspects of life",

We learn from our mistakes; that's why we make corrections. Some scolding of newbies is not to scare them off but to make them strong. Today we are proud that we have some reputable members that we are looking up to, and definitely in the future, some people should be looking up to us.

I think person need to check were you dey good at. Some people dey good for commenting. you fit just dey comment dey improve until you martured for here. Creating of regular unnecessary threads dey reduce person value and e dey show how in-martured person dey. You ft get merits by just commenting reasonably. naim be my own idea of how them fit reduce most shitposting.",

With your stats yourself, I can see that your  recent improvement has been good because your written and involvement has changed greatly and this is what we need here in the forum because improvement actually shows that you are growing and I think if everyone should emulate this then they wouldn't be any problem to such deal like spam posting or shit posting here in our local board.",

What they can do is just to watch what other members who understands bitcoin more are discussing there. This will lead to less discussion in the local board which is what we don’t want in the local board now. Newbies should beware of irrelevant topics that has no meaning or add value to this community they are sharing it to, this is basically the spam most of the senior members are talking about. Learning takes time and we know they’re all learning gradually but that shouldn’t make them spam the board with unnecessary posts.",
