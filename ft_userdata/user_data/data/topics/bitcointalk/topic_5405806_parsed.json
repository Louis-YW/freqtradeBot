And having a trading course in a school, I'm starting to see it these days and they're including it to their special courses but not curriculum.",

It's a double edged sword. It could either make or break you that depends on the market condition and how you position your shorts or longs very well.I do not treat any kind of cryptocurrency trading (even futures) as full time job because it poses high risks. Although yes there are high rewards, but expect that most of the time you'll get liquidated even if you are knowledgeable about these trading indicators, patterns, etc. Treat this as a side income instead and only trade an amount that you can afford to lose.",

Don't think its easy, many of the Spot traders are even panicing when the market plunge and then start selling at loss. Its not a good time to become a full time futures trader, do it when you already got countless profit and try just a tiny leverage to test if you really can do it.",
