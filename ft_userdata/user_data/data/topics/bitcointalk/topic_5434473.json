And if you just look at the market and just see an increase in Bitcoin that has started to move slowly in an upward direction. It's actually something I've been very used to seeing in the past on Bitcoin because the current price is still a long way off from the all-time highs on Bitcoin. So if you want to enter now into the market and try to invest in Bitcoin, I don't think it's a bad choice for now and indeed for everyone.",

Now it's good too, but not the best moment, though. Anyway, it's still not too late. Everyone can still buy bitcoin and prepare themselves for the pump season that can happen this year or in the upcoming years. The market is looking better each new day and it would be great if it continued like this, but investors must be careful, because we are talking about a tendency that has started few days ago. It can be a bull trap, so beware, and don't expect immediat returns from your new investments.",

Bitcoin only paved the way because it's features are actually beneficial. Most other altcoins don't have anything meaningful to add, and are simply changed parameters to give the impression they're something new. There are a few that have offered different things, which could be beneficial. However, not to the extent of Bitcoin. The biggest benefit is not needing to use a bank, and therefore truly owning your money, but we don't need hundreds of other altcoins to do the same thing, we just need one. However, Bitcoin has had a ton of external pressure so I'm not sure what you mean by that. It's basically been scrutinized, and predicted into the ground at least several times every quarter.",

Since the start of the new year, the price has risen significantly. What if it doesn't wait for a correction before purchasing? This is the time to buy because the price will rise further, and if you don't buy now, you may be forced to pay a higher price later. Only the level of profit will differ between those who buy now and those who wait for the correction to buy.",

Buying Bitcoin is not because of a forced motive but rather an act that is done with your own awareness to buy.Buying Bitcoin is not only now the right time to buy, but Bitcoin buying activities are always the right time. If the current upward trend is starting to occur, then buying before this month is much more appropriate because the purchase price is below the current price.The current price is $18,8K and has a chance to reach $20K this month. Before the Bitcoin price in the market is sold at $20K, there is still an opportunity to buy. For those who already have Bitcoin, it's time to hold and add the amount.",

Mostly when we react emotionally, we make bad decisions.Additionally, it has one big impact that I did not see anyone emphasizes it. DCA after a long time will help you to have a power of net capital that is big. Bigger capital and bigger power to gain profit when price even does not need to reclaim its all time high.Lastly with DCA, we have to prepare regular capital source for it that force us to spend less, get more savings for DCA.",
