Sometimes you can get the rest of the story, like this article and others like it.Global Tensions Rise Over Russia And Ukraine – What happens Next?Quote from: https://alt-market.us/global-tensions-rise-over-russia-and-ukraine-what-happens-next/If you have done your job properly through due diligence, research and applied practical insight, then you will be in a position to point out why the dominoes are falling. People have to understand how these events were predictable so that the can prepare better in the future.The mainstream media, politicians and global banks will tell the public that \"no one could have seen these events coming.\" This is a lie. Some of us in the alternative fields did see them coming and with considerable clarity. The establishment and their defenders don't want you to know that. They will deny up and down that we predicted anything; they'll claim that we don't exist, that our analysis never happened, or as a last ditch effort they'll claim that they saw it all coming before we did.The mainstream officials and analysts have to maintain their image of public authority, and they can't do that if \"upstarts\" in the alternative arena are constantly right while they are constantly wrong. They have all the fancy Ivy League degrees, after all.In my article 'The Globalist Reset Agenda Has Failed – Is Ukraine Plan B?', published in January of this year, I outlined why I believed that a war between Ukraine and Russia was the most likely crisis to follow after the hype of the covid pandemic faded away....This past week my latest prediction came true, with Russia now striking multiple infrastructure targets using cruise missiles and drones and taking down at least 60% of Ukraine’s electrical grids. These grids are now rerouted to provide SOME power to the affected regions, but in the best case scenario they are only able to be active for 5 hours a day. Kyiv city authorities called on residents and businesses to limit electricity consumption from 5pm until 10pm and urged owners of advertising signs to turn off their lights during this time.Ukraine has halted all energy exports to Europe in response to the grid damage. Meaning, the EU just lost even more of their primary energy resources on top of the loss of Russian gas and oil.Some people might claim that the missile attacks were impromptu and were only triggered by the partial destruction of the Kerch Bridge by a Ukrainian truck bomb. This is false. According to Ben Hodges, a retired U.S. general, the intensity and volume of the attacks indicated they were planned well in advance of the weekend’s explosion on a bridge linking Russia and annexed Crimea. Meaning, Russia was going to strike Ukraine infrastructure regardless....That’s not to say Ukraine isn’t facing disaster, far from it. Until now, they have enjoyed amenities which are rarely available to a country in the midst of invasion, including power and internet communications. This is now changing. As grid systems continue to fail or be destroyed by targeted strikes it is inevitable that millions more Ukrainians will seek to leave the region as refugees to neighboring countries. The influx will definitely create a humanitarian crisis....The strategy here is so transparent it’s almost laughable. As Biden continues to overstep and continues to beat his war drums against half the US population, the claim will be that those of us who respond or resist are not “freedom fighters,” but paid Russian saboteurs. Even those of us that have been fighting this fight for decades will be accused of “treason” and “insurrection” instead of simply defending ourselves against tyranny....",
