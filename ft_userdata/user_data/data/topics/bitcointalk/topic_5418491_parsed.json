  "content": "I have a token I created on XCP back in 2014.I recently started selling some of them. About 20% of the supply is distributed now. The prices ranged from 0.055 to 0.00555 being sold thru \"dispensers\".Do you think that the NFT Hype will die out, and this Historically Significant NFT will become less in demand?I am thinking to hold off til the 10 Year Mark. Would be really cool to be selling a TEN YEAR OLD NFT!Anyway Its been a bit of a challenge, these NFT Historians are all trying to get me to pump the token and dump them. I don't feel happy selling to them because all they want to do is FLIP it later on.Are these Historians Really after the History of NFTS for their intrensic value which should increase in the future?Are they just historian buffs and want to collect all the OG things for the fun of it?I had 1000 SEBUH tokens.Originally my plan was to allow holders to exchange them for Bitcoin miners.That plan hit a massive roadblock when I had some personal life issues come up. Some \"NFT Sale Operator\" kind of guy is wanting to help me sell them off and hes asking for 20% of the sale $$ LOL.IDK seems kinda sus. These things can sell themselves if people are really after the \"history\"https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x82c7a8f707110f5fbb16184a5933e9f78a34c6ab/25629064175770061what I have for sale now on Opensea is this SEBUH thats inside of a Circuits of Values \"emblem Vault\" - kind of like a Multi-chain Wrapper that brings things to Opensea to dump more rapidly. I kind of dont like the idea of it because I wonder if the \"bridge will collapse\" any moment when the Creator \"Shannon Codes\" gets \"hacked\".Anyway im starting to think these tokens may be my ticket to reaching some high valued exchanges. I am wondering what Bitcoin Talk members have to say about \"historic NFTs' - Is it just another Buzzword to drive sales? Is it legitimately seeking to preserve History of Crypto?Thank you for your time reading my post, and big ups if you reply to this post.https://web.archive.org/web/20140701023358/http://sebuh.com/sebuh-xcp/ - Web archive of my website when it was operating in 2014 with SEBUH tokens available to be exchanged for BTC miners.https://xchain.io/asset/SEBUH -- block explorer link for XCP network. I really want to get up on some Convention stage and Speak about my experience.All i want is Redemption for myself. I want to complete the journey.I want someone to Use A SEBUH to CLAIM a BTC Miner. This would make me whole. And it would heal a lot of trauma that had happened in 2014.",

      "body": "I'm the proud owner of a SEBUH token and you made it into my thread about Historical NFTs (granted I don't update it very often as nobody here seems to care about... anything). Was going to pick up another one off the DEX, am waiting to round up some spare XCP.Quote from: sebdude420 on October 27, 2022, 09:23:39 AMDo you think that the NFT Hype will die out, and this Historically Significant NFT will become less in demand?No, never completely. As a matter of fact I think HNFTs have a much better chance of holding up in value compared to new NFTs, which are now in the trillions.Quote from: sebdude420 on October 27, 2022, 09:23:39 AMAnyway Its been a bit of a challenge, these NFT Historians are all trying to get me to pump the token and dump them. I don't feel happy selling to them because all they want to do is FLIP it later on.If I had two I would probably flip one later on, but I'm gonna ride or die with my one for a long while. Anyway, who are the \"historians\" (some of them are more like \"histoooorians\") that were asking you to pump the token. NAME N SHAME!!Quote from: sebdude420 on October 27, 2022, 09:23:39 AMAre these Historians Really after the History of NFTS for their intrensic value which should increase in the future?Are they just historian buffs and want to collect all the OG things for the fun of it?Some of them, for sure, yes.Quote from: sebdude420 on October 27, 2022, 09:23:39 AMI am wondering what Bitcoin Talk members have to say about \"historic NFTs' - Is it just another Buzzword to drive sales? Is it legitimately seeking to preserve History of Crypto?These are all excellent questions. I personally believe that the collector market for old assets/tokens/NFTs is going to be huge in the future; of course its success hinges on the overall success of cryptocurrency as a whole. Which I don't think is going anywhere. I think of HNFTs as pre-1980s baseball cards... Hard to find these days, and the greats go for huge sums. The older, the rarer & the more famous, the better.You've got a good piece of NFT pre-history on your hands... You are its steward. Treat it well. Try to build on its legacy, not just for your holders but for yourself as well.",

Like in comparison i would create erc20 token now, and wouldn't touch it until 9 years passes? And now you decided to list them and people are buying in just because of the NFT hype or what? Did you market them?Anyway sounds like these \"historians\" didn't see any value in it, if that would be their only selling point. There are ton of old died off nfts out there that no one cares just because they are old. Just be glad you can get rid of yours.But now i need to check my old privatekey/password list if i have made tokens in XCP network because i don't even recall.",

Only a handful of them were sent for that purpose back then so he retained most of them.The hype came about because a certain NFT Histoooorian announced the \"rediscovery\" of the \"first token redeemable for a physical item\" a couple months prior to SEBUH's sale launch, which was redeemable for a Bitcoin logo keychain. However, the issuance of SEBUH predates that token, along with another token redeemable for a book.Here is the block explorer entry for SEBUH:https://xchain.io/asset/SEBUHIf you flip to the Issuances tab you can see the original issuance date was June 10th, 2014, which makes it prehistoric in the world of Historical NFTs. It predates my own first token created on Counterparty, which came toward the end of that month, and doesn't have nearly as cool a backstory.Also, if you create your own ERC20 token now, it wouldn't matter in 9 years as there have already been hundreds of thousands of tokens made on Ethereum.Historical NFTs are cool and probably more investment-worthy b/c they were made before it was cool to make tokens. The era goes all the way back to the first Namecoin assets created in 2011 and ends in 2017 or 2018, depending on who you're talking to. Think of it as old baseball cards vs. new baseball cards: which are generally more appealing to serious collectors?Also yes if you have a counterwallet, fire it up and see what you have in there, then let me know first, heh.",

      "body": "Yo! Thanks for all the kind replies everyone. I am still here. The past two months havn't seen any SEBUH trading. While we wait out this crypto winter I have been focused on my IT work and some photography works. Letting my ideas simmer down for a little bit to see what happens next in this story. I am really excited for the future. I want to plan something big for the 10 Year Birthday of [SEBUH]. Something really crazy that will draw in a huge crowd of onlookers. I had seen an XCP token called HATERCOIN that has had its ownership changed several times, and Sub-Assets generated by the various owners. I found this very interesting. I was also looking to sell ownership of SEBUH, but at the price I wanted it would not sell. I was asking for ~888 ETH. If it had Sold, it would have been the biggest sale made with an Emblem Vault. Would have been so life changing. Let a huge part of myself go so I can start a new life with my own place and freer mind. Some day soon I will be shipping out some autographed wallets.I have been collecting more Prehistoric Bitcoin Miners. Recently acquired a Red U1 Antminer USB. Need to get my Casacious coins and Bitcoin Magazine Issue #1 Graded. I have spent so much time in crypto and I still feel like I should be creating, producing, thinking, evolving, and loving what it can do for me and the people around me. Bitcoin Lightning Node Coming online Soon, will compliment Sebuh.net XTZ Bakery. What most of what I had made from selling SEBUH tokens I will use to start a Lightning Relay Node. Cementing my footprint back into the BTC space.",

      "body": "So with that in mind the rest of my journey now sounds like an adventure. If someone does not want me to use a NFT with these tokens I want them to sell me out, sell me on eBay and put my face on the wall of History.    So my questions are:    - What would the \"history of NFTs\" actually look like?    - How much of it would you have to sell this year, or would you be able to sell it this year?  - Where is it going for the ICO to take place?  - Should I have some sort of token to sell on a NFT?  - What would be your thoughts/recommendations/etc if a NFT was to die?    - What should I do to get my NFT out and started working on NFTs?    If I wanted to have a NFT in 2018 to give it something back then, I will probably go into Cryptocurrency exchange and sell it to investors at the ICO.",
