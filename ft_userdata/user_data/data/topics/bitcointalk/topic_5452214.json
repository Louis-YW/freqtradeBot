I think what he is trying to say is he lost half of his funds from transaction fees, if you will not check the details of your transaction you will lose it from a very high fee, my friend almost send his Bitcoin to me he just notices that the transaction fee was $37 when he tried to send $50.OP should post the TXTID for us to see if it's already confirmed.People should be aware of the existing network congestion and know how to deal with it, you may have to delay doing transactions now, if it's urgent like an emergency situation, choose your altcoin and just buy back when the congestion eases up.Quote from: Dummie on May 10, 2023, 07:38:32 AMHi!I´ve lost half of my founds for nothing.

Wait for opportunity to Consolidate your small inputs, consolidate all of your previous transactions into one input.Use the Lightning Network for everyday payments.",

If its not personal, can you share your transaction id here so we can dig more into it to give you detailed information about what happened. Also which wallet did you use to spend the funds ? I guess you transferred funds at the worst possible time (highest congestion).PS: Always check the fee rates on mempool.space before you proceed next time.",

In the future, I suggest you be a little bit patient and avoid overspending like that, especially in a highly congested network where you need to pay a lot of fees even for one input. Use tools like mempool.space to see the average median fee for the next block and change the fee accordingly. Most wallets overestimate and it will just cause the fee to increase even further. If you really need to get fast confirmation because you're buying stuff with Bitcoin, I think you can use other coins to pay or use a service that has a longer confirmation window or will refund you if the conversion fee change drastically.",
