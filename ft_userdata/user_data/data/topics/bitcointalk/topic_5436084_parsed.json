  "content": "I was just farting around on CMC, browsing through shitcoins that used to hold my attention and by looking closely at Reddcoin and their website (and in particular which exchanges RDD is traded on), I came to learn that StakeCube is apparently going bust.  What caught my attention on their website was this quote from Oleg, who's presumably running the show:The blame is being laid on massive outflows of coins and the illiquidity of their proprietary shitcoin, SCC.  In that long and rambling screed, I don't see blame being placed on anything with lungs and a heartbeat.  Now I'm not too sure how many of you are familiar with StakeCube, as their niche was PoS coins, ones with masternodes and the like, and they were damn small.  But I'm baffled as to how, as Oleg says, SCC was--or even could be--used to pay for real-world goods like servers.  There ain't a damn shop online or with four walls and a door that accepts obscure shitcoins like that, so am I wrong in assuming that StakeCube created SCC out of thin air and then sold it for another coin (like btc, ltc, or one of the ones you can actually spend) in order to finance their operations?Is this the reason why most exchanges nowadays have their own proprietary coins.  SBF was straight-up scamming, which was separate from the success or failure of FTT and would've been exposed eventually had FTT never existed (in a perfect world at least).  I'm not sure what Oleg and StakeCube were doing, but I don't think they were scammers.  I'm just baffled that so much was riding on this shitty altcoin, which Oleg had to know was pretty illiquid.  Blows my mind.And finally, this quote just had me slapping my head:QuoteSo, everything was just a lie?No, it was business as usual for everyone, everything announced in the newsletters (roadmap, v3 development, etc.) did happen, and it was never the plan to act like this – on the contrary – everyone in the team worked their ass off, no matter all the FUD coming from the community, in the hope that the crypto market would recover and we would be able to release updates and v3 in time to get back on track.FUD from the community....uh, OK.  It seems very clear to me that whatever fear, uncertainty, or doubt existed was 100% justified.  That victim card that keeps getting passed around is looking frayed and tattered.Curious to hear what you all think.",

As for what happened with FTX platform, it is the dependence of most of their liquidity on the currency, and in return, the misuse of customers’ money to invest or waste it on the interests of the platform officials.The reason for the collapse of most token is the same as the reason for the collapse of central money, random printing, which aims primarily to create money out of nowhere with the misuse of that money.As for the platform, it is free money without any effort. The problem is that whenever they think that this free money is real money.",

FUD is the scapegoat of every single failed \"project\" here, I sometimes feel like slapping people who only know to yell FUD!! FUD!! at everything!QuoteWhile only a small number of coins are affected in terms of a balance sheet deficit (BTC, DOGE, LTC, DASH, and a handful of small caps), these are obviously the most valuable. The deficit ratio of assets vs. liabilities is high, with BTC and DOGE at 95%, LTC at 60%, and DASH at 10%. Most of the other coins are fully backed, actually overcollateralized.The deficit was mainly caused by the illiquidity and decreasing value of our StakeCubeCoin, which is used to pay for things like servers and mining machines but instead was held to back a positive balance sheet. I am willing to provide a more detailed explanation if needed, but it is unlikely to make a difference.Probably what really happened was they sold the valuable coins and backed them with their own coin till the deficit became too big to be covered by something that was losing value faster than everything. I wonder what the 95% ratio really means, they have 95% of the BTC, or the deficit is 95% and they have only 5% left?

If they were just a bit less greedy, they would have gone away with it by just stealing the shitcoins and leaving the valuable assets alone, but everybody is greedy at the end",

Oh, wait I scratched the itch guess the coin is worthless now.That is what all these shitcoins and tokens are. But you can't get people to see it.-Dave",
