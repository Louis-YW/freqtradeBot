  "content": "Is this my country's problem that naira to dollar is becoming extremely too high in exchange value. One dollar used to be equal to one naira, but today a dollar is N800. Could it be as a result of importation of foreign goods or lack of local made goods by government of my country?We can pulled out from any nations that is not willing to trade with us rather than pleasing them to displease yourself. We creates our local goods and send them to our wider local markets let the foreigners come down to buy from us so that our currency will appreciates in value and increase production",

      "body": "It is not possible to put a single reason for inflation or the devaluation of the currency against a basket of currencies, as inflation has several causes, some of which may be political, but it reflects the state's management of the financial crisis and how money is printed.Therefore, the solution can be found in knowing the cause and whether inflation is transient or is it the result of wrong policies that must be modified.I think posting in the local board would be better as they would have a detailed knowledge of what is happening in Nigeria.",

The thing is that not only commerce matters but there is also a multitude of other factors, there are plenty of countries with a negative trade balance that are not having a problem keeping their currency up.But the simple explanation is that there is more demand for $ than there is offer, so much for the so-called dedollarisation everyone prays for.Seems like everyone hates the $ so much they want all of them stuffed in their pockets.Quote from: JamesBorn on March 23, 2023, 07:54:43 PMWe creates our local goods and send them to our wider local markets let the foreigners come down to buy from us so that our currency will appreciates in value and increase productionYeah, that's the plan but doing it as you can see it's a lot harder than talking about it.",
