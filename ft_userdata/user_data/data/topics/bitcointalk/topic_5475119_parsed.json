I don't think we should dwell so much on trust that we should jettison the need for responsible investing. As a guide, what you should put in Bitcoinshoulg only be kidney you don't need urgently, money you can afford to live your normal life without it. This is why the DCA method is recommended for anyone willing to venture into Bitcoin.",

But in situation where BTC is showing some glimpsed of having a good run like a total Bull run that we called provably level of trust became more high and I think its goes to 80% since from that we don't need to worry anything since price would usually go up. The only thing we need to wait for that is when to sell and everything is fine at our end especially when we are taking our profits and enjoying the efforts we made on good season of BTC.",

But I think when it comes to trust level, Bitcoin has gain a particular amount and alot of people actually respect and trust Bitcoin enough to use as high as 80% of their earnings especially during this vital period in the market and this also what has led to this share growth of Bitcoin over the years as it has completed the repeated circle always and will always let people have something to believe in it more and more.",

Well, if it won't change then does that mean you are willing to risk all of your money in investing Bitcoin?. If not then you did not believe in Bitcoin 100% to start with. We all know that it is volatile therefore it is not guaranteed that you will earn profit because It's all about patience and if you don't have enough patience then you may lose some of your money.Quote from: DaNNy001 on November 22, 2023, 10:25:42 PMWell, you have your opinion and trust level on Bitcoin.

I trust bitcoin 80% because many people are already rich in this industry, and that is the reason why I trust bitcoin even that much. However, if you look at it, you will see that bitcoin has been existing for a long period of time and nobody has complained badly about it. The only people complaining about the currency are those that invest and can’t take risks; they now sell; they didn’t gain, so those are the people that complain and those who got scammed, which is due to their negligence. Therefore, if bitcoin can betray it, it will not be now. The only time I get jumbled about it is when the market turns upside down, and when I remember, I only invest the amount I can afford to lose; I don't bother anymore. If I’m not bothering the maker, I would have 100% trust in bitcoin. Quote from: Agbamoni on November 22, 2023, 11:28:39 PMEveryone trust the banking system and the internet without understanding how it is been operated yet so many times the trust has been broken but will still make use of them.

However, as we all know, bitcoin is something that you will be in charge of if your funds are managed, which means that nothing will happen to it unlike banks or other organizations, who will be the ones to control your funds, which is not supposed to be like that.",

Bitcoin has never derailed from the whitepaper published by its founder. It has also been able to grow stronger even in the face of attacks and diverse challenges. Bitcoin is designed to be a decentralized currency which means it displaces any form of intermediary. Any decentralized finance that promotes peer-to-peer financial services will be a plus to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Regulation is an enemy of Bitcoin because it will limit its quest to promote pseudonymous financial transactions. But it is also important to note that we don't just trust in the Bitcoin space, we verify. And doing your own research is an ideal way to verify a coin or service in the crypto sector. To answer your question, I trust Bitcoin 100% more than any other cryptocurrency.",

Due to it's purely decentralized nature, you don't need to trust whether or not Bitcoin will be here tomorrow. You probably need to trust the internet on whether it will be here tomorrow or not more than you need to trust Bitcoin. I determine my trust in DeFi based on the protocol and am extremely vigilant in the protocols I choose, if I use them at all.I don't trust NFTs because the industry and the majority of the value of what is within it is subjective, unreliable and probably manipulated for the most part.",

It's hard for anyone to measure trust in BTC using a scale of 0 to 100 because if you're new to investing when Bitcoin's price rises, you may lose faith in Bitcoin if you don't get the results you expected. And if the results are even slightly as expected, your bitcoins will continue to grow day by day. It is very difficult to consider only numbers here. I don't want to measure any scale when it comes to Bitcoin. In my case if I say I am a middle class. I can invest very small amount of bitcoin which is limited to my needs. But that doesn't mean my confidence level in Bitcoin will be very low.

So do I think Bitcoin is here to stay as one of the top players in crypto?
