Is the spelling and grammar correct? What about punctuation? Are you a non-native speaker of English but wish to release English content, knowing you may have some broken sentences or incorrect usage of words?If any of this applies to you, I am here to help.I have often viewed things on the web that lose some of their professionalism, cohesion, and even legibility due to the above-mentioned problems.- I am available for one-time jobs and also on a continual basis.- If you are unsure if I could help you, please PM me and I will let you know if I am qualified. - Prices will vary, and depend on a number of factors. We will work out the total before any work is done and crypto is exchanged.- My prices will be extremely fair, and my offers are always negotiable.Please feel free to post here or PM me. I also have an email set up for work-related communication if you prefer: MistercoinForHire@riseup.netI look forward to working with you!",
