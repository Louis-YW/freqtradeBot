But to produce more efficient ASICs you need resources and time, it can take years. Some companies failed in the process too, it is not an easy task (like Intel recently)If I am not wrong Bitmain is still working on sha256d asics, but as scrypt asics are more profitable actually we could bet that a lot of their team's member are working on scrypt algo asics with a higher priority.

Like are they avoiding sha-256 for a reason? We cannot really know, the current hype is more about shitty proof of stake than proof of work I think.. We already have a ton of coins and projets using sha256d algo (like XEC, BCH, DGB, LCC, BSV etc..etc...). Why would we want a new useless project ?Maybe it is difficult to promote a new project PoW based on sha256 because of the reputation of the mining (you know, the eternal \"it is polluting, mining is bad blablablabla\"Anyway, I think it could be better to have this conversation in the altcoins mining section of the forum if we want to follow the rules, and if you want more answers about that.Quote from: KiaKia on June 20, 2023, 04:42:17 PMI am curious because all the available Asic miners are already getting older and less profitableIt depends of your electricity price, how much you pay for x kw/h or mw/h, and about the cost of your infrastructure. A lot of people are still making profit, otherwise the network's hashrate wouldn't be as it is. Difficulty is rising quickly, but companies can add hashrate to compensate the difference, or could just bet on the rise of the BTC s rate if they don't add more asics to their infrastructure",

If you want a tool that lists all new miners with release dates then check this tool below.- https://www.asicminervalue.com/Then sort them by clicking \"release\" to see new miners including the upcoming release of new miners.",

Like are they avoiding sha-256 for a reason? Based on what I know, there are still companies that continue to make or develop new asic miners, and some of the companies that make it up to now as far as I know are Canaan and Bitmain, I just don't know the other company . Maybe or maybe a few years from now or next year they will release new miners who knows, right?As for new projects that don't use the Bitcoin mining algorithm, maybe because it's not energy efficient, because it's a sha-256 hash function.",

I am curious because all the available Asic miners are already getting older and less profitable, how long does it takes for Asic companies to build the latest Bitcoin Asic miners with higher Hashrate? A higher hashrate on its own means nothing, it's always a combination of price, efficiency, hashrate, and lifespan.An example, Bitmain can overclock their S19 XP and get 20% more hashrate at the expense of both efficiency and lifespan, or, they could underclock it to gain more efficiency and lifespan at the expense of both price and hashrate, stuffing more chips to get a 500th miners is something they do in a few weeks if they want to, but they will end up with a huge miner that draws a lot of power and won't sell easily.Looking at the history, I don't remember there has not been a single year where all large ASIC makers didn't bring in a new model to the market, also, in some years they made a few models, it all depends on the market condition.With that said really, I don't know what is the purpose of your question when I read this partQuoteI am curious because all the available Asic miners are already getting older and less profitableThis will always be the case, looking at the most efficient air-cooled miner in the market right now which is the M50s++, if you were to ignore the cost, that miner makes a ton of profit in comparison to the power it needs to run, but that won't be the case forever, difficulty will keep growing, they will make better gears in the future, just like how the old miners such as Antminer S9 or MicroBT M10 are now pretty useless despite being at most efficient gears at one point in time.As a person who mines Bitcoin, you need to understand that there will be no point in the future where you can just buy X gear and expect it to stay profitable forever, you will always have to assume that at some point in the future, the miner will make less than what costs in energy, also, taking into account the lifespan of these miners one should always assume that those gears will either die or stop making a profit in a few years.So your buying model must be realistic, makes exactly no sense to buy a mining gear that can't ROI in 2 years at current difficulty, because that will only get worse as time moves on, but as long as your ROI is reasonably short (6-12) months you can somehow safely be sure that you will hit ROI and make some more profit before that gear is either no longer profitable or functional. This is a never-ending game, you need to keep chasing the market, increasing your hashrate, lowering your power consumption, mining as a business is far from easy.",

After the Halving, the profit will decrease, and before the halving, an announcement and pre-order for new ASICs should appear.Many people simply do not understand mining economics.Many variables to profit. New mining gear at better efficiency is but one.If the s21 did 18 watts vs the 23 the xp does and costs 2x the price of an xp only borderline miners would need to upgrade to it.Ie maybe a 9 cent guy wants a 6500 dollar s21 18 wattsand a 7 cent guy wants a 3700 dollar s19 xp.     23 wattsand a 3 cent guy wants a 1400 dollar s19j pro.   29 watts",
