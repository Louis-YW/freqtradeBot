Myself I think that our brothers that registered newly this will make them to think of what to do and what not to do as their plan to achieve betterment in the forum. Let me start by reviewing my small plans in 2024 but I will not review all at least some of them if it will reach up to two, because our people said that we should think for the future and also documents our plans should in case if we are not opportune to make use of our plans and any other person who view our plans can work on it for its benefits. Accumulating of bitcoin: this is my first plan in 2024, because I seen that many of us praise bitcoin but we don't have more of bitcoin, why some people from other locals boards have thousands of bitcoin.What strategies can be use to accumulate a bitcoin: this is another thing we should think of in bitcoin accumulations, some of us do not buy bitcoin when the price is low but they buy bitcoin when the price is increasing, the best time to accumulate your bitcoin is when is in DIP and when it rise you get high numbers of bitcoin.At least this is one of the plan I have next year no matter bullrun or bearish manifest and I will like us to outline our plans we have in bitcoin in next year",

You have made a good suggestion that should be put into consideration.  It won't be wrong if we have many Bitcoin millionaires in this local board. We have been active in the Bitcoin community and we have all the information at our disposal, nothing stops us from making good use of the opportunity. I have been thinking about the best thing to do regarding the next bull run that we are expecting. Even though the economy is not funny now, it is necessary that some funds be set aside and saved in Bitcoin... that is what I'm doing, just that it is not as big as I had planned. We all can start small and build from there... let's make the most of the coming bull run. Quote from: Riginac111 on November 06, 2023, 07:54:20 AMMyself I think that our brothers that registered newly this will make them think of what to do and what not to do as their plan to achieve betterment in the forum. For the new guys, they have to learn to invest in Bitcoin. That is the best way to make something huge from the system. Since you are not already earning Bitcoin, put N10k per week while you build your account... this will make you not to miss the next bull run. Bitcoin price may shift above $100k from 2024 going forward. You won't like yourself if that happens and you don't own some Bitcoin. This is my suggestion, and it should not be taken as investment advice... still do your own due diligence.",

In addition to wetting smartGold01 dey talk,be say Bitcoin price dey change but the coin in ratio no dey change. For example if you buy1btc=$20k in come rise to $25k the number of Bitcoin go remain the same while the price go change from 1btc= $25k so coin no dey add na the value dey add. Except say you dey continue to dey buy.Another thing to also buy bitcoin be say if the 1btc na $20k if you by am e no go complete 1 Bitcoin again pankake swap go collect there own percentage maybe e go com reduce to $0.99 btc and the price no go dey dsame again.",

You have already advise that accumulation should be done when Bitcoin is down which isn't a bad advice so that's what we have to be doing and not waiting until next year. Start your accumulation now, if you don't have a job to generate income in buying Bitcoin, you can use your signature earnings as your source of accumulating Bitcoin. The money we received from our signature payment shoudn't be used up. Save small as your investment, as little as 10% no go bad, e no matter how small e be but keep aside some and in a long period you for dun get better quantity of Bitcoin to give you better profits when the bull market time dun reach.No be everybody go fit affordable one Bitcoin so we suppose dey contended with the small one wey we get. If you still dey think say dat small one wey you get no make sense, just wait make the next bull market finish and see wetin the value of that Bitcoin wey you get go be and others mightn't be able to afford it anymore just like most of us can't afford 1BTC dat was very affordable few years back.",

I would also say you should imply disciplines while you accumulates your Bitcoin by the 2024 and entitling your accumulations with logically planning so you don't only succeed to accumulate your Bitcoin and spends it awfully.Some persons don't even have Bitcoin talk more of  having more. This is typically when we says some person's do have knowledge but doesn't practically implement it or theorically expresses it out. That where it is said that unexpressive knowledge is a waste.And to my  knowledge, the capacity of owning or accumulating of Bitcoin is not depended on the forums board but of individuals.Quote from: Riginac111 on November 06, 2023, 07:54:20 AMWhat strategies can be use to accumulate a bitcoin Before accumulating Bitcoin is assumed that you got some already so the ways one can accumulate Bitcoin is>>>* Do not be haste to sell your Bitcoin because as the Bitcoin value is increased in the market ,so your Bitcoin is also increased.* Top (buy) more to your initial Bitcoin  so as to set a higher pace to interest because Bitcoin income value rate is  based on initial (total) accumulated Bitcoin.* And a continues trading because if you have Bitcoin stocked without trading there is absolutely no tendencies of addition as to accumulate more unless you typically rely on buying.I am also considering by airdrops 😂",

It will take up to 3 to 4 years to have at least 1 Bitcoin if a regular DCA of 100k Naira is invested in Bitcoin. So you see how far to go, unless the plan is not to accumulate up to 1 BTC. My point is if a newbie continues to wait till when the price is low, he might not be able to buy any Bitcoin throughout a long period of time and before you know the year will run out without accumulating any Bitcoin and those money kept while waiting for the low price will be spent unknowingly for something no worth it.",

Between I have not made a research about that decentralized exchange.Hey friend you will buy bnb smart chain from centralized exchange like Binance send it to DEX exchange likeTrust wallet.through thesam smar tcontract. then go to Dapp search for pankake swap then you can use Binance to buy other other currencies. Come to think of it how did you think people buy all those meme,shit and altcoin on trust wallet. That is how I was able to buy some altcoin in my wallet about a year ago.I know this mate but it was your previous post that got my attention 😅Just keep this at the back of your mind that you can't buy bitcoin on decentralized exchange rather a centralized exchange, what you must know or note is that Decentralized exchange are known as Swap can be either being configured through Binance smart ( BSC) or Ethereum network and maybe Polygon. Even there are more network coming up but if you don't feels like using Centralized exchange then you can go for local p2p from a trusted trader here where you can buy btc from and he sends you any chosen coin in returns. You know I so much loves newbies that tends to know all while they knows nothing maybe when they starts facing difficulties then they will come back to write later about their challenges they are experiencing.",
