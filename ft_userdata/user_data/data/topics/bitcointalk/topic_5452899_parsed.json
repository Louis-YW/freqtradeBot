  "content": "A few hours ago I received a notification from the YouTube channel Tuttle Twins and as the title suggests I am very grateful to Tylor Stevens for creating a children's cartoon that depicts how Bitcoin works in a way that is easy for children to understand. Btw, it's still ongoing and there are episodes. What I'm trying to say is that we don't have to bother explaining to kids how, what, and why Bitcoin is so important in the future. Because with the help of this film, everything is clearly summarized, I guarantee that children will love the film. If you have trouble understanding Bitcoin Withpaper then this film can help easily. If your child wants to be given early learning about bitcoin then this film will be very helpful. My suggestion is to download the film from their official website, put it in an album, and make it a show for children. Believe that this will help the development of useful children's knowledge in the future. As an adult, I enjoyed the film.Watch it first and give your impressions and don't forget this film is very useful.Conclusion: there are many ways to introduce Bitcoin to children, so there is no other reason for us not to introduce it from an early age. The first and the best Bitcoin educational cartoon I've ever watched.The full episode and more for free at: https://www.Angel.com/TuttleYouTube",

Even board games are often boring for kids, but cartoons never are!The introduction of bitcoin to children is not a bad idea, rather it will help them get idea on what digital currency is pending on the time they will emerge into the full technology when they grew up, there are different playing materials where there can be bitcoin inscription on them and the children can easily get used to seeing the bitcoin logo or symbol to help they get used to it whenever they are coming across such, they would have understand that it's another form of money in a digital currency technology.",

      "body": "I think such cartoons are very important for the children as they love those cartoons and the entertainment is of another level for the kids. It's a nice idea to create a cartoon series that's entirely created to give financial education to chidden about Bitcoin. It's really fascinating to create such good materials in the form of entertainment for the kids.We should promote these videos by sharing them with the kids and they will keep sharing with other kids, if such programs get good amount of views the creators will work even harder to add more episodes for to promote Bitcoin and the next generation will know about this technology even if their are in their childhood days. The memories of childhood are so dense that such kids will love to adapt the Bitcoin when they grow into adults.",

I hope there will be more multilingual support if the creators want this film to reach more children around the world.",

The first and the best Bitcoin educational cartoon I've ever watched.I've watched it and I think this film is very educational, not only for children, we as adults, the essence of what this cartoon wants to convey is easy to understand. Especially if you compare the working system of the old transaction tools and how dangerous the fiat damage that the government keeps printing is. In the film Satoshi's face is censored, explaining the reason why he created Bitcoin was that he was fed up with the fiat system. Limited supply of Bitcoins cannot be duplicated (copy and paste). Everything is explained in this film in detail but not boring. Filmmakers are very dedicated to this.",

The kids will be their next mission because they will be easy to fool when they are young but this cartoon is surely helpful and I'm sure not only kids will get benefit from these things but also the adults that will gonna watch with their kids as well.",

It is 1 hour long but I think kids would get engage to every character.This is a superb initiative and till now the video has got 13k views in just 13 days. I feel more such cartoon videos in different language can spread the awareness about Bitcoin to the future generations.",

Children due to high interest in cartoons can learn something useful from this instead of wasting time on other less educative cartoons. The future of any child that this cartoon becomes a favourite to them will be very bright. For parents here who have been looking for a way to introduce bitcoins to your children in a friendly manner, this cartoon is a great option.",

      "body": "Every effort taken to pique people's interest in bitcoin is a positive development, as long as it is not forced or an unsafe technique of teaching about it. I believe that teaching children about bitcoin at an early age can hasten the adoption process since they will assimilate faster and know how to share the knowledge amongst themselves, even as a joke in their playing fields. Displaying information in a cartoon format for children is the ideal approach to catch their attention because kids never get bored watching cartoons and can easily learn and reproduce everything they see in the cartoon. Tuttle Twin came up with a great idea, which they should be commended for.",

Although I think that altcoins and scammers would be a perfect arch nemesis of Bitcoin and could easily be made the villain. I have had to go on youtube and search for tuttle twins to take a look at the cartoon in the first place. The website itself is demanding you first tell them your email address before you are allowed to view it. Which is very uncomfortable and sketchy. They should remove that.Unfortunately, as much as I like the idea of a cartoon, after taking a first look, I have to say the cartoon animation, storyline, voice actors, effects and so on are extremely low production value and I doubt any child will be very interested in watching for more than 2 minutes.",

      "body": "I've made a thread (Cartooned style video about Bitcoin for beginners) about it as well, same creator of content but I saw the clip on TikTok. The first time I watched his video, I really found it fascinating. It's educational and at the same time the cartoon style makes it more entertaining and interesting to learn about Bitcoin. Also, the way things were explained is easy to understand so I can really say it's good for beginners and young teens as well. But I wouldn't say that this would help children to learn about Bitcoin. Since they're still young, their mind won't probably comprehend the details that much. Maybe it will help them get some ideas and to be familiar with the word Bitcoin but not to the extent of they can understand everything said in the video where they can start exploring it cause it'll still be too complicated for them.  Even if it's in a cartoon style, it doesn't necessarily mean that the target audience are children. Cartoons can also be for teens or adults. It's just smart that they used cartoons to provide a visual representation of introducing Bitcoin and explaining how it works. It will be great if more people will discover that channel and their videos.",

I can see how preschool kids or elementary school kids would watch it, I've seen much worse plot development and dialogues on TV channels for kids.Honestly, I didn't expect to like a kid's show, my expectations were pretty low. And, to be honest, it was a bit too long for me, even though I've watched the whole episode. But it has many references, small jokes, and small lessons as well. Like how the kids say they won't ask about Satoshi's identity, which sort of shows you should respect one's privacy and desire to stay anonymous. It also teaches the history of money nicely, although I'm not sure small kids would understand it well. And there's a caution against wanting to get rich quick with it. It's a wonderful effort to explain Bitcoin to kids, and I'm really happy stuff like this exists.",

This however agrees with the sayings that says \"catch them young\". Kids like cartoon very much and as such, the cartoon video would help instilling the bitcoin knowledge in them as they continue to watch it more often. Kids are always curios about what they have watched and would want to know about it.These days generational kids are very smart and intelligent. They easily get along with things which they have learnt and would want to do a practical on what they have watched or seen. Watching the cartoon video would arouse their interest in wanting to practically get engaged with bitcoin activities  such as carrying out transaction and other related activities as well.I will commend the efforts of Tylor Stevens for this wonderful idea put together to promoting the bitcoin movement amongst the kids.
