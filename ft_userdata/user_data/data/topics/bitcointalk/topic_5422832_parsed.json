Also if I draw using water color, it's fit handrawn art or painting art?2. Does the animation art only for digital? does stop motion is included too?",

Also if I draw using water color, it's fit handrawn art or painting art?There are colored pen too you know. So this won't do for black pen only. But it still depends on the work of art of any one.For the water color, this would probably fall for painting art,  since the hand-drawn art falls for pen and paper only.Quote from: Apocollapse on November 24, 2022, 12:36:39 AM2. Does the animation art only for digital? does stop motion is included too?Since both will fall for digital art, any art with an animation on it either .gif or .apng or any video file extension will fall to animation art, non-animated digital will fall on the other one.Of course, this is what i only understand, Hhampuz and co. have say on this so lets wait him on this.",

Moreover, I assume that we're only allowed to submit ONE (1) artwork in each category. So from how I understood it, TWO (2) artworks are the MAXIMUM entries that you have for this whole Winter Holiday Art Contest.Good luck!",
