  "content": "I caught two persons arguing this morning that led to this post, one on the other hand says this person introduced me to bitcoin July 2022 while i was doing my normal buying and selling of yam and palm oil, quoting him; my business of selling yam was doing good, I buy yam in bags with palm oil and I have a store where I normally distribute it to customers, before he came with his ideas of buying and storing bitcoin and since then I have not gotten shishi, all my money has gone and am asking him to explains what went wrong? What happen to my money or bitcoin? Why is it only eating and not vomiting? My reply, sir generally the market is down not only to you but everybody, just exercise patients because even myself can not explains to you why the price is not going up, I guess this is as a result of low demands and supply's chain of distribution of bitcoin that has affect the market but don't panic am sure you will recover your money when the market rise soon, but how soon he ask? I said the market is rising slowly already.The argument ends but I want to draw this lesson to everyone;1. When introducing crypto to anyone let them know you're not responsible for anything contrary.2. Tell them you don't control the price, the system does.3. You're not liable to any losses4. The person should make good decision before joining5. Don't collect money from the person to trade or invest for them. Them should do it themselves.6. Don't tells the person when to withdrew his or her, they should chose went to.7. No promises for anybody joining cryptosystem is a free market.",

      "body": "Anyone trying to invite someone into investing in crypto should let the person know that Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme. If the story is true, the method by which the person who introduced him to crypto used it is very misleading, and if he wants his money back in full, by all means, he has every right to go after the person who invited him to crypto.But to some point, the person in question really made a bad investment decision. There is a level to which you should invest in something you ordinarily just heard from someone, something you don't have an idea of on your own, and you spend until you shut down your existing business, all because of what? High promised return on investment?Without a second lesson taught to me, you can't introduce me to something for which I will take funds from what's currently giving me earnings, something I have full control over, to go and invest in something else, up to the extent that I will no longer have anything else left to sell in my shop.This kind of story will always end in two ways: if the shop owner who loses his shop because he invested all of his capital in Bitcoin doesn't have any other means, he will be left with no other option but to sell off and grab whatever's left of his capital, then record the rest as a loss. Which he will either accept in good faith or run back to the person who invited him into crypto without giving him any proper knowledge about it, since the entire story describes the person as the major problem here.",

Also, Bitcoin isn't a get rich-quick scheme tho, it requires patience, a good attitude, and wise decision-making, such as buying and selling at the right time. It's important to avoid greed because you could end up losing a lot.It's important for newbies to understand that the market is highly volatile, especially the price of Bitcoin, which can increase or decrease by thousands of dollars in just a few hours and that's already happened before, this is mostly due to supply and demand.Long story short, it's important to explain all the basics to anyone interested in investing in Bitcoin.",

Too lazy to study and delve into the details personally - be prepared to pay with your wallet.Get-rich-quick schemes tend to empty your wallet quickly.Advising people to invest in btc is costing more to yourselves. OP's story, described above, is a good example of this. If a person earns on your advice, then you probably won’t hear any words of gratitude. If a person loses on your advice, he will definitely blame you for this.

You are just responsible if you have assumed the obligation to introducing bitcoin to anyone. Not ready? Then don't advise.2. It's not enough to say, but you need to explain.3. Precisely. The adviser doesn't incur any loss and that is why it is so easy to give advice to others. So don't blindly accept it.4. And what is the right decision?5. Nobody owes anything. Everything is purely voluntary.6. In my opinion, from the moment you start investing, all decision-making obligations are assigned to the person himself.7. Also a free solution.",

Obviously a single individual cannot control the price, unless he's some multi-billionaire. Lol. Bitcoin's market value is not controlled by any individual but rather, the majority. Problem is, majority has different opinions with regards to market prices of cryptos not only Bitcoin. We have this group called 'whales' which are basically huge investors of this industry, wherein mentioned group could temporarily create a trend because of high market volume. With regards to prior information about this industry, things won't be as easy as it may sound.  Decline on market prices are simply a part of market price volatility because of factors affecting such variable. There are just people who has high hopes because of the impression created from this industry.",

Some new investors who start entering just want to get instant profits without any long process. If they understand, they will definitely understand that the market cannot really be predicted 100%. We can only know where the limit is reached, but if the market situation is controlled by Whales and a lot of manipulation, we will be completely unable to guess. Just go with the flow of the market. There is no need to explain in detail to those who do not understand. They really have to learn directly from the market so that they will have the experience of how the market does not go according to our predictions. There is nothing wrong with Bitcoin or the crypto market. We have to understand and understand how the market is, not fight it.",

Also the effect of volatility on the market has been in a decline, at least I can say quiet reasonably because of the significance in participation that the Bitcoin world have enjoyed over the years.Advisably, I suggest that we make others understand the real and true concept behind the market and how investing in Bitcoin can be a great deal with time.
