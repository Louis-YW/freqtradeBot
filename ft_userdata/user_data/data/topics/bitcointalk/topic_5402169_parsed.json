      "body": "I think most the sportsbook allows that unless you are doing something shady to increase your chance of winning or you are really good to the point that you are just getting profit to the casino for a long time without a single loss. Every casino will usually don't want players that don't contribute to their profit so limiting is their solution avoid potential loss since they are a business, not a charity. Can you provide your experience on how you come up with this inquiry so that we give you a proper suggestion base on your experience? Stake and Sportsbet is known for handling huge amount of bets without a problem.",

Thanks!All the crypto ones normally allow anyone including winners to play there at their site.They can afford to pay winners as they have huge amounts of money available to them and a lot of user base,I am talking about the reputable casinos and crypto sportbooks.They are in no way like bet365 which tend to limit the people who win more than 3000-5000 EUR,here it does not happen and most probably will not happen because there is no real sense to it.That is the beauty of crypto casinos in the first place,they pay multi million dollar jackpots so I find it highly unlikely they to limit winners on their sportbook section of the site.",

Try reputable gambling sites such as Stake.com I haven't read any issue about them limiting their players just because they are winning and base on my experience to them I don't encounter that (but I don't win really big amount).",

Is that really your question or you are asking about if the winners will be able to withdraw the money once they won the bet?. I am confused on what you really wanted to know and kindly clarify your question. Gambling sites that are trusted and reputable always pay their winners and doesn't make them lose all the time. The result is base on the sports (sportsbook) and games (casino) and it depends on your luck.",

      "body": "Thanks for the replies! Maybe i need to explain a bit more. The old school bookmakers, non crypto like for example bet365, dont like long term winners and after a while when you start winning because you have an edge and do +ev betting they limit you and you cant place more then an amount and maybe eventually close your account. This ofcourse sucks. So basically my question was if there are crypto sportsbooks that dont do the same stuff limit your accounts because you are a winner. If so, then basically they dont allow winners like the old school bookies. I know pinnacle for example dont limit players unless ofcourse you cheat or do something illegal, but it is harder to get an edge there. I saw people talking about stake and sportsbet unfortunately due to location/geo blocking they dont let me play there.",

Thanks!What exactly are you referring to in your question? I don't have a problem winning a bet at a well known, reputable sportsbook, so if you really are asking how I know which sportsbook to bet at, then you should first ask that. As for limiting, maybe it would be good to show us some examples? I don't know how much you gamble, but I believe that every sportsbook will have certain limits to protect their business.",

Thanks!If you find a sportsbook that doesn't allow bettors who often win to continue betting on their sportsbooks, it's simple, just leave it and look for another, now there are enough bookies available, you just need to find a trusted one. But if that happens the sportsbooks must have a reason or see the bettor doing something suspicious, because normally a business will always try to keep its customers stay with them.",

I think there's no such thing as limiting regular winners there even how many times their users already win a decent and big amount. But in the first place, are you a big roller or considered yourself a whale? I think you don't have to make that a problem for now if you are just an average gambler or not that staking a considered big amount. And besides, if there's a term about limiting those regular winners, I think it's difficult to get on that point as there should be a certain tier for it.For now, just use your preferred sportsbook and don't mind the supposed limit.",

Besides, sportsbook does not bet against you, they only facilitate bets on both sites, so why would they hate winners?",

Most casinos have lines like \"X casino reserves the right to ask for identification\" something something, so it's really up to them when they ask. It may not be because you're continuously winning but there could be an instance where it was a coincidence that you were winning at the time and yet they asked you for KYC for a completely different reason. But well in general, they don't ask it win or lose, BUT it doesn't mean the possibility of your account being limited (due to being required to do KYC for some reason) would not happen.",
