I can't find much info about them but then seem pretty legit for the most part and I was thinking of buying in on the presale. One thing that worries me a bit is that they are built on the Binance smart chain so all the fud surrounding Binance might affect their success. Here's some description about them from their site. \"What are we trying to achieve at ORYEN?Our long-term goal at Oryen Network is to make $ORY a recognised stable digital currency, which is used within different platforms and network chains. After observing and learning from the DeFi sectorsâ€™ previous mistakes, here are the main key points to take away as to how we look to differentiate ourselves from other projects:\"Here's a link to the presale. https://presale.oryennetwork.io/user/contribute?token_buy=&token_amount=Here's a link to the main site. https://oryennetwork.io/Please let me know what you guys think.

I can't find much info about them but then seem pretty legit for the most part and I was thinking of buying in on the presale.Ive visited the website. Could say its a nice website, however there are tons of red flag that Ive found which for me isnt worth investing. -their team profiles were just introduction of who they are, its best if they can show links to their actual profile like linkedin or at least Twitter so we can see if those are really the people working and not just a jpeg created profile or copy cat identity.-They dont show their presale sold or total accumulated funds from the sale. This is important, how would we know if they are really have potential.-No partnership with known platform. Like literally a self made project trying to show how good their project. Sometimes its depend on the platform but didnt see my objective on this one.-90% APY and never gonna go down base on FAQ? I think thats really alarming. Since we all knew it will at some point. If its not then they will have a big problem later on.My advise OP dont put your money. Its smells something fishy about this one.",

      "body": "Thank you sir, you bring up a lot of great points I overlooked. I guess I was in a daze from the websites beauty ðŸ˜…Â I asked them a few of your questions and he said the identities are concelaed so that people focus on the coin and project and not the devs. Â He wouldn't answer the question about the presales or partnerships and just gave me their audit instead. Very suspicious.Â  They're audited by solidproof.io and have passed everything. But one thing that caught my eye is something marked as 'low risk' which says: \"The owner can pass any arbitrary address and drain the complete balance of the contract.\" Definitley not good I think. Won't be investing in them now and will beÂ  more careful in the future!",

Some analysts see it as one of the top decentralized finance (DeFi) cryptocurrencies of 2022. I have heard that it is safe and transparent to use but I haven't used it yet.",
