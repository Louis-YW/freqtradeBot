I'm trying to learn all Trades just to discover what I am good at. Unfortunately, I can't say that I have Learned and Discover my expertise yet, what I do recognize is I am versatile in everything in any kinds of industry I have worked with. my Pay Grade currently  is just  Enough for the Skills that I am executing (Exchange for Fiat).However, I know the capability of cryptocurrency because it has Facts of its growing Value, way back let's say 2009 up to date. I have known Names - evidently showed Lifestyle change because of Crypto Savings. So In conclusion, I respectfully ask \"what is your Effective Expert Advise for a Person (me) that has enough Salary but still want more Financial Stability using cryptocurrency\". P.S.

Bees don't waste their time explaining to flies that Honey is better than shit First I like this quote.Quote from: Strufmbae on November 02, 2023, 06:44:42 AMSo In conclusion, I respectfully ask \"what is your Effective Expert Advise for a Person (me) that has enough Salary but still want more Financial Stability using cryptocurrency\". It is good that you have realized you need some other source of income than what you get as salary. Salary is what you get based on the work you do for your company or boss and you can be fired any day your boss woke up on the wrong side of the bed and by that time, your \"enough salary\" will be gone. In other words, no salary is enough because you are still under someone business.So grow your own business. You already have crypto knowledge, focus on it. At the moment you have the opportunity to make more profit by DCA on bitcoin and wait for halving. I think that is what many hodlers are doing now until they are done with the upcoming bull run.",

Are you looking for a long-term investment so that you have enough cash if you are fired from your job or decide to give up work, or are you looking to be wealthy so that you live a life in which you do not need to check the \"PRICE on the PRICE TAG.\" Investing is a game of continuous learning, but to be a successful investor you must learn discipline and have a specific saving strategy. Then, the simplest investment strategies such as Bitcoin DCA can double your investments in the long term without any investment experience.",

I am not sure of the reliability of some cryptocurrencies in the crypto industry but I can vouch for Bitcoin. My advice is that you consider buying Bitcoin using DCA and focus on keeping it not just for the halving but for a longer time. But for you to achieve this it is also important to make provisions for emergency funds to cover your expenses in times of uncertainties. Some hodlers sold off their Bitcoin prematurely due to uncertainties. Since you are an old-timer in the industry I guess you know about keeping funds safely in wallets. You also stated that you are versatile in other businesses so diversifying your investment to other sectors outside cryptocurrency could also be helpful.",

Focus on what generates profits for you (your job) and specialize in that, and leave trading to gamblers (capital providers) and professionals (capital recipients). Instead, build a bulletproof investment portfolio that isn't all crypto. a portfolio consisting only of crypto is extremely fragile. Currently, US bonds and gold seem to be a good pillar on which to base most of the portfolio. ETFs like NOBL will also add antifragility to a portfolio. The rest can go to DCA in Bitcoin.

Focus more on Simple Trading by buying one (or few) crypto asset when it's undervalued and sell when it's overpriced. Some may advice you to only accumulate and not sell, but I let people decide whether to sell or not.  One of the most reliable ways to Know when a crypto is undervalued in order to buy or when it's overpriced to sell, is to feel the public sentiments...You may buy when the pessimism level of the public about price decrease is high & the pessimism is based on weak fundamentals or anything untrue , and you may sell when the public optimism about price increase is high & based on weak fundamentals like ETF or anything untrue (& contrary to True Bitcoin principles). If you want it really easy, you may follow my past predictions to know the right time to buy or sell. My predictions are very unconventional and not like what you would expect from others",

I can understand your desire and goals for personal development. I can see you mentioned salary, but you have more opportunities. First, I want to mention another external case that I am dealing with, which is the story of a friend of mine who had a salary of over $1000 a month, and with that income, Life expenses won't be too difficult, but looking further into the future, that friend is still stuck, thinking about saving to buy a house, get married,... makes that friend always stressed. I introduced him to this market opportunity, of course not by telling him to buy Bitcoin, but to learn more skills to earn more income. And the important thing I see is balancing the time spent on the old job with the time spent learning the new job. I know there are many MMO related jobs that can bring in income, but of course it isn't easy when starting out. So I just want to wish you to always try and look at things more positively, always learn, and always look for new opportunities so you can achieve the target you want.",

It's from personal finance 101. Then, if you want to get financial stability through \"cryptocurrencies\" I advise you to forget that word. Use only Bitcoin. The best you can do is a strategy known as DCA which is to buy at regular intervals. How much can you buy? $50 a week or $50 a month? Buy every week or month depending on your situation the same amount. In 5 years there is a very high probability that you will have obtained a very good return on your investment. You can get an idea by simulating at https://dcabtc.com/ (the only thing is that the simulation is based on the past, and the future does not necessarily have to be like the past, but it serves as a guide).",

Having financial stability is everyone's dream, but because the choice you want is Cryptocurrency which has price fluctuations, the risk is greater. This means that what needs to be targeted is an asset that really has long historical value, guaranteed that this asset is the only one at the top in the digital asset chain, namely Bitcoin. You have at least fulfilled one of the ideal conditions, namely stable income, so that with long-term financial goals, Bitcoin is a solution among cryptocurrency solutions. You definitely already know, and you just have to decide whether you dare to take the opportunity or not. The Bitcoin halving is getting closer, perhaps with enough financial support that the results can be seen faster than the retailers out there who are determined to be able to collect Bitcoin every month.",

Are you looking for a short term investment like buying and selling crypto to make a quick profit or are you looking for a long term investment like holding crypto for years? Knowing your goals will help you decide which coins to invest in and how to manage your portfolio. I would therefore recommend you starting by educating yourself about cryptocurrency and learning about the different options available. Then, you can decide which cryptocurrency you want to invest in. You should consider the dollar cost averaging strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money on a regular basis regardless of the price of the crypto.Remember, Bitcoin is the most safest crypto to invest in but you may consider some altcoins too.
