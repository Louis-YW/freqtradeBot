  "content": "Thurman is supposed to fight Claressa Shields and he's been daring Crawford to fight but after all the negotiation he will end up fighting for the WBA world welterweight against StanionisStanionis was scheduled to fight Ortiz in July but the fight was cancelled because Ortiz was hospitalized two days before the weigh-in.Both fighters have a long lay off but definitely, they are going to be in the right shape come fight night as both fighters always show up in great shape.For me, the fight is almost even but I have Thurman winning by decision since he is the more experienced and versatile fighter between the two.QuoteThurman has agreed to challenge WBA world welterweight champion Eimantas Stanionis on December 9 in Las Vegas. The bout between Thurman, a former WBA/WBC 147-pound champion, and Stanionis will be part of a pay-per-view card Showtime will distribute from MGM Grand Garden Arena, which will commemorate the venueâ€™s 100th boxing card that night.Eimantas Stanionis-Keith Thurman Set For December 9 As Part Of Showtime/PBC PPV In VegasImages : Box.live",

      "body": "It's great to hear that Thurman is making a comeback to the ring after over a year of being inactive. His last fight was back in May 2022 against Mario Barrios, which he won via unanimous decision. His opponent is still quite young, at 29 years old, and doesn't have much experience. So, I'd automatically put my bet on Thurman to win this fight, especially since he has only one loss, and many believe he could have won that fight against Pacman if he had been more aggressive in the first half of the round.I think Thurman really needed this break, and while the fight against Crawford didn't happen, it's good to see him back in action. I'm hoping he wins this fight impressively, and I'm sure there's a big fight waiting for him in the near future.",

Plus the wealth of experience that he's got compared to Stanionis is a big help. I'd put my money on Thurman on this fight although I would probably consider arbitrage betting.",

Plus the wealth of experience that he's got compared to Stanionis is a big help. Thurman was a champion, and that pretty much explains why he's considered a better fighter. He lost his belt to Pacman, which is fair enough since Pacman is a legend, but it was a well-fought battle. It could have gone either way since the fight ended in a split decision, if I recall correctly.This fight feels more like his comeback, and I thought so, but it's not against a champion, so it's not as interesting. However, the fact that he has a fight now makes me believe he could still make a comeback to that championship fight one day.Quote from: Latviand on October 21, 2023, 02:10:24 AMI'd put my money on Thurman on this fight although I would probably consider arbitrage betting.Of course, that's the smart choice.

As far as I'm concerned, Terence Crawford is the only legitimate welterweight champion currently.Thurman doesn't fight often and outside of his win against Barrios, a b-level fighter, doesn't have a meaningful win in many years. The ring rust will be a factor although Stanionis hasn't fought in 18 months himself. Stanionis isn't all that great but I expect him to win simply because he is younger and still in his prime.",

The contrast here is clear, and I personally feel that this fight isn't what I expected.

But the Pacman fight is the one that really stands out in our memories, as it was a major event, especially for me since we consider Pacman as our hero. Thurman is known for his outspoken nature, and rightfully so, because he was a champion and still fights like one. If not for his injury, he could have been more active in boxing, but that's in the past, something we can't change. What matters now is that he's gearing up for another fight. I'm not sure if it's a big fight, but with Thurman in the ring, it's bound to be an intense battle, really worth watching. My concern is for his opponent, as I don't think they'll fare well in a toe-to-toe fight against Thurman.",

He loss the opportunity or a significant fight, one that was rumored to be a prelude to facing either Spence or Crawford. I'm sure his goal is to make a comeback and get another shot at the championship. Winning this fight is the first step, and his performance needs to be electrifying to drum up excitement among the fans, which is what the promoters are looking for.

Well, you know, aside from being young, Stanionis hasn't really shown much in the ring yet. This is like, probably the biggest fight of his life. If he manages to beat Thurman, it's gonna be a huge boost for his boxing career. I mean, up until now, only Pacman has managed to beat Thurman, and we all know the legend that Pacman is. So, if Stanionis puts in the work and upsets Thurman, it's gonna be a game-changer for him. Heck, it might even push Thurman into retirement.",
