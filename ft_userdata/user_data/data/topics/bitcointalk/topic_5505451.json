  "content": "Amidst bitcoiners interest on the section 5 of the strategic bitcoin reserve bill ( The bitcoin purchase program of 1,000,000 btc) many had to send out letters to their local senators. A few days ago, about 2200 letters was sent and today nearly 3000 letters have been sent. I don't know if this will be of any effect, but I think that the recipients would feel they're been spammed.Reading through this reddit post, I could say that not everybody would be able to draft out an appealing letter. When I went through the site where those letters are being submitted, I also noticed that a premade letter is on the site, as a template. But, people may send similar letters and senators will be receiving same type.However, the community needs this in the sense that US buying bitcoin as a hedge against monetary instability can lead to more countries having bitcoin reserve to strengthen the financial condition of their nation.I had to go through the strategic bitcoin reserve bill by Ms Lummis and noticed that nothing is decentralized about the concept. The secretary of treasury has more authority over all the private keys locations.And from the look of things they'll be a collaboration with the secretary of defense and secretary of homeland security to help secure the physical locations where the cold storage equipment would be kept. Although in a way meddling with the funds would be punishable by law.If it's passed, we'll watch how they'll be able to hold those btc for 20 years without amending the law.Those who wish to participant in this scheme here is the site https://satoshiaction.quorum.us/campaign/strategicreserve/",

I doubt it.It's ok for me if two conditions are met:1) the reserve is limited to an amount which don't enable the government to major market manipulation. See my concerns in this thread. The example used in that OP to use market manipulation to implement an address blacklist is perhaps a bit exaggerated, but for example if Bitcoin Core decided to implement more privacy into the protocol there is potential for resistance (governments threatening to sell their coins if Core doesn't \"obey\" them). Other areas where a government may try to interfere are the PoS or big blocks discussions.2) if the move is accompanied by a coherent cryptocurrency policy. This means for me that at least there should be acceptance to pay taxes with Bitcoin, a tax policy and regulation not causing major burden for crypto users, and no restrictions regarding the use as a payment means. Recognition as legal tender is not necessary.3) the reserve is meant to be permanent, this means that it should not be sold. So the goal should not be \"hold for 20 years\", but \"be part of Bitcoin's ecosystem\".A million BTC for the US would violate #1.",

It means that the common man will not be able to buy bitcoin in future to come if this happens. Government should concentrate more on other assets and not bitcoin.",

Holding bitcoin for 20 years is something every expert would recommend. I can't completely sleep at night knowing that some reserves of Bitcoin are in the hands of the government for 4 years not to talk about 20 years. What is the essence of holding an investment, I would immediately sell my holdings and focus on another asset. The reason is that there is nothing the government has regulated that they do not control. Bitcoin in reserve in the hands of the government is something I would never tie my fate to. Success is my reason for holding and investing in Bitcoin with the government involved I am no longer interested.",

Additionally, they wouldn't want to lose out in the investment, it'll all turn out in a way that'll work for the government. Although the last part of the bill stated clearly that the government wouldn't in anyway, for the sake of the reserve, restrict individuals from trading their bitcoins or confiscate people's digital assets. From historical approach of gold reserve, the government purchased a lot of gold, and somehow controls its flow in their favor. We'd be looking at a crypto market where the government try to manipulate the prices to work in their favor.",

The only thing to worry about is the market impact of the news. If US buys 1million BTC for reserve, it might also cause upward movement of the price of bitcoin. If they don't buy, naturally, bitcoin is built on scarcity model. It will on its own get scarcer as time goes.To me, I am even happy that the government is now talking about holding BTC as a reserve, ETF approved, etc. This is the global adoption that was said and prophesied years ago.",

In practice, it might not be, because purchasing so much (and by the US, no less!) is likely to trigger a bull run, driving the price forward, and thus this can end up costing much more.It's nice to see people getting active on the topic, and that they're aiming apparently for bipartisan support.
