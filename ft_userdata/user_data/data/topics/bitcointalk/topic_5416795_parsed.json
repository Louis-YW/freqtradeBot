  "content": "QuoteNew York CNN Business — US factories are humming, and manufacturers are scrambling to find workers as the pace of hiring hits levels not seen in decades.Friday’s September jobs report showed US manufacturers added another 22,000 workers in September, increasing employment in the sector by nearly 500,000 over the course of the last 12 months.The nearly 13 million workers employed in US factories make up the industry’s largest workforce since the Great Recession caused employment in the sector to plunge more than a dozen years ago. Since April, manufacturing employment has been growing at about a 4% annual rate, the fastest sustained pace of growth since 1984, when the sector had more than twice as large a share of US jobs.And employers say they now are scrambling to fill even more jobs. The sector has had about 800,000 openings for most of the last year, despite the hiring binge, according to the Labor Department’s report.With supply chains causing problems throughout the global economy, many US companies that depended on overseas suppliers have been shifting their focus to sources of parts and goods much closer to home.“It was taking months for parts to not only get manufactured but come across and they decided they were willing to pay US manufacturing pricing to get that much faster,” said Hayden Jennison, production manager for Jennison Corporation, a Carnegie, Pennsylvania, company that makes everything from fire fighting equipment to construction machinery. He said there’s enough demand for his goods to staff an entire additional shift at the factory. But even though he’s paying $20 to $30 an hour he can’t find the workers he needs.“Hiring has been a problem since 2020,” Jennison said. “Hiring experienced candidates that understand the industry, and understand what they’re doing, has been very difficult.”Typically factory jobs and output take a hit during economic downturns, as they did during the Great Recession. But even with fears of a recession rising now, industry experts don’t expect factory jobs to default to their familiar boom-to-bust cycle this time.“I think we’re in uncharted territory,” said Jay Timmons, CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers. “For every 100 jobs openings in the sector we only have 60 people who are looking. I think it’ll take quite a while to fill that pipeline.”Timmons said that pay in the sector is up 5% over the course of the last year, and he expects it to keep rising as manufacturers scramble for skilled labor.Experts say one of the biggest problems manufacturers face in attracting workers is their perception of the nature of the job.“We often take a look at the images of manufacturing and we see the sparks flying and a welding environment and perhaps it’s a little bit dingy, dark. But by and large our manufacturing jobs today are high tech,” said Eric Esoda, CEO of a not-for-profit providing consulting and training services to small- and mid-size manufacturers in Northeast Pennsylvania.One group employers are looking to for more help: women. Manufacturing remains a male-dominated industry, with only 30% of hourly factory jobs held by women, according to NAM. But that’s up from 27% only two years ago, and the Manufacturing Institute, an education and workforce development arm of NAM, has various programs aimed at raising the share of women workers on factory floors to 35% by 2030.Today less than 10% of private sector jobs are in manufacturing, compared to more than 40% at the end of World War II. But it is still a key sector of the economy, one that pays much better than many others. The Labor Department reports the average weekly wage for manufacturing jobs is $1,250, or $65,000 annually — 11% more than private sector jobs overall, and 81% more than retail jobs.https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/economy/manufacturing-jobs/index.html....This sounds very optimistic and upbeat. Although, if ventures such as these are having a real positive effect on the US economy. I don't think its being felt.While the manufacturing industry will definitely see a boost from high fossil fuel costs impairing global shipping. Followed by a shift to local sources of parts, goods and components. I think many manufacturing jobs in the united states rely heavily on subsidies. Which could make them prone to failure, should subsidy programs come to an end. The manufacturing sector in the USA is simply not very robust or independent. In the way that the country needs to fuel an explosion in manufacturing capability and job markets.I think what the united states and many nations of the world really need. Is for youth and small businesses to step up. Big business has become too monolithic, unwieldy and inefficient. Small start ups could help to fill the many needs and wants being created by our looming recession.",

Meaning the factories that benefit from the low transfer times end up hiring US workers and make them work in US factories because right now oil is expensive and transporting goods from China is not profitable.The cheaper Chinese workers could make the products cheaper, but adding the cost of transportation and also the loss of revenue during the period where they do not have any money and that means we are talking about loss of time and not selling products while waiting for it. Sure if you are buying 500k+ shoes like Nike does, it's still reasonable, but for smaller jobs, it's logical to stay in the USA and keep going.",

The same problem here in Europe:QuoteIn the EU, the employment rate of people aged 20-64 stood at 74.8% in the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 0.3 percentage points (pp) compared with the first quarter of 2022. we have hit record employment levels since the founding of the EU, roughly 8% up in a decade and with enormous room for more!And to make things even more interesting this whole statistics don't take into account foreign citizens that don't have a fiscal residency here but still work in European companies. The labor market in Europe has managed to absorb 400 000 Ukrainian refugees who have found a job, that's how desperate we were here for hiring, you're human and you know how to communicate you can get a job for sure, there are hundreds of companies who are resorting to paid training months, just sign a 24 months contract that you won't quit and they are ready to hire you and pay you even in the first 3 months you're learning how to do your job.So much for the death and destruction of the US and EU economies.Quote from: Hydrogen on October 11, 2022, 11:56:02 PMThis sounds very optimistic and upbeat.Yeah, quite a different thing around here where there is doom and gloom and only talk about crashes, recessions, new world orders, bankruptcy, and other collapses.

I can give you an example like the tire factory my cousin works for, they are hiring about 1000 people and 80% of the jobs are hybrid, most of it you can do from home, R&D,  engineers for safety mechanisms, architecture, developers, testers, etc I think the ratio of brain vs muscle needed is 20:1 at least.Quote“We often take a look at the images of manufacturing and we see the sparks flying and a welding environment and perhaps it’s a little bit dingy, dark.

As I've said, there are probably lots of odd jobs in the US that even unemployed Americans wouldn't take. But I'm more than sure that those odd or even dirty jobs are coveted from the perspective of many foreign labor force. So I think companies that are left with no choice would always have that option. They'd probably rather hire foreign workers that need training than sacrifice their operation or productivity.QuotePlus I think if there's a shift away from the US getting most of its manufacturing done in China and wherever else, it's going to be a temporary thing.  After all, there's a reason all of those jobs went overseas in the first place, i.e., it's so much cheaper than hiring American workers.  We'll see.We'll see. Of course, cheap labor force is definitely a significant factor but that's not the only consideration. There are probably a number of companies that would rather pay bigger salaries for the sake of standard or overall business environment or whatever. But those large manufacturing companies that are having a hard time filling vacancies for years would probably be enticed to move overseas where labor is overflowing and cheap, provided the environment is conducive enough to do business.",
