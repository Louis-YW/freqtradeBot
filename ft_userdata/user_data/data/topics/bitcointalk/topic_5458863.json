  "content": "On Binance, there is multi-asset mode, which is limited to some coins like bitcoin, ether, bnb, ripple, USDT, USDC, BUSD and USDP. On Bybit there is unified trading account which is unlimited because it applies to all coins. The coins you have on multi-asset mode on Binance, or the coins you deposit into your Bybit unified trading account, you can use them to open a position or some positions depending on how you want it. These are the two exchanges that I know that have such way to trade. Another which I know is OKX, it has multi-currrency margin, I do not know what it is because it requires accounts that want to go for it to have at least 9900 USDT worth of USDT. But I do not think it is the same as to what I am looking for. If anyone have option for it before, please you can let me know about it. But my question is I like to trade with several coins at once, to use them to open a position. I have done that on Binance and Bybit successfully. But I need more exchanges for it. I use Huobi, OKX and Kucoin but they do not support it. Any other exchange that support trading with more than one coin at once to open a position?",
