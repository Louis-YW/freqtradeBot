We'd rather believe the word saying \"should newbies invest in old projects\" as it is likely and more possible to have ROI after rather than these new projects that we never know. Don't get deceived by what you see high offering returns as this is likely impossible to happen. Make your mind think that these new projects don't have a brighter future than those that have been established well.",

A new project is risk on itself, why you don't invest in popular cryptocurrency and try the luck there instead of doing it in a very new project with no trust.That's an investment, every project has its own risks. Nothing is completely 100% secure even on older projects. In fact only Bitcoin provides the best solution if you really want to invest in the long term. For the OP there is nothing wrong if he wants to jump into a new project that he has learned well. This failure will be a valuable lesson for him in the future. All require decisions and take risks, otherwise there will be no learning about investing. Not sure about knowing the good and bad of a new project unless you are willing to take the risk. And the responsibility to accept the risk of what he chooses.",

I always see newbies looking for gems in the market that would make them millionaires and end up being rekt in the process. Avoid that. Go for trusted, the ones with roots. They always find their way back to being valuable even after a dump. Just like this time. Ethereum for example, it is not even the slightest near from when I bought them 1-2 year ago. $300 per piece. Imagine that. How much it is now even after a load of dump?",

Don't rush your investments because that's where they make the mistake of investing into something which is scam, ponzi, affiliate, unreal projects. Because whenever a newbie enters in the market they are attracted to the quick money projects and also far for the traps of crypto universe. Since you never know whose behind the idea you can't straight away predict how successful something would be! Be careful with them. Obviously NFT's taking shape but with lot of downs these days and too many fake alike are coming. NFT is costly market too, better start with simple investment like bitcoin as you have opportunity to buy it at its lowest.",

Although some may really care enough to give genuine advise but what happens to a project is unpredicted which may get you rekt in the upcoming days after investing. The best way would be to control your greed and start small on reputable projects first as you gradually learn how to research about a project and criticize properly at least to an extent where you get 5+ wins out of 10 investments. But if you really wanna gamble on it, then use a very small amount which you can completely ignore when lost. Don't regret not gaining much profit since it is better than losses.",
