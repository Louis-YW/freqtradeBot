  "content": "Despite the low confidence in the price action lately, we are seeing a sideways market.A sideways market is when the price moves horizontally, rising and falling but not breaking out or down. It indicates indecisiveness or consolidation, which could create a turning point. The question is in which direction will the price action go? Well, we can only hope it breaks out and starts a new trend, but it can still go down.The only good thing about a sideways market is that the price action between support and resistance is more predictable, so it's a good time to scalp. However, during a period of indecisiveness, you should trust fundamental indicators more than technical indicators, as anxious investors often turn their attention toward macroeconomic factors. This way, you can better anticipate breakouts. I'm not a financial adviser so take my words with a pinch of salt. But, these are general facts most traders already know of. Yes, there's money for you even in a choppy but only if you play your cards right. Trade, not gamble.",

      "body": "Op, I like the term and that you brought it up. The price does seem sort of stuck around $30k, not moving significantly above or below this point. As I see no strong reasons for Bitcoin to stay down right now (no major restrictions from major countries, no big companies pulling out money, nothing like that), I think it's likely that the price will go up from this point. But, of course, who knows, maybe it can go down even further. It's best to wait it out and see what happens.",

If this sideway movement takes weeks to month,  I will only expect another issue to rise for price to dip again $25k, its a stressful slow downtrend.

Many traders look on short time frame and view crypto market market in general using it. Longer time frame suggest that Bitcoin is not on sideways but rather on the continuous dump since the relief to 45K area. It's a good thing that weekly candle didn't close below 28K and bounce back before the weekly candle print. I’m still hoping tomsee a doji on a weekly candle or else we will continue go down the 20k support or worst if the bull can not find a strong support.Let's see and observe what will gonna happened on the current weekly candle to determine the trend if there is a potential reversal.",

Well, we can only hope it breaks out and starts a new trend.It depends on how long you want to buy and hold, if it is for short period of time, I can guess this may still not be the best time because we do not know if the price of bitcoin can go down the more, but if it will go down, the downturn would probably not be significant. You can still wait for awhile before buying but what if you miss the boat, it is possible but I think it is not likely for now. If you want to invest for a long period of time, you can buy and hold bitcoin right away, the price will increase and you will gain but this can take like 2 or 3 years.You can have a kind of investment strategy like some people bought at $35000, but not with all their money, bought again at $30000 but just part of their money, they are ready to buy at $25000 and also if bitcoin price decrease the more, which I do not think, they are ready to invest more money at $20000. This is a good investment that long term holders will seruly make profit from when bull run start.",

If the response is positive it might be the bottom.I am \"wishing\" that this should be the bottom because it has been quite some time now since we have seen a green market.",

We are currently in a recession, many people will just keep the cash so they can  spend for the necessity. But only the rich people will keep on buying in the crypto market. Retail investors will feel the need to cash out. This could be  just a reset in crypto where only the rich can afford soon. So hold on to your dear life.",

I personally blame the irrational investors who keep buying bitcoin hoping for quick profit, aka weak hands. At any time the \"more predictable\" support or resistance could be broken just as we saw hundreds of times before where price shoots up or crashes down. My favorite example is from April 2019 when $4k resistance suddenly breaks and price shoots up 50% in one day doubles in a couple of weeks.",
