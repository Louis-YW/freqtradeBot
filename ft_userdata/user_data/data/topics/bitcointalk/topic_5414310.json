Bitcoin?Please, I need answers cus honestly, it's something I dunno. No insults, please.RSVP ‚ò∫Ô∏èSandra üë©‚Äçü¶±",

Once migrated, all data here will be transfered there, host, domain name, etc. so there's no need to register again. So the platform is still bitcointalk, its members, staff/mods, and admins.

You can take a look at what the software looks like here, although bear in mind that it is not a ported environment (i.e. DB content, profiles, boards, not even complete functionality such as Merits and so forth).One thing to consider is that what is being created by intent is a software on which to run forums of all sorts (a kind of SMF if you will, from an abstract point of view), not just a custom implementation for a one-off forum called Bitcointalk. This means that software development is much more complex, as it has to work with open customizable concepts to support different forum configurations and functionality, and not just something 100% tailored only to Bitcointalk. This approach certainly is behind the massive overhead of time and resources being invested in the project, although on its own likely does not justify the delay.",
