Using the default settings and not securing your account properly opens you up to many scams.  This has been going on for years. I've even been accused of it myself by some forum loser with a big brain/head.",

But I decide to be reporting them to telegram moderators because you can report any group or channel, but none of them has been banned and I keep reporting them but nothing done and they are still active. We have been saying something about google but I think Telegram is the worst.I think that all the communities of the popular projects, platforms, wallets .. etc., in the crypto market on the Telegram app their members are targeted by scammers. The Telegram application has become one of the best and most indispensable communication applications and has a vast user base. I can confirm that all or most users have probably come across one of the scammers who DMs them first.You can find the option to report and block at the top of the account & If you provide your evidence and necessary details about any of the scammers and the reasons you believe they are scammers through https://t.me/notoscam or the following email: abuse@telegram.org. After the Telegram team reviews your report, they may impose restrictions on the account for a period of 7 days. After repeated reports from other members, the period of restriction on sending messages will be increased, and then finally, the ban will be imposed on the scammer's telegram account permanently.Unfortunately, even if their accounts are banned, they will create other accounts with virtual numbers and continue to deceive people, so the solution is to block and report everyone who DMs you first, as group moderators follow this rule to protect their community.",

No way. The way scammers operates is just clueless to victims at times. You can't say you know how to avoid scammers when you still know how to fall for them unless you feel like giving them that little token. Please in case of next time send it to me rather than giving them your cashðŸ˜….You reporting those scam channels to moderators of telegram is a waste of time for me, is like it won't work like they're untouchable. Is best your avoid replying them because they really know how to get into their victims skin so I'd advise you do them the pleasure by reading their messages and continue doing your thing because as it is, nowhere is safe not even google you mentioned even the telegram X too.",

You'll always get those random people messaging you of something they've found out and it's a great opportunity that they're sharing as if they've found that will change your life and they're very optimistic about it. I guess Telegram really needs to step up on this one and has to do something with these users. But with them having the premium, many scammers can just avoid that and with their feature of easy changing the usernames/names of each user, it's one reason why it has became a den of scammers. So if Telegram isn't really doing anything against them, you just block those random messages that you get because you will really get these messages every channel you join, they're like watchers and observers waiting for some new people to message.",

Any such social media or search engine is the same. They will not filter out bad things for you, you have to decide which one to take in.Often these people will have proxy accounts inside the group and a scammer outside the group and the data collected through the proxy will be used to contact via the scammer account - in such cases mods are out of power because the scammer account is not in the group at all. Whenever you see an account that is not having any common group with you and is messaging you, block it, 99% it is a cold call scammer.",

Although I was conscious of receiving those messages and to what they are saying is for me to reveal my login details so along the line their discussion wasn't in line to help me rather they are interested for my login email and password.
