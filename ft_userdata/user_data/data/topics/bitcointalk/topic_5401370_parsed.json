  "content": "Kevin De Bruyne thinks the UEFA Nations League is 'just glorified friendlies' Kevin De Bruyne: UEFA Nations League is 'just glorified friendlies'QuoteKevin De Bruyne has blasted the UEFA Nations League, describing the competition as a 'glorified friendly'.De Bruyne's Belgium will get their 2022/23 Nations League campaign underway next month against the Netherlands, with three matches scheduled between 3 June and 13 June adding to the already hectic football calendar.The Manchester City man was in no mood to hype up the coming matches, telling a press conference that he'd rather be resting after a tough season.\"Two weeks is too long. Well, as a player we can't change that much. I'm not exactly looking forward to it,\" he admitted.“The Nations League is unimportant in my eyes. Just glorified friendlies after a long and tough season. I am not looking forward to it.I stumbled on this news some days ago and I thought I should bring it here to get your opinions. I do understand his point. Players need rest after a long season but I do not see any other player complaining(please correct me if I am wrong). So far I have enjoyed watching the UEFA Nations League matches. I believe that it will serve as a sort of litmus-test for the teams and their coaches ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar which begins on 21 November.  By the way Belgium already lost to the Netherlands(1-4). So do you think the UEFA Nations League is glorified friendlies?",

He has the right to complain, but he signed a contract as a football player, and what do football players do to get paid right? If he doesn't wanna play on these 'filler' cups, perhaps he should renegotiate his contract to not include these games for his role as a player for these clubs.",

Maybe other players have not come out openly like KDB to speak their mind, but certainly it will be a concern to many, he is just maybe the most outspoken so far. Some player's actually deserve rest for a bit, it is has been a very demanding season for some of them. You may call it complaining but he has the right to speak up. Some of these players were called up believing that they may not need to play much, but some of them have played full time. So if KDB see's the competition as glorified friendlies, that's his opinion and he has a right to hold one. I enjoy the games, but truthfully some of these players deserve to rest and spend time with their family.",

We can feel euphoria when the UEFA Cup competition is running, but not for the UEFA Nations League. The good thing about the UEFA Nations League is that national teams can measure the ability of their country's teams on a regular basis.\"I agree with what Kevin de Bruyne said, the UEFA Nations League is a glorified friendly.\"",

You're right, this game is just a warm-up so a lot of what we see isn't serious about putting in an ideal performance before the show officially starts. Indeed, from the start this was only an introductory event, but on the other hand I don't think the players should get injured. This will clearly have a bad impact if it occurs when the official match has not started.",

I don't understand people like Roberto Martinez, who is using his big stars like De Bruyne in the Naitons League, De Bruyine needs a break after a long season, Martinez could let some young players play.The Nations League matches are important for the weak national teams, but not important for the big national teams, so De Bruyne is wrong about those games being friendlies.",
