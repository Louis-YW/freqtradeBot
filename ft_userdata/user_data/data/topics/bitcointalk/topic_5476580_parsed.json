      "body": "I use Coinmarketcap for price movement and comparing the price of coin with dollar, and it very fast and accurate, I deem it to be the best. Beside using it for the purpose of crypto price it also give some details about the coin. Like for example it tells the market cap, coin volume, the total supply, max supply, coin websites and it even goes as far as making links for the coin white paper. Without any argument I want to believe that Coinmarketcap is  the best so far.",

Think that's because Coingecko has a much more simplified user-interface to me. But generally speaking, I usually just check prices on whatever CEX I'm trading on, and for now that's Bitget. Thankfully, the platform has an oversimplified interface as well, with several options to allow easier understanding of the charts among everything else. Good stuff!",

I also use this site to verify legitimacy of of contract address of coins before loading them in my wallet.There are other website those also provide real-rime information about prices of crypto currencies and their list is given below:1- CoinGecko2- CryptoComparePlease keep in mind that availability of services and features may change in future.",

I must check prices about 100 times a day & that is no exaggeration. You can use it on a desktop PC obviously but it has a really clean app that you can use with your mobile phone. It’s great when you’re on the move. Obviously you can create a watchlist & favourite certain coins. I think it’s the best one by far.",

They are much simpler and easier to look at.I'm in no way involved with them but it has became my goto site for price update. There also seems to have more functionality and clearer data but you need to login to use all of those.Even with the constant update, I feel the site is lighter than coinmarketcap and as I use an adblocker, I can't compare the number of ads on any of them.",

      "body": "So some people mention why would this person want to check btc price a few times a day when they don't own any.  The reason is because they are related to someone close that has some btc and that person told them about it.  So this person wants to check the btc price for that reason.  Also that person told me they might have to buy some as well sometime later on most likely if it continues to go up.  The thing was I told this person well if you check btc price, do it at home but the issue is the old that person used to check btc price at home no longer works anymore.  Back then I went to the bitstamp website on that old phone that the person keeps at home so anything they want to check the price, they just enter their old phone passcode and then click on chrome and it would show the current price on bitstamp.  Then click on the button to close the phone.  So if they were to click on the phone again, they have to enter the passcode.  The point of this was I didn't want to do this on their main phone that they use and in public because if they do check it while in public and other people notice it, other people would assume this person has btc which they don't.So because this person does not have an extra phone or computer, what is the best way?  If it was me with just one main phone and nothing else and I want to check btc price in public, I would be careful checking it and everytime I check it, I would then erase the chrome or safari browsing history or just check it in incognito mode.  Having the other person erase the history or incognito mode would be very hard for them to do each time.  I mean they can still do that on their main phone but only check it at home right?  The issue here is that person would have to write down the bitstamp site on a piece of paper and leave that at home since each time they delete the history or incognito mode, they have to check on paper how to do it.  Let say that person wants to do it in incognito mode.  First they have to know how to do that.  Then after that, they have to remember the bitstamp website spelling.  Then only after that, close the browser.  The issue is the next time they visit the website again, they would have to look at the spelling of the website.  Get it?  So in this situation, best way for this person to check btc price at home where there would be no history of it?",
