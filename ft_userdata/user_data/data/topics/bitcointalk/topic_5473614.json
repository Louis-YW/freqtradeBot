Let me take it  to the aspect of Tuitorship.I do not know how we might have come to know about this forum, but don't we think it is better to find someone we can discuss and ask questions on how this forum operates as most persons won't see it as to create a topic thread, I believe to stay in this forum is very simple just by obeying instructions,Specifically for we the lower ranks, let us not claim to know all about what we know nothing. In as much teachers are needed in a school, because they have passed such stages as  students and  are their to guide the students same way we need to be mentored by this our high ranked members. Tuitorship not only on things related to this forum but Bitcoin as whole. As high ranked members their are some certain losses due to mistakes that you might have experienced which you would not want any one of us to make same mistakes and even if you must have talked about it earlier in the forum I do not assume it is possible to read every bit of your topic thread or those shared in comments.Which country does not want his/her board to come out top when ranking, so I feel our oga dem fit help out in this aspect.",

My point is that, a lot of people in this our local board are so desperate for recognition and merits that they believe it's just by copying certain informative articles and news and use it to spam the board. I'm not saying the news and the articles are not helpful, indeed they are, I personally have learned a lot from them, but when something good is excessively done, it's thereby known as abuse and it's the outcome is never good.In a nutshell, it's very important for the high ranked members to share their knowledge and guidance to we the newbies and low ranked members in order for us to grow in the right path, with the right mindset. We rise by lifting others so we can all rise together and make a recognition for country board.",

But now wattin person dey see na account with first post don start to dey educate em elders, though some persons get the knowledge before dem enter the forum, and e you see those people account most time their merit dey pass their amount of posts because of quality knowledge wey dem get, but some newbies wey never too know go dey try to dey bring that kind leg come.Just as the op don talk, teacher dey for class because em students won get knowledge from am no be the other way around, I no say the young shall grow oo, but make the young sef grow pass through the major process. So my advice to newbies na be say you fit dey make very serious contributions for other people posts, but when e comes to creating thread make most of dem be say na question wey go make you know quickly, so that e no go tay for you to grow become Ogah.",

Well said bro, but most people just get obeying issues and I think the learning from people are also the best way to improve oneself especially from top guys here in the forum no even your oga them self. For me, I no go lie e take me some time before I actually come dey use to the system and although I go follow any oga but thorough training of my contribution skills nai really help me and when I say contribution I mean writing and understanding skills because these are the basic thing every one needs here, if you know what to write and how to write it then I think the forum will be a fun place for you because they are so many things and knowledge here not even only Bitcoin that you can achieve aslo chip in your little contribute for someone to see your efforts and actually merit you for it.",

Now na for water proof and fire proof safe I dey store my mnemonic seed, so that unplanned event no go fit just come scatter my investment. So make person learn how to keep em mnemonic well oo, if that one lost e mean say all you coin don go.E no get any country wey no like to grow so I leave the floor for our baba dem make dem shook mouth for this matter enlighten we the young ones.",
