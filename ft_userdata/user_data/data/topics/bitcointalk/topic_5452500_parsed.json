I joined the telegram channel of one of the least-known Indian cryptocurrencies exchange. I asked a simple query to one of the main chats before asking it with one of the moderators. My query was not related to cryptocurrency. It was about a crypto/INR conversion as one of my friends (who is not good with English) asked me to question his issue on the main chat. The issue was resolved but my friend got targeted by a scammer the next day. I am sharing the screenshot of real moderator and the scammer.Real ModeratorScammerDid you find any difference between the above images? If you have then it is good otherwise you will get scammed.",

      "body": "This is one of the simplest & oldest ways to scam someone.What made me compare the scammer's image was how cleverly he created the same username.If you compare both images, there is one thing that is similar the username. If you dig deeper, it is all about where the username has been posted. The scammer is intelligent, but still careless, as he cannot copy the golden tick and the accompanying info. These scams can led a newbie like you get convinced that the scammer is a Moderator. That is why you need to do a detailed check when talking to unknown.",

      "body": "Nothing new! This happens with everyone whenever you ask a query on the main chat. The way this scammer created his profile is not new too. This is a signature way to scam anyone. What you need to do is avoid Telegram and avoid Indian exchanges. That being said if you join any Telegram channel of a CEX you would find scammers doing the same. Be careful and do the same kind of R&D when you see someone unwanted contacting you.",

If you have then it is good otherwise you will get scammed.This isn't new, it's quite old. I remember this scam is being running from the days when there were ICOs and those ICOs had their telegram channels. Scammers used to make fake account with admin names to scam the users into getting funds in their accounts. Using very same usernames with just a letter here and there. Using bio in username. I have even seen them finding emoji to replicate the ticks along with the names as well. It was after this that ICOs clearly started stating to use the address mentioned on the websites only.",
