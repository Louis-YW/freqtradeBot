  "content": "I am mining and loving how easy is to make like near 40 RTM daily,I want to make more and I have a E5 1650 v1 at home,it was staying like crazy at 91 degree Celsius when mining with 8 out of 12 threads that this processor has and which I mine with.I changed the thermal paste and now it runs 87 max in the highest difficult algorithm as Raptoreum changes algo a lot,it goes from 83-87 and then it stops,however I don't have the CPU fan spinning at max because it makes a crazy noise.I tried with the same setup Â of HP Z 420 but with another processor the E5 2640 v1 runs at 64-70 degree max.What can I do,should I change CPU fan cooler to a Cooler Master or something like that,or for the E5 series such temperatures are not that a big of a problem from what I have heard ?",

If you don't really care about the CPU you can justlet it go and hope it doesn't fail too soon.I think I will order at Aliexpress a E5 2640 V1 which is 90 watt and that should not heat as much as this,the cooler is in perfect condition as I checked it,but apparently Linux makes it heat a bit more than Windows.The E5 2640 cost just 9 dollars in total so I don't care anymore what happens to this processor,if it dies so be it,this is a beast of a processor though,going to 1400 H/s while I have two E5 older version at work and they both do like 800 H/s in the best performance,the overall average though of this I have is near 400-500 H/s so I am very happy to add like another 10-13 coins to my daily rewards at the cost of this processor going to hell.Sometimes it goes to 61-63 degrees and I don't know why maybe because it is running a low power algorithm?",

You either increase coolingor reduce heat generation.I removed hyperthreading by making it disabled in Bios,could not find where to underclock the processor,the situation is still the same though,temperature is just 2-3 degree Celsius less at 83-84 but the hash rate dropped significantly once I disabled the hyperthreading.I am quitting mining for the moment until I got like 1-2 Pcs of E5 2640 V1 processors and I got them in stock here at home,once I have them,I am running 100% full power this processor until it fails,I would not care much once I am stoked up with a couple of other CPU-S.",
