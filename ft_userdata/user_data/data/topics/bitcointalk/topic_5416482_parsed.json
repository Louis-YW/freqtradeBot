      "body": "Do not confuse yourself with grammar. It is just trading. Order flow trading is the strategies and analyses that traders are using to trade. If you want to know more about this, you have to read the do and don't of trading, that is very important. After reading that online, you can open an account on exchange like Binance. On Binance, you can see many article and video guides that would help you in trading. But do not forget that you should not use the amount of money you can not afford to lose to trade, trading is highly risky.",

      "body": "I think this is a hard strategy to implement in crypto as there are lots of different markets that are traded at once and some will see volume spikes (even if others have higher volume) because of the nature of their users.That aside, it's sometimes good for the very short term. I've only used a strategy like that when selling when I see a large block of sell orders or buying when I see the opposite (but not on fast trading exchanges which seem to be a lot more erratic with this).",
