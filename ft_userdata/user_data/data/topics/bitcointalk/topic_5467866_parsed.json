Binance p2p business and other p2p platforms are booming seriously with the volume of these transactions running into millions of dollars monthly. Meanwhile, banks enjoy fair share of this in terms of transfer fees and other charges including value added tax to goes to the government.  The only threat Bitcoin pose to the banks in my country is that many people now save their funds in Bitcoin and not in the banks because inflation have killed the local currency as well as other previously profitable investment methods such as fixed deposits, treasury bills and bond markets. Furthermore, restriction on FX by our government further gave Bitcoin edge because people resorted to Bitcoin for their international transactions and as well know,  Bitcoin never fails. Consequently,  even our Bureau De Change cried out  that Bitcoin via Binance p2p is killing the country's local currency.",

Bitcoin was created as an alternative to banks but in its development we have seen that this is not the case, because what most people do is transfer from their bank to CEX to buy Bitcoin and/or shitcoins, sell and bring the money back to their bank.

Yes, but it is just another alternative, although use is growing. Before there was Bitcoin, people invested in gold, or in the stock market, as well as in many other financial assets to beat inflation.",

There are some cryptocurrencies before Bitcoin too. [1]Bitcoin is a first successful cryptocurrency based on blockchain and it motivates many developers to launch their projects, products on blockchain as alternate cryptocurrencies (altcoins, some people call them as shitcoins).Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency exchanges popularly use 2FA that has been started to use in banks and some other industries. It is a start for banks but applying blockchain in bank system is still in early phase. They will start it with CBDCs, but those blockchains will be centralized by governments, central banks and commercial banks. [2][1] Bitcoin: Prehistory[2] https://cbdctracker.org/",

It is not widely popular in country where I live and most of the people aren't aware of it yet. The banking sector isn't taking any actions against it because they don't consider it alarming for their system. Although, once or twice the governmental sector tried to have some regulations and strict actions against it but that has noting to do with the banking sector. And, fortunately not even the governmental sector got any success in suppressing it.Like Odohu said, in my country the same scenario is taking place. The banks are receiving enough money thanks to the p2p transactions that are taking place in centralized exchanges. The banks are also profiting from the Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies p2p transactions and that's why they aren't taking any actions against Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies.The banks have increased their fees for those merchants who are increasing their monthly sending and receiving limits. Although, most of the p2p transactions go through bank accounts directly and they don't have much fees but when we count the volume of the transactions that are taking place per month then we can see that the banks are earning in millions of dollars from those transactions.",

BTC offers something different for people who want to use it, and that is permissionlessness, self control and censorship resistance, so it is the people who are looking for these features in a currency that will use BTC, and also those who want to make money from its volatile nature.",

However, this does not mean that the state must emphasize its rejection when there is such a large inflow and outflow. The solution is that banks relax their policies towards Bitcoin with open arms so that they can provide mutual benefits to each other. Bitcoin investors and traders have always been subject to monitoring of asset holdings and the Bank does not want this to fall outside its radar. The traditional banking system in my country is now starting to show interest in what digital assets have to offer, including Bitcoin and other crypto assets. So that banks synergize with local exchanges to build cooperation and encourage them to continue to educate the public about the importance of investing in today's digital era.",

However, if traditional banks feel challenged by the presence of Bitcoin among the public, this may be due to the lack of new conveniences that their customers require from banks in terms of serving their own customers.Meanwhile, Bitcoin is not like that because Bitcoin only needs to be understood well enough by everyone who wants to use it for several things such as investment, trading and also just to store it for the long term. So I don't see Bitcoin challenging the banking sector through any system, because the only ones who feel challenged are the traditional banks themselves when Bitcoin is already so well known among people throughout the world.",

They found that Bitcoins allow them to manage their funds independently without any third party person interfering. This has started happening frequently from 2018. This has definitely challenged the banking monopoly. For this many government have also banned using the currency in their respective countries.

It's still far from what it should be, still steps forwards were made.But actually challenging the monopoly? No. Not by far. Even more, it helps them (possibility to use blockchain for certain things, the chance for new investment products, the chance for diversifying the means of backing their fiat - even if not used yet, the chance for new business partnerships - eg with exchanges, ...).In my country they are still somewhat sleeping under their rocks and failing to seize opportunities.

At present, people of our country instead of keeping money in banks, they are keeping money with themselves or building land or houses in exchange for money.

Meanwhile, the volatility of bitcoin will cause the value of our currency to fluctuate very strongly in a short time, sometimes it will cause our money to lose 20%, 30%, or even 50% of its value, is it suitable to become a savings? In case people fear the local currency will lose value, they still have a more suitable choice than gold as a means of storing value because gold is more stable. Bitcoin is more suitable for investing for the future than saving, IMO.",

The initial idea of Bitcoin, as far as I am concerned, is that it acts as an alternative to a trust-based system. With Bitcoin, trust is obliterated.
