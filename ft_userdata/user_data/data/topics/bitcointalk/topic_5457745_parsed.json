  "content": "With recents upsets to crypto exchanges, Coinbase and Binance, by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) it looks as of they are more invested in going after exchanges who they feel are not meeting or following their  criteria  for operation. With such a development, there are individuals who feel the SEC are slowly losing sight of what they stand for and this was further proven after the SEC served Coinbase a Wells notice that could not be clarified.US congressman, Warren Davidson, has introduced a bill that would see the SEC being restructured and it's chairman, Gary Gensler being removed and citing concerns over his seemingly tyrannical rulership, stating his intentions to protect the crypto market from heavy regulatory actions. He further outlined seven failures of the SEC chairman, which led him to him believe Gary is incapable of remaining in that position.1- he averages more than two rules proposals a month2- he provides inappropriately short comment periods3- he has unfavorable and unlawful ESG disclosure mandates on the market. 4. He operates a \"check-in and never leave\" rule for crypto5- he has endless discoveries with no clarity and resolution6- he has unworkable proposals for overhauling equity market structure7- a high staff turnover rate and unhappy individuals leaving office. Gary's failures as SEC chairman These are valid factors to oust someone from his position but will it be passed into law? Others feel that with the risks associated with crytocurrencies, the strident measures taken by Gary Gensler is necessary. What are your thoughts?https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2023/06/13/crypto-secs-gary-gensler-fired/",

EG yes audit custodians to ensure reserves exist, protected and insured so there can be no fractional reserve \"bank run\" risk",

If any crypto company is doing something wrong, the SEC should proceed with normal process, not the type that will be use to manipulate the market, I don't know which side to take, because some crypto exchanges are corrupt and they are good at covering things up, FTX sucks at this, that's why they are caught, at the same time, not even Gensler is clean.",

Now that he had done his job right I guess he is not needed anymore after all Blackrock has arrived. And the EDX is coming for the crypto users, an exchange that is backed by Schwab, Fidelity, and Citadel. He could be removed but the damage is done. Once he is removed he will be out of the scene anymore and he could hide all his life.",

While it's everyone who's interested in crypto's desire to see Gary Gensler sacked, Republicans think it's impossible to fire him but could make his life difficult. And I'm here wondering how that's gonna help the situation? I guess Warren will have to drop this notion of removing Gensler because even though the bill has republican support, for it to get approved, it will have to pass through the democrat dominated senate and such chances for a positive response is highly unlikely.",

Crypto supporters were all praises for Gensler for being open-minded and a crypto supporter himself. Heart were broken later on. But I wonder, is it normal for a congressman to file a bill and propose that a chairman of an independent government agency be kicked out? Reading the 7 grounds posted in the OP, it seems they aren't strong enough. If we compare these allegations to Gensler's seemingly solid background, it seems Gensler would stay. So far, Gensler continues to enjoy the trust and confidence of the president.",

Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.Gengsler is really irritating what he has done recently in relation to the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin company and there are many who have seized bank companies because of what he has done to be honest. So for me, he should be removed from his position in the SEC so that he can be abused in his position to be frank.",

What are your thoughts?i am not a person of law because i do not have any knowledge about US law, but in my general opinion, this case is old, like it is after when Gary sued Binance and Coinbase, and at that time i didn't get to read the factors, i think Gary is also not suitable for the job but he has positive views about BTC so i am also satisfied with him too. The case was opened back in time and maybe these points are also of that time. so as for now things have changed as you must know the adoption of BTC is being streamlined by the US because they intend to bring their own crypto exchange and many companies also applied for BTC ETFS like BlockRock company. Which really showed us the interest among Us officials. One thing I do agree that these good things started after the case was opened by Davidson. i think his case might have some impact too.",

Don't forget that the SEC is not independent and cannot cover the sky alone, so it doesn't matter who runs the SEC. Whether the SEC or the CFTC is cracking down on the crypto market, it's all at the behest of the US government, who is trying to fight crypto like many other governments.",
