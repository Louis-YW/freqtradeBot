Or have you had the chance to join a signature campaign (altcoin bounty) that you found very lucrative in the past?I will prefer you call the altcoins campaign asÂ  bounty campaigns and not signature campaign, determining the profitability is base on user's experience and approach to it, some may find it demanding enough than it offers while many really like that and finds pleasure in it alongside the pay rate, i will only advise you to read the rules, apply and consider the fact by yourself if truly worth going for or not and not to just conclude on someone's else experience.",

Around 2017 to 2019 those campaigns on altcoins are good and literally giving a lot of rewards to forum users. But lately its hard to find a good one now. So joining on btc-signature campaign is much effective.If I were you, I'll find signature on btc paid which has a consistent payment.",

      "body": "They are to some extent as profitable as a lottery. As you usually get paid on the shitty token you promote, if it's one that makes a 100x, you've succeeded but if it's a pump and dump it's going to be worthless. That's not counting that it's not an exit scam or something.I have never joined a bounty but from what I have seen from them. Seems like there was some more profitability in the past in 2017 or so as cryptoaddictchie mentioned.",

If your dedication is that you should get a commensurate return on the time you spend on this forum, then I highly recommend avoiding altcoin campaigns.Actually this forum is profitable in every way. Some members only aim to fill the empty signature and avatar spaces because they are too active in the forum to learn something or do personal business, and don't expect much financial gain from the attributes used.",

If possible, I'd rather join a BTC campaign, but if not, I'd bet on a campaign managed by reputable managers. At the very least, your chance of being scammed is lower there.There is still one or two ongoing campaign but it's very difficult to enter here, so yeah there will be some effort to join the really good one even if it's some altcoin-based campaign.",

Sometime those bounty hunters can earn up to thousands or ten thousands of dollars from a super legit campaign. I can't even provide you some links to the old worthed bounty campaigns that gave bounty hunters lots of rewards. I have a chance to join in some legit bounty campaigns in the past. The reward may vary depending on the price of token. We can't say how good the reward but if you are lucky enough and you can get a lot of money. Some bounty hunters have managed to earn millions dollars through participated in the ethland signature campaign aka aave.",

Most alts base campaigns can be very rewarding if the project has any kind of potential, I have promoted a few and so far the result was decent. Only 1 or 2 out of 10 alts campaigns you promote are worthy of holding long or short term (depending on your intention and the market situation) rest are to sell as soon as you receive and of course, it is trading in the market otherwise you will be stuck with a worthless token with no value.And when you jam a good alts project, boy! you can make as high as 5k and above, this also depends on your rank and your share from the reward pool.",

If he wants to know the status of the bounties in the past then id say that they are much better in terms of value because it's easier for the tokens to pump and you can make a good fortune before only by doing bounties but not anymore today although it's still possible to earn something out of them and that small earning is always better than nothing. Now many users will prefer to join a signature campaign that pays in bitcoin, not only because they are more guaranteed but also the pay rate is a little bit better. The only downside is that they aren't easy to join.",

Of course there are still good projects out there that are still paying and some of them are paying on stable coins which most bounty hunters are aiming for.

You need to hold the coins you collected from the sig camp though. If you are not going to hold, then you only need to check the dollar value of the altcoin which you are getting from the sig camp. If you are not getting a good dollar value and you don't think the project is good, then it is not a good campaign. Leave it and get in to something which pays in bitcoin.",

I dont think it is hard at all for those who have a decent understanding of how bitcoin works and knows how to keep their head cool. Besides if you dont have a flair for writing, this type of hobbies will take up a lot more time and pressure on your head. While there are many users who join altcoin paying campaigns, I am sure you can go around asking, most of them have not been happy with the delays in payments, lack of pay security and the uncertainty regarding the price and dumping on exchanges. Often the entire project might get abandoned and you will be left with a bag of shitcoins. I have joined a few bounties in the past besides a running signature campaign and my experience has been little worth sharing.So I would suggest you to get a better understanding of how to write in the global threads and then apply for bitcoin paying campaigns, because these are the gold-standard of campaigns here.",

Or have you had the chance to join a signature campaign (altcoin bounty) that you found very lucrative in the past?Profitable if you're lucky to join in bounties wherein the rewards after getting listed in exchanges soar high and you happen to sell on the right time. But if your rewards dont have value after waiting for long then it's likely a shit project and all your effort after months of promoting are wasted. I once joined in alts paying sig campaign few years back and it is indeed profitable because the token is already listed in exchanges while the campaign is running hence we can already sell it.Thus it depends, you can only profit if you spot a good bounty and that's a bit hard. Some hunters chose a reputable manager as their sign for a reliable bounty but it's not a guarantee. You still need to conduct an extensive research.",
