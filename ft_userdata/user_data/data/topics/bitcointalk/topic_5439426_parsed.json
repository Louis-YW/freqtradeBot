  "content": "I recently purchased the Coldcard mk4 hardware wallet and I was already familliar with electrum so I made a wallet in electrum for it and transfered my funds to the first address in the addresses tabs, I was then able to transfer bitcoin out to buy some stuff, but my question is: if I, for example, send 1 bitcoin to the first address, 1 bitcoin to the 2nd address and 1 to the third, would my coldcard automatically sweep all the coins from the address into one transaction if I had to send 3 bitcoin to someone?Hopefully someone can answer my question, let me know if anything is unclear.",

Only what can make a transaction not to be successful is the transaction size limit, which is now in vsize or in weight. The limit is 100kb, any transaction that is more than 100kb will not be broadcasted, but you do not have such issue, example of people that have the issue are people that want to consolidate numerous small inputs or make transaction from coins they have collected from faucet which have numerous inputs which they may not be able to transfer until they use coin control to divided the inputs and make more than one transaction in which the transaction input size is reduced to or below 100kb per each transaction.",

That's the default maximum standard transaction weight and nodes will likely reject your transaction if it has a larger weight.It may worth mentioning that the protocol allow a transaction to have larger weight and nothing prevents a miner from including a transaction with larger weight.",

I am far from my laptop now and I am not able to check somethings on my desktop Electrum right now to know how the transaction is represented, but I think it is in byte. I just noticed people do complain of kb transactions on Electrum too even while using segwit address. Weight/4 = size. That is 4000000/4, making 100000 bytes which is 100kb. Or is this not correct?",

A segwit transaction includes some witness data that are counted as a quarter of non-witness data. Quote from: Charles-Tim on February 11, 2023, 09:03:32 AMWeight/4 = size.
