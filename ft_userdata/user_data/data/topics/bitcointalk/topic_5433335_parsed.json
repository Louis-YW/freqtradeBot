We do NOT log our Miners IP addresses. Your privacy is paramount at ShhPoolMore than just a pool! A true fellowship to propel one another into success.The reward structure is this:48.5% of the solved Bitcoin reward goes to ShhPool miner who’s hardware solved the block.48.5% of the remaining Bitcoin block reward is equally split between all ShhPool miners that took part in  solved block.3% goes to pool operator. This will be a full time job.  My level of dedication to ShhPool miners and pool will be unmatched. We will be in constant search for ever competitive edge to solve  bitcoin blocks. We will spare no expense to leverage latest technological advancements towards solving more bitcoin blocks as a pool.Recent events has proven that a pool operator must be on top of pool maintenance and security. ShhPool operator will go well beyond what is typically seen in the current lackadaisical  management of most bitcoin pool.latency and connectivity improvements will be daily. ShhPool operator will be available daily for questions or concerns for ShhPool miners.Pool operator will cover all overhead cost to maintain the pool tell we hit the first block. One prime overall goal is to form a close fellowship of miners that work together for mutual successMerge mining Bitcoin Cash with Bitcoin .This would help everyone cover the cost of electric tell we hit Bitcoin  blocks. A lot of hashrate is actually wasted by NOT merge mining. With all that said. We will be launching merged mining for Bitcoin cash by the end of this month. This can be very lucrative while at the same time going for the PRIZE. The Bitcoin  block reward.  The Bitcoin Cash payouts will be structures exactly the same as Bitcoin payouts percentages.48.5% of the solved Bitcoin  reward goes to ShhPool miner who’s hardware solved the block.48.5% of the remaining Bitcoin block reward is equally split between all ShhPool miners that took part in  solved block.3% goes to pool operator.

The Bans are simply to protect all ideas and concept we arrive at as a collective. We will be battling the top 10 mining companies to snag blocks. Imagine this. We come up with a really good strategy . Could be code based like the Algo I am developing called Piggy Back and PUNCH it. It is an algo on port 3002 that can predict with amazing accuracy what miners and their hardware is about to send the heights work/share per round. This algo sends all miners on 3002 to Piggy Back and Mine with that specific miner to ultimately try and punch through the next bitcoin block.  Lets say someone releases a part of that code and ends in the hands of one or more of the top 10 mining companies  that solve the vast majority of bitcoin blocks. Someone whoever leaked that just gave them more ways to deny smaller pools their share of bitcoin block rewards.   I will say we will be doing NOTHING shady or illegal. NOTHING illegal will ever be tolerated. NOTHING nefarious. We are going to try new things. We are going to innovate our way into solving bitcoin blocks. To do that we cannot give away our competitive edge to the same pools that day in and day out solve the vast majority of blocks.If the Bans bother you. As we gain a good base of miners on ShhPool. We can redefine what information is allowed to make it beyond our private channels. This can be voted on by the majority of ShhMiner.  I hope you see why we need a NON-Disclosure agreement .Keep in mind it’s not like we are sending a document over FAX or email.  lol  You agree by mining with us not to share our methods that will ultimately be used against us by the same pools that dominate bitcoin mining.",

My efforts have shifted to a more profitable pool structure for myself and miners. One day this project will be revived for solo miners. Tell then my efforts have shifted to ShhPoolYou used the term \"Don't Trust...Verfiy!\" in your first post. Well I find that ironic...After attempting to work WITH you to further develop a working unique pool your true colors have shown. Now you have taken the payout structure concept and even used my verbiage to start another pool based on our discussions. The business / joint effort (and I assume any you venture into further) was doomed due to your paranoia about you not wanting to share the source code or move off of your precious VPS. Not even with someone that you were supposed to be in a joint effort with to develop a pool.Then when your VPS server crapped out when stress testing you simply refused to move the code to a fully paid for dedicated server that I purchased and hosted just for the development and the eventual running of the new pool. So you left me no choice but to sever the ties since you refused to share the code that we both were supposed to be working on and your idiotic refusal to move to a dedicated server that can handle the load more that 40TH/sNow did I write 1 line of code on solo-bitcoin.com? NO. But I did provide technical insight on to what was wrong with todays pools that guided you to using Blinkhash V2 with CK's pool code only to have you go rogue and act like a child.So, for anyone ever considering working or mining on any pool that KitKatZ develops I would ask to see the code.

Looks who is ranting and name calling bad mouthing lol. My ideas are mine. I had them way before you.You wanted to split 1% of pool fee but do very little other than send hashpower. So you get the block reward and half of the 1% ? My time is  worth more than half of the 1% you offered me. Geeee thanks. Hard pass. 40 T/h wow really here is a screenshot of it running at 236214 T/h and at the time the sever only was at 80% cpu usage lol. Sense then the server has been upgraded. You just lied about a fact you yourself knew to be true. Don’t be salty. Who took this screen shot old friend? Exactly . Bottom line is . You demanded a lot and offered very little and that’s why I choose not to work with you. Please feel free to create your own pool .  Glad you went and publicly started throwing shade. I was actually missing chatting with you but now I am free of that. Why not spend your energy building YOUR pool and stop causing drama…. cause you cannot or would have to pay someone to build it.

Your code is heavy and clumsy. It’s decades old and outdated like yourself. The proof of this is defined by the facts your pool  has not solved blocks in ages. The only thing that was special about you is you happened to be in the right place in time and had  SOME coding skills. I can throw  rock in a freshman class at my college and hit 50 students that could outcode you in their sleep. You have been riding the coat tails of something you did a decade ago and moving about this forum like some celebrity .Being rude to people and talking down to pretty much everyone. Lets face it . You had a hand in CK pool design  but the real talent was Con Kolivas . This is shows in actual measurable numbers. Lets compare the amount of blocks Solo Ck has solved vs Kanopool . Money is the  measurable metric to defines a persons life choices. In this thought process. If you gonna stay as a pool OP . Might want to get your head out of your ass and start trying to innovate rather expect the same old what you been getting. Be nice to people ... Be innovate. Just stop the bullshit.

Someone whoever leaked that just gave them more ways to deny smaller pools their share of bitcoin block rewards....OK, so you are running a scam.Bitcoin mining is a random event, you can't predict random events.Try reading. Algo can in fact take historic data from a pools submitted shares and to its best of ability to predict what miner will in fact be the strongest in that round. READ before you post. I knew you would be one of the first here throwing shade....No it cant.You are lying.It's a scam.Block finding is a random event.Too bad that kitkatz and sledge0001 had a falling out.We lost a small pool last month as a block was stolen from it.Since I did a lot of background talks and pm's with sledge0001 and a little with kitkatz on a discord channel I was hoping to get on the  pool with them.They had a fight / argument and split up.I will say one thing if KitKatz has a method to non randomize btc mining that works the whole game will change.For now at this moment I do not know of a way to do that. So I will watch and see how this works out.My guess is not very positive.At kano I tend to think you are pretty much correct that the op can not do what they say they can.Sledge0001  is a good person. I know that. I was lucky enough to share some time geeking out with him. The events that led to the fallout was pretty much my fear of being outside of my comfort zone. Everything you have seen in the past couple of day is just two people being upset by our own perception of the failing out event. We are the hero’s of our own stories and your truth might be far different from my truth. I wont discount Sledge0001’s truth. I am sure he is hurt as am I. For that I am sorry. We both are not hateful people and not intentional trying to be mean to one another. We are people and have emotions. We are not our emotions we have been spilling the last couple days. Sledge0001  is a great person with a big heart and truly feel wanted whats best for us both looking back. Think we both just got caught up in our own version of how things should play out. Communication breakdown could have something to do with it. I should have communicated better the reasons of my reluctance.  If a little more time was given to me to warm up to some concepts who knows what might have happened but I have no time machine. All I can do is keep moving forward the only way I feel led.",

Here, I'll give out your secret ... the miner most likely to get the next block ... has the highest hash rate on the pool.Wow - that's incredible",

      "body": "Some very big news. We  have officially started mining the Bitcoin  testnet with already 3 blocks solved . Thank you for everyone who is participating. If you ever wanted to get some Bitcoin  testnet coin . Now is your chance. We want to make sure everything is flawless before flipping the switch to mainnet. . More exciting news. Some really big time miners have offered over 45-115 P/H a month toward ShhPool. This is very exciting. They had the great idea of merge mining Bitcoin  cash with Bitcoin . This would help everyone cover the cost of electric tell we hit Bitcoin  blocks. A lot of hashrate is actually wasted by NOT merge mining. With all that said. We will be launching merged mining for Bitcoin  cash by the end of this month. This can be very lucrative while at the same time going for the PRIZE. The Bitcoin  block reward.  The Bitcoin  Cash payouts will be structures exactly the same as Bitcoin  payouts percentages.48.5% of the solved Bitcoin  reward goes to ShhPool miner who’s hardware solved the block.48.5% of the remaining Bitcoin  block reward is equally split between all ShhPool miners that took part in  solved block.3% goes to pool operator. We also changed the password policy. ShhPool will be free for ANYONE to join. No bans or restrictions. 115 P/H should deliver us a Bitcoin  block reward within the next 30 days. https://solochance.com/ says we should hit it on or around 16 days but let’s give it 30 days . No pressure.Thank you to everyone who has reached out with overwhelming support. Thank you all so very much. Looking forward to solving blocks with you,KatA lot of you have no clue your actually merge mining other coins on some of these solo pools. Get paid and don’t go broke while gambling on solo bitcoin blocks. You could solo mine for forever on these solo pools without ever seeing nothing but wasted electric. Join shhpool and get paid out of every block we solve. Don't HOPE for the big payoff that might never come.ShhPool Discord ServerUpdated Main ANN: and as always \"We do NOT log our Miners IP addresses. Your privacy is paramount at ShhPool\"",

      "body": "After a great testnet run. We will be switching over to Bitcoin mainnet today. The shhpool operated flawlessly. We solved a bunch of testnet blocks. Thank you all for allocating hashpower to the testnet run. I know it is very hard to spend that electricity without much of an upside. We could not move forward without your contribution. Thank you again. Today will be spent bringing shhpool to the mainnet and getting ready for Bitcoin Cash merge mining. Some user interface updates as well. Would like to have a more complete miners profile page. This way you as a miner have a better understanding of how your hardware is operating on shhpool. I would like to let the community know. This venture “shhpool” belongs to us all. I cannot succeed unless shhpool miners do. If you have feedback or want something changed. Please let me know. If you have a better methodology. I want to here it.",
