  "content": "New electrum version is released. This release is focused on improvement of Lightning UI and finally the support of the Blockstream Jade hardware wallet[1]. Quote from: Electrum Release Notes (Github.com)# Release 4.3.0 - (August 5, 2022) * This version introduces a set of UI modifications that simplify the   use of Lightning. The idea is to abstract payments from the payment   layer, and to suggest solutions when a lightning payment is hindered   by liquidity issues.    - Invoice unification: on-chain and lightning invoices have been      merged into a unique type of invoice, and the GUI has a single      'create request' button. Unified invoices contain both a      lightning invoice and an onchain fallback address.    - The receive tab of the GUI can display, for each payment      request, a lightning invoice, a BIP21 URI, or an onchain      address. If the request is paid off-chain, the associated      on-chain address will be recycled in subsequent requests.    - The receive tab displays whether a payment can be received using      Lightning, given the current channel liquidity. If a payment      cannot be received, but may be received after a channel      rebalance or a submarine swap, the GUI will propose such an      operation.    - Similarly, if channels do not have enough liquidity to pay a      lightning invoice, the GUI will suggest available alternatives:      rebalance existing channels, open a new channel, perform a      submarine swap, or pay to the provided onchain fallback address.    - A single balance is shown in the GUI. A pie chart reflects how      that balance is distributed (on-chain, lightning, unconfirmed,      frozen, etc).    - The semantics of the wallet balance has been modified: only      incoming transactions are considered in the 'unconfirmed' part      of the balance. Indeed, if an outgoing transaction does not get      mined, that is not going to decrease the wallet balance. Thus,      change outputs of outgoing transactions are not subtracted from      the confirmed balance. (Before this change, the arithmetic      values of both incoming and outgoing transactions were added to      the unconfirmed balance, and could potentially cancel      each other.) * In addition, the following new features are worth noting:    - support for the Blockstream Jade hardware wallet (#7633)    - support for LNURL-pay (LUD-06) (#7839)    - updated trampoline feature bit in invoices (#7801)    - the claim transactions of reverse swaps are not broadcast until      the parent transaction is confirmed. This can be overridden by      manually broadcasting the local transaction.    - the fee of submarine swap transactions can be bumped (#7724)    - better error handling for trampoline payments, which should      improve payment success rate (#7844)    - channel backups are removed automatically when the corresponding      channel is redeemed (#7513)Although i just heard this new hardware wallet, it looks like neat but like a bulk remote to me. LolTo those who keep collecting hardware wallets, making reviews, using the liquid network, i guess its must to try.[1] https://blockstream.com/jade/",

I've watch some video reviews, Although trezor and ledger is much smaller, yet not as big as other existing HW out there like the ellipal and keepkey.

Yeah, that's the one.  Maybe I misinterpreted the concern.  I want to use taproot also, but probably not enough to switch from electrum to another client.  I do run core on my PC as well, I can always grab a taproot address from there if needed.  But like you said, taproot will be more practical once more services and users have implemented it.  It took a while for most to adopt native segwit, so I imagine that we'll be waiting a couple of years before v1 addresses are ready for prime time.",
