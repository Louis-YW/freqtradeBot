I wanted to post a helpful topic that I had seen that would be helpful to other beginners. Why didn't you let newbies know about the list you dropped here? How confident are you that new users will locate and read those threads?Because of this, I proposed that it be labeled. If a moderator thinks this topic is important, he or she can compile a comprehensive list of acronyms and Bitcointalk.org phrases.",

How long have you been a member of this forum before discovering those threads? <snip>You seem to have not gotten the advice in the reply you quoted. Tha user was asking that you can also bump that particular thread you're linking to, but doing that it comes to the top page of the board again and those yet to see it would be able to find it easily. Jus follow the bump rules of 1 per every 24 hours and to delete old bumps.The user also listed other useful threads still to make it easier for new members to find it easily and read through.",
