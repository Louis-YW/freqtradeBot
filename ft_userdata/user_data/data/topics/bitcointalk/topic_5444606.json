It was on the 12th of March 2020 that Bitcoin dropped 50% in value and this got me so good, till date I still regret my decision, because after so many endurance of waiting and waiting, Bitcoin dumped from 8000$ all the way down to 3,500$, I just gave up and it does not take too long, like 3 months later, that we were already in another bull market. Do not be deceived by the chaos that the government are trying to cause, it's a big distraction, for those who are weak, do not be a weak BTC holder.",

The market itself is way too unpredictable and if you'd be in times of decline with market prices, the only thing you should consider is to deal with it and not to liquidate. Has something to do as well with the amount you can afford losing on your investment. Regarding dates on the other hand, history repeats itself but not exactly as what happened from the past. Prooc is simply inconsistency with market price increase so what more with declines or corrections in market value. Simply a part of this technology and other field of investment especially those which are solely dependent with the demand.",

Because many people may have trouble understanding, but what I found by observing the meaning of the meme is that I am in that long line. But then the market conditions were such that it was very difficult to actually get an indication or fear that it would be its last destination or all-time high. Then, of course, for the big whales, an extra emotion worked in people to invest.",

I don't really remember such dates but I just look at the chart, it was a long red candle dropping from 8k down to 4400 and the next day it dip to 3800. Maybe 3500 on other exchanges.All these distractions are somewhat like a shake-out to those investors who can really hold for a hold time and are worth the wealth they get. FED raising rates again is definitely among them. They know it's not the solution as it will only make the people suffer but they keep doing it.",

Some people believe in what you say, while most don't, which is understandable given the highly volatile nature of bitcoin prices.Flaunting profits from Bitcoin trading can certainly attract a lot of attention, but how many people will go bankrupt when they don't know how to trade cryptocurrency properly? On the other hand, if BTC is purchased and used by the general public, the system is prioritizing its function, which has the potential to be developed by others.What @Rana590 is saying forces us to think about something that can make Bitcoin bigger and more widely used by the public. When the name Bitcoin starts to become popular and talked about by people of different races, it opens up a new world for those who can make a system safer or transform it into something even betterBTC price will be easier to go up",
