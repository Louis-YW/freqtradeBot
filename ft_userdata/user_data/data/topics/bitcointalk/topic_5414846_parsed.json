With the transition to staking, there is every chance that Vitalik Buterin's ship will set sail on its own. Like it or not, it will be seen in the coming months, but today Ether continued to fall.At the time of writing this material, the cryptocurrency was hardly fixed at around $ 1,300, but it is possible that tomorrow it will collapse much lower. In this regard, there is a noticeable increase in offers and an increase in daily trading. Cryptocurrency holders are getting rid of savings, fearing a collapse amid bad news from developers. Unfortunately, by the evening of September 15, none of the team representatives shared the details with journalists. It is quite possible that there is simply no information, because too little time has passed, so experts suggest not drawing far-reaching conclusions. It is no longer possible to mine Ethereum, millions of video cards were simultaneously disconnected from the network, but did not hit the market. First of all, the community is waiting for the activation of the EthereumPoW (ETHW) fork. Recall that this is a parasitic offshoot, which is designed to preserve the ability to mine Ethereum for those who do not want to switch to other altcoins. As you already understood, today there are a lot more questions than answers, so we are just waiting for the launch of ETHW, but we will judge its success later.But it would be wrong to say that the experts' forecasts turned out to be empty words. Pay attention to the chart below. Here is the complexity of the Ethereum Classic (ETC) network. As you can see, last night the hashrate reached 66 TH/s, while right now it has exceeded 305 TH/s. There is a 5x increase in ETC mining difficulty. If you do not understand what this means, then let's be brief: until recently, Ethereum hashrate exceeded 600 TH / s and was exactly an order of magnitude higher than ETC. After mining was blocked, the freed-up capacities had to pour somewhere. Some farmers have switched to little-known altcoins, others are waiting for ETHW, but almost half have transferred their capacities to Ethereum Classic.",
