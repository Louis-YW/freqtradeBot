      "body": "Very good job, OP. I take a look after their whitepaper and found another snippet that they copied from another project called \"Captain Glory\"[1]. I also ran a check through their team and found something interesting, that they dared to use the real names of the people they use as their team, but the backgrounds described on the suspect's website and their real job history clearly shows they're not connected to this project at all and their name is being used without them being aware of it.The three that I found:As for the BM, they currently have a questionable project before that's raised against them --initially built on a wrong basis, but it developed into a possible scam with the newfound foundation-- it's quite unfortunate that Mr. Mattei is yet to reply me on TG to seal the case.I've been wanting to take a deeper look at the BM, as a quick glance at their projects gave an impression to me that they just blindly accepting poor quality and borderline questionable projects, but my weeks has been quite crazy these days. I hope I can do a thorough scan trough the project they promoted in a near future.Have you notified the BM for this case?[1]I'd like to mention that the name is somewhat familiar to my brain, it kept tugging a thread that I cant grasp that I think I've read the name somewhere on this forum, but a quick search with Ninjastic brought no result, so maybe it's just my imagination and it's just another project that never stepped their foot on this forum.",

      "body": "Do bounty managers really take out time to read and go through such details to giving attention to them before launch of the bounty? If the managers do this i think the project team would have taken their time to make changes immediately after observation and another thing to note in  this post as regards to this project is that it might likely be a scam. From your observation about the team members they presented here which are not in any way related to the project, i think they are up to something and if the bounty manager is not aware of this then i suggest his or her attention should be called to this immediately to rectify this error before it goes beyond what the forum can not comprehend. As it is in the early stage now i think that bounty should be called to a halt till  further investigations surrounding the team behind this project is concluded.",

[The funny thing is that he hasn't been paid for his work yet, Really unprofessional manager]Yes, that's right. Laminatrade does not have an ANN thread here in the forum, and this bounty is to increase their followers and increase their popularity on social media sites to deceive and mislead traders, and in the end, as you mentioned, they either paid any shitcoins to the bounty hunters, or they did not pay anything.",

[The funny thing is that he hasn't been paid for his work yet, Really unprofessional manager]I'm glad to hear that the manager has closed this campaign, nevertheless, he feels at least a little responsibility. at least one of the plagues was stopped.yes, quite unprofessional or maybe just naive. I can understand that (new and inexperienced) managers accept all deals just to get a job. Although in the end it mostly ends up as free work for scammers.",

Bounty hunters never do the slightest bit of research on a project before joining a campaign. They join the bounty campaign and do the tasks without worrying about whether they will get paid or not. And what else will they get from such projects except worthless tokens! A project team that copies the content of their project's Whitepaper from another project's Whitepaper, can we expect anything better from that team?",

[The funny thing is that he hasn't been paid for his work yet, Really unprofessional manager][...]Umm... I think you've just got bamboozled by them. Yes, they locked the bounty thread and it's no longer available for any post for proof of posting on TG or twitter, but I think that's more because the campaign has already ended, so the BM essentially has nothing to lose. His job is done, he locked the thread as \"a show of remorse\" while there's actually not much difference whether he left it open or closed.",
