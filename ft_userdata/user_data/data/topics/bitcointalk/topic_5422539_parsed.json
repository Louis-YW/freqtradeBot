      "body": "Well other then going on Tik Tok sometimes I am not very active on any social media platforms anymore. Most of my friends are still on Facebook so I tend to use it the most.However, I usually just use messenger and that’s more for chats and one on one communication. I rarely post anything to my larger ‘friend’ group anymore.I like using Facebook more for shopping marketplace, food recommendations and local events information.",

      "body": "Bitcointalk isn't a social media if you compare it to a more personal site like Facebook et al., even though spam and false information are still here. Anyway, if we talk about social media when we can befriend, follow, and upload photos/videos, then it's still net positive in my opinion. You can always make your account private and connect with real and positive people. Just block accounts that often post annoying stuff and you have your peace of mind. I doubt bots will take action on my pets' photos/videos as it's mostly my friend who comments. But if you are in the influencer business, then it's a bot war.",

      "body": "Facebook. I use it to check up on old friends. Instagram- I used to just while you wait time and know what is happening. Twitter. I go there for the gossips, you know, for the bants. I'm not really active on Tik TOK because I feel it's just to waste of time. I don't think there's anything beneficial about Tiktok. Tiktok for me,is for kids. I don't use Friendster. I don't use Myspace or any other social media sites aside from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. How I feel about these social media sites? is that there's a lot to learn. It depends on where your attention is focused on. You can learn the good thing, you can learn the bad thing, and then you can learn the Ugly thing just depends on where your attention is focused on and what you're looking for on the Internet. Thank you.",

      "body": "I still use Facebook to keep in contact with friends from back in the, also relatives that I’m not totally tight with.I do have an instagram but I rarely use that now. I have Twitter which I mainly use for news, I find Twitter is the best source for near enough real time things breaking. I don’t use TikTok, I find that’s for girls in their early 20’s. Bit embarrassing to see middle aged dudes using it. Overall social media has its uses but I am not the biggest advocate.",

      "body": "I use social media, but not insanely intensively. I read about the topics that interest me and use some of them as an opportunity to do further in-depth research. You shouldn't take anything you read directly as true, but always check the facts.Discussions with others have often helped me to find my own point of view. Nobody knows everything. And thanks to social media like bitcointalk, we also have the great opportunity to benefit from each other.",
