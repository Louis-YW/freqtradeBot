  "content": "What happened:: I have account in coinplay since month, It got zeroed 2 times and total of 788$ was deposited there in 3 deposits, after last deposit I have some better luck and I ended up with ~2260$ in my balance after today lucky session where I made ~600$ on live betting esport match and around 1-2 hours later while checking odds/market I got signed out of my account, after that I couldn't log in back because I was getting error that this user not exists. I contacted support what happened to my account and they told me to send a mail to security team, which I did. Security team send me a reply that is included on screen with some nonsense points of their ToS. I didn't violated any terms, they just seized my all winnings made over last month, and said that I can only withdraw the deposit, which is a big joke because if I had lost money, this would never have happened. I saw that this is a very common practice among them and their group, so I wanted to add my case to the collection.Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3502111Reference Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5420930.0Amount Scammed: ~1400$Payment Method: BTCProof of Payment: https://i.imgur.com/YnPmMFx.pngPM/Chat Logs: https://i.imgur.com/qX0CDu5.pngAdditional Notes: https://i.imgur.com/0uhWGXO.png proof of my betting history, you can see amount of bets and last bets returned as 1x",

      "body": "It is unfortunate you are having this experience. Likewise it is when it happens that such a complaint is coming from a newbie that does not know the left and right of how the system works here.These are the things that cast bad name on crypto. OP I was wondering too if you never did a research before you attempted having deal with this casino because the last time I checked, their announcement thread and representative were much inactive and have left their clients here unattended to with lots of questions waiting for answers. If you had checked trustpilot, you would have seen for yourself before going further. As it stands now, there is no assurance that your case would be attended to here since their announcement thread has been inactive for long. I will advise you keep trying your luck at their customer care.",

I don't like the fact that KYC is being implemented everywhere in casinos either, and what you say sounds like a good idea, but I don't think that the forum will implement it.

They're pressed into a tight spot between compliant to governments' AML/ATF regulation and preserving the anonymity nature of crypto.This is one of the reason why some casinos made a tiered KYC and/or only ask for KYC when a problem occured in a user's account and not before, to give some wiggle room between compliant to govt. rules and to protect their customer's privacy.",

Scams is not moderated here that’s why our trust system works this. But I really like if the forum will improve and adapt to the current norm for the sake of protection for forum user. Even Bitcoin is now being indirectly KYC through centralized exchange. We need a little bit centralization if we want to improve customer protection but again I have no hope for this to happened since scam is not moderated and it's not an easy task to clean them all.",

The account already has negative feedback just this year, so I think that is already a warning for you to stay away from the site. This thread is more like an awareness post, and thank you for posting, but don't expect you will be able to recover your funds because they are scammers, as evidenced by their red tag. Let this be a lesson for you to do due diligence before gambling on a specific online casino.",
