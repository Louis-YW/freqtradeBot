Also, this guy I came across few days ago on X posts solana stuff, from gambles of his listâ€” FluxB, Jupiter, Jito have announced airdrop: https://twitter.com/MetisCharter/Fun fact: he posted solana guide on nov 2, and in there we were to use Jupiter, meanwhile Jupiter snapshot was also taken on nov 2.",
