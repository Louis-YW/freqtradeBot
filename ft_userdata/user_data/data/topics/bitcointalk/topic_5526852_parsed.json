I.e. there would probably be more businesses, individuals and merchants ready to accept BTC as payment for goods and services, and more people would choose BTC as their option of a hedge against fiat devaluation.",

      "body": "Quote from: Stablexcoin on January 18, 2025, 10:27:39 AMevery enthusiast was that it was meant to make fast payment,First of all it depends on how you define \"fast\". Usually because of the altcoin advertisers/scammers people tend to think that confirmation time is the indication of being \"fast\" or slow. But irreversibility is. Many altcoins that are producing blocks every couple of seconds have no security and many of them are centralized and most importantly some have mutable blockchains like ethereum. Their confirmation has no value and their transactions can never be considered truly irreversible. However bitcoin's one confirmation has a tremendous level of security even if bitcoin blocks take 10 minutes on average to be found.Secondly I don't remember anybody ever introducing bitcoin as a payment system with \"fast payments\". They key characteristic has always been decentralization. And as I explained bitcoin's payments and settlements are both very fast.QuoteThe idea began to change, it now became a store of value.That's not new though. Bitcoin is designed to be money and by definition money is a currency that is also store of value. The capped supply ensures that and it has been like this from day one.In any case I don't think the \"mentality\" has changed. There have always been many categories of adopters like those who invest in it to become rich quick and those who adopt it to reach financial sovereignty. And the number of people in each category is rising with adoption, even though the investors are more vocal therefore are seen more.",

      "body": "the fast payment mindset was due to people trusting that zero-confirm payments relayed in mainnet would eventually settle, with a tx fee of under $0.10/txand yes by 2019(10yr) this changed due to core devs making zero confirms less trustable on mainnet, whilst 'offramping' that \"trust of zero confirm\" over to subnetworks, and then changing the mainnet fee structure/formulae to hype-up, advertise the subnetworks as the go to systems for the old mindsetso its not exactly just a user mindset change due to new users from different backgrounds that just occurred through magic, but instead a protocol change to the roadmap 'plan of utility', done by core that caused the users 'mindset of utility' to changeso if you want to know whats in store for the next decade, just ask the core devs what their plan is",

Now, on bitcoin’s use cases, it will continue to serve as a mode of payment and a good store of value. The only difference is that, while global adoption for bitcoin increases, the scope of bitcoin usage also grows. Since content creators and influencers have been gaining high demand these days, instead of using fiat for their salary, bitcoin could possibly make its entry. It’s up for them if they will use it for investment or not. Another thing also is that it could also serve as cross-border payments and remittances where bitcoin creates lower cost for international transfers rather than using the traditional bank method.",

It's a coin that have come to remain in the market for a very long time looking at it's trajectory so far. What I'm pretty sure about is that a time will come that the bitcoin might not have its way like this any longer. For instance, a time will come where bitcoin must have gathered momentum in the market and become over saturated and alternative coins will have their way to thrive. Already bitcoin is gradually becoming unaffordable for a greater number of individuals and investors out there, especially the Micro-investment demography. As time goes on, it will reach its peak and will pave way for other coins to thrive in the market.Quote from: Odusko on January 18, 2025, 04:26:11 PMIn the future there will be more development on the Bitcoin project and adoptions and Bitcoin scalability at every stage of time, there is nothing new in terms of users for Bitcoin that we have not known, but there is a need for more development of that userscase to make Bitcoin mainstream adoptions and scalability enhanced Bitcoin ecosystem and low fees in the Bitcoin network and also several alternatives that aid network scalability that meet up with the demands of the time, between we have seen some nice developments already and we need to commend this present time and era in the Bitcoin ecosystem.But do we think there would be a low fees in the bitcoin network again?

BlackRock, Tesla, Square are either formulating plans around it or buying in. Every purchase sends a message: distributed technology can be the source of future value. People want a piece of the new digital frontier and to be part of something greater, so they experience emotional tugIn ten years, the focus could be on world stability as Bitcoin serves as a financial shock absorber when central banks implement additional quantitative easing or push negative rates. The dilemma is: do we lean into this new era, or do we resist change until the old systems crumble? That friction shapes human growth particularly when we understand that open networks and self-custody help to create trustAnother thing is that user acceptance usually depends on empathy and understanding. Should the next generation inherit Bitcoin, perceptions will change once it solves actual issues like fast transfers or inflation protection of investments. The major revelation is that Bitcoin symbolizes freedom, choice, and a possible reset for people, people weary of top-down economics, not only money",
