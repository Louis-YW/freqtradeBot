  "content": "Fennec is a decentralized peer to peer cryptocurrency, mineable with GPUs and CPUs on the YescryptR16 algorithm. Because we are a bitcoin fork (we are actually more similar to Litecoin), we will only be listed on CEXs. Our first CEX listing is within 1 week of launch (Exbitron)! Please see the roadmap on our website for more information on future CEX listings as well.Getting in at a cheaper price means that you would need to be a part of our Peer-to-Peer sales event, which is open to anyone who is a member of our Discord or Telegram chats. However, you are free to mine Fennec with GPUs or CPUs once the network is live tomorrow as well. There will be more information on configuring your CPU/GPU systems to our network in the Telegram and Discord chats as well.We currently have a handful of callers helping out over the long term, not just for single calls. These are callers that mostly represent the Ethereum Smart Contract ecosystem, so many viewers will recognize Fennec as a unique concept (for them), and are excited to participate in our launch! Some of our callers include Dogen (pending until post launch), T1T4N, Father XUFI, Swae, Decentra Ape, and Carnage. These are well known callers on Telegram, Twitter, and Discord, and should bring us some great initial volume before we proceed with YouTube marketing to raise awareness and promote the adoption of Fennec.Coins tend to hold much stronger, and pump at a slower and steadier rate than smart contract tokens. Especially for the first several months, coins are more known for being a lower risk investment. If you have more questions, please shoot @FennecOwner a DM (on Telegram), or hop in our main chat www.t.me/FennecPortal for more information.We have the majority of our stats, specs, roadmap plans, and administrative plans on our website below:www.FennecBlockchain.comOur Discord, Telegram, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, GitHub, and other accounts can be found on our LinkTree below (Our Linktree is also on the bottom of our website's home page above)www.LinkTr.ee/FennecBlockchainThanks for your potential interest in Fennec!",

The mining pool had some technical difficulties in the beginning, but we cannot reset the blockchain at this point. We had about an hour of downtime, which translates to under 200 coins being emitted, and have a larger premine of 6.3 million coins. In our opinion, the 200 coins that were emitted are simply a drop in the bucket. The block rewards are still rolling, and everything is as stable and functionable as can be at this point, with the largest majority of miners happily mining. Our official mining pool is also up, please check out mining guide at https://howtomine.fennecblockchain.com/ as well for more information. We apologize for the inconvenience, but it was not like we had block rewards rolling for the entire day without anyone being able to mine. A decent portion of our miners were on Rplant as well, so the majority of people have been collecting block rewards as well from the very start. We apologize for your problems with the launch!",

Our coding dev had an issue with our mining pool once the blockchain was live, and this shouldn't be taken as a secret agreement with Rplant. They were hovering over our project for weeks prior to our launch, and so when we had an issue with our official mining pool, yes, they received a larger portion of the first 200 coins that were emitted. But with nearly 3200 coins being emitted per day, this should not be considered a significant portion of the block rewards. If we had our mining pool down for over 6 hours, I would understand your stance, to a degree. However, we had this issue fixed as soon as possible, and the block rewards Rplant collectively received should surely be considered very negligible.",

I asked the admins why only one pool \"Rplant\" can connect and not others, there are no answers. It says \"be patient\" all the time. If the blockchain is not reset to the starting point for fair reasons, it is logically not a fair start. I wish the project much success and happiness, but with such a strange start I see black.Hello FJ, I know we discussed this a bit on Telegram as well. The mining pool had some technical difficulties in the beginning, but we cannot reset the blockchain at this point. We had about an hour of downtime, which translates to under 200 coins being emitted, and have a larger premine of 6.3 million coins. In our opinion, the 200 coins that were emitted are simply a drop in the bucket. The block rewards are still rolling, and everything is as stable and functionable as can be at this point, with the largest majority of miners happily mining. Our official mining pool is also up, please check out mining guide at https://howtomine.fennecblockchain.com/ as well for more information. We apologize for the inconvenience, but it was not like we had block rewards rolling for the entire day without anyone being able to mine. A decent portion of our miners were on Rplant as well, so the majority of people have been collecting block rewards as well from the very start. We apologize for your problems with the launch!Sorry but that's a joke. Make secret agreements and say to the miners pls patience ^^Many miners not only had the Rplant bonus, but also Rplant itself. Super marketing but unfortunately another project with secret agreements.Instead of telling Rplant that the main pool is not active yet and should please wait or give the other miners the opportunity to think about Rplant.Rplant is a sneaky poolWe made no agreements with Rplant. Our coding dev had an issue with our mining pool once the blockchain was live, and this shouldn't be taken as a secret agreement with Rplant. They were hovering over our project for weeks prior to our launch, and so when we had an issue with our official mining pool, yes, they received a larger portion of the first 200 coins that were emitted. But with nearly 3200 coins being emitted per day, this should not be considered a significant portion of the block rewards. If we had our mining pool down for over 6 hours, I would understand your stance, to a degree. However, we had this issue fixed as soon as possible, and the block rewards Rplant collectively received should surely be considered very negligible.HA HA HA how is possible your dev have problems for 6 hours and Rplant not ^^very mysteriousWhy didn't you communicate with Rplant so that all miners have access to it (the whole 6 hours). Tell what you want, you have secret agreements. You can't talk nice about a thing when the facts speak against YOU.Sorry but not serious and not authentic.",
