  "content": "Seems to me the best way to store a seed phrase with a hardware wallet would be write your seed phrase down twice and break it into 2 parts.  Also make sure you have a passphrase for the hardware wallet.  Now you open 4 safe deposit boxes at 4 different banks.  But do so in a way where the banks are a bit far from each other... like make sure it isn't 1 mile within each other at least but preferably a lot farther away like 5 miles.Now you put 2 copies of the 1st part of the seed phrase at 2 different safe deposit boxes at different banks.  You then put the other 2 copies of the 2nd part of the seed phrase at 2 other safe deposit boxes at 2 different banks.  You then write down your seed phrase in a piece of paper in your apartment or house.  You also enter it in a password manager that you save to a usb and the cloud.   ORDo the same thing with putting 2 copies of the 1st part of the seed phrase at 2 different safe deposit boxes at different banks.  You then do the same with putting the other 2 copies of the 2nd part of the seed phrase at 2 other safe deposit boxes at 2 other different banks.  You also then make 1 copy of the 1st part and 2nd part of the seed phrase for you to store at your apartment in different locations.  This time however, you only enter the passphrase to a password manager that you save to a usb and the cloud but make sure you don't write the passphrase on a piece of paper in your apartment or house.  You could also make a 2nd usb flash drive and give it to someone close to you and tell them to hold it as a backup in case something happens to your usb flash drive or something happens to your password manager in the cloud accessing it.  You could put another usb in one of those safe deposit boxes you are using but if you do that... well you are increasing your risk since if someone got access to one part of the seed phrase and has that usb... if they somehow get into your password manager... then they have 2 out of the 3 parts of it.  So say imagine the government was to seize your safe deposit boxes, well then they have access to your seed phrase and your usb with the passphrase in your password manager in the flash drive.  Now could they always hack into it if they have your flash drive?  Or the only way would be to tell you to reveal what your usb passports is and/or the password manager password?Would you say the 1st option is ideal?  What about the 2nd option minus the putting another usb drive in one of your safe deposit boxes?",

Spliting your seed phrase to two or three parts does not help you to have better backups but technically, it makes a worse backup. Losing access to one of two parts of the seed phrase, you lose your bitcoin.After that, I also read that you want to store it at banks, it's another bad idea.",

I developed this idea of writing it in a Bible, it's sound weird but in there nobody understands or even wants to read it the way it's place in the bible. I split it in 2 different bibles or books that even if it's keep with anyone the chance of reading such books is very low and I believe it's a better secured for me. The pattern of writing can be upside down or something but I just manipulate it. But no matter how you wish to secure yours at least someone should be aware of your plans in case of unforseen circumstances.",

If you're careful enough about it it's safe.You should use small steel plates for greater durability because paper is easily damaged even with just a slight impact. Unexpected things can always happen and there are many things we will never predict, so we need to be careful from the beginning, don't be too subjective and think that nothing will ever happen to us.  The method of storing phrases using paper or notebooks is what I believe many people are doing because it is easy to preserve and move. And if in case you don't like to use steel instead, you should have at least 2 to 3 copies to avoid risks. I use both a notebook and a steel to secure my seed phrase.",

I made it not complicated because I believe it was enough to guard by seeds phrase, As long as it was kept offline, that was hard for other people to trace it unless if there was someone from our friend, relatives, or any of the family members know and steal it.And aside from that never put all our crypto in a single wallet but rather help it spread to avoid losing it all in case hacking incidents come.",

You stated in your post that keeping your seed offline is the best practice. Yes it is, but you should as well know that even the offline method won't be efficient enough, if you don't apply the best offline methods. For long, there have been different methods of storing your seed offline, but not all are efficient or reliable. As time goes on, some of these methods can be affected by some natural external phenomenals. For example, paper which has been the oldest method, still can put your seed at risk of been lost. When thinking of using the paper method, you have to first research on types of paper with long lasting quality. Not just ordinary papers will be enough to keep your seed. But the best papers might just be your target. Also when you are storing your paper which has your seeds written on it, you have to be smart and keep them away from water or fire and store the paper in places with moderate temperatures.Again, the metal encraving method, which is more efficient than the paper method, can also be affected by some external forces like rust or corrosion. If you choose to use this method, you might want to go for a good quality metal like the stainless steel or titanium. They have more quality compared to other metals. In all, not just using the offline method will keep your funds safe, but also remember to use the best off line method. Now back to op. Just as @Alphakilo has said, storing your seed using washers is a good practice that will be recommended. Just click the link which he gave and read all about it on the post by @ fillippone.",
