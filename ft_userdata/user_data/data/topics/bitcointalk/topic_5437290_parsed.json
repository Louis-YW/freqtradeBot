To check a project's trust worth, verify its team members and their background. Check the project's vision and evaluate whether it is feasible in real life and whether it has a market of it's own. Then see whether the concept actually solves the problem and also if its the first of its kind.Still then you will see that good projects fail easily in the next one year and you cannot do anything about it. Altcoins are like that only.",

It will be different if the coin is centralized, you must trust the CEO and hope he wouldn't rug pull his own project.Government always tightening their rules and it's need KYC to trade in centralized exchange, the worst thing is the exchange can freeze your account and confiscate your funds. If you trade on decentralized exchange or non custodial P2P platform, your coin will be 100% safe.But you need to know 99% coins are centralized, only 1% or less are 100% decentralized.",

Buy bitcoin for $20,000 and forget about it for a few years until its price rises.Soon there will be regulation from the SEC, and most of the cryptocurrency projects will be closed, but some projects, like Ethereum, Polkadot, Atom, should work on the market, because many financial companies will work in these ecosystems, which will tokenize their assets.",

You wouldn't also want to buy a coin that is centrally controlled by some individuals/whales who can manipulate the price of the coin in any direction they so choose, that's another reason why a decentralized coin like Bitcoin is a no-brainer for most crypto enthusiast.

When trying to determine whether or not an alternative cryptocurrency can be trusted, there are a few things to keep in mind. One important factor in an altcoin's success is the expertise and dedication of the people behind the project. As a corollary, the altcoin's use case and practical relevance are also critical considerations. Success is more likely for an alternative cryptocurrency if it offers a practical solution to an existing issue or fills a need in the current market.One must also consider the altcoin's underlying technology and evaluate it against similar currencies. Are there substantial network effects or collaborations that will assist propel the altcoin's adoption and value? Is the group of people working on and using it robust? When deciding whether or not to invest in an alternative cryptocurrency, these are all crucial questions to ask. In the end, it is crucial to do your homework on the cryptocurrency and fully comprehend it before putting your money into it, and to always diversify your investments to lessen the blow of any potential losses.",
