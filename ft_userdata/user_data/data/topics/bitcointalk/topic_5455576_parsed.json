Why not instead running the signature campaign and bounty yourself, why not hire the service of a manager that will oversees all the arrangement and? Monitoring of the campaign period and activities of the participants. I think it is better that way and you will earn the trust of the members of the forum to participate in the bounty campaign and just like the user bussybuddy has mentioned the list of the professionals we have here you can make good use of one of them, once again welcome to the forum ops.",

Atleast give a participants a token that has a current value, I'm sure that bounty hunters will flock your bounty campaign and you can choose there. You can also limit and put some requirements on the bohnty campaign like only accepting hero members above or atleast have a certain amount of merit to join. You can't expect that people from a signature campaign will transfer to the bounty campaign you have but if you reward is convincing enough, there might be good poster that can switch to your bounty campaign.",

You can try to contact bounty managers in SERVICES to run your campaign. It is better to use their services than to run it yourself. Because bounty managers already have experience and ability to handle bounty hunters. You can choose a campaign that pays weekly or a campaign that pays at the end of the phase.But most choose the second one because I think it's a win win solution for all parties.",

If stable coin then you can get high quality participants they will make good posts, i think first of all you should to hire a reputed bounty manager then BM will choose good participant because it’s not your job. You can hire @yahoo62278 or @LoyceV for the signature campaign manager.",

Or would you do a weekly compensation like btc paid? Theres plenty of bounty management listed and suggested here but I doubt they will take on altcoin projects. There some exception but you need to prove that you are gonna pay in advance like do an escrow for your payment or even the tokens. But nowadays, its not worth it to promote ICO or alts that still on investment or raising period especially if its a very brand new one.",

The way FireDAO team is going about this project is very concerning, running a bounty shouldn't be an issue for a project that knows what he or she is doing. You can run it also since I do see you spamming this forum with your frequent messages, so if you don't have anything you are doing just do it yourself but if you are busy, contract it to the most trusted people in the space base on the trust level there are a lot of them, but it also comes with a price.",
