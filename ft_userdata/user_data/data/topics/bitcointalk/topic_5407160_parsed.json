I try that my works were beautiful and touched hearts of people what they would be wanted to be repeated or got for themselves, for decoration of the apartment, for the beloved kids, etc. I have a degree in “Design” .In this area I am working more than 15 years.Painting “Bitcoin” https://5ksana.art/cryptoart/painting-bitcoin/Condition: MINT 100%HandMade by 5KsanaI’m pleased to present to you my painting “Bitcoin”, depicting a typical digital representation of the currency, but with a special twist!One of the hallmarks of my work is taking objects from the digital realm and illustrating them using interesting and natural material like wine cork.There is a real satisfaction and joy one gets seeing the ethereal entities we see onscreen everyday turned into real objects like paintings.Bitcoin and such currencies offer independence from the monopolistic pyramid scheme of tyranny and should be embraced by freedom loving people everywhere.The Painting of the “Bitcoin” of the artist 5Ksana are the perfect gift for that “hard to buy for” friend. They make great wedding, anniversary, hostess, or anytime presents. Use this to pin up your “to do” list, or just simply enjoy it as a decoration.But most of all the picture is intended for private collectors who love cryptocurrency and freedom!Made from real upcycled wine corks, no synthetic corks are used.All genuine corks sourced from wineries, vineyards, and wine bars, with the natural shades of bordeaux, merlot, and pinot noir.A hanger CAN BE attached to the back of each for wall mounting.The picture is unique and the only one in the world.Only handmade!Materials:recycled wine corks;glue;acrylic sealant.Size: 11.2″ x 11.2″ inches – 30 x 30 cm«Age is just a number. It’s totally irrelevant unless, of course, you happen to be a bottle of wine or Bitcoin» – 5Ksana_______________________________________________________________________________ _________________________Bid Format: Bids only in BTCReserve Price:  0.025 BTCStarting Bid: 0,025 BTC                             Bid Inc.: 0.002 BTCAuction Ends:  Friday, July  22th  12:00 PSTDelivery: International – Free (EMS).",
