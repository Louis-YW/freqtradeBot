You move freely around the world with your mini-reactor.What pros and cons do you see in this?How do you imagine a mini-reactor?You think moving around the world with reactors that are probably powered by nuclear energy will be easy? Well, Â one of the main advantages/pros is the amount of energy generated by reactors compared to their sizes is usually greater (and considerably cleaner) than many energy generating tech of similar sizes, but the risks & likelihood that a nuclear technology would be abused/misused is thought to be greater than its benefits... So they kind of limit its usage.But I think the best practices would be to allow very reasponsible and good People /Nations to use the tech or just build it to be safe enough for everyone to use",

There are other technologies.Man is also, in fact, a reactor that processes food into vermicompost.Turn on your imagination and come up with what a reactor should be for you, which would suit you and provide you with heat and electricity.

      "body": "OP, can I propose a new reactor? It's totally organic and can generate a lot of heat and electrify your life at the same time, you'd just need to take her out, buy her food and stuff.If you are up to it, I can provide you with an answer, it's open source, just promise not to abuse her OK?Here you go, \"Pussy\". It could also produce liquid, a lot of it to be honest. What you need to activate it is a fuel rod, it has even the ability to receive a few rods(gang) at the same time. However I'm against gang banging any pussy.Do you think my idea qualifies for a product? IMHO it has one of the lowest maintenance costs comparing to other existing reactors. Only thing you need to becareful about is the water intake, if you let it pump water out of you, this could lead to a melt down resulting in mini-reactor generation.Â  lol is in order.Good idea or not? This was the result of my turned-on imagination.ðŸ¤£, this is what I want as my own reactor.",

However, no one else can repeat this generator.Here is proof of Ravi's work (https://www.youtube.com/@raviwfc/videos)I just described the physical principle of action in a formulaic form, creating a Physico-Mathematical Model (PMM).That is, I just designed the words of Meyer into a Scientific Theory.Now I create Technology on the basis of Scientific Theory.Science and Technology are different things.If Science answers the question WHAT is happening.That Technology answers the question HOW to do it.",
