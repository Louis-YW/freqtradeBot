This network is able to coordinate an infinite number of blockchains (execution shards) by using the Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM) consensus mechanism, which eliminates all consensus-based contention. The ability for PoEM to coordinate a perpetually growing set of blockchains allows the network to process more than 50,000 transactions per second. The architecture is a composable multithreaded execution environment with blocks being produced approximately every 1.1 seconds.https://docs.quai.network/introduction/quai-networkInstall and configure a Quai GPU miner on Ubuntu Desktop or Server.https://docs.quai.network/mine/miner-overview/gpu-miner/ubuntu-installationInstall and configure a Quai GPU miner on HiveOS.https://docs.quai.network/mine/miner-overview/gpu-miner/hiveos-installation",

The price of the coin is unknown and no one knows how profitable mining will be, but if mining on the mainnet is profitable in the future, then mining now will not be a mistake.",
