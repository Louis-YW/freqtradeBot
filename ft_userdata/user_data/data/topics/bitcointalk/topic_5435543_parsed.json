What you're asking is a stupid question because there's a cryptocurrency that will ever be like Bitcoin.1. It is the only true decentralized crypto and Ethereum shouldn't be categorized as decentralized since it uses the proof stake.2. Its consensus and censorship-resistant cannot be achieved by any altcoin.3. It's the reason why we know blockchain and its other benefits.",

And both great cryptocurrencies got different use, Bitcoin is a major in payments. Ethereum is likely more advanced, which focuses on smart contracts.",

It is a better altcoin, best coin in fact if we compare it with the other thousands of altcoins. Crypto innovations brought about by Ethereum have made a difference.",

For me BTC and Ethereum are completely different things. Bitcoin obviously was the first crypto project that was ever created. Therefore it basically created the whole crypto market and that is also the reason why crypto still equals BTC, especially for people that are not so familiar with cryptos.Ethereum came later but offers much more functionality than Bitcoin. Ethereum made everything that we are having today possible.",

Even if we talk about the price, or market cap, ETH is still way below. So I don't think there is something that we should be in shock with the number of validators.It could be the numbers that Ethereum didn't expect, but I guess it just shows how Ethereum becoming so centralized now with that number of validators?",

They are not building same things so they are not in competition with each other, even though some maximalists like to think so. If you are talking in terms of marketcap, flippening at some point is possible, but it hasn't happened yet and ETH has been way more sensitive to any fud out there. And more importantly BTC leads the price movements. That should tell you enough about it.",

So far, Ethereum looks like a king compared to other competitors, but decentralization in this ecosystem needs to be monitored. And you need to understand that investing in this coin will not give many percent of the profit, because the capitalization is already very large, and the increase in the cost of ethereum increases the cost of transactions in all its ecosystems.",

If you think ETH can be the next big one, then that’s ok just increase your holdings so you can feel it. The market is growing and rising again, its good to see a lot of positive reviews with cryptocurrency.",
