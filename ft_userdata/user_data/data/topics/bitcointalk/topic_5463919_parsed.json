Now back to the topic. I consider it a huge privilege to have found this forum considering how much I have learnt within a short time of me being active here. I registered 2021 but never paid attention to this forum as I didn't see the need because I was doing short-term trading of bitcoin only thinking that is all there was to this amazing technology. Little did I know that this forum holds the answer and all information one can possibly need in regards to bitcoin and cryptocurrency; ranging from how to buy, different investment approaches,  storage, mining as well as other interesting things. Indeed, a lot of information have been revealed in various sections of this forum, and they are all available for free. In addition, members of this forum are ever willing and ready to answer any question, irrespective of how funny it may sound... they do this with joy and all you need is just ask.The hot topic now is the Bitcoin dip in price. While a lot of people will be panicking, those in this forum understand what is going on as it is not something new. Consequently, a lot of topic have been raised so far,  all suggesting that instead of panicking,  we should buy the dip and hold... because a lot of activities are lined up that is expected to make Bitcoin see a new all time high (ATH) between 2024 to 2025. I suggest you do your research about this to see how you can take advantage of that opportunity.",

      "body": "I highly respected the proverb you quoted as I have a dog and can relate to what you meant. Coming back to your topic, if you are into Bitcoin then the forum is the best resource and discussion platform. You don't need to visit any other website as we have different boards where we can find our answers get clarification to our doubts & discuss on various topic. As per the current price of Bitcoin I think rather having a panic attack we need to create a buying position on every dip. These buying position might give us good returns after halving. I am confident that after halving we would see a new ATH or multiple ATH like the last time",

I'm glad to be in this forum because I have gained more knowledge about Bitcoin since I started exploring this forum. My crypto mentor told me that only whales can invest in Bitcoin, and I also see reason with him. I imagine how will I invest $50 in Bitcoin and make a good profit from it, but this forum has changed my thought on Bitcoin that it is not too late to invest in Bitcoin. What I just need to do is to buy Bitcoin and hold at a price that if it dumps will not affect my holding that much because a new all-time high is coming.",

Assuming I paid good attention to this forum when I created my account in 2022, by now I would have built my Bitcoin portfolio to something magnificent using DCA that I learnt recently. Now I am struggling to build it amidst economic recession, demands from family and limited resources. There were days I made good profits when I was day trading Bitcoin, if I had known what I know now, a good percentage of those money would have been used for buying Bitcoin for long term instead of allowing the money deplete during bad trading days. There are even other trading techniques I learnt from this forum which are useful. I will not forget the knowledge I got about bitcoin wallets and how to store my bitcoin because I was storing in exchanges before.Quote from: Mate2237 on August 20, 2023, 04:35:32 PMFirst of all, the capitalization of your topic is not necessarily needed, before I registered to the forum those are some of the information given to me by the person who introduced me to the forum.

In some parts of Africa, you have to think or reason to get the interpretation of a proverb because the speaker is not mandated by tradition to explain the meaning. To me, the proverb simply means that some people don't know how to use opportunity because they don't know that it is a privilege to have one. A dog is privileged to have food but he can't sit to eat. I knew nothing about Bitcoin before I joined this forum. It will not be out of place to say that my journey in the Bitcoin ecosystem started in this forum and I have never regretted it.
