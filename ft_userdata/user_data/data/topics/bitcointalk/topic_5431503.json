      "body": "Hello,I posted a thread yesterday soliciting feedback regarding a Bitcoin banking project. I first posted it on Development and it was deleted. I made a separate post asking why, and it was suggested that I repost the thread in Meta.I did that, but it got deleted again.I've read through the rules but can't seem to find the¬† forum rule I'm violating. Even so, it's clear enough to me that I'm doing something wrong in this community. Not the first impression I wanted to make.I'm looking for feedback and a discussion regarding the theoretical structure of a project I believe is worth advancing. If anyone could direct me to the appropriate person to ask permission, or the right place to repost my original thread, I'd sincerely appreciate it.Thank you!BB",

In relation to the latter, the phrasing was perhaps a bit confusing. I‚Äôve seen the suggestion for moving it to Meta, although rather than move it, the focus should have been placed on getting people‚Äôs opinion on what board the content should be posted in. Reading over the wording, with the context from your prior post, seems to point to you wanting feedback on where to place the content, and not to the project itself, but perhaps that wasn‚Äôt crystal clear, leading to confusion.Project Development doesn't really sound bad to me, as the idea is seemingly essentially BTC related, but perhaps the fact that you added a BTC address for contributions was a killer. One thing to consider is that explicitly mentioning a bitcoin address for people to send funds to, is generally considered to be infringing rule number 7 (no begging), regardless of the actual intent. You can have bitcoin addresses here and there, on your profile, and reference them on posts, but generally you shouldn‚Äôt ask for people to contribute to them (see rules). This rule generally leads to posts being deleted if it is not met.Let's see what other people think about your case.",

Another thing Op ad your question already answered you can now lock this topic in the bottom left corner to prevent spam replies.",

Cus the MODs won't waste anytime trying to figure out the WHY or HOW anyone would do such mistakes; they'll simply delete 'em post, sometimes without your notice. We've got alot of sticky notes dude, read up just so you don't fall a victim next time.I'd also wanna urge you: do what is right and keep being consistent, you're gonna make out mega someday, just like everyone else.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",
