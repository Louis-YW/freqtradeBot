I doubt. Especially for new gambling sites.They might end up facing bankruptcy at the early stage if no such wagering requirements will be applied especially if there are lots of users who will gain the bonus. The wagering requirement is also necessary as users won't stay on that site if the bonus doesn't have any requirements. They need to do something for these players to stay for quite a long and that's the purpose of the wagering requirements. The requirement will also trigger their users to deposit more just to achieve the bonus.",

That already takes out the abuse.This leads to the next question.2. No, they will not. The reason is because of number 1.There will always be abuse and they won't give out free money just because you made a deposit. Even banks don't give out interest in just a short amount of time. It takes years for just an increase of 1 percent or maybe less.",

Bonuses are optional and you shouldn't choose a casino only for their bonus. Play like you would and if you happen to get the bonus and do all the wagers it's good for you, free money!The requirement has become a standard in the industry and It's not going away. It can get lower but it won't disappear. One of the reasons for it is you cannot get rid of abuse in full. There will always be innovative people who will find ways to do it and there's a lot of poor gamblers who'd do a lot for a few dollars. The wagering requirement is the easiest way to stop the abuse. It's that or full KYC on registration and nobody has time to do that.",

To me it sounds reasonable. Because casinos business model completely depend on people depositing and placing wagers on their money, they also place those requirements to incentivize people to wager more, so they can become part of a higher tier and have access to those perks.2.that would imply casinos would need to go further and impose even tougher KYC (which would be highly unpopular). There is also the possibility of casinos losing money (specially the small ones) if they do not administer bonuses correctly.  In the end, I don't think wagering requirements are going to disappear. Sure, there could be ways to make them more accessible  and friendly to newcomers or small gamblers, but from the point of view of a casino owner, they help to keep things going.",

That's not even a question.Gambling sites won't give free money obviously. If you give me a 100% bonus, I deposit 1 bitcoin, and if there are no wagering requirements, as soon as you deposit the other bitcoin into my account, I withdraw 2 bitcoin. A 100% return in a moment. Much better than any bet or investment.It would bankrupt the casinos fast.

There is also the possibility of casinos losing money (specially the small ones) if they do not administer bonuses correctly.  I don't see the KYC thing, as there are also wagering requirements at fiat casinos, such as Bwin or Betfair. Yes, it would be useful so that, following the example I gave earlier, the same person could not double their bitcoins in an instant with a multitude of slopes created, but the risk of bankruptcy without wagering requirements is there, regardless of KYC or not.",

It doesn't mean if wagering requirements are not there it will result in deposits, bonus claims and withdrawals. There could be a better way to do that without emptying players all in an attempt to meet the casino wager requirement.",

It seems that the abuse will not be removed from the casino and remains, And the no-wager requirement will never happen because the purpose of the casino is the same as I said in my first point of statement and will remain the same for the foreseeable future.",

Understandable. Otherwise, bonuses and the like would most likely be abused, and they'd have no real profit off of the freebies they give (not that there is in the first place though, it's only in the cases that they actually win through said bonuses after all). 2. No. As I said earlier, abuses aren't the only factor involved here, it's also the potential profits they could by making new users reach that set wager limit. In the first place, I think abuses are already countered with the fact that most casinos require KYC on withdrawal? Just that is enough to promote a ban if they discovered multi-accounting for bonuses. 3. Again, none, simply because it isn't only protecting the revenue of casinos, but rather increasing it.",

Can you come up with other security checks and anti-fraud measures?It's like asking the question: \"Would you rob a bank, if there are no guards, the cameras aren't working and you have all the keys?\" Of course that some people will try to abuse the system, when the security is off.2.The casinos, that offer bonuses without a wagering requirement will simply lose their money, because everyone will abuse the bonus system until the casino goes bankrupt. There's no alternative to the wagering requirement. The people, who think that KYC is a good replacement to the wagering requirement are naive. The darkweb is full with stolen ID pictures and info, which can be used for ID verification.",

But casinos are not charity organizations, and even if abuse is completely eliminated there will be wagering requirements for all casino features. When it comes to money, I never saw any casino that gives some \"free cash\" without wagering requirements before withdrawal... imagine that abuse if you can register, get some free cash and withdraw that cash immediately! I guess even with mandatory KYC people will try to take as much as they can...But some casinos give \"free spins\" without wagering requirements, but the tricky part is that with 20-30 spins you need to be extremely lucky to hit something nice. Usually, it's a few dollars so you need to play more before you reach the minimum withdrawal amount.",
