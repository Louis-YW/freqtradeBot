      "body": "Hi Peter,I hope you are well. Thanks for your reply to my post and sorry for the late response as I do not visit this forum very much. I have tried to contact you but it says that you do not accept messages from newbies. If you can please could you email me at anesu.thondhlana@marskil.com. I have a BTC seller that can sell via fireblocks at large quantities with discount and I can bring them forward to discuss further with you to close a deal. I am direct to the principle, so there are no broker chains involved. The principle will speak to you to provide details on the quantity you want to purchase and your desired tranche schedule. After this you will speak to the end seller to finalise the transaction through conference call. Please can I confirm that you are the end buyer as we do not deal with any intermediaries. I look forward to your response. Many thanks",
