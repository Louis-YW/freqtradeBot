The color combination and format style really soothes the eyes here. So basically the site just provides PvP games? So what‚Äôs the housedge for each of the games mentioned above? Moreover you should also mention about the KYC details along with which countries the players are allowed in the site. Definitely will give a check to the site, and will leave a detailed review soon.",

I've seen this kind of logo many times especially among streamers. They've been here since 2021, but they weren't active until they finally created announcement thread. Hopefully, they will run another promotion exclusively for the Bitcointalk community, just like many other gambling websites that have posted their announcement threads here on Bitcointalk.",

If my guess is correct that it is rebranded/renamed casino from btcarena.gg, means that they have been here since 2019. What I dont understand is that the old representative was not active just after he announced that btcarena.gg is launched officially.",

Is it because this project is now under new management and has been trying to launch since 2018?You should beta test first before going live. It looks like there are still major issues, especially when it comes to deposits and withdrawals, but I'm not sure. I'm just basing this on what I've read on their Discord server.",

      "body": "welcome to the forum. your thread is very beautiful, congratulations, in recent times most people who come to announce their new casino, have had problems in the ANN thread, they create an ann thread that is not beautiful, not flashy, so the forum members had to stay telling the creator of the ann thread to buy copper member. Anyway, at least you came well prepared for this part. in the thread part it's fine, but when I entered your casino I see that it doesn't work: FAQ, Terms Of Service, Probably Fair. This is very strange, because it is the most important things that must work. So you ran to create a thread here on the forum but you didn't check whether everything is working correctly or not in your casino, this could be bad in terms of people thinking about trusting your casinoHow are people going to create an account at a casino where they don't know about the rules of that same casino? and to make things even worse, in 2019 there was a casino with the same name and designer as your casino:üî∂BTCArena.ggüî∂ALL NEW COMMUNITY DICE GAME üèÜTHE FIRST PVP LOTTERY/COINFLIP SITEit's the same casino?It's the same owner?In 2021 you created a thread to announce the beta phase of your casino:üî• Arena.GG Final BETA event!

I wonder: what happened to make you disappear without giving a reason and then reappear almost 2 years later?I saw that your casino also has a token, looking at coinmarketcap:https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/ethereum/0x6eec66dab0e6a21f367fabba2c47c449de7d3a31/#TradeHistoryI don't see exchanges, but what is your objective with this token?",

It just plain text saying that is a huge red flag.And because of that i have no info even on how $ARENA is mined or how it even works. Does it give dividends directly to your own wallet or the wallet that's hosted by the site? And do you get $arena by holding $arena? Why would anyone want that?Your Top 10s Leaderboard shows that only 8 people hold any $arena and looks like it shows their eth addresses by default which seems a little invasive imho",

Why does the thought arise - is this establishment reliable?To be honest, I wouldn't use this casino, that's because there was a thread made by him in the past and he disappeared without explaining why he had to leave, which clearly shows that it's not his main concern to please his customers, so he can come back disappearing again as soon as people put money into his casino and see that just like in the past he also created a thread in this thread and didn't respond to anyone, it's been 4 days without him having entered the forum, in other words he disappeared again, no I know if this time he would only return in 2 years or if he disappeared for a few daysbut we have to ask ourselves: what does the behavior of someone mean when they present a service in which their objective is to have customers and that person disappears, the customers ask him questions and he, who is the owner of the services, is not able to respond, could this be a problem? would the behavior of a person intend to run a serious, honest business for many years? Let's imagine that people put money on his website and have problems depositing and withdrawing, would he be active in responding quickly to people? When I look at people who do this, I'm scared to create an account on their websiteSome thread owners who have this behavior, after disappearing for a long time when they come back to the forum, start to complain that they disappeared because they didn't have time because they were busy with the casino, so I wonder why they posted something incomplete? We'll see if Op returns and what he will say about his disappearance.",

I guess the OP is also disappeared already now, few days not login since he created this ANN thread, just another proof that this is not a gambling site to visit.",
