If you check the Bitcoin white paper, you will clearly see that Bitcoin was created as a decentralized p2p payment alternative. But with such great technology, you don't expect it to stop there. You as an investor can choose to use it for what ever purpose you want to, either as a long term investment plan or a payment option. But the truth is that bitcoin hasn't shifted a bit from its initial purpose of creation.",

But using it to buy things only happens when the network is huge, because merchants need enough people to have it and want to buy things with it to bother adopting it for payments. And the thing that Satoshi coded in to make people want to have it is, in addition to its fundamentals as digital currency, its scarcity. Investment is the first use case, then as growth slows down it just becomes the best way to save money, no longer really an \"investment\", just a savings account. Only at that point, once lots of people own it, does it make sense for merchants to adopt it. Paying for stuff is the final stage of its growth.Remember this is something that is organically growing from one person to global usage. The only way for it to grow is gradually phase to phase with transactional currency being the final stage. Once it seems like it is meeting its purpose, that means it has already achieved mass adoption.",

BTC is p2p digital cash that is an alternative currency to fiat, but people can as well decide for themselves what they want to do with their BTC without requiring permission from you, and that does not change the original purpose why BTC was created.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5498206.msg64143275#msg64143275",

For others, it continues to be an alternative to fiat, banks, and everything that comes along with those things.

It is only click bait story if they did not experience it and did not understand risk, uncertainty on future of Bitcoin in past years.Bitcoin x pizza story, a man sold a family house to all in invested in bitcoin and are traveling around the world, many stories can be told but only people in those stories understand what happened.QuoteThat doesn't mean that thing stopped being what it was meant to be.
