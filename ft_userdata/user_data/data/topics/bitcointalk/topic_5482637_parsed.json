Predicting the next dip is tricky but keeping an eye on news and trends helps.Yes, it's very tough to predict the next move of Bitcoin and how much it will go down.  Last week, we saw that ETF was approved and the price of bitcoin went up to $49k but suddenly we saw some bad moves of BTC going down.  I did not realize what happened that bitcoin price goes down that much.  A few minutes ago I saw the price of btc on coinmarketcap which shows that the price is 11% down in the last 30 days.  This is a significant opportunity for those people who want to invest in Bitcoin.  Maybe the BTC goes down but it's not confirmed be BTC does a comeback and goes up which will not be a piece of good news for those who want to buy.  So do not lose this opportunity and make some investments.",

When the price fell further, other people also panicked and sold their bitcoins, this incident was also exacerbated after bitcoin broke through the support point of $39,564 (weekly timeframe).

      "body": "Not every dip requires an explanation. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, its price can't be regulated and can't be controlled. The interest in buying and selling Bitcoin naturally fluctuates, and that causes the price to go up or down. There's also a phenomenon called a correction, which is a way of an asset's price adjusting after being overvalued due to hype or something like that. So what we see now is Bitcoin's correction. It will stop, Bitcoin can easily recover from that later, and it doesn't matter in the long run. A correction doesn't need triggers, it can happen naturally after growth.",

Falling Bitcoin is a good thing because this is an opportunity to accumulate bitcoin at cheap prices, not a time for panic selling. The truth will be quite harsh, but we should thank those who sell in panic because if they don't sell, how can we buy bitcoin at cheap prices? This is the financial market and it is very cruel, people with paper hands do not deserve to profit in this market. I prefer a panicked market to an overly calm market that doesn't make a profit.",

I've lived in the market long enough to know that any market expectattions that fails could backfire and could cause a reverse trend, which is what is happening now. The ETF filing and expectations that caused Bitcoin to rise, when later got approved, is the same that causes it to fall now, this is because reality is different from speculation and optimism.Then, it was the expectations and optimism that dragged the price of Bitcoin higher through FOMO, but it is moving on the opposite side now where it (Bitcoin) is viewed as overpriced. This, I'm afraid might last for a month, but hopefully, halving will change the narrative, I mean the post-halving effect. Technically, Bitcoin is bearish in outlook, it will continue to sell lower with little or no restrictions at all just like how we experienced it when it was buying late last year.It has breached a strong support level at $40,243 and still has a strong price action before it, so it is likely that it will reach $37,519 in no time and even go lower than that.
