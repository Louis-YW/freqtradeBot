  "content": "Hello there, when i tried to visit duelbits' site, i found about these links. At first, i thought its mirror links of duelbits' site, but when i asked it on duelbits' live support chat box, they told me it's not their official link.  You can see, the legit link which is duelbits.com is on top, then we can see the second link, which i asked to live support, then the third link which i think it's also a phising link (the blogspot & gandom)With that, please help me to report those phising link so it's not appeared as \"sponsored\" sites while we want to visit duelbits.",

Searching sites on google might be risky especially sites that involves deposit, withdrawal and rewards. If this was a case of a complete novice maybe such would have made deposits and who knows what might follow after that. Cross checking this links to ensure it matches that of the official link might escape one's memory and the way this phishing links will present convincing welcome messages one might mistaken it for the official link. It is better to stick to BTT forum links shared on their official thread.",

That is why I quit using google search engine long ago.",

I always set my block trackers settings to aggressive for mobile and uBlock Origin for desktop that's why clicking google ads whether its on google search page or any other website is near impossible.Plus, kindly report the ad, it will be a big help",

I've encountered websites like this before and I even mistook one for being a phishing site. that being said I still recommend not using the website as a way to go to the real duelbits.",

So this https://duelbits.com/?a=terrence92 that is on sponsored ads redirects to https://duelbits.com/?modal=Auth&type=register, not really a good strategy as you can be reported to the site you're promoting, there could be a violation for imitation.",

Creating a clone copy of casino is really expensive because you will need to game providers and other casino engine features just to make it realistic. Itâs better to do affiliate like what the OP accused as phishing compared to investing huge money on copying casino without any guarantee for a victim.@OP, thereâs a lot of ads like this on google if you will search other popular casino like Stake and Sportsbet. Some of them is phishing and some of them is just an affiliate. Itâs better to bookmark the casino or use the link provided on there ANN thread here to make sure you are browsing the correct website.",

Most of people just googled it and just click whether the popped up on top. If it's legit site, they are okay, how if scam site appeared on top? They would lose all their money just because signed/logged to phising site.",
