This is the correct format: https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/keys/private-key/wif/.Did you perhaps bought this wallet instead? Don't be too shy to admit it, a lot of people in here come often, asking for helping them to recover \"their\" bitcoin, when in reality, it's just a fake wallet file they bought from a scammer, with nothing in it.",

Also how can someone from this forum steal your wallet because you just posted only the address? This show your poor knowledge about Bitcoin which begs the question, how can someone with poor knowledge about Bitcoin own 8 Bitcoin legitimately? It's super suspicious and weird.",

WIF looks like Quote from: https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/keys/private-key/wif/These are static examples of WIF private keys. Do not use them.Ky1BY5QkB6xb3iQQjJQmVcvqc6mkLBaZTW1xCWpf91aFGBh1kyQ7 (for a compressed public key on mainnet)L1Rw26ZuhBqguYDSi77zAxyfHUZ2H1JAQunf3TEbxyfcBDjUvBse (for a compressed public key on mainnet)5JKZUnxc5G8toCqErCQpHiUYff3t7GvBd2my4bf6odejtZAy7hG (for an uncompressed public key on mainnet)I have the impression you misunderstood something.1. This is not a proper way to post binary data2. Be very careful on what actual data you are posting; no admin can help you if your private key ends up in wrong hands and quite small chance even police would help. Better watch your back.3. You may want to tell more clearly what your problem is and let us try to find solutions. If, for example, you have a password protected wallet and you have some clue about its password, there are tools that can help you.However, coming with some random useless data and some empty threatening will get you nowhere good. Maybe will get you to some private messages \"willing to help\" and actually trying to steal your coins, but nothing else. Get more constructive.",
