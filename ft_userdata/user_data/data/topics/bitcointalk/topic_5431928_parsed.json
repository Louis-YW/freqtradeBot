  "content": "After browsing Meta, I saw these two topics:BitcoinTalk Censorship: censoring information about Satoshi and BitcoinCensorship on Bitcointalk. My topic was removed!I do not have an opinion on these threads, though I think that we can all agree that bitcoin is more about liberty than it is censorship...and I do not believe that censorship would be an appropriate attribute of bitcointalk. So, I have made this thread for three reasons. Firstly, to see if it is censored. Secondly, to allow people to share if they believe they have been censored. Thirdly, to enable discussion of the topic. To help people anyone who is having a censorship issue, I will keep this post maintained with quotes for anyone who claims to be censored. - I will stop responding to this thread to stop bumping it. Even though I am inclined to respond to some people, I can't be bothered too much as it is unrelated to the topic.",

However, I won't share my opinion on them as I am not looking to get involved. They are no more than the inspiration of my curiosity that lead me to make this thread.Quote from: PX-Z on December 27, 2022, 01:09:53 AMAlso, Bitcoin and bitcointalk are two different thing, this forum has mods and rules that needed to be followed or we will face lots of spam compare to what they are calling \"censorship\".I suppose they are two different things. I do not think their values should differ much (if at all) considering they were created by the same person with the same intentions and values in mind. I do totally agree with you that without forum mods or rules at all, it would be mayhem.

There are people sometimes cries but it's more like some discrete noises from members who had their conflict of interest either with an individual member or with the admins they way the are managing the forum. I would think that people being censored would sound like discrete noise to a lot of people. Usually people who are being censored have their voice silenced to the best of the other parties ability. I'm not saying that's what is happening here at all, I am just addressing what you said in your post. Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on December 27, 2022, 01:15:09 AMWhy would people cry in this topic instead of having their own topics like you picked at the beginning?If there is ever a build up over time, then it's easier to know about it if it is being posted in one thread compared to many floating away. Many voices are more powerful than one voice (if there really is a problem at some stage). This was one idea that came with the rest after I saw the mentioned threads.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on December 27, 2022, 01:15:09 AMI see you woke up after a long time and suddenly started asking so many questions (in new topics) as if you were not existed in the forum. What happened in between? It's been a long time. What happened in between is a lot to write. You can read it in my autobiography if I ever write one  Just joking. I have some free time for a few hours or more per week now. I want to be involved in a community again and I used to enjoy this one. Truth be told, there is an incentive to be on this community over others as maybe one day I can be a part of a signature campaign and this few hours of spare time per week can be a rewarding hobby. This is definitely not my motive, but it is an incentive. Why I am posting so much is just because now is one of those times where I have a few hours and decided to go online. I just post what is on my mind as I read new topics.",

Quote from: LoyceV on December 27, 2022, 09:59:16 AMQuoteFirstly, to see if it is censored.Deleting posts isn't necessarily censorship.I agree. I would say censorship is removing something that should be/is allowed but is deleted against the creators will by the perpetrator (for whatever reason).Quote from: LoyceV on December 27, 2022, 09:59:16 AMQuote from: BenCodie on December 27, 2022, 12:34:38 AMSecondly, to allow people to share if they believe they have been censored.That's not how this works.

Start by forming an opinion on the 2 threads you mentioned: was it justified to delete it, based on the forum rules?I don't have a concrete opinion. Both of the threads are a little different and I did not think too much about them as one of the users were very extreme and the other may have been wrong, but I did not read enough to conclude. I came straight to make this topic instead, because it interested me a lot more and seemed like a good idea at the time. I will read through both threads and I might form an opinion so that this topic is no longer pointless.

I wouldn't be surprised if you were the one promoting this marketplace, since you have mentioned its name more than I have in this entire thread.Quote from: Poker Player on December 27, 2022, 04:37:36 AMQuote from: yhiaali3 on December 27, 2022, 04:26:25 AMCensorship here in the forum is not on discussion, ideas, or freedom of expression, but only on violating forum rules.So it is not censorship.

If you bother visit Politics & Society, you will see few topic which usually isn't or can't be disguised on many social media.If you experienced it as a normal user with less conflicting views, it would be a much larger topic...but usually censorship targets people with less common views. If you asked a \"normal\" facebook user if their content was censored, they would say no, and that they have never had their content deleted. Again, I am not suggesting this is happening here. I am only responding to peoples posts and kind of playing devils advocate at this point. Quote from: ETFbitcoin on December 27, 2022, 10:14:37 AMIf you're serious about this, you might want to take a screenshot and provide archive link such as https://loyce.club/, https://ninjastic.space/, https://web.archive.org/ or https://archive.vn/.Quote from: Upgrade00 on December 27, 2022, 10:27:37 AMQuote from: BenCodie on December 27, 2022, 12:34:38 AMAfter browsing Meta, I saw these two topics:Use the search option with the key word censorship; limit the search to Meta board and you will get tons of results related to this, it's not a topic that started few days ago and it's no surprise it's being discussed, this is the internet, people are bound to have different reactions to things.You can list out all the leads you find, follow discussions there and reach your conclusion.I will look in my spare time and if it really compels me to do so after some more research and reading, I will do that. I do not have a lot of spare time on my hands even to use the forum so I'm not really looking to try and change things here. I think I just got ahead of myself with my curiosity in this thread. What I will do later is some more reading with Upgrade00's suggestion and put the results in the op, only for precedent for this thread being created, so that it's not pointless and it can serve its purpose.",
