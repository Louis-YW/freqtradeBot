Being a pro-trader requires a lot of work and sacrifices though, many can’t achieve that level because they failed to educate themselves more about trading. If this analysis works, then its good that you actually buy during this bear market. Bitcoin will rise again, this is the analysis of many and I also know it will happen very soon.",

Obviously they are not all moving the same way, for example when everything is falling there is always a handful of shitcoins that get pumped. So you have to be a lot more specific than that.It is understandable that shitcoins start getting pumped now that bitcoin price is stable and isn't making a big move. But you can't predict which shitcoin the pumping teams are going to choose for pump in advanced. It can only be seen and analyzed when the pump is happening.",

I see likely 18400 btc as highest price this month. But today altcoins like xrp sol shiba are bullish together with btc and 17k price acting as support for btc in this short term bull run.",
