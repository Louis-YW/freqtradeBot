For me its really easy money with a little short of time but other trades I also lose and unfortunately, I am more losing than winning eversince on future trade. I really thought technical plays a 100% on that but sometime its not enough. Even my prediction panned out the market works on mystetious ways. So I also agreed that before trying out better to knew 100% evetything about it. Its not about knowledge but the actual events on future sometimes make you question the high volatility of market and unpredictable movement.",

Yes, in the beginning when you taste that first, second and third profit, you think that, \"oh that's great\", you can do it easy . Nevertheless, when you experience your first lost and it's going to be big, perhaps all the profits you got will be lost in just that one trade of yours.",

I see a lot of traders settle only on spot trading because for what I see they cannot take the huge risk given by this option since we really need to spend time to watch how the market moves because if we are not there to guard our trades for sure we will lost since market is so volatile.",

Spot trading is advisable for beginners and even to have this until you claim yourself ready to step up to a riskier type of trading which is Future Trading. Experience is really needed for this - I won't stop people to try this at least they have some reason why they stay using Spot trading and understand the risk in Future trading.",

Well, it's easy to think that you're always learning and whether you win or lose, you're anticipating both of them as an outcome. Gain more experience and have more patience to control your emotions.

Losses are somewhat inevitable in trading and all traders had to go experience this. You can never expect a profit all the time as losses are highly possible. Moreover, a feeling of being disappointed is understandable as we never think about it but just a profit. However, trading isn't designed to work like that and it can never be safe especially if you are new to this. Perhaps, we can't instantly become a pro-trader, it takes quite long and more losses to experience - that is the reality.",

Likely, if you are good at spot trading, you find it difficult in Future trading. This is what I see some people who have been in Spot Trading for many years still stay there and have no plan to step up knowing that they can be outperformed there. Such a wise decision but guess what? That should be the case as simply we can underestimate Future Trading nor it can be easy just like Spot trading.",

Do you even know to how to use stop loss in your trading? I think Futures Trading is specifically not for traders that donâ€™t use stop loss feature because this the most important feature on Futures trading that needs to be known and setup before you will enter any position on your trading. This lose is really painful because I know how hard to earn small money on multiple small trades and just busting it in a single day.",

Â  always don't fell on your emotions when trading, that's the lesson for you mate!.Because you know it doesn't matter if you trade spot or futures as long as you have risk management and you know what you're doing in every trade it's all fine and you still can regain afterwards even you made mistakes at the beginning. Â And also donâ€™t be so hype after winning because you will become a greedy trader.. where in always make an adjustment to prevent massive losses especially when it comes futures because it's not a joke and it can really burn your account in just a blink of an eye...
