  "content": "'signature chain' - a new type of 'NFT' on the Bitcoin blockchainOpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/signature-chainThe items include the private key of the Bitcoin address for the given 'signature chain' as unlockable content that can only be unlocked and revealed by the new owner of this item.Don't use these addresses for your private/own transactions. These are just for 'signature chain' transactions. You don't need to transfer the 'signature chain' immediately after purchase. You should understand how it works before transferring it. But if you believe in that project, you can get it now.Rarity: 'signature chains' that start with early used addresses but also early created 'siganture chains' in that project. We are very early (13/Feb/2023). How this started:Recently there was a post with signatures, that used a key of a very old (January 2009) Bitcoin address.Quote from: OneSignature on November 28, 2022, 01:30:19 AMQuote from: OneSignature on November 26, 2022, 11:23:02 PMThis is the oldest signature    (please post if you have a signature with an older address)Quote-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----1E9YwDtYf9R29ekNAfbV7MvB4LNv7v3fGa-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----1NChfewU45oy7Dgn51HwkBFSixaTnyakfjHCsBcgB+Wcm8kOGMH8IpNeg0H4gjCrlqwDf/GlSXphZGBYxm0QkKEPhh9DTJRp2IDNUhVr0FhP9qCqo2W0recNM=-----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----signature chain  Quote-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----1KN59gRxD8G9g9smSLTFt9aSgWxYxTzFL7-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----1E9YwDtYf9R29ekNAfbV7MvB4LNv7v3fGaHwvtQmiREYIyZeI9uohqr82d9eiwtcBgbhG5+VR7+ouEDOTgd6EYvcgNQVELLVJnQbYhN6SSv1xPtQ8SmIa10+U=-----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----The discussion was \"is it Satoshi or not, who is it\" and so on.Then the user yhiaali3 mentioned that it could be used to create an NFT.Quote from: yhiaali3 on December 03, 2022, 11:13:16 AMSomeone may want to convert old BTC addresses into NFT and sell them for large amounts later, this idea may achieve great profits after 10 years have passed, as these old addresses become of archaeological value as they are old Bitcoin addresses.In this case, it does not matter whether you own the private key or not, because this address will not be used to send or receive bitcoins, but only as an NFT.And we want to test a new type of 'NFT' here with that project:--- old Bitcoin addresses as 'NFT' on the Bitcoin blockchain - a signature chain ---",

      "body": "how it works - will be updated'signature chain' rulesOnly legacy addresses that start with '1' and had at least one incoming transaction that is on the Bitcoin blockchain can become a 'signature chain.'Some addresses don't have outgoing transactions, these are valid too.Addresses can be compressed or uncompressed. There is no upper limit for the number of incoming or outgoing transactions.The private key holder of such an address can start a 'signature chain.'The starting address is the ID (or the name) of that 'siganture chain.'The blocktime of the first incoming transaction of a given address indicates the 'siganture chain age.'The ownership transfer happens through 'transfer signatures' + 'transfer transactions.''Transfer signatures' are message signatures, where the message is the Bitcoin address of the new owner.Anything else than the address of the new owner in the message would make the transfer signature invalid.A transfer signature is only valid if there is a transfer transaction.A transfer transaction is a transaction from the address of the old owner to the address of the new owner and the value is not important (can be dust).The transfer transaction can contain more than one input (from the old owner) but it is only valid if it has exactly 1 output (to the new owner).The new owner is now the sole owner of the 'signature chain' and can transfer this to a new address who will become the next owner.Only unused/empty legacy addresses starting with '1' can receive 'signature chains.'It is important to store the signature history of the 'signature chain' as the new owner needs it to verify the ownership.If a 'signature chain' was transferred to an address, any outgoing Bitcoin transaction from that address thereafter would indicate the transfer of the 'signature chain'. So it is recommended to have a separate Bitcoin address for 'signature chain' transactions.A Bitcoin address can hold only 1 'signature chain.' (if an address holds one 'singature chain' and receives another one, then the new one is not valid and the sending address will remain the owner)Any address that received Bitcoin from a legacy address after the initial block (see below) can't receive a 'signature chain' if there is only 1 transaction output as the received Bitcoin could be a 'siganture chain' transfer that will be revealed later by the owner. Therefore it is recommended to use a new legacy address to receive a 'signature chain.'The first 'siganture chain' of the project (1NChfewU45oy7Dgn51HwkBFSixaTnyakfj transfers the 'signature ownership' to 1E9YwDtYf9R29ekNAfbV7MvB4LNv7v3fGa) doesn't need a transaction (by definition it is the initial signature like Bitcoin block 0). All other 'transfer signatures' need 'transfer transactions' to be valid.Invalid 'signature transactions' can be on the blockchain. But they will be treated as not happened.Valid after block 765779 (03/Dec/2022 11:04 PM UTC) txid 16bb6761cc8d7d393d25a88ec589361c1f0461a9c138ecc2333b0736efe488de = initial transfer (example below)Example:we have a signature that 1NChfewU45oy7Dgn51HwkBFSixaTnyakfj transfers the 'signature ownership' to 1E9YwDtYf9R29ekNAfbV7MvB4LNv7v3fGaQuote-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----1E9YwDtYf9R29ekNAfbV7MvB4LNv7v3fGa-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----1NChfewU45oy7Dgn51HwkBFSixaTnyakfjHCsBcgB+Wcm8kOGMH8IpNeg0H4gjCrlqwDf/GlSXphZGBYxm0QkKEPhh9DTJRp2IDNUhVr0FhP9qCqo2W0recNM=-----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----we have a signature that 1E9YwDtYf9R29ekNAfbV7MvB4LNv7v3fGa transfers the 'signature ownership' to 1KN59gRxD8G9g9smSLTFt9aSgWxYxTzFL7Quote-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----1KN59gRxD8G9g9smSLTFt9aSgWxYxTzFL7-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----1E9YwDtYf9R29ekNAfbV7MvB4LNv7v3fGaHwvtQmiREYIyZeI9uohqr82d9eiwtcBgbhG5+VR7+ouEDOTgd6EYvcgNQVELLVJnQbYhN6SSv1xPtQ8SmIa10+U=-----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----then we have a 'transfer transaction': Bitcoin transfer from 1E9YwDtYf9R29ekNAfbV7MvB4LNv7v3fGa to 1KN59gRxD8G9g9smSLTFt9aSgWxYxTzFL7txid 16bb6761cc8d7d393d25a88ec589361c1f0461a9c138ecc2333b0736efe488dethe 'signature chain'1NChfewU45oy7Dgn51HwkBFSixaTnyakfj1E9YwDtYf9R29ekNAfbV7MvB4LNv7v3fGa1KN59gRxD8G9g9smSLTFt9aSgWxYxTzFL7has the ID 1NChfewU45oy7Dgn51HwkBFSixaTnyakfj (= first/initial address in the chain)and only 1KN59gRxD8G9g9smSLTFt9aSgWxYxTzFL7 (= last address in the chain) can transfer that 'signature chain'It is to mention that this example is a special example as the first signature in that project doesn't need a transaction (by definition of that project it is the initial signature like Bitcoin block 0). All other 'transfer signatures' need 'transfer transactions' to be valid.But it works even without a 'transfer transaction' of the 'transfer signature' for the first project transfer.Example 2:Quote from: casinotester0001 on December 06, 2022, 03:01:14 AMIt worked. (It should work because Bitcoin works  )The transfer to 143NrfsANkM5B2Y3pWeCHNxGQS8kBFceDw is stored on the blockchain, but the 'signature chain' protocol doesn't accept it because the target address was a used address. So the owner 1MAP7AKiN5Ddce82VE8eFheFfyQ8iffvmV was still the owner of the 'signature chain'.I sent it to the other unused/empty address 14ivWoBRgpfMbyiWqyjuDFnch6sGpsxKTV and now the protocol accepts it.You have your 'signature chain' on 14ivWoBRgpfMbyiWqyjuDFnch6sGpsxKTV.txid 387087dddda71c8d48ee1a7ec08652507a32a9a2a2d574884f633065575675c2block 766,199signature:Quote-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----14ivWoBRgpfMbyiWqyjuDFnch6sGpsxKTV-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----1MAP7AKiN5Ddce82VE8eFheFfyQ8iffvmVIBNSqTqvnbppr24p5yLGfAhki47DRCOTH6D4DQ/07LePPjqRTNna/SyL3KcSLgUP2GNYsG5N+El6EnoEU5P95VA=-----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----This signature is proof that 1MAP7AKiN5Ddce82VE8eFheFfyQ8iffvmV gives you the right to transfer this 'signature chain' for the Bitcoin address 1MAP7AKiN5Ddce82VE8eFheFfyQ8iffvmV to someone else. 1MAP7AKiN5Ddce82VE8eFheFfyQ8iffvmV is a newly created address to test 'siganture chain' but it could be for example a very old address and the private key holder/owner of that address could transfer the rights to someone else through signing such a message where the address of the new owner is the message and transferring Bitcoin (value is not important/can be dust) to the address of the new owner.Only you can transfer this 'signature chain' for 1MAP7AKiN5Ddce82VE8eFheFfyQ8iffvmV with the private key of 14ivWoBRgpfMbyiWqyjuDFnch6sGpsxKTV. It is important that you store that signature above. Because there is no 'signature chain' explorer at the moment where you could see that. This signature is like the NFT picture that is not stored on the blockchain.We are doing all procedures manually at the moment. And it is good as people can understand how it works. At some point it should work automatically through a wallet/explorer.Now we have to see how the community will accept it. But I have a feeling that it is CryptoPunks in the making.",

Then the 'ownership' isn't shared as another signature of the previous owner to another address + transaction to this address wouldn't be accepted by the participants as the rules are: the first transaction on the blockchain from an address is valid. All transactions thereafter don't count, are valueless. (We will have an initial block number, whereafter this will be valid.)I know, it is a bit difficult to understand/explain because we don't have examples on the blockchain but they're on their way.

Working on it will not be easy and it will be difficult to understand at first, but it seems to me a really promising idea and your project can succeed.Your discussion of the topic there shed a lot of light on the idea and I think it is starting to become more and more clear, you need to make one NFT at the beginning to try the results and see the advantages and disadvantages.good luckYes, thanks, that you mentioned that someone could try to make an NFT out of it. We don't have a classical NFT here, but this 'signature chain' works and could become something   who knows? Mabe we have something like 'cryptopunks' in the making. At the beginning people didn't understand blockchain & NFT too.",

At the beginning people didn't understand blockchain & NFT too.Yes, right, I think I understood your basic idea, this is not a classical NFT, it will be a new type of NFT that differs from the previous one, based on the “signature chain” and not just the old address. Perhaps this new style will be popular with Bitcoin fans in the future.I read the discussions between you and franky1 it was really helpful to clarify the idea, you can make use of these discussions and objections to develop the idea later, if you succeed in that maybe this is the start of a new and unique type of NFT.good luck",

It would be better to use a new empty address. Because from 143NrfsANkM5B2Y3pWeCHNxGQS8kBFceDw if you make outgoing transactions and if the output is 1 legacy address, so it would mean that you send/transfer your 'signature chain' to this address. You don't need an old address to receive 'signature chains'.EDIT:Ok, I see you don't use it anymore for transactions. Sent the 'signature chain' to 143NrfsANkM5B2Y3pWeCHNxGQS8kBFceDw.",
