  "content": "I first started investing in Bitcoin after the June crash last year.I had accumulated 0.07 Bitcoin before we started pumping a few weeks ago and have since sold 0.02 which currently leaves me with 0.05.I decided to sell and put the profits into other altcoins I believe will see greater gains in the next bull run. I am not sure if I should continue selling my Bitcoin the more we pump or if I should start to DCA again.My thinking behind selling is although I got in at a good price (my current average buy is £15k), that it is only a 6x from £100k which is the expected amount Bitcoin will reach next bull run.A 6x is good if you have thousands of pounds to invest , but I do not.I want 20x gains and feel this is more realistic in top altcoins that are currently 80-90% down. Is anyone taking profits or are most of us just DCA?",

It is your money, but i would call it a bad choice, having BTC and buying altcoins isn't diversification at all, i believe a better thing to do would have been to invest your profits in other assets. Even if you believe altcoins would see greater gains in the next bull run, how do you know which one of the thousands out there that will.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on February 02, 2023, 04:24:48 PMMy thinking behind selling is although I got in at a good price (my current average buy is £15k), that it is only a 6x from £100k which is the expected amount Bitcoin will reach next bull run.Nobody knows the exact amount BTC will reach by the next bull run.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on February 02, 2023, 04:24:48 PMI want 20x gains and feel this is more realistic in top altcoins that are currently 80-90% down. While investing it is good to set realistic targets and not try to be greedy with the gains you want, it is much better to be certain of 6x gains, than to look for 20x and invest in coins that will swallow up your money and leave you with nothing.",

There may be some who are talking profits and then wait for a dip and then buy back, it takes skills to do it but doable. Continue DCA that's what many of us will say. We will see prices beating the last ATH.",

Bitfoin can rise more to $28,000 or even to $30,000 but it is a kind of greedy gambling.If you are greedy to wait for $30,000 to take profit, you must accept that you can waste a chance to take profit about $24,000 if Bitcoin stops there and starts its correction. You must accept that if you miss it, you will have to wait a few months that maybe till 2024 to have chance to take profit about $30,000.But in 2024, $30,000 is not its highest price surely and you will waste another chance by taking profit too early.First time, in 2023, wasting chance to take profit because of too greedy.Second time, in 2024, wasting profit by taking profit too early.",

If you're DCAing with so much every month that it's becoming noticeable and something you feel like you have to keep actively manage, you should probably consider reducing the amount you put in (if it's an affordable amount you're DCAing with, why are you so concerned and why can't you do another smaller one in altcoins)? Are you staking those altcoins too? A lot of places where you can stake/obtain yield from the coins that are down are offering very high yields (I've seen 60% on SOL) it looks like you're taking quite a big risk if you're not looking to stake but are wanting to invest in those coins - and if that comes as news to you, you probably shouldn't be investing in things without doing full research of them.",

As we are seeing pump on the market right now, it will take correction in some point. So DCA will prevent from huge loss. One last thing about investing on alts. They may not bounce back up like BTC in the bull run. So it is safe to avoid those shitcoins. Focus only on Bitcoin.",

I believe that same position with you that purchased last low is now taking profit or else there will be no correction at all and the price will continue to rise without a break. It’s not bad to take profit if you are already happy since a profit is a profit. I’m sure you will feel sorry once the price go down and missed the opportunity to sell while you can. I believe you really do a good decision for selling part of your holdings just to secure profit because you can always buy back anytime and have same amount of money without loss but you can’t sell without once the price pull back.Securing some profit while maintaining part of your investment is the right choice if you are confused on what to do next. You don’t need to become greedy just get the most profit because huge loss still in play once the trend reversed. You should always consider a wild card of possible huge in your investment if you want to become fruitful on crypto trading.",

But you must remember that this is your money, and we, in this forum, would naturally have different opinions about the topic, so this might even confuse you on what to do with it. If you think your profit is already enough for you, go ahead and sell it all - and perhaps leave 0.01 for future purposes - and be done with it. But if you can still wait a little longer and can spend a little more, the obvious choice is to hodl and DCA even more.",

But from your post it shows you’re in for quick gain and holding won’t be easy for someone like you. If you really want those 20% gain in short span then gambling on those Altcoin would be your best shot but be wary some of those coins that are already down could remain like that.

I am not sure if the altcoins that you are investing in right now will be reaching a higher price in the next bullrun again or not. From my previous experience, not all top altcoins will continue to rise up and reach or pass the previous ATH although they are the top coins. For, many new coins will be rising up with recent classification and hype. But, if this has been your choice, it is up to you. You may be ready for the risks that you will face.

For, this current bearish ear still provides me a low price. This will be much better to invest again in Bitcoin, as long as we have the target at least until the next bullrun, this will be much more profitable.But once more, you are the one who has the right to do the most appropriate thing.
