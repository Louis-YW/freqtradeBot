  "content": "Back in early 2020, Panini came out with their line of 2019 National Treasures Blockchain CardsThese cards came as physical cards and an \"NFT\".They had 10 rounds of 10 cards each to kick it off.Got an email the other day stating I had been gifted a similar NFT from PaniniThe email looked legit and confirmed with another collector they had received the same thing.The link does \"appear\" good:   https://url7500.paniniamerica.net/ls/click?upn=  So I logged in directly to the website and was no longer able to see/find my 1 card that I had won from the auctions.Well... looks like now they want to you to do KYC including facial recognition to \"unlock\" your \"crypto wallet\"/ crypto market services.And not only that.. they partnered with BitPay.... uggghh  This seems pretty intrusive for a sports card company considering their \"blockchain\" and \"NFTs\" are closed/non-transferable from what I know.Has anyone done the KYC??Can anyone else see their \"NFTs\" ??",
