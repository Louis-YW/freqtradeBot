This is a shady practice to conduct a business. I don't think anyone from this forum will buy your service after seeing such obvious fake marketing.",

      "body": "Why creating a new thread when you already have an announcement thread for your services. Irrespective of the year it was created and how old the thread could be,you could have updated it with this new service of yours or better still you bump it up rather than creating multiple announcement thread for same purpose you could be tagged a scammer or spammer for doing this and nobody would look your services already I noticed from the old announcement thread you made available some newbie account vouching for your services which I think is a no no sign here. That alone shows how desperate you are and could scare away prospective clients from patronising your services.Lastly, your stickers are way too much expensive than one could imagine. Do you not use escrow services for your business? As I think that is the only means I believe members here would want to deal for their own safety. Maybe you should have a look into it and put it into consideration.",

Maybe you should have a look into it and put it into consideration.slandering is easy but reality is not as you see, i use escrow also from lots of website, how did you think that i dont use escrow? in here i completed lots of works and all clients were happy with my works, so nothing to think for me for this simple lovely commentand for the other thread, you are right but i will delete that thread because service announcements are not active as here, and its not an announcement anymore.ife is good stop negativity bro  love yourself, you will understand you dont need to attack those threads to satisfy your ego.",
