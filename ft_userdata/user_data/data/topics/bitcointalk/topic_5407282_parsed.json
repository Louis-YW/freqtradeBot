The only problem is: that an account changing email and password can easily be misinterpreted as related to account trading, so make sure you are the sole owner of the account and have full enough evidence if something goes wrong.",

On the other hand, I have been reading through a bunch of cases where people only had an ETH address and apparently they did not succeed in recovering their account. My guess (not a known fact) is that it could be used in some exceptional cases, on a case by case basis, but not as part of the usual procedure, where only PGP and BTC signatures are explicitly mentioned.",

I signed a message to prove that I am the main owner, and in your case you can do the same as a persuasive step to convince people.I don't think there will be much of a problem if you change the account email, but it is true that some people may be suspicious about the possibility of the account changing hands.

So many people would have different views on the situation.Technically, yes you can change your email address anytime and there are no restrictions on changing it any number of times. However, since changing of email and sometimes password too suspects that account might have changed hands. So to be on the safe side, you can sign the message to prove the ownership of the account. You can only do if it is required by someone, not a compulsory thing with changing the email address of your profile.",

So many people would have different views on the situation.OP, note that while this might be true, 1) it probably shouldn't be suspicious, since changing e-mail addresses/passwords can often be done for mundane reasons like security or changing e-mail providers, and 2) it's way more suspicious when someone wakes up after a long period of inactivity and changes both their e-mail and password.  It doesn't look like you've come back from a long break, plus you've asked for help in this thread so I don't think anyone is going to give you a hard time because of an e-mail change.Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on July 23, 2022, 03:55:18 PMBut you can prove account ownership with password, signed message from your Bitcoin address. Did you sign any Bitcoin message with your address on Bitcointalk?That's a good point, and I'd definitely suggest OP stake an address if he hasn't already.  You never know when you're going to have to prove you own your account, and you don't want to make it to Hero or Legendary rank only to have some situation occur where everyone is asking you to sign a message only to realize that you never staked an address you can sign a message from.  I've seen that happen before.Quote from: decodx on July 22, 2022, 08:49:48 PMPublicly announcing the change of email address (before the change itself) might be a good idea so that you can always refer to that post if someone ever asks you about it (for instance, changing email is sometimes associated with account sale or even hacking). I'm not sure it's necessary (or even a good idea) to do so, but I remember doing exactly that in the past, although it might have been my password and not e-mail.  I just wanted to head off any suspicions at the pass, because I know there are members of the community who notice these things all the time, and I didn't want anyone to think I got hacked.",

Otherwise, I wouldn't worry much about it.Of course suspicion will not arise automatically without other supporting evidence [changes in posting patterns for example]. Usually changing password and changing e-mail at the same time will be identical to accounts that have been sold or changed hands, especially if the account has been inactive for a long time.If the account is hacked, sold or changed hands then they will not be able to prove the ownership of the account by signing the message from the bitcoin address [most cases] and they will probably complain that they forgot the wallet password, used exchange wallet, the device used was stolen or damaged and etc. Therefore, if the OP never sign message from a bitcoin address, then he should probably do that too. That's good advice for future account security.",
