I haven't read anything new except your admiration and idealization of Bitcoin.I don't know; I think that you need to be simpler and easier to relate to everything. Also, review the anatomy. People live well with one kidney until old age and even do business with the second one by selling it.",

Still looking for the weird link.Yes, you can live with a kidney, as you have two kidneys, and there is a possibility to live without them through kidney transplantation and dialysis.It is true that Bitcoin represents most of the real market capacity for cryptocurrencies, but in fact there are no real altcoins models that compete with Bitcoin.It is true that there are more than 26,324[1] cryptocurrencies, but they are all duplicates, hardforks, and tokens, so that cryptocurrencies worth studying are counted on the fingers of the hand, even these cryptos still have multiple shortcomings, and if they succeed in solving them, they may have a market capacity closer to Bitcoin. Forget about that, stablecoins may reach a stage where their market cap is greater than Bitcoin.[1] https://coinmarketcap.com/",

It is possible to live with only one functioning kidney.https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/onekidneyBut I do not see the point of your analogy. It is true that Bitcoin is one of the most well-known and widely used cryptocurrencies, but comparing it to a kidney seems a bit far-fetched. You could argue that Bitcoin's role in the cryptocurrency world is comparable to a vital organ in the human body, however, the cryptocurrency space is diverse and constantly evolving. So while Bitcoin will probably always have a special place, that does not mean it is the only crucial element in the cryptocurrency world.",

Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency that is created and it plays a big role in the cryptocurrency space for sure, its also the most popular cryptocurrency out there, I mean if we are going to delete Bitcoin these days probably this cryptocurrency could still function I mean other blue chips alternative token are already establish it self, like, for example, we have the Ethereum token, there was a huge gap on Ethereum and Bitcoin not still Ethereum was the closes cryptocurrency to Bitcoin even though it has a different purpose and structure to Bitcoin it still able to reach the market price of thousands of dollars in the market. So I think even if bitcoin was deleted at this moment I think Ethereum could easily take over the spot that bitcoin has.",

      "body": "Yea, this is obviously your perception about Bitcoin, but I believe if any Bitcoiner is asked to write a good comprehensive essay about Bitcoin with the use of some metaphorical words, then some people would say that Bitcoin is the leg of all crypto, while some would say it's the heart, some would say it's the brain, and some would say it's the eye, etc. (name them). In that situation, I would say that Bitcoin is the eye of all cryptocurrency because the eye is like the wind of the human body; where one is blind, they can't see anything, and imagine if Bitcoin fails today. That means all cryptocurrencies will crash because Bitcoin is what is holding the market together with the highest trading volume.I would not go with the kidney, perhaps am not saying you are wrong. The reason is that in the medical field, kidneys can be transplanted through surgery, but if you go blind today, my eye cannot be replaced with yours. So is Bitcoin. If anything happens today to Bitcoin, which Altcoin do you think can take the lead? Is it Ethereum or BNB? I don't think it will work.JMO",

Regardless of their assumptions and mindset about bitcoin, it is inseparable from the technology it has brought to the financial system.

I am sure that some of what we call shitcoins are going to coexist with Bitcoin in the future, and Ethereum has all the look of being one of them. I don't think it's going to be more than a dozen or two, which counting that there are more than 26,000 and growing, plus the upcoming implementation of CBDCs that will compete with an advantage in that market, means that a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money.For me Bitcoin is still the best today and I see no reason for this to change in the near future, we can call it kidney, heart or whatever, but I also believe that the future will be different from how Satoshi imagined it in the white paper: more a store of value than a P2P cash.",
