They paid little or nothing at all. Compared to airdrops, this is better in terms of learning. When you take the test, you begin to understand how it works. But it also takes longer than an airdrop.",

I heard this from a friend and he claimed he got better results compare to airdrops and bounties.I can definitely say that participation in test networks sometimes gives a good profit. But you need to understand that not all the testnets will eventually be paid, as the team may not reach the final stage of the project or simply get greedy without paying the reward. But given the fact that it is not difficult to pass the testnet, you need to participate and perhaps the reward will find you.",

Remember that testnet campaign was also pretty much the same like bounties or airdrop. The reward was also actually depend on the so many factors and this is also depend with your luck. It's not so many projects were always need participants to test their network. The only thing that you must remember if test net participant was also pretty much the same like airdrop.

I don't think there's any really profitable projects at the moment, so be careful with things like this.",

It's worth a try if you have the time and want to mess with them.Also, when you deal with testnets, you have the opportunity to get to know the projects closely. I think this is very important.

It's just so simple how you promote new projects by working through bounty hunting. You just need to test new projects on before their launch. So if everything goes well, you might get some rewards. And the reward is similar to a bounty payment in that some pay very well while others pay very little. But remember, there are also scammers, so before testing or joining testnet, remember to create a new account separately. Remember to follow all the instructions to complete the testnet task. As a free earner, I think you should explore all the free earning opportunities like airdrop, bounty, and testnet as well. It's my opinion, others might be different. Thank you.",

I heard this from a friend and he claimed he got better results compare to airdrops and bounties.Most testnets bring nothing, especially those that do not use real liquidity. So, if you want to earn on testnet, get ready to realize the fact that 90% of actions in testnet will have no effect, and the remaining 10% will have to wait for some time, because after the end of testnet it may take several months before the main network is launched and tokens, which were given to you as a reward, will be presented on some exchange.",

There are a lot of testnet projects going on, it is true that the reward depends on many factors and not all of them are as rewarding as we think but if so, then those rewards are worth it and give you well-deserved profits. Unlike bounty campaigns, the tokens received are mostly useless and full of rubbish. Participating in the testnet also requires prior research and project selection, you can't just choose randomly and say they don't pay you. Not to mention testnet will help you to have more skills and knowledge than you participating in airdrop, bounty campaigns becoming spammers.",

I also started searching recently and wanted to try them out, I see people talking about testnet as well as retroactively of 2 recent famous projects, SUI and APTOS. They say the chances of getting the bonus are very high. Can you please share some telegram groups you are following to do testnet. To be honest, I am also looking for them to get started with testnet.",
