Previously they've been doing 2-3x load for silvers, so popcorn's out.You always have the risk the QR somehow can't claim the BTC. History has shown that you cannot set it to 0. Agree for Casascius close to 0 but still. I will say 1 BTC on a coin not equal to 1 BTC in a wallet you control. If you are very rich, you can better ignore that risk. But if I were to buy 10 BTC coin, it is not a risk I could ignore. So would not pay load.",
