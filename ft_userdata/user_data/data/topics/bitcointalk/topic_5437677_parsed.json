  "content": "So I was day trading on Huobi exchange today and I come across a new update from the exchange with this beautiful information, I believe this is strictly for the new Bitcoin adopters The image above is from Huobi exchange, it shows that now matter how good a new innovation is, the old ones won't want to see it prevail, they will ridicule it to the core, do not be fooled, technology is advancing and Bitcoin is simply the most reliable better digital currency and a big headache for the banks. Stay away from any Bitcoin FUD and always remember that Bitcoin has faced death so many times and still prevails, this is beyond stoppable for the haters now, the only thing they are capable of is the CBDC and FUDs.",

I have stayed away from funds ever since I got into Bitcoin,  this is because I was already experienced in the way competitors work on the mindset of their potential clients by discrediting newer and effective innovations. Fuds have always been that way and only the gullible can be deceived by such comments, at least I know enough to decide which is bad and which is acceptable. And to that point Bitcoin is the best form of the store of value and a hedge over inflation.",

But in as much as a beginner has made up their mind to learn more about bitcoin, they shouldn’t be discouraged by the negative sayings about bitcoin but rather leverage on how to be better and productive in what they stand to gain about bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market. We are in a competitive age, so fake and unreliable facts will be the words of the fellow competitor vying to make their same business better as them, which they also want to prevail amongst others.",

The downtrodden (coming down of suffering in the bear markets) of bitcoin is to favour some investors then the bull as well is also to benefit some investors, but the bull is the best in the crypto investment. Bitcoin investment should be made to the age of +18 so that they bear the risk in it.",

Bitcoin will always rise, just try to maximize its trend if you’re a long term player, there’s also an opportunity during the FUD, just continue to look for the perfect timing.",

There are numerous false statements made by people who were into computers like Bill Gates, who said in 1994: \"I see little commercial potential for the internet for the next 10 years.\"If someone familiar with computers and the Internet, who was programming in the 70s, so he had decades of experience, could be so wrong, so can be any of the current so called \"financial experts.\"What amazes me is that people trust Buffet and Munger on this when these people have never been interested in tech stocks. They're mentally stuck in the 20th century and completely missed the rise of Google, Facebook and Amazon. Now they suddenly have an opinion on the market they don't understand and don't participate in.",

Actually almost everyone knows about bitcoin. But where blinded on what media is showing. Because most media news will only make a headline when someone got hacked on bitcoin, scammed, lost because of theft, bankruptcy, in short bad publicity. Misinformation is the problem.On the other hand, many are actually bullish to bitcoin but become disappointed when faced security compromised, hacking/stolen, phished, etc.Investing bitcoin is not just having or buying them but having full security, safe device and good practice of keeping them. These should be taught not just \"you will be rich and financially literate when you invest long term in bitcoin\"",
