I am curious how they did it while there are a lot of reputed bounty managers waiting for jobs, and there is a lot of competition as well. I believe those projects are scams who doesn't care about reputations. Having multiple accounts is not bad if they do not violate any rules and don't cheat. I didn't find one of them cheating on campaigns. But, since they broke the ban evading rules, You may report them for ban evading.",

I don't know what happened, but I guess that they deliberately made a fake project and made their campaign.",

They know the industry more than the high rank members like us. They are working in the field and the work makes them experience which makes it easier to negotiate but it will be always better for project manager to hire a reputable member when they are sending their token or any coin that is in their budget for the campaign. Manager manage the campaign and escrow takes care of the payment.",

But using such low reputation accounts, when they launch bounties in this way, they do the work by paying them low fees. So these projects always want to run their bounty campaign in this forum at low cost, so instead of professional work they get many cheaters who do different types of fraud in their campaign.",

A few weeks back, I was contacted by a project to run their bounty campaign here. When I sent them pricing, they asked me whether I can accept their token as payment lol. I said no and guess what, the next day I found they hired a Jr Member camp[aign manager. You cxan hire such campaign manager with your iwn token and a lot of projects are happy with paying no money lol.",
