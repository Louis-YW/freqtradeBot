Because most newbie still never understand much about crypto like dat and we go need this sub thread so we too fit contribute small as i suppose say no be all talk go be about crypto for the sub thread  if not most newbie go just deh spam anyhow for the board and not only restricted to newbies alone on the spamming issue.",

Unless una want to begin create division here because that's one go make every o man go dey chat for him own language wey no go make sense at all. We say Naija na one indivisible nation make we show de example even here too no b to dey divide the platform. Make we use Pidgin here make no body create any other dialect speaking board for here. Make we leave am for the Pidgin wey we dey speak here.I no mean to dispute any body o. Na just my own opinion as e be. Make una reason with me.My own na just suggestion and is not mandatory to implement it... Make I use the forum as example for you, why be say as the forum dey we get local board for different languages? Why they no talk say since na bitcoin and cryptocurrency all of us they talk about, e no need to get local board, and as people they post for local board, they no dey post for other sections wey they speak English? If we have sub thread for each language, e no mean say people no go still dey post with English or pigin for normal thread wey people create. As we don get board e no go too make sense say na only English and pigin we go still dey speak alone, pigin no be our official language and no be our local language.",
