  "content": "Hello @everyone! I'm very curious for your reasons, why you've signed up at Bitcointalk, created an Account here and are an active member of Bitcointalk by writing content regularly. Previously, I have been active a little bit in Crypto forums to do my own research, share my research and ask questions but after a short time, I was a bit disappointed of most Crypto forum members because many replies haven't been useful at all. Let me explain some examples: CryptotalkCryptotalk was a very active forum where many members made contributions but most of it has been spam, probably due to Cryptotalk incentivizing posts. Last year, posts stopped to be incentivized and suddenly, no one wrote posts anymore. I just wondered why my new topics didn’t get any replies anymore. Cryptotalk is dead now. Even when it was active, most replies were of very low quality. Very disappointing. AltcoinstalksAltcoinstalks is very different from Cryptotalk as it's an independent forum, similar like Bitcointalk. I have presented quite a few researches on Altcoinstalk, but discussions haven’t been very insightful but more insightful compared to Cryptotalk, of course. Biggest disadvantage from Altcoinstalks: Activity has been very low and for many topics only few replies have been left. Very big issue of Altcoinstalk as well: it is focused on Altcoins and many useless Altcoins such like Tron or Ripple are shilled. Criticism of such coins is bashed. Not a good showing to push such fraudulent coins. Quite contrary to Cryptotalk and Altcoinstalks, my research often led me to Bitcointalk on different topics, where I always found helpful information. Most likely, it is due to many coders being active here on Bitcointalk and as we know, coders have a fantastic knowledge about Bitcoin. But even more important is to explain it in an understandable way to normal people, similar to Andreas Antonopoulos, who’s a very experienced Computer Scientist and can explain complicated topics very well, to make it easier to understand for normal people like us. I haven't created an Account on Bitcointalk until recently, because I was very busy but after reading more on Bitcointalk, I decided to sign up here. Content is very insightful on Bitcointalk, where I have found comments made by Satoshi, historical content summarized by xtraelv and also topics from fillippone were very helpful for me. I also want to emphasize our active coders on Bitcoin Technical Discussion explaining difficult content in an easy way for normal people. I can say it's been a good decision to sign up on Bitcointalk and will continue to look up interesting content here, ask questions or share my research. If you want to share your reasons, - why your decision to be active here was in favor of Bitcointalk or - how you detected Bitcointalk, feel free to explain here. I’m looking forward for your responses.  Greetings from BangkokPhu",

International contributions on Cryptotalk have stopped almost completely but Russian replies are still very active, I don't know why. I don't want to make prejudgement against Cryptotalk and I'm sorry if my claims are wrong but it really looks like it is run by shady people.",

I believe it was due to stopping incentivized posts but I don't know. I've never signed up at YoBit, so I also don't know how it worked to get incentivized. I didn't see any announcement, too.

All users on this forum have specific reasons joining this forum, such as adding insight, adding friends, marketing purposes and because the airdrop requires them to register for this forum. Apart from that Bitcointalk can also be a place to make money, most of the users who are here cannot be separated from the signature campaign on their profile.It is undeniable, money is the main attraction for someone to join here. Of course there is reciprocity as well, companies related to Cryptocurrency will be assisted in promotions as a result of this forum having very active discussions. This forum is very coordinated, there are rules that users who have joined here cannot violate. Such as spamming, copying and pasting posts from other users or other sources from the internet and making posts off topic. All general rules are attached here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0.This is what differentiates Bitcointalk from other forums. In Cryptotalk and Altcoinstalks the discussion is less in-depth, this is a consideration for companies, so they are less interested in promoting their business there.",

Me being active in the forum is because of the fact that you learn here. Well, Youtube videos also helped me, but reading some of the opinions here really helped me a lot.

Also the fact that most of the reputable players that helped Bitcoin and crypto are here such as Satoshi, Hal, Sirius etc. etc. is one of my reasons as well.How did I detected or know Bitcointalk?
