I also think women are typically more financially conservative/smart when it comes to saving money.¬† I've gathered this from years of working in finance.",

Even at work, I know 4 girls already that are so into gambling, especially sports betting, and they're good at it. The liberty of recent times that women received allow them to engage in what used to be 'guy only' things and that includes gambling. I guess you are just not exposed to a setting wherein women are openly gambling hence your conclusion that it is a guy thing.",

      "body": "It would have been safe to say that about 60-70 years ago. It‚Äôs no secret that men gamble way more than women and that is due to the fact that in the ancient times, women mainly tended to the home while the men worked and had time for a drink or two and a game with friends before heading home for the day.It probably was also frowned at by society when women wanted to do anything fun for themselves that didn‚Äôt entail looking after the home. The discrimination that went on in the past has now led to the wide gap between males and females who gamble. Times have now changed and women could literally do anything they wanted. It‚Äôs now not a rare sight seeing a woman gamble but you wouldn‚Äôt expect the number of women who gamble to suddenly become comparable with that of the men any time soon.",

I also think women are typically more financially conservative/smart when it comes to saving money.¬† I've gathered this from years of working in finance.I agree with your opinion. 100%. Women are conservative with anything that has to do with risks especially if the said activity is outside their control. I'd say that it can be attributed to the upbringing - most parents are often inclined not to take chances with girls and they end up growing with such mentality. If it involves too much risk or has uncertainty, they wouldn't want to touch it. It's not just in gambling but I've seen this happen in other facet of life like investment, risky ventures, etc.",

Today we have lots of women with gambling experience than many guys out there.And from what I observe, I haven't heard or seen a single female gambling addicts it we have a lot of male gambling addicts which means women are more self controlling and responsible as gamblers. The point flew across your head buddy. OP is asking us if there's something about us males that makes us gamble on a more personal level than females, seeing as we take it competitively sometimes and most of the gambling addiction cases fall in the laps of males. Sure people are now more than ever able to do whatever the fuck they want without gender stereotypes pulling them down, but the question is why of all genders do males take this thing on a more personal level. As for OP's question, speaking for all males here, I think the reason is because we're hardwired to take things on a competitive level, life for a male even in today's standards is a never-ending competition with either other people, or yourself. With that in mind, males will take things seriously regardless of how mundane it may look from an outside perspective, which leads them to fall in situations like these where they don't even need to succumb to had they thought on a level-headed mindset.",

Women rarely have the time for such activities since they prioritise maintaining their physical appearance and engaging in social activities, and they have low risk tolerance. Because of the responsibility to provide for their families, men are more likely than women to engage in gambling, become hooked to it, and become gambling addicts. Even though there are many different types of gambling, I believe that the fact that so few women are interested in sports may be the reason why so few of them gamble. Sports gambling is the most popular type of gambling, and because so few women are sports enthusiasts, so few of them gamble and very few of them develop gambling addictions.",
