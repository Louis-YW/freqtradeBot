The guy is surely very good on sport analysis and scouting on value bets offered by a sportsbook. I doubt that he is the guy who compared odds since that is time consuming while the user is obviously show an impatient characteristics by making an all in bets. Sportsbet is really profitable and anyone can dominate it since there’s a parlay that amplify the profit for multiple pick bets. A good sports analyzer can perfectly predict a 5 or more leg parlay bets. He is legend.",

I was aware that it can be done but what strategy or skills an individual needs to be able to do it? I went into browsing mode as I have done earlier and found out the skills needed to get to the peak of sports betting. Here are my five steps to make your sports betting profitable.Turning $1000 to a huge amount of money is just by luck. Even if care is not taken and the punter increases his stakes and continue to bet, he may lose all the money won back to the gambling site. Quote from: elevates on June 14, 2023, 01:31:21 PM1. The most important step is to Research and analyzes before placing your bets: It is imperative that you gather relevant information about teams, players, statistics, and recent performances. This information would enable you to make more informed decisions.In sport betting, the lower the odds after analysis as usual, because likely the big teams would win. Yet it is luck if the big team or the team that you go for wins. Quote from: elevates on June 14, 2023, 01:31:21 PM4. Comparing odds from different betting platforms: This is one of the rarest situations. There are instances when betting platforms may offer varying odds for the same event. The best practice is to always compare odds across multiple platforms, which gives you the opportunity to find the best value and maximize your potential returns.The odds are usually always varies, but similar and closer. New betting sites like to make their odds a bit higher. Quote from: elevates on June 14, 2023, 01:31:21 PMWhat do you think?Not only about how good a punter is in analysing matches to be played, he should know that gambling is luck generally. Obviously we know this when underdog would win strong teams.Use only the amount of money that you can afford to lose to gamble than to be thinking of turning $1000 to a bigger amount.",

They just go on with their gambling activities based on their previous knowledge not realizing that a single player is capable of changing the fact of a game, while some of them still go with the idea that gambling is purely a game of luck and if them trying to improve their knowledge in it is only a waste of time.If a wise bettor can take their time to analyze and figure out how to maximize their winnings rather than them diving into their account to foolishly place a bet on a game that they know nothing or little about, they would be able to realised more profits than they already do.",

Remember that sports betting does require patience, discipline, and dedication to make it profitable.What do you think?Yes, it is the right method. Sports games always require accurate analysis and deep understanding. If you guess based on feeling, then that's a big mistake. In my opinion there is no luck in sports games, they need data analysis, even if there is luck, it is only a little.Even though I know this method, but if my favorite sports club is playing, I can no longer see the data, I always support my favorite team. That's the wrong thing to do, but I do it a lot. Another mistake I often make is when I've won a lot, I'll go back to playing carelessly, no longer using analysis, I'm just guessing and in the end of course the previous win is lost.Maybe I know how to win, but often I forget when I should stop. If I have been controlled by my emotions, then there is no more win",

If they are going to take that journey I think it will take time.  Hey, I get by just putting my money to the top dogs every time.Based on my understanding, a parlay is a type of sports betting where you combine two or more bets into a single wager. However, this can be a risky move, as if one of the bets fails to win, the entire parlay bet is lost. This could result in a significant financial loss, or, alternatively, you could win a substantial payout if all the bets are successful. While I do think that calculated risk-taking can be a valuable approach, my focus is on achieving positive outcomes with moderate risk. Therefore, I do not necessarily agree with your specific idea or strategy.",

I've seen one sportsbook offering 1.45 odds once on a market that I was about to bet then that same market is 1.70 on the next sportsbook.

There's no assurance ofcourse, with the winning team or fighter in every sport. Gamblers can jist make speculations or guesses based on previous matches or fights but that won't guarantee things.

This information would enable you to make more informed decisions.I think this information about a sport or team can be gotten if you dedicate time to watch games in that particular sport. Watching reviews of past games will also be a good platform to get information about the clubs. Subscribing to some sports newspapers, newsletter and magazines could also be a good source of data.

In the end, this can give you an edge when making predictions.I wouldn't agree that one needs to be highly proficient in some sports to be successful. Basic or average knowledge about a particular sport could serve the purpose of gambling. But I agree that focusing on a few sports will promote mastery and proficiency. Quote5. Take a systematic approach: Avoid pursuing losses by sticking to a specified plan or method. Discipline in your betting approach and it does improve your long-term prospects of winning.Gambling what you can afford to lose and having a gambling budget is key to every gambler. If you have a gambling plan you will easily avoid the temptation of chasing losses. I also want to add that sometimes luck also plays an important role in gambling because knowledge and skills might not lead to winning.",

When I started gambling, it was with sports, and my friend did all the analyzing, and they would just give me what's called a \"booking number or code.\" I will just enter it and stake the amount I wish to; it took me a while to really learn how to analyze sports games and how to diversify while betting on a particular club. For some casinos that allow one to choose different options, you can really give different winning options to a club, but some betting platforms don't allow one to stake more than one option. For example, if you predict that Chelsea will win Manchester City in a match, you can still stake another option that Manchester City can win Chelsea, but there are some platforms where, after you stake on your first choice or options, you can not diversify.",
