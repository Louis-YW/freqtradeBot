They will just pocket the shipping fee and the buyer will be expecting the package not knowing that he/her has been scammed. I would really love to have the Alienware laptop someday.",

I can prove that I was recently scammed out of $400. And that fact that it means nothing to you also shows why they should pay that to the escrow as well so that you get full pymt once they have it.",
