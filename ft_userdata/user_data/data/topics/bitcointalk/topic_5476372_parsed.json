  "content": "With everyone concerned about fees and stuck transactions no wonder a lot of fake accelerators are spamming the net with their fake offers.One of them:janjdn Quotehttps://whois.domaintools.com/btcaccelerator.info15 days oldCreated on 2023-11-1815 days old domain, yahoo pages design, lack of any information, lack of proof they own a mining pool and further more a stupid fee that makes absolutely no sense and no sane miner would even promote such a thing:It makes no sense for a miner to charge you $47 to include your tx in 5 hours and $25 in 6 hours because he doesn't know what the fees will be like in the future, and that's why the every single legit service that offers paid acceleration services is calculating with a large margin what they take for the next block!If fees skyrocket in 12 hours why would a miner let your acceleration worth $17 when maybe the minimum tx will carry $30? But the stupidity doesn't end here, the \"calculator\" is giving some quotes that are truly laughable, since obviously they don't check the size of what you submit:They claim to accelerate in the next 5 hours this tx for 47.70 USD, https://mempool.space/tx/8bd46c9b71b6646bf2f6397a9c3377970539885c6c01af6c49fd07787aa1014dA ‎57.11 kvB!!! 1735 outputs!!! 7.76 sat/vB current fee for 47.70!This at a time when a tx 20% smaller paid $1600 to barely make it in the next block.Stay away from this scam!",

Very lazy to do it rightly.

Lmao.With instant being between instant and one hour, with just yesterday a block taking more than 70 minutes to be mined you can see why only a noob or a scammer will use time instead of blocks when advertising this.Quote from: Charles-Tim on December 03, 2023, 12:42:28 PMPeople said there is no evidence that they are scam, but definitely they are scam, including the here one that you have justed posted here. They are all scam.I just hate this whole thing that is right now spreading though the forum where you must have complete evidence and there must be a victim who will dox himself, prove ownership of funds, prove the funds where received by the scammer and before anyone would have the right to accuse that guy must also KYC himself and send a sperm and blood sample to the jurors.We've reached a a point where someone trying to sell a bridge from Cape Town to Tokyo for 2 BTC is not a scammer till somebody actually buys it!",

The only free accelerator that I know is ViaBTC. Paid accelerators are demanding for too much money, it is good to avoid paid accelerators. I do not want to know if they are legit or not legit.",

Lmao.Hahaha...That's insane, well on another thought, some people would be fooled into paying for this service, especially those who had mistakenly used a low fee and are expecting a somewhat big amount of money. These are the people who do not know much about Bitcoin, it's always saddening.This style is not new but more packaged, it's we who should be on the look for something like this to guide against it. If people could be informed always, such antics would have gone extinct.",
