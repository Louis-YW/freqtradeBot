However, he has made the abuse in other campaign in the past. In that case, JeWay really deserve to be kicked out from the campaign. JeWay was only active in the Gambling Discussion board since last month, and he hasn't shown any contribution to the forum. Moreover, he is using his alts account to take the benefits from the signature campaign here.

If managers don't want to hire spammers or users who break the rules, then they shouldn't hire cheaters either.Yes, according to your evidence, he participated in bounty campaigns with multiple accounts, and that is definitely cheating. The important thing is that the cheater is detected and that the bounty manager is aware of the facts. Now it is up to the bounty manager whether he wants to keep such members in his campaign or not. Many bounty managers decide on each participant on an individual basis, regardless of negative tags. And that's okay. Because sometimes trust scores, even from DT members, can be unfounded or unfair, so it is better for each manager to decide what works best for his campaign. BTW, since the suspected members did not comment or try to explain their side of the story, I left a few negatives on their accounts as well.",

If someone doesn't have any problem attaching their brand to a neg tagged user, that's their choice.Nice, you're right. But let's take a look at one of the suggestions on signature guidelines, it would be great for every manager to consider. So we don't have to worry too much about that because the campaign manager also has a perspective on why participants are accepted or not on a case by case basis. But if the tag was clearly caused by cheats in some of the previous campaigns, then accepting it in the campaign is a bad idea.Quote from: hilariousandco on November 17, 2016, 12:46:01 PM• Consider not accepting users with negative feedback. It never looks good when users have negative feedback and 99% of the time the feedback is there for a good reason, but if you want to take this on a case by case basis then that's down to you.Quote from: Little Mouse on July 18, 2022, 03:20:04 PMDid you tag them because you want them to be kicked out from the campaign?Nope, it's a bad idea and I've never thought of anything like that.Quote from: Little Mouse on July 18, 2022, 03:20:04 PMI'm pretty much sure your motive was to expose them as alt only. You feedback is still valid to expose them as alt. You don't need to be worried anymore I think.You're right, the motive is to find more cheater and tell managers that they shouldn't work with cheater. My question is only because there are rules stating prohibition, otherwise what's the point of rules?50 merit, for what?  Quote from: JeromeTash on July 18, 2022, 08:07:35 PMI have seen a couple of managers (not 1xbit) accept certain users with negative rep.Remember, it is at their discretion on a case by case basis.

This is the big of farmers accounts, so I think they all deserve a negative tag now.Will you decide the fate of 16 accounts for a transactions outside of the forum? Do you know that some bounty hunters buy from other bounty hunters after distribution? Are you also aware that some bounty managers also buy shitcoins from hunters? All of this occurs outside of the forum. Not saying same thing happened here but this COULD be the case in the accounts below, I believe that painting red is overkill! I expected to see a bunch of newbies farming, but this is different. You might also want to slowdown buddy, you've been painting a lot lately.I will investigate this case further and provide feedback if I discover anything new.",

Some of the accounts are from the local Indonesian community and this is really sad for me to watch.I'm not against how you expose cheaters accounts, but tagging the 16 accounts above still requires clear evidence to avoid being off-target. Maybe you need to consider some reasons before tag them all because as one of the local Indonesian community, I am very sad to know that some of the above accounts are red tagged if it is not proven to be true. Give them a chance to explain the problem, so there's at least a pause before you stab ass all of them. This is my friendly request to you, while I appreciate your forum contribution. Thank you.",
