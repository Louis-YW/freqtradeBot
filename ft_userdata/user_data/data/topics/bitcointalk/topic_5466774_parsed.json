It has long been on the news and limelight of telegram running their own TON network for quite some years now and at last they achieved it. With their large traffic size of over 800 million users on monthly basis I think this would give them a good edge and stand on Crypto market as they already have a good utility value coupled with the fact that they just launched their own Crypto wallet. I further had to do some research and records findings of past occurrences and experience with telegram and it became pertinent that I ask these questions. I believe each telegram account holder would definitely have to create his or her own wallet possibly after an upgrade to update such features into the app. So far there have been a lot of nefarious act been done on telegram such as account cloning, account hacking and lots more and I ask what if in a situation where by one's account telegram account is hacked does that automatically grants the hacker access to the wallet? Because I believe the wallet is already built with that telegram account  irrespective of the fact that there is private key or phrase. Another question I have is this what if in the case of banning or blocking a telegram account, would the telegram team also block the wallet of the owner as well? I have to ask this because I became curious about this when I started doing my research into it. Another question I also have is this would the telegram wallet be some sorts of attached or linked to telegram username or ID of every telegram account holder?I believe we can discuss this here to knowing more and sharing ideas about this unfolding development because telegram itself has a huge number of Crypto enthusiast and I tell you there would definitely be lots of activities and engagements on telegram in the days coming and this would definitely increase lots of telegram scams and hacks which would warrant telegram account holders to strengthen their telegram security features.Your ideas are welcomed for further discussions.SOURCE",

The image above is as a result of trying to find relationship between bitcoin discussion and the thread reading what is on the section description, to me it doesn't connect but if am wrong you can correct me. Still on the telegram wallet I believe it will work as telegram future it to be because most conversation in this forum is done on telegram. Cryptocurrencies activities are most done using telegram. Adding to that I would love to have asked a question; like will telegram become decentralized? because anonymity is what we preach and some more questions but I will reserve the question for now.",

Because I believe the wallet is already built with that telegram account  irrespective of the fact that there is private key or phrase. As I was reading this post what came into my mind was the Vitalik account hack on X.  So OP your question eventually answered your query. Yes! With just a clone of the account it's an automatic access to the havker into the account wallet. Mind you it was just a clone on Vitalik sim number that's how the hackers got access.QuoteI believe we can discuss this here to knowing more and sharing ideas about this unfolding development because telegram itself has a huge number of Crypto enthusiast and I tell you there would definitely be lots of activities and engagements on telegram in the days coming and this would definitely increase lots of telegram scams and hacks which would warrant telegram account holders to strengthen their telegram security features.Your ideas are welcomed for further discussions.I can't find reasons to creates more and more wallets for myself right now and if I wanna create one it wouldn't be a telegram wallet. If scammers and hackers have usually had it easy hacking and cloning telegram users accounts of what difference will the security make now that a money wallet has been attached . I think telegram hacker might be throwing an in house party right now over this development.",

What wallet is this because telegram has a lot of wallet available on their blockchain since they have their own Blockchain called TON. I’m using Tonkeeper wallet long time ago to hold my tokens native to TON. I’m not what this kind of wallet but there’s a lot of wallet on TON network which is by telegram team.I made a few research and I believe the article is misleading. A branch on telegram network called Wallet recently announced to develop their own non custodial wallet on the network. You can find the project link here: http://wallet.tg/ton",

When an account has been hacked and the wallet will be lost. It's caused by telegram has not yet implemented protection for its wallet before but this time is quite different as telegram already put an option to add password when you are willing to log in into your wallet.

But I'd still prefer increasing their security first and filtering those scammers out there that had been targetting a lot of newbies in both Telegram and cryptocurrencies. Because it's not new to us that Telegram has been one of the go-to applications for ICO products and other start-up cryptocurrency projects. I have seen so many types of scams in that application and some of them are really inviting but thankfully I've had some bad experiences where I already learned my lessons.Anyway, congratulations to them and I wish this is not the end of the line.

This is that sort of thing but maybe I did not get it and maybe I am wrong and it will do a lot better.
