  "content": "Something that always strikes me is that people underestimate the impact of a decentralized world. Especially more vulnerable people that depend on society for ‘survival’. I get a lot of power to the people vibes while I’m not sure that a lot of people are ready for this.How I’m experiencing things today (Simplified) :- I pay more than 50% taxes —> I have no choice- unemployment is supported by basic incomeBasically I’m forced to share some wealth to keep society runningImagine now a decentralized society :- my connection with an employer will be direct and I will pay no taxes —> I have a choice- No support for unemployment. Maybe this will stimulate more people to work but will also create some issuesBasically stronger people will become stronger and people suffering will suffer more.Im sure Im cutting some corners here but the principle stays afloat. Won’t Bitcoin create more disbalance while a lot of people are claiming the opposite.",

I know people say the Darwinism will prevail and will choose only the stronger, smarter, etc, I know maxis says that people's weaponization is the way to protect private property etc, and many more arguments from a couple of maxis out there, but there is so much more beyond that, that I'm not sure I can imagine how a world could run in such a libertarian or even anarchist models of society. Subjects like health, education, protection of the ones with \"already\" little to no resources, etc.I mean, people has been being driven by socialists and capitalism and that developed a exploit mind set, a greedy mind set and a corruptible mind set that I don't know how could that ever be reverted.",

Won’t Bitcoin create more disbalance while a lot of people are claiming the opposite. It does not have to be this way. The problem with discussing all these things theoretically is that reality has many nuances that are not foreseen in theory. And there are theories that defend the opposite: that a world without state intervention would tend to equilibrium, instead of inequality, as you propose.For me in principle I would like a more decentralized world, with less regulations and less taxes, although I think some are necessary. But the trend in the world is the opposite and if you look at Bitcoin the same, people buy Bitcoin on sites like Coinbase, there are more and more KYC etc. so the decentralization of Bitcoin is very tiny, not to mention that if I hire you to do a job for me, I pay you in Bitcoin and we do not pay taxes, we are committing an illegality.So, leaving theory aside and thinking realistically, I believe that the decentralization brought by Bitcoin will be very limited.",

Maybe your numbers are correct, I don't doubt, but that's not what he said, about the 50% taxes.Where I live, there were some stats a couple years ago (now, I'm sure it's worse), that we only start making money for ourselves after the 7th month of the year. Until there, everything we earn is for taxes, so, I believe that it might be even more than 50% of taxes that we end up paying, globally speaking! And I live in the EU.",

Where did I say it all goes to unemployment support 😁 Our unemployment allowance is also a lot higher than the amount you mention : its about 1500€. Same story for pensions. When you know about only 40% of our population is active there will be a much bigger impact than 2%But in the end it doesnt matter. I have to pay 50% to society.

We all decide if we want to pay those taxes or not. If you leave digital fingerprints for monetary transactions, you could get caught and questioned. If you don't, the chances are significantly smaller.many countries have many tax loopholes. the main one is loans.so allow your forum pseudonym to loan(personal loan) your real life name a 0% interest with a 100 year repayment plan of £0.01 with no penalty for non-payment. as for Quote from: sbrys on July 13, 2022, 07:30:03 AMSomething that always strikes me is that people underestimate the impact of a decentralized world. Especially more vulnerable people that depend on society for ‘survival’. ....Basically stronger people will become stronger and people suffering will suffer more.very much sounds like you want the rich to get rich and the poor to just die offif you dont care for the poor. then yes expect some people to call you out on it.there are alot of anti-capitalists in bitcoin. as that was the whole point. to get away from elitismby the way capitalism is not where everyone gets rich.. thats the fantasy tail the rich tell poor people when rich ask the poor to hand over their money.capitalism is the myth that if you work harder and scrub them toilets or flip those bugers better you too can be a king of a kingdom one day.. do you think clintons or trump ever scrubbed a toilet or flipped a burger or done manual labour ever in their life.. capitalsim is the fairy tale dream of hope without promise. capitalism is actually in simple terms.. the bigger character comes first. literally. and the smallest character . comes last",

Especially more vulnerable people that depend on society for ‘survival’. I don’t think decentralization will spread over to any aspect of society, you will still need government services for most things: Healthcare.Police.Jurisdiction.Education.Military(no military only works, if no other countries has it, but if one country starts building militaries again, the others have to do it too, or they can be conquered easily).Social services.Basically everything the government is now doing too.Except if they loose their monopoly over money, it could actually make societies more strong again and where decentralization really brings in huge benefits.Quote from: sbrys on July 13, 2022, 07:30:03 AM- my connection with an employer will be direct and I will pay no taxes —> I have a choiceIt’s the same now in most countries, your employer will probably deduct taxes beforehand and you will only get the taxed amount payed out. Just like now, because otherwise the state would start closing their business. The difference with decentralized money will be: No one can confiscate your already taxed money, or make it worthless over time. This is huge, if people had this in the past, the whole course of history would probably have been different.Quote from: sbrys on July 13, 2022, 07:30:03 AM- No support for unemployment. Maybe this will stimulate more people to work but will also create some issuesThey will tax people, there’s a saying: only two things are certain, taxes and death. Even if the state looses their power temporarily and a vacuum forms, after some time a new state will probably form again. We can’t escape this.",
