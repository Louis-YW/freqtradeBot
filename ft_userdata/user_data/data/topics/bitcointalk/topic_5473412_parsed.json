OP is tricky in promoting the website game but redirects it to 4RABET aviator game which is very similar to 1xBET. These are the kind of crypto casinos that didn't create their ANN thread in the forum but are bold enough to spam.",

Have you tried playing Aviator on Becric, or do you have other recommendations?Using a 3rd party provider for a crash game is never the best platform to choose. Choose crash game that is probably fair so that you can verify fairness of each round. Follow the recommendations of @Yahoo since that 2 casino offers a probably fair crash games and already have a solid reputation here except for moneypot that is just acquired by new owner but the domain is one of the oldest crash game casino.Why will you choose 3rd party provider that you only rely on trust while you can use open source platform which you can guarantee that every bet is fair.",

I just discovered this game lately when I'm trying new casino sites that have a free spin promotion.I didn't open the game but I suspect they are only like a crash game. We know crash game right? They have different themes, but the best ones that fit for them are the space/sky ones or those who involved a rocket, and a plane because the goal of the game is to not get crashed. Other games actually has a demo but sometimes its availability can also depend on the platform.",

Where I saw that there were several comments that gave unfavorable statements and considered that this was a fraudulent aviator platform. And there are some people who complain because their accounts are blocked when making large withdrawals. Most of the comments there suggest to avoid and not play on the platform.And here I just want to question, how do you respond to these negative comments? And how do you convince us to really think that this platform is really safe and has no indications of attempted fraud?I'm really waiting for your answer, to avoid my misunderstanding in responding to the aviaotr platform that you suggested.",

However, the important thing is to always be careful in choosing the gambling platform that we will visit and also in choosing the type of gambling that we want to play. Because of this popularity, there are many irresponsible parties who take advantage of this opportunity to reap large profits.",
