  "content": "Hey all!For the past year, there have been some news coming about quantum computing advancements, with the latest one being the Google's new chip Majorana 1, which uses 'state of matter'.I'm no expert, but whenever I see an advancement in quantum stuff, I often read people saying that everything else will be hacked a lot easier than bitcoin and I understand why.However I don't see why not to start and think about how to implement potential quantum resistant algorithms to be used within the BTC blockchain. I know some altcoins already have implemented some sort of quantum resistant algorithms. The only posts I saw about quantum stuff in the forum were from ~2012. If there are other topics relating this, please share them and I will close this in their favor",

It is because there is no quantum computer and yet advanced one that will exist for now (and estimated to 2030 or more) that will be a threat to bitcoin. Although they will later be produced but when the right time will come, bitcoin developers will do something that will make it impossible for the quantum computers not to access people's private keys. They still know that it is not yet necessary for such upgrade yet.",

If there are other topics relating this, please share them and I will close this in their favorBitcoin is an upgrade-able protocol. If developers believe that it's time to make an update that will change or improve the level of encryption that Bitcoin is already secured by (whether it be due to quantum threat or some other threat), and consensus agrees, Bitcoin will evolve. Quantum computing is not a threat to Bitcoin imo",

I'm a developer myself and I think a good feature could take 1+ year from idea to production. I wonder if there will be a need to migrate each address separately or there will be just a new type of addresses and users will have to manually move their satoshis",

If the quantum computer able to hack every known algorithm(so far) was to become a reality,I think it would first be in the hand of people with power (presidents, governments, military, other secret services) because it will cost a lot(money and knowledge) to make and not everyone can afford it.I just don't see how someone from the lets say middle class can invent it in their garage but who knows. I don't know what people with power would do first with quantum computers but I doubt it that it will be bitcoin hacking if we are still on fiat standard, but still some specific wallets could be targeted just to centralize bitcoin and end the fiat's biggest threat. Maybe another solution would be to transform all of the services(the power) to be public and everyone to be able to check and see how and what is going on.. but this might be just a dream since it will involve world peace, no wars, no corruption.Anyway I suspect private quantum computers are a bit more ahead than what is known publicly ( look at every other thing and it's the same AI, weapons, markets etc.. insiders)",
