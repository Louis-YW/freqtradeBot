With this, the responsibility falls on your shoulders in looking for the right websites for the information.Of course, everyone wants to profit at the end of the day. Bearing this in mind, you should also consider the things that are bound to happen, such as the incoming fork this 2024. While there may be no big news so far this 2023 that affects the price of crypto, be ready just in case something happens big. Always have some reserve cryptocurrency in order to at least maximize your profit in the end.",

From your tone, you want the bullish run I guess, but for the next person, there are expecting a bear market to enable them to purchase bitcoin at a cheaper rate. Being well aware that the bull market will come again. Saying we should lower our expectations not to be disappointed, is an incomplete statement for cryptocurrency users having known that different entities are in the market for different reasons which include; Taking profits to recover from losses such people have lots of expectations for the cryptocurrency market to go bullish and end up getting disappointed if it doesn't, which could mean that your article is referring to this group. Full-time Hodlers they're people who won't sell bitcoin this year even though the expectancy of the first-named gets even, the market gets an all-time high, they have no reason to be disappointed.Buying the dip Those that expect the market to go so low this year; buying bitcoin at a cheaper rate and waiting for the all-time high so that they'll cash out big.Even they're people that keep buying low or high regardless of the conditions.I think the expectations for the bitcoin market in 2023 are uncertain and not everybody has the same expectations for the market, we all differ and no need to bother about lowering or lifting our expectations about bitcoin this year. I expect bitcoin to continue striving, achieving its goal, and getting adopted by businesses and people alike. The goals of everyone will be achieved, whether a person wants profits or wishes to buy the dipper dip it's all good for the currency.",

This from history has been known to be followed by a bullrun and possibly, an ATH. Perhaps we might not have a bullrun for the year 2023 but, we might find price appreciating much more.Having too much expectations is just one way to getting disappointed but, it ain't much of a disappointment when your making profit except, for those whom must have taken loans to invest which remains a bad way for an investment and could lead to loses too.

During a bear market, it is best to reconsider your plans or, in some cases, reduce your ambitions for a while. Recognition of one's mistakes is a very wise decision; only those who do nothing are not mistaken, and self-righteousness does not always keep pace with the truth. You need to be confident, but being too confident can be dangerous.",

Normally the Bull Market is after the next halving, unless we call going from $16k to $30k a Bull Market. Another thing is that there are certain influencers who are predicting very high prices, even beating ATH this year but I think that, although this cycle does not have to repeat the previous ones, and so it is being seen, that we will beat ATH in 2023 is extremely unlikely.
