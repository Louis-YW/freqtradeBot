      "body": "It's a 100% scam. Don't waste your time and assets on it.Gorki Network forked RChain's source code and initiated its promotion as a new blockchain, a claim that lacks veracity.https://i.postimg.cc/Xv2tQWFD/image.pngThe code has been in development since January 2017, funded entirely by RChain members and REV token holders. RChain, a US-based cooperative dedicated to developing a cryptocurrency smart contract platform, faced insolvency due to mismanagement before and during Ting Yang's presidency.In this challenging period, Ting Yang assured stakeholders that the project would endure beyond the cooperative's dissolution. She specifically pledged to safeguard the value of the crypto tokens (REV) designated for sponsoring RChain's source code development. https://youtube.com/watch?v=qe3azJWvnLghttps://i.postimg.cc/c1wjK2TY/Screenshot-from-2023-11-27-18-44-01.pngHowever, she undertook another project named Rhonix, registered an offshore company in Dubai (Rhonix Labs FZE) to evade liability, and failed to honor her commitments to REV holders and RChain members. This decision was made discreetly, behind closed doors, with only selected members and the development team being privy to the information. Notably, these individuals also secured RNXT tokens, the precursors to Gorki. Unfortunately, some individuals were deceived into losing their newly acquired RNXT tokens. Complaints and reports were submitted to the police by scam victims.https://i.postimg.cc/X7YWKsTJ/Screenshot-from-2023-11-28-05-21-05.pngAdditionally, Ting Yang's associates began banning cooperative contributing members from official RChain Telegram channels, further fueling outrage.https://i.postimg.cc/w3YgkzJs/tunkas-troll.pngRhonix Labs' Twitter account was suspended for violating Twitter/X rules.https://i.postimg.cc/P5g6SqFx/Screenshot-from-2023-11-28-05-00-02.pngAll of this led to a strong reaction from RChain members, culminating in the rebranding of Rhonix as Gorki Network. Outraged members established a Twitter account (@whorenixtrollop) to voice their concerns.Furthermore, Ting Yang took measures to conceal her face, signature, and the name of the offshore company from the project's website. Her involvement can still be proved by her linkedin profile.https://i.postimg.cc/c1wjK2TY/Screenshot-from-2023-11-27-18-44-01.pngI could go on talking about this for a long time.",

I will not dwell on your racist and mysogynistic proposals on telegram against our CEO. If this post is not deleted tomorrow I will demonstrate your bad faith point by point.People violently dislike your project and its CEO as a consequence of many of the reasons I stated. Your reply sounds like an ultimatum and a threat. It doesn't sound like you are demonstrating good faith.",
