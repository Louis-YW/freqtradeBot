  "content": "Today the world heard:Â  \"The U.S. does not support Taiwan's independence and has no intention of engaging in conflict with China.\"U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said this during a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing. Blinken also stressed that the United States does not seek a cold war and has no plans to change the Chinese system. In turn, Xi Jinping said that China respects U.S. interests and will not challenge Washington. The Chinese leader added that the United States should also respect China's position and not harm its legitimate rights and interests. Xi Jinping expressed hope that the U.S. will take a rational and pragmatic position on China.What does this mean? Even yesterday there was a very serious confrontation around Taiwan, today it is \"peace, friendship, respect\". There are two questions:1. Which country has become a bargaining chip? 2. What does the world expect in terms of economics ?3. Joke question: Don't you think that the capital of the country of the \"bargaining chip\" begins with the letter \"M\" ?",

The United States realized that it was not possible to frighten China with large-scale exercises and that the American military-industrial complex could not pull a proxy war on two fronts. You have to bend and flirt, but without much success - Blinken was received much worse in China than Bill Gates.",

But I don't think they are bargaining with each other, and there will be another pawn in place. Instead, why don't we think in a different way? If the US continues to wage war with China on all fronts, the US will not benefit, the one who suffers the most is no longer China. As for Taiwan, a distant water cannot put out the fire near it, whether the US continues to support Taiwan or not, it can't be stopped if China really wants to unify Taiwan. Even the US and EU are facing many difficulties in the Ukraine battlefield, so I don't think China will be afraid of the US to use anything to bargain.",

Joke question: Don't you think that the capital of the country of the \"bargaining chip\" begins with the letter \"M\" ? Does not want war but America is a country with a history of war engagements everywhere, funding, arms sales, etc. Am I exaggerating enough about it? now is a new era called the cold war, the same people behind it are trying to bring down other countries economies so that their own country's economy remains standing with a financial system that controls all other countries finances. I agree with the forced friendship title context because that's what happens when America wants something to control. Under Biden's leadership, the United States issued more inconsistent statements, for example yesterday they declared themselves competitors and the next day they declared friendship. Since when has Xi Jinping bowed to the US when it comes to economic development? well, there's a kind of fear inside the US white house environment. The United States is too afraid of China economic revival, even being challenged openly by the BRICS Alliance with the declaration of de-dollarization. The US response doesn't talk too much because it realizes that the country's economy is on the precipice which is at stake since it has defaulted on debt payments.",

They all wear the front appearance but certainly, they look after the future outcome if they continue the military drills all around. Both will still play the same game but all these friendship acts will be accepted after all they will be cooperating in building economic growth. US can not fight 2 wars at the same time and wars need Money. I don't see the end of the war in Ukraine still and they should proceed to talking about ending the Ukraine war while they are peace.",

In the end, both China and USA have such a tight economical relationship that it would be harmful for both of them if the political tensions affected the exportations and importations of all kinds of goods. Regardless what the USA says, I would bet they will continue to support Taiwan and harden their military bases and positions in Asia.

This is good for the world but very bad news for Taiwan independence because China will surely use this opportunity to oppressed this small piece of land.

Unfortunately China does not rule by fairness and openness - but by brute and incompetent force. It would be disastrous for China to try to take Taiwan and the world would likely wake up to the danger they pose, even worse than Russia, if such actions went ahead. China really screwed up Hong Kong after taking over, crippling it as a powerful financial hub, and this was their chance to prove that they were good leaders.",

Joke question: Don't you think that the capital of the country of the \"bargaining chip\" begins with the letter \"M\" ? I have no idea on this, what's M then?If the US is now saying that it does not support Taiwan independence, then this is indeed a very interesting turn in US-China relations. The issue of Taiwan brought these countries closer to a serious war. In the United States, the outcome of a military clash between these states was simulated on a computer, and it turned out that the United States was winning the war, but by a very small margin. We can say that both states as a result of the war between themselves will be drained of blood.So far, this is a reasonable move on the part of the United States to push back the threat of World War III. And this is not about weakness, as some here believe. The policy between the two big states should be wise, but the situation towards Taiwan may change in the future.Answering a \"joking question\" I agree that the capital of a country beginning with the letter \"M\", that is, Moscow can already be a bargaining chip here. It is much more profitable for China to stay closer to the US and the EU than to Russia. Part of the territory of Russia, which there has long been considered Chinese, because it previously belonged to China, China will still take away from the weakening Russia as a result of its war with Ukraine. At the same time, if China does not openly support Russia in this war, then Russia will lose it relatively quickly.",

China and the US are political, economic, and military competitors and competitors will always oppose each other. Both nations have an interest in Taiwan. Taiwan will always be a vassal state of China and America is not proposing its independence from China but the Island's autonomy. So Blinken was correct when he said that the US is not seeking Taiwan's independence. America might not be able to fight two proxy wars. China is a major beneficiary in the war between Russia and Ukraine. China enjoys high discounts for buying Russian products. China have also seen many consequences of war and might be scared that Taiwan can also receive the same support Ukraine is receiving. I know China and the US are core rivals but from both country's moves and comments, I don't think they want war. The economic consequences of the current war in Ukraine are enormous, the world will suffer recession if another war breaks out.",
