      "body": "Not familiar with the exchange or the seizing issues that it had but I can see both being true. The government did not get all their accounts so *some* money is being released.Same way other exchanges have exit scammed in the past. They pick 2 numbers say $75000 and $100000 I am using USD since I am in the US. The $100000 is what can be withdrawn in total, the $75000 is what they are pulling small withdraws from. Anything under $225 is pulled from the $75000 pool of cash so there are many small people posting that yes they can withdraw. The remaining $25000 out of the $100000 is for selected large withdraws so there will be discussions about how I got my $1500 out or your got your $2900 out and everything looks 'legit'.The pool of $10000000 that they had is now $9900000 and they run with that.....-Dave",

It would not surprise me if a third world business like Wazirx was indeed scamming/laundering money. Not to sounds ignorant but poorer countries are notoriously less disciplined when it comes to not scamming or stealing. But I am sure there are socio-economical reasons why people in those countries do that.What else can users do except sit and wait for something good to happen? All their clients money is in their hands. This is why I only make sure that my money is always out of reach of centralized third party members. Like Wazirx.",

      "body": "The moment an exchange says don't panic, funds are SAFU, is time to get out of there as fast as you can.Even if it doesn't go bankrupt, you don't lose a thing, but if it does...As for the main question, it might be just how MtGox managed to stay afloat when the Dwolla funds were freezer or when Mizuno stopped servicing them, it stayed afloat using third-party solutions but slowly it reached a point where it would have collapsed even without the hack. Anyhow this is pretty easy to check with so many users having an account here, you can ask some friend to show you the details of a successful withdrawal, in his bank statement he should have all the info, if the payment comes from a different source than in the past it means things have definitely changed, if it's the same account then there was nothing but a hiccup.Either way, stay away from an exchange that even its founders have problems identifying who actually owns and operates it!",

Unless the Indian government decides to close their offices and arrest the directors (which they can), you should be good with your holdings. Also they have got backing from Binance. Wazirx is a part of Binance. So CZ is very protective about the brand he had built. Unless Indian government decides to completely close down their business, you money should be safe.",

If Wazirx opens the withdrawals again, I hope that most of the funds and users there learns the lesson that we always keep on telling to everyone to don't store funds in exchanges.",

And you really believe that?Because as always, when shit hits the fan CZ is backtracking on all statements and starting his web of lies again..First thing first, he tells you to get your money out of WazirxNow, the real problem:Binance does not own any shares in Wazirx becausethe transaction was never completed despite him claiming on Twitter Now, give me one reason to trust CZ and one reason not to call him a lying piece of you know what!",
