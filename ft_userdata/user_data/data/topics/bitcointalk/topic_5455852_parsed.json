WorkAsPro is part of Ideaology.io, a company based in Dubai. The website is new and we are currently working on marketing it.Currently, it is possible to pay with the tokens IDEA, USDT, DAI, BNB, and BUSB on Polygon, and IDEA, USDT, DAI, BUSB, and MATIC on Binance, and other methods will be added soon. There are no fees other than this 8%, and if you pay in the native project currency (IDEA), there are 0% fees.Quote from: dkbit98 on June 11, 2023, 08:16:07 PMI never saw any crypto related Freelancing platform gaining more popularity and I think I saw all of them in last few years.Not saying WorkasPro won't make it, but I really don't see anything special that stands out here, unless there are some hidden cool advantages I can't see.Thanks for your comment. WorkAsPro has many advantages, including: the lowest fee among freelancing websites, and the use of a blockchain voting platform that prevents any manipulation of points and scores. The most transparent payment system with high security, various payment methods in fiat and Cryptocurrencies, and payment in IDEA bring the fee to 0%.Moreover, Ideaology.io, the owner of WAP, has been active in this market for over 3 years and has proven its skills and experience.",

Based on how some other freelancing marketplaces work, I am guessing WorkasPro does it similarly. They connect buyers and sellers. More precisely those looking for work and those buying a service. Payments go through escrow like competing marketplaces do it. If someone orders a service from you, the buyer pays the full amount into an escrow account which is a green light that you should begin your work. Once it's completed, you send it over, the buyer verifies the quality, and signals to the escrow to release the funds. There must surely be an arbitrator who can be called upon if one party has a complaint. If not, that is an essential point the platform should think about. But I wonder what mechanisms they have in place to prevent one party to collude with the escrow to cheat the other person involved in the exchange?",
