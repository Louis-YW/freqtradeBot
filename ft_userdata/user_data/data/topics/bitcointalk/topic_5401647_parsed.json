It was investigating binance exchange site caused by it was conducting ICO a few years ago. Im sure that SEC was always doing this kind of shit. Just ignore it. SEC was only looking for some money from binance. Binance can pay fine easily.

Please tell me more about how SEC works.No man, it's just a typical of SEC that was coming after years. SEC was also doing the same with another project in the crypto. They did know so well when the crypto project was conducting ico but SEC was attacking crypto right now",

Like there must be something going on before the investigation or SEC can just choose any project to investigate? Please tell me more about how SEC works.They've been doing this to almost every successful project so, this isn't surprising that BNB has taken into their attention but it's long overdue. It's just about being registered as a security or not. BNB can easily defend itself on this investigation, they've got all the resources and money to defend whatever they want to defend if the SEC asks so.",

      "body": "There is really nothing going on with it, it is just a regular thing and we shouldn't be shocked about it. I personally believe that SEC just saw that there is a good chance they could end up making some money from it, investigate it further, find any loopholes or problems there, and end up using that to extort money out of Binance saying they did something wrong.Binance will want to continue to work with USA, so they will pay it, to keep it silent and not create any issues and that way everyone wins. Remember the old USDT one? That was a hoax as well, USDT had a ton of problems but paid a small fee and got out without any damages to them at all.",

Or call it whatever you like, the thing is binance got the money to survive through all odds so relax its nothing to worry about.",

I think binance had a launchpad and I didn't see anyone complained about scam or any other thing. They probably sniffing around to find something to regulate on. All of that is showing of normal routine check and the much I can say is binance is hardly getting a negative review from users.",

Sec loves a good fud, and they only not done it for the first time and with too many projects already.Sec chooses probably those top coins and as I can see it, bnb is a good one on the spotlight as their ceo is quite popular and they are really trying to dig on them for years. But also this could also means they wanted it to go down, probably they wanna bag some at a lower price.",
