But, this time we are witnessing a different scenario as we have seen increase in the price of Bitcin but it's yet to reach ATH and it's still continuing to increase but Altcoin's are going bonkers and having more than 100% increase and it's not limited to few but most of the Altcoin is following similar trend.

But maybe we are still far from bull run and this is just a massive activity on altcoins cause some people are literally giving a lot of funds to the market and starting to invest and even the losers or lose a lot are already coming back since the market is going good. Institutions also are going in maybe ita a good sign and will contribute to a more comprehensive bull season.",

Altcoins can also be purchased with stablecoins, although I don't trust any of them.One for sure bitcoin is the major pair in cryptocurrency market, when bitcoin going up then altcoin just follow bitcoin trend.This kind of thinking almost everyone uses it also people intend to sell bitcoin for altcoin when the price of bitcoin go upAnd when bitcoin is going down, usually they will convert all altcoin for bitcoin. thats why when bitcoin drop, people intend to sell their altcoin for bitcoin.",

I mostly deposit the USDT and almost every Altcoin has the pair with USDT. And mostly I use this stable coin.And scenario that how Altcoins perform well when Bitcoin go up. I think the reason is that mostly Altcoin keep Bitcoins for reservation. And behind a project there will be Bitcoin directly or indirectly. We have an example of Terra Luna we saw that Do Kwon reserves Bitcoin and after that he sell all the Bitcoins to save Luna but he was scamming so that was a Biggest Drama which he made.But which you Sharen it is an old method.",

The recent surge Bitcoin price followed by altscoins is primarily attributed to the significant interest of financial institutions in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which are likely to be approved in January, 2024. ETFs approval can act as catalyst to further boost in cryptocurrencies market. DYOR",

We all know that trade pair is bitcoin/altcoin and so with that, they will have to wait what bitcoin will do first.On the other hand, if we see a altcoin that is running way ahead of bitcoin, it could be just a normal pump and dump in the altcoin market as we have seen a lot of that kind of movement before. So before the altcoin market have it's bull run, it will have to wait for bitcoin first to move.",

Bitcoin is still strong and it is quite stable. indeed the situation will be good enough for altcoins to start the pump but that requires a market response, whether it will help and support the pump or not. if the market situation still doesn't allow it, I think altcoins will just pump following Bitcoin's movements.",

It cannot be a bull trap since it's happening for multiple Altcoins.I wouldn't really chalk up the entirety of bullrun with Bitcoin only, altcoins themselves could have their own bullruns in their own phase, just that Bitcoin bullruns usually increase the attention towards the entirety of the market, hence more investors hence more coins go up. Not to mention that I don't even think we have a Bitcoin bull run? It's just a steady movement and slow increase so far imo, I'd expect the bullrun, if it ever happens to happen a couple more months later, at least half a year more I suppose.",

Your analysis covers the dynamics of cryptocurrencies market, particularly in the context of bull run. Establishing a new price level which works as resistance is a common phenomenon of market. The recent price surge in Bitcoin and alts is a good example, how prices of asset solidify resistance level after a significant price surge. Consequently, market tend to move side ways within this range before eventually breaking out and embarking on new trajectory.According to some analysts, the positive sentiment in market kicked off in last quarter of 2023 is an early stage of a bull market.",

Instead, I will see this as an opportunity and take advantage of it. And when it's over, I will make sure to take my profit and exit. I am still not convinced that this is an actual bull run for altcoins. I'm still focusing on Bitcoin. Every investment is a risk and we grow by taking risks.

It cannot be a bull trap since it's happening for multiple Altcoins.We can't say that Bitcoin has not moved so much having moved over $20,000 in just a few months, which is the highest in market capitalization increase among cryptocurrencies. But for the fact that Bitcoin is heavy is a problem on its own, there is no way altcoins will not outshine it since they are still light and cheap, they will respond better when minimal capital is injected into them. That aside, many altcoins moved when Bitcoin moved, and it can't be a misguided to say that almost all altcoins moved at that time because it was general, only that most of them didn't move so much.But later, they started peaking, but even till now, some has not made significant movements but waiting for the bull run time of next year. That is how it always happens, there are some altcoins that will be moving when Bitcoin moves and there will be many that will move more when Bitcoin has stopped moving up. That is the trick in it and a reason why most people will not know which one to eventually HODL their money in if they are indecisive.",

BTC start bullish motion from 30k$ to 45k$ where btc remained stable for almost one month. So far btc trade between 40k$ - 45k then we will see many altcoins stat pumping 100% in 24 hours as whales are doing all. most of the projects pumping reason is airdrops which will be given on the basis of staking and performing others task while some projects have some good news in the future. Injection and Solona are pumping due to airdrop trend.",
