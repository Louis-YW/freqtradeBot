  "content": "Quote An actress, Oluwadarasimi Omoseyin, who was earlier arrested by the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission, ICPC, is now being investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC.Operatives of the Lagos zonal office of the EFCC commenced an investigation of Omoseyin, a cosmetologist, for allegedly tampering with the new naira notes.The EFCC on Friday said the offence was contrary to Section 21 (5) of the Central Bank of Nigeria Act, 2007. The ICPC nabbed the suspect on Wednesday along Awolowo Road, Ikoyi, Lagos, following an intelligence report. The 31-year-old was arrested following the sharing of an online video of her spraying and stepping on the new naira notes at a party.In the said video, the actress was reportedly seen flaunting wads of the newly redesigned naira notes. She was subsequently handed over to the EFCC on Thursday for further investigations. “Items recovered from her at the point of arrest include a Range Rover and iPhone mobile devices. The suspect will be charged to court once investigations have been concluded,” the EFCC said.Source: https://dailypost.ng/2023/02/03/actress-paraded-by-efcc-for-spraying-new-naira-notes/Wetin una get to talk about this new movement, has the government actually started punishing anybody found to be guilty of abusing the new notes or this is just another personal attack by the government and this actress was a victim.

Okay what about the market traders, wetin dem go do to stop them abusing and mishandling the new Naira note.",

Nigeria culture na to spray money for party and all these politicians too dey do the same,because we too like show off. For this actress wet dem catch so and dey carry her go court,she too do self,wetin she think say she be wey only she just dey spray herself money come dey match,e show say she no value the cash maybe because she get too much. I see reason to the arrest because no be even occasion she dey do am,na just to show off. If she get strong back up,then the Mata na small thing. For now I no think say e go easy to stop mishandling of the naria because market women no too go school and fit no know another way to handle the money pass their Squeezing pattern. High level of corruption dey make laws no dey effective for the country because na only the poor,law enforcement agencies get power to oppress. The only way out is cashless policy.",

Also the government has lots of situations they should channel this energy for and not spraying of notes.",

Abeg I want make them spray me for my wedding even if na btc you won send still dance small and spray me Well I expected nothing less from feminist point of view so at that you are right in your own way for putting up something like this in defence of the crime committed by the actress, But the point I will like you to note is as follows. *the new CBN policy stated that an individual is limited to 20k withdrawal a day which also represent our daily spending limit and the Actress flaunted wards of hundreds of thousands of the naira note which is already a violation of the Nigeria currency protection policy which has been in existence even before thos new cashless policy. * Her sources of the naira notes must be investigated because they a money laundering offences. * This is not only happening with the actress but to every other financial crime in whatever ways, Efcc has arrested a lot of money sellers in my location, because there have taken advantage of the panic in the financial sector to exploit Nigerians.",
