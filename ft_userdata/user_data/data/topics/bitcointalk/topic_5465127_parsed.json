Being specific will help a lot, as members will know what your intention here really is.Over to your question.. investment in altcoins must times appear to be more profitable than investing in bitcoin, but they are highly risky too, so if I'm to advise, I will say go for bitcoin if you are looking for a safe place to invest. And if you are to go for altcoins, be ready to take the risk, as anything might happen within the investment period. Either it gives you a hug back or you end up losing everything; the choice is entirely yours to make.",

As for namecoin, it's one of the oldest project, way back in 2013 if I'm not mistaken, and could have been invested heavy already but I don't know if it is still has the hype in the next bull run.And if you look at it, and if my memory serves me right, it's last all time high in 2017 because I vividly remember that it was very hype back then and it was thought that it could dominate it's niche. But now for me, this is just my opinion, not a good investment as it might not hit all time high in the next bull run.",

It's easier to think of and write about grand scheme but it's much difficult to implement those ideas. For me, I believe on execution of smaller steps and ideas more important than large promises.

Though there is a chance to take advantage of pump dump after a few days new projects and sitcoms become dead. So it will be hard to make money from pump dumps. In summary, I would prefer to invest in Bitcoin. Just keep in eye on when a dump happens and take entry. Hold until you get a good profit from there. Make your target when you will release your holding. That's how you may achieve your goals instead of investing in a shitcoin.",

Kidding aside (not really tbf), I think it depends on how much risk you're willing to take. I've never heard of Namecoin before but if you think it's a good project, then go. I'd say split up the $1k if that's pretty big for you though, just to mitigate that -100% I said earlier. In this case you're probably shorting anyway, so even if you pull out early when you profit, if the project really has the chance of making that 1000% return, it's never really going to be late. You might get a bit less, but it's still a lot more compared to nothing.",

Look at the chart of this coin over the last 8 years, what do you see there? Do you see rapid growth and new ATHs there? What is the point of carrying your money into a coin that has a trading volume of $5,000? What are you hoping for, that after you buy these coins, things will change and now the coin will behave any differently? No, it will behave exactly the same, so I don't see any point in carrying my money into such projects.",

Why does your username say, \"Nexus Flavor\" if you are not really here to shill the project? That sounds like the classic line the a thief shouting that they didn't steal anything when what they've stolen is already visible from their pocket. However, I don't think this makes any difference whether you are shilling the project or not because most people won't just invest in a project they hear about from someone random over the internet.And, what makes you think that any of the two projects you've mentioned will actually give you a 1000% return on your investment when both of the projects are new? And we all know what generally happens when we invest in newly launched projects especially if they are meme or shit coins.",

You say that you are sticking to Namecoin, but you do not give reasons for that other than selfish feelings, so some describe you as shilling. .Currencies that achieve 1000% are the ones that offer something new to ride the wave of ICO DeFi AI, and Namecoin did not do any of that, so the possibility of it rising by a large percentage is unthinkable or inaccurate.Litecoin has a privacy update and Dogecoin is a memcoin",
