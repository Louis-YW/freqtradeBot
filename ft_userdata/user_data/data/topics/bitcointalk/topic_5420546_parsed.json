Connections like you can make someone's withdrawal on a bankrupt exchange get processed? What experience are we talking about? If you want to educate us on how to be bears, I'll pass.

If you happen to know what you are doing then let your skill speak for itself. You can't come here claiming that you know a lot about crypto, without actually proving it. Have you mentored people before? Who can vouch for you? What can someone learn from you? How can you provide a solution to everything and what do you mean by everything?",

Really? Education knowledge? Did they teach you about commas during those education knowledge seminars and \"experince\" classes?Quote from: Fullbear2222 on November 11, 2022, 03:30:12 PMIf you have questions about crypto Im definately the one who knows but but techical things like githubs i only know mostly fud fomo and pmp dmp and banks whales Fed money and money printing thing regards with crypto. Really? But but? Again, commas! Do you do them? If I have questions about crypto, you would be the last on my list of people to ask for guidance.Quote from: Fullbear2222 on November 11, 2022, 03:30:12 PMAlso my strengh Are i make difficult things easy there are no problems for me i'll fix and find solutions for everything. Can you find solutions for the misspelled words and grammatical mistakes in your sentences? Why is your \"are\" spelled with a capital letter mister but but?Quote from: Fullbear2222 on November 11, 2022, 03:30:12 PMDo u think it's good for me start teaching on Youtube ? I am not trying to hurt your feelings but hell no. Explain to me any difficult concept about crypto that you claim to be an expert in? Quote from: Fullbear2222 on November 11, 2022, 03:30:12 PMSo you think u need menthor ? What is with you and Thor and his older brother Menthor? We don't need superheroes on Bitcointalk. There aren't that many villains worth fighting here.",
