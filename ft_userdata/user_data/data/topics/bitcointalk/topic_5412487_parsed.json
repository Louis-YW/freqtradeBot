He wants to get the fight confirmed to take place within 3-4 months by telling Joshua in typical Fury fashion \"Let me know if you are interested\"  SKYSPORTS",

      "body": "What I read on news after Oleksandr Usyk won Anthony Joshua the second time is that the next person he is fighting is the heavyweight champion, Tyson Fury. But I am surprised that he does not want to fight with Fury this year, likely because he knows the kind of strength and power Fury has and have to prepare ahead. But with the look of things, no boxer can stand Fury, I may be wrong, but we would see  by next year. Let us see what Anthony Joshua would say about this, but if a match is organized between them both, Fury would likely win. Quote from: JollyGood on September 05, 2022, 04:49:41 PMIf Joshua accepts and this fight goes ahead, what will will the outcome be and will it shape the future of boxing for years to come?Fury will likely win, he is definitely stronger in my opinion, while Fury versus Usyk would be next year.",

If AJ goes ahead to accept the fight as he also mentioned that he will be ready to fight in December, another defeat may just further send his career to bed.",

That was honestly a generous offer from Fury, Joshua cannot ask more than this after losing to Usyk. Well, anything can also happen with this fight and maybe Joshua has some skills and surprising technique to beat Fury. Who knows right? but Fury is pretty confident that he can easily beat Joshua that's why he calls him to fight this year.",

Fury got his last real fight in 2021, and before that, only in 2020. I dont think that Whyte was a real thread to Fury. Same will be Joshua. Strong and straightforward boxer. Joshua is not ready right now to fight boxer of such a high level. If this fight really happens, I would be very disappointed, as this might be an easy fight for Fury, not the fight fans wants to see and Fury might really retire after it.",

I assume this fight will be more of the same for him. That is true about Fury. Somehow, he finds a way to win even if it goes to as points decision (with exception of the dubious draw against Wilder in their first fight).The way he outmuscled Wilder, the way he sued his weight to lean on him and tire him out is another tool he has at his disposal. If it goes ahead I cannot see Joshua winning.Quote from: Daltonik on September 05, 2022, 05:52:44 PM~snip.This seems to be very low level posting in order to meet signature campaign criteria.

I dont know who will vote for Joshua. Only kids or so called \"couch experts\", that are inspired by record numbers (which are not great right now) and YouTube highlights ? What we know about current Joshua ? 2-3 in last five fights. Wins over about to retire Pulev and a revanche against snickers boy? Mental instability. Fury would break and eat Joshua on first press conference with his trash talk and then we will see an interpretation of \"you are not strong dont look athletic, how did you beat me?\"",
