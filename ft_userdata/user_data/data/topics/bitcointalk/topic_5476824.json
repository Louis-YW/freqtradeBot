  "content": "We are happy to announce the release of obsidian (OBS) We are being listed in multiple exchanges very soon so we urge everyone to mine as many coins as they can   This coin has been released for just under 2 weeksSpecs:Miners are currently awarded with 100 new obsidian per block, an amount which gets halved roughly every 4 years (every 840,000 blocks).The Obsidian network is therefore scheduled to produce 164 million obsidian, which is 2 times as many currency units as Litecoin. Block time is approximately 1.5 minutes.21 Block confirmations to spend mined coins (Litecoin is 120 blocks confirmed before you can spend mined coins)We have sourced a lot of code from both Litecoin and Bitcoin to give you the best of both worldsAll information including links to our discord/ Forum/Block explorer can be found at our websitevvvvv,obsidiancoin,org",
