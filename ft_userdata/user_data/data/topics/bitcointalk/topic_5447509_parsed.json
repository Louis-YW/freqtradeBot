  "content": "Last week, I met one of my uncles-in-law who has been a sailor for many years. In the past decade, he has been out of town and travelling all over the world to make a living. He has two children to raise and being a father who is always absent from their growing-up, he somehow does not know how to get along with his kids once he is back home once a year. In this transition period, usually like one month or two, he will find him some odd jobs  to make money to support his family. Unfortunately in this economic downturn, it is very difficult to find a job so he is quite upset now. Staying at home means no income and this makes my aunt very anxious. This uncle is in mid fifties and he is one of the most diligient people I've ever known. Ever since he was young, he would always keep busy doing all kinds of jobs to make money. I have to say that he made some savings for some years but it was most used up by sending his daughter to study overseas. Under today's economic condition, he has to wait more time to be assigned onboard and it is said his salary will be slashed big next time he has an offer. Well, to make a living, he has to accept that. He used to be a happy-go-lucky guy and always have a smile every day, last week I saw him, he was more like silent and upset. As he ages, the window for him is closing. I never saw him encounter any financial problem because he has been diligient and frugal. This meet-up has completely changed my mind. Even people like him are struggling financially and we'd better prepare a comfortable life for the old version of ourselves. This uncle is still doing okay although with some struggles but I am sure there are millions who are broke and wish they could have made and saved more money when they were young. Always plan for the future. What do you think ?",

It's part of our journey to have fun and spend some money to unnecessary thing. However, it doesn't mean it won't work due to these activities, if you started doing earlier these practices which you could adapt and be part of your lifestyle, then maybe even a little spend of money wouldn't be hurt your savings and investment. If you fix your mindset to have better future then it might change the way you see things. Because having a plan is much better than waiting for your destiny.",

He might not have gotten the whole gist. There was where the OP said that his uncle actually had good savings but he used his savings to sponsor his daughters education outside their country. This could be called wrong planning or something like that. Did he actually save to send her daughter to school or she saved for retirement?He was supposed to use what he earns to sponsor her daughter's education and then save or invest for the future. Not the other way round.According to the article, his uncle has spare time in his job but didn't establish something he would be doing with his spare time to earn more.",

Always plan for the future. What do you think ? Saving money when we are still young is a good preparation for the future, the problem is how can we save money when we don't even have it, or we cannot support our daily needs, then there's nothing left for saving, it is hard specially when we are poor and we only have a minimum wages. I believe that there's a lot of people that is suffering with the situation they wanted to save money but how?.",

I guess that's the one thing that he lacked when he's been on those times of earning well as a seafarer. As he grew old and on his age, it's hard to get some onboarding again and that's the reality unless he's been with the company for so long and he's got a senior position that's needed in the ship. Sadly, many old folks have been experiencing this, working all of their lives and doing everything to send their children to the best schools and give them the education they deserve unknowingly didn't prepared for what's to come to them. And to those that are earning well for now, this isn't just the only story that I've heard of, too many have compromised their future and didn't think of themselves just to give their family a good life. You still need to take care of yourselves because when you get there, you'll never know who's there to help you.",

It doesn't matter if he's someone older than you're. Except you meant to write \"uncle's in-law\". That's, as in, an inlaw to your uncle. If you're referring to a man who is married to your aunt as \"uncle in-law\", that's wrong. By the way, your uncle can only be someone from your dad or mum's bloodline. Nothing else. I even hear or read people say, \"my cousin brother\"or \"cousin sister\". What the heck does that mean? A cousin is a cousin, except you say a \"male cousin or a female cousin.\" You guys should stop complicating stuff with all those unnecessary placements.

What do you think ?Yeah, always plan for the rainy days. However shit happens and sometimes our plans just come crashing at the dying minute. Like the man in your story, I advise people to get into jobs/employment that will allow them time to themselves and family. That will allow them dictate their own pace and not being dictated to.

People often assume that they should spend all their money on their children so that when they get old their children will assist them financially. This is a very erroneous belief because a good school doesn't determine a good job or financial independence. Please don't get me wrong, it is good to give your children the best but you should also plan for your retirement because one day those children will have to face their own family. Nobody is even sure of getting a good job after graduation. Ensure you spend only what you can comfortably afford and invest for your future.        QuoteHe used to be a happy-go-lucky guy and always have a smile every day, last week I saw him, he was more like silent and upset. It is true that a financially challenged persons might sometimes be moody or unhappy. But money shouldn't determine our mood or behavior. We must learn to be happy even when we don't have plenty. If we can provide our basic needs, then we should be grateful and happy because there are millions of people that are dying of poverty and starvation.    QuoteAs he ages, the window for him is closing.

      "body": "Most times, this depends on the economic situation of a country, the availability of jobs on the labor market, and the morals children learn in their individual homes. It is never a bad idea to start up our savings plans for the future so that when we are old, we will also have something to rely on when we are retired and not strong enough to work again.Why I made mention of family morals is because, when we give birth, we take care of our children, give them the best education or skills, and groom them in a way they could also grow to have their own family. the process of giving our children the best education and skills so they can explore, and if they start working or making money, they can also take care of us in our old age.Why I also mentioned the economy of the country and the labor market is because in most countries, it's difficult to get a well-paying job.I will use my grandpa as a typical example. He was the father of eight children, and while he was working as a civil servant, his salary was not much, but he managed to send all his children to the highest institutions. Two of his sons are lawyers, one of whom is a solicitor in Scotland https://i.imgur.com/yhRJRrJ.jpg. When my grandpa was working, he did not make any future investments for himself; all his investments were in his sons and daughters. He could not even build a house in the city, but today one of his children has built a duplex for him and my grandma in the city. It's been about 15 years now since my grandpa retired, and even the pension he is receiving is not consistent because the state government doesn't pay every month; some time they owe him up to two or three months before paying. But my grandparents are not lacking anything because their children have well-paying jobs and are always sending money to my grandparents parents. I also send money to them because I was raised by my grandma.So what I am just insinuating is that giving our children the best education, morals, and skills could also be a future investment in the sense that when we are old, they can provide for our needs.In life, one thing is for sure: no one can predict the future, so it is good to always have good plans tailored out, like still making other investments. Someday our children will grow up and have their own family, and if they don't have a well-paying job by then, they will also be struggling to take care of the needs of themselves, their wives, and their children. If we, as their parents, are relying on them, we could be disappointed because it's going to put pressure on them and could lead to some family misunderstandings.",
