  "content": "Have not used my old nano ledger s in a while.  Tried to plug into laptop recently and i notice a horizontal line across the screen when entering the pin.  Am able to enter in my pin but the issue is you can't see the top part of the number so when going through the numbers, looking at the bottom half of the numbers you can sort of tell what numbers you are scrolling since well it goes in order.  Then enter and when i'm on the screen and use the arrow keys to move around different apps, there is that horizontal line that seem to block a bit of the letters?  But you can tell its btc, bch app etc when right clicking and scrolling.Unplugged nano ledger s and then went to enter pin again and then notice again the horizontal line where you don't actually see the full number of the pin you press.  But you can see the bottom half of the number so you could still tell what numbers you are entering in the pin.When i went to ledger manager on ledger live, it would ask you on the ledger screen if you want to allow or deny the app.  The issue is when you right click the arrow on the ledger to choose to accept or deny you see the words are faded because of that line.  Anyone had this happened?  Another strange thing i notice was it shows i don't have enough space to update my apps on ledger live?  Only have a few apps, btc, bch etc and it shows i still have 100kb free so why no space?  is it because bch and btg are now bigger kb or somethng?  Only time i did update on the nano ledger s is when firmware update so i update that and my coin apps.  Notice there hasn't been any firmware update for long time so didn't bother with any of the coin app updates.   Years ago i had screen issue with the S and they sent me a new one.  Had this for over two years so i assume they would not replace it a second time especially since it is discontinued?  What are my options?  No way they send me a replacement right since they done it once already?  Went to click on one of the other coinapps on the ledger screen, not btc but another coin, and when it ask to confirm the hash on the ledger screen, well this isn't possible because that horizontal line literally covers the top half so you can't even read the hash or address to confirm.  This would also mean if i were to try to send btc or or any other coin, aren't I going to have an issue because when it ask you to verify the btc address on the ledger, well you can't because the top half of the letters are cutoff because of the screen?What are my options right now?  Should i contact ledger on this and how?  Their website seem to allow you to ask for support but then at the end, you just get a form to fill out your name, phone, address?  That is how they do things now?  How long they take?  Will this take weeks or more?You can buy a replacement screen but is it hard to replace it?  Anyone done this?  And this is for sure a screen issue? Should i not touch or plug in the nano s into my laptop until i get a new one?  Since doing that might mean the nano ledger might not even power on anymore?   Anyone here had this happen to multiple ledger devices especially the old nano ledger s?  Also have the seed with me but not 100%.So based on that, get a new nano ledger s or x right?  Since if you buy a replacement screen and something messes up, then it isn't good?But if some issue, well at least you could still somewhat use the old nano ledger s even though when it ask you to confirm the transaction to send the btc, well even looking at the bottom half of each letter for the btc address send confirmation, you could sort of tell it is the same btc address you are sending to?  So any issue recovering on a new ledger, well at least you could maybe send the btc with a messed up screen or you then just buy a replacement screen?  Has anyone here bought a replacement screen and then messed up their nano ledger s to where nothing powers on?Recall a while back people said if there is some issue with your nano ledger, always get a new one and enter seed in it to recover.  But if wrong seed, well you still have your old nano ledger to where you could maybe fix it.  So thoughts on this situation?  The fact that i connect the nano ledger s to my laptop and laptop recognizes it with that sound and i could still enter my pin even though top half of screen is unreadable is at least better than if it didn't power on at all right?  That second situation would mean it's not the screen?  Or it may or may not be the screen?  Years ago my old nano ledger s had dim screen.  Then months later it would't even turn on and then had to get replacement.",

After what you've experienced from using their product, you're thinking about buying another one from Ledger! Why?- You mentioned earlier you can still send your bitcoins to another address, so do that if you're worried replacing the screen might turn your Nano S into a worthless piece of a stick!",

      "body": "Okay so it has to be the screen.  Anyone else?  Well has anyone bought one and what site and was it easy or medium or difficult to fix?Meant by say the seed i have is not correct, and i enter the seed in a brand new nano ledgers plus, well it that is the case, i still have the old nano ledger s right now with me so i could either try sending the btc from it, or get a replacement screen for it to try to fix it?  But if i were to just get a replacement screen and try to fix it, say the nano ledger goes bad somehow...then i order a nano ledger s plus and put in the seed and it isn't correct, then that would be the worst.  Meant not sure if the seed is correct.  Well i only used the nano ledger s and familiar with it.  So shouldn't i stick with that as oppose to go with trezor or some other wallet?  Anyone know if the nano ledger s plus has many issues?Well i opened one of my other coins app and when i did that, it ask to verify the hash on my nano ledger s screen.  The hash was in three parts... but when you look at the hash, you can't even read it because the top half is cut off... does that make sense?  So when you right click to look at part two or three of the hash, you can't make it out.  So the issue if say i open the btc app and try to send btc, well the issue is i wouldn't even be able to read the btc address im sending to... make sense?  Also i do not want to send the btc to another addresss.  So based on all this information, safest thing is buy a new nano ledger s plus then?  So in a way it's similar to how someone has a messed up nano ledger whether it's screen or firmware, and that person either isn't sure their seed is correct or don't have their seed? Yes i don't like trying new things.  So anytime there is issue with my nano ledger whether screen or firmware, it's a huge pain because want to make sure i don't make a mistake.So the simplest thing seem to be get new nano ledger s plus... then enter the seed and restore accounts that way.Should i not bother connecting the nano ledger s to the laptop anymore in case it gets worst where the screen might not power on?  Old nano ledger s had the screen dim issue and then wouldn't turn on months later.  This nano ledger s has like horizontal line in middle where you can only read the bottom part of the pin numbers when entering it.  But when you look at the hash, it's basically unreadable because there is a horizontal line.  The one strange thing is after you enter the pin and browse through the apps on the ledger screen like btc, bch and btg, you could definitely read those?  So want to know anyone had this exact screen issue.So just tested it again.  Went and plugged my nano ledger s in my laptop again.  Notice again that when i enter my pin, you don't see the top part of the number but when you left or right click it to get to that number of the pin, you can tell what number you are typing before you press enter since the numbers go up in order.After entering pin, all my apps like btc, bch, btg shows and even though it is visible there seem to be a horizontal line that goes through... but the thing is it doesn't seem to obstruct the words that much like the top of the numbers of the pin?  Example when scrolling through the apps like install app, you don't see the full letters but clearly readable.  Now when you click on ledger manager on ledger live, it would ask you to allow ledger or deny manager on the nano ledger s screen.  Here... the words Allow Ledger is clearly visible...but the word manager.... like the top half of manager is cut off with a line?  Same with how deny ledger is clearly visible but manager ... the top half of it is cut off.Also notice this.  Shows on ledger live my firmware is up to date.  Shows 100kb used up but still have free space.This is with btc 62kbbch 2kbbtg 2kbwaves 34kbSo i still have over 30kb free. Now new updates show btc  56kbbch 36kbbtg 36kb So the reason i can't update all because i don't have enough space right?  So you recommend i delete btg from it and update btc and bch apps?  Only have coins on btc and bch.Is it possible my screen acting like this because my coin apps haven't been updated for a long time or that not possible?  Firmware always been updated but they haven't had any firmware updates in about 1.5 years.Should i delete btg app and then update the btc and bch apps?  No clue those other apps went fro 2kb to over 36kb.  But i will still have enough space with btc, bch and waves.Anyway i can do another test or is this 100% the screen?  Try another usb port to plug in?  Or that won't matter?Won't do it now but would a reset possibly fix this screen issue?  The big issue here is if i try to send btc to another address now, i'm positive i won't be able to read the address as confirmation because when i tried to log into waves app, it ask me to look at the hash in 3 parts but it isn't readable... the top half.  Such that imagine it wash5gf56hgf8kh21ed gfkjljjfo32bq fs8da5f4d5sf6swell you can't read the top half of each number or letter so you would have to sort of guess if it is the correct address.  Thoughts on this?",

Definitely contact Ledger support and see if they'll offer repair or replacement first though. Costs nothing to ask.Once you've sourced a replacement device (be it Ledger or something else), simply load it with the seed and away you go. Once you have your new device setup and working, then if you decide you might want an \"emergency backup\" device, you can always try sourcing a replacement screen and giving it a go. If it doesn't work, you'll be out like $10 (for screen+shipping). If it does work, you will have a cheap backup device.For now, I'd definitely stop using the current device to prevent any further damage unless you have a super urgent need to move coins (and even then, I'd recommend other solutions)",
