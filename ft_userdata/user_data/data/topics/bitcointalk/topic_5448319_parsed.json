Such enhanced presence for an offshore company can be provided by using some optional services, known as “virtual office facility” – essentially, an advanced communication and management services package.In standard configuration, a Seychelles IBC would only have a Registered Address and Registered Agent in Seychelles, thus meeting the mandatory minimum domestic presence requirements. However, the usage of the Registered Address for routine business purposes is usually very limited. An additional functionality can be provided to an IBC by choosing some of the optional virtual office services.A virtual office facility may include mail and fax forwarding service, shared or dedicated telephone and fax numbers, telephone call handling service, document preparation and re-mailing service. Using one or more of these optional services will contribute a more substantial “bricks and mortar” appearance for Your Seychelles IBC.This virtual office is perfect for anyone who wish to upgrade his/her game online.PRICE  $200  CONTACT me for more informationEMAIL : digitalpro2235@gmail.com",
