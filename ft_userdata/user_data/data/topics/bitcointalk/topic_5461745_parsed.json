By the way, I think it worth to consider not only bitcoin mining but altcoin mining, for example, Antminer D9 can bring you a pretty good profit. With this miner you mine dash but you can rent it on Nicehash and earn bitcoins. Or probably build and rent GPU server on websites like vast.ai. I don't know how profitable that is, do your own research but if we have a look at their prices, profit seems pretty interesting if you manage to rent your server for 24 hours 7 days a week. Here is the link: https://cloud.vast.ai/host/setup",

Because Asic miners are very noisy, you don't want to have the neighbors calling the cops on you, trust me it happened to a friend, it's better to run Asic miners in a place of your own, if your house has a garage it's even better, make sure it's well ventilated, if not create one for your miner. It's possible that you have already use a Bitcoin mining calculator to check how much you will be making from an Asic miner per day, I just want you to know that 1st quarter of 2024 is the next Bitcoin halving, whatever that calculator is showing you will be slit into the half after the halving, it's just a reminder, so that you can prepare.",

Money and cheap electricity are important factors, but do not ignore other requirements like a good location that is safe and has technicians available that easily assist you when needed.",
