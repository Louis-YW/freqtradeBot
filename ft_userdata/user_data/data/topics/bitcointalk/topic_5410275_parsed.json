Most reliable one is Linux. Stay away from Macs.For Windows, anything that runs Windows 7 and newer will work (please don't get something as old as Win7 though). For Linux, aim for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. You will need a 1TB drive ideally, You may get away with only 500GB (will be tight). Laptops are fine if it's all you have access to.",

With OS and so on, I'd recommend at least 1TB of storage for the computer/laptop. This is the most important part. Also SSD would be nice (would improve greatly the time for the initial download and check of the blocks/blockchain).Also I recommend you ask here on the forum, publicly, and get answers publicly. Doing the setup doesn't need private information and if you are doing it privately you can end up being scammed.",

About Ubuntu what guide did you follow? have you built it from the source?If you follow the guide from btcarmory.com would you mind trying to follow the guide from this link below if you still want to make it work in Ubuntu? and yeah I agree that it is not for non-techy guys its easy to install it through Windows OS.- https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/blob/master/linuxbuild/Linux_build_notes.md",

      "body": "My situation is similar to the OP in many ways. bitcoin core 0.24.01, armory 0.96.5, 64-bit.Both installed (at least theoretically) to the external d: drive with 1TB storage. Armory displays a small banner screen with loading: 100% at the top.Does it matter that I installed bitcoin core first, downloaded the blockchain and then synced up? After that, I installed armory 0.96.5, but needed to change the path for armory to the d: drive after the initial install. I checked the status of the box \"prune block storage\" in bitcoin core, but that wasn't until after the initial installation. How do I proceed? What checks do I run, which logs do you want posted in pastebin? ========================== more details - probably superfluous =============I had a few logs for bitcoin, and then logs for armory before I set the armory windows shortcut icon to \"run as administrator\" and both directories for the path to the external drive. \"target\" is d:\\armory\\armoryqt.exe and \"start in\" is set to d:\\armory. Both configurations are in the shortcut used to launch armory only. Not in a config file.qt.conf has \"Prefix = D:/armory/library.zip/PyQt4\" and \"Binaries = D:/armory/library.zip/PyQt4\"I have been attempting to run armory without having first launched bitcoin core. Does armory start bitcoin core automatically? Should I run bitcoinqt and then armoryqt?========================== Some additional background ====================================I installed both the cold storage - offline - wallet and the online wallet in 2014 on Windows 7 laptops. Not much difficulty was encountered. I used them a number of times without serious issues at that time. I synced up in about 2016 or 2017 and completely filled the hard drive where I had bitcoin core installed. The system was inoperable, so I cleaned it up and used an external drive for the blockchain files afterward. It came back and worked in 2017. 2019 and 2020: nightmare. Upgraded the online wallet to windows 10. Upgraded bitcoin core and armory versions.  If memory serves me correctly, armory worked in roughly that timeframe, but the online laptop encountered platform-related issues and I couldn't get armory to launch again successfully. This current installation is on new hardware and windows 11. It's a clean install.Can anybody help?  I have the paper backup with password.",

I checked the status of the box \"prune block storage\" in bitcoin core, but that wasn't until after the initial installation.  That's unfortunate, likely you have a pruned copy of the chain, that cannot be used as is by Armory, you would need to resync your node with the pruning off.Quote How do I proceed? What checks do I run, which logs do you want posted in pastebin?  Make sure you have a full chain with Core then start ArmoryQt. If you get pathing issues, try with ArmoryDB on its own. The useful log files are armorylog.txt and armorydb.txt. You can find them in your armory data dir (defaults to C:\\Users\\*yourusername*\\AppData\\Roaming\\Armory).Quote \"target\" is d:\\armory\\armoryqt.exe and \"start in\" is set to d:\\armory. This won't do much for you. You installed armory in D:\\ but that's at most 100MB of data. The database which takes several gigs will go to the default folder mentioned before. What you are trying to do is to get Armory (and Core) to save their data in the D:\\ drive.This link will help you through that: https://btcarmory.com/docs/pathing",
