For businesses, the transfer of payments in one area between different banks takes from several hours to days, and a similar transfer between different areas can take several days. Even a transfer between organizations in the same bank takes several hours. But for individuals, transferring money to any point in Russia between different payment systems occurs almost instantly thanks to the Fast Payment System.

Yes, and we should not strive for this. Still, cash is not as controlled by the government as non-cash. Non-cash money has previously been entirely under the control of the banking system, and hence the government. CBDC is functionally much better than the current non-cash money, however, in terms of control, it is the same non-cash money.Cryptocurrency, of course, expect times of further regulation by states and their governments.

The amount of currency circulating in Africa’s largest economy has meanwhile dropped to about 1 trillion naira from 3.2 trillion naira in September, he told reporters in Abuja, the capital, on Tuesday.According to some unconfirmed sources, the number of wallets has grown because the government began to use CBDC to pay social support to the poor in the country.______Please correct if this is a mistake. The next stage of implementation starts with the poor.",
