As you are running a mixer you should hire an announcement designer and also you should buy a copper membership to show images. Hope you will take my opinion positively and take action accordingly.",

How does a user prove that they actually used your service to mix their coins or not if they don't have a signed message from an official address of yours?Also, there is something off about some blogs like this that you made - https://[banned mixer]/blog/top-bitcoin-tumblersI believe most of the information is not accurate. Also, which one is Bitcoin blender (If I recall well, I think Bitblender.io and Blender.io would use that name on their websites, but the mixers been defunct for some time) yet your blog was just made a month ago.",
