You claimedthat was the testnet. So you went mainnet (for your premine) then test net then back to mainnet.Everyone one who mined, spent money on power and rentals lost all the coins mined, but not you andyour premine.After the chain rollback people started over at a zero blanace. When it looked like a few people were getting close todeploying some smartnodes, you deployed 11 smartnodes with your premine, effectively making italmost impossible for miners to mine enough to build nodes. Only way was to buy the coin that youcontrolled 71% of. Then you get listed on a exchangeand you sell some of your nodes, by some estimates you made $30k with this BS.Now your listed on MPS and this info needs to be known. This project screwed so many people.",
