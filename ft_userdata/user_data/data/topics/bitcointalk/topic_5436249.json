  "content": "Of course, we certainly know that not all countries in the world are progressing, especially in the economic field.I want to ask everyone, can adopting bitcoin help a country's economy? especially countries that are experiencing bankruptcy, for example, as experienced by our brothers in the country of Sri Lanka.but if my think can! a country by adopting bitcoin will help its economy, as long as it is adopted on a large scale.for example as follows:: all people who can afford it are obliged to invest in bitcoin, but of course investing in bitcoin is only made as a side job. but of course investing in bitcoin must be in accordance with the capabilities of the community, because society of course consists of rich people and poor people, but in my opinion investment in bitcoin can be achieved by all people, because investing in bitcoin can start with small capital or large capital .So in that way I think the people's economy will be helped, so in this way a country's economy can also be helped because the community invests in bitcoin.and finally the government must provide lessons about bitcoin to its people, or add it as a new subject for students, and also provide special lessons for those who are not in school, namely so that people know the risks of investing in bitcoin,etc.what is my understanding like that, I ask for your opinion from all of you?",

Let the community be more independent and don't limit their scope of earning opportunities to increase per capita income. For example, if people can generate bitcoin from their expertise or whatever, then the government should relax the rules and (if necessary) provide supporting facilities.",

I know that Bitcoin has a fantastic value or indeed your narrative is built when looking at the current price of Bitcoin. But do you know how the Bitcoin market with high volatility can experience ups and downs in value?Sri Lanka economic collapse was due to the government's inability to manage natural resources and prioritize personal interests. Meanwhile, the role of a leader or more precisely a representative of the people means devoting himself, his knowledge, and all his abilities to provide welfare to the people. Look at the story of Sri Lanka where they didn't have such a leader. If the leadership is still vulnerable to personal issues, how will they focus on Bitcoin investment vehicles that could be taken over by the government at any time?",

In the end it looks like even if it was a success, it'd just be a temporary respite and wouldn't really deal with the core of the problem, whatever it may actually be. Plus, if this was known, there's a chance of people manipulating the market in a bid to temporarily profit off of something off of it, it's still an entire country investing after all. And in the end, it also kills the idea of what an investment is. Forcing everyone is not the way, not to mention the possible risks involved.",

Bitcoin has demonstrated its ability to aid in the political and economic development of poor nations. The expansion of financial inclusion is bitcoin's most important advantage in developed nations. In this way, it can quicken the development of a variety of industries, cutting-edge technologies, and innovations that are essential to the expansion and advancement of the economies of emerging nations. Innovations based on cryptocurrencies are advantageous to developing countries.",

Sri Lanka, they have the advantage because there is India and China which are rising powers in the east. They can just make a deal with them for economic support.

For an example, if a government from a bankrupted country advised their citizens to start investing in BTC in November 2022, today they would have seen an increasement of about 45% over their investments, which would consequently boost the local economy of the country, without any doubts.However it's a risky deal, because in the same manner BTC rised almost 50% of its price in 2 months, it could have also decreased 50% on that same time period, leading the bankrupted country to an even worse scenario.To rebuild a country from scratches I believe it's needed more than Bitcoin. It's needed a lot of labor, good will, partnership and patriotism from countrymen. When people work together and don't fight among themselves all the time, they can go further. That is the example of evolved nations which developed technology and life quality for their people.",

Yes, it may help some of its people but it doesn't mean that making bitcoin a legal tender will be the gateway to economic success.It depends on how the government will utilize the use of btc to their advantage.
