Don't post personal information publicly (or anything that could be used to identify your account) if you can help it too. Sending it to them via email if they offer you one would be fine.",

Making a backup on another phone or a flash OS should be okay if you don't have any other option. Just store them in a safe place.I also agree that Google Authenticator is not the best app for 2FA. Their lack of backup options and inflexibility is just terrible. Have had some bad experiences with it in the past but fortunately, I managed to back up my data in time.",
