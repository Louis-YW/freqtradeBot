My main position is 55% in profit and I have been debating if I should take some to then buy back lower when we experience our next crash. Just wondering what everyone else does? Do you take profits along the way and if so at what point? Or do you just invest to hold long term? When I first started 6 months ago I had the intention of just buying and waiting 2-3 years till our next bull run to cash out but lately I have been thinking if I can also make money along the way then that would be even better.",

Or do you just invest to hold long term? From my experience, the best is taking profit to retrieve your initial capital back.Then, if you still believe in what you are holding, you can keep holding it and wait for higher price. Fortunately, with this approach, even if the worst happens, you will not lose any cent of your initial capital. With good scenario, you can have x5, x10 in profit.",

      "body": "Have you ever had the experience of making a ton of money on your first investment, only to see it all disappear because you were too impatient?I've been there. And I've learned that the best way to recover your initial investment is to simply wait it out.When you're new in the industry, it's easy to get excited about making big returns quickly, but if you don't take profit when they come, that excitement can turn into frustration and disappointment. That's why I always try to remind myself of this advice: the best way to make money is to take a slow, steady approach. You might be thinking, \"That sounds like common sense!\" But most people don't really think about this when they first start out, so if you're one of them, maybe it's worth taking a step back and really thinking about what your goals are and are they better served by taking a big risk or taking a slower, more careful approach?",

I am personally in favor of holding my investment whether it is in loss or profit I will not think of taking that profit before the target But this is in the case that I don't need the money that I have invested. However, if you invest money that you will need, then I think you should at least withdraw your investment when you are in profit.",

I will advice people to just buy and hold for like 3 years from now and make profit. Although, nobody knows what bitcoin price could be in the future, but it is more likely that history will repeat its self again. Holding for long would be my advice if you are able to.",

In my experience if you are bag holding altcoins and calling it portfolio then you should take your profit (if you still have any profit) and get out. The only thing that has a solid long term potential is bitcoin and so far all the altcoins have been dumping against bitcoin. For example the biggest shitcoin called Ethereum has been dumped 60% against bitcoin in the past 4 years.",

But BTC is more trustworthy coin then another. If you choose short term trading then I'll suggest you that study about coin,  buy for one or more days.  Sell when you see reasonable profit.

However, I would add Ethereum into my DCA later on when my monthly average income increases. However, if we’re talking about the other altcoins in the market, if you are into profit then I guess the best choice is to take profit to be sure that you win at least a little. Profit is profit anyways. However, it depends on you. We don’t make decisions for you but yourself, because it’s your money so your decision and responsibility.",
