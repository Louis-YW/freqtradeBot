However, I want to be able to run it from everywhere, so I will move it where the bitcoin core binaries are:Code:mv ~/electrs/target/release/electrs /usr/local/binNow we must create a directory in our external SSD, alongside our bitcoincore directory.Code:mkdir /media/apogio/BTC/electrsWe will create a configuration file (electrs.conf) inside this directory.Code:cd /media/apogio/BTC/electrsnano electrs.confAt this point, we need to specify some details in our configuration file.Code:network=\"bitcoin\"auth=\"<user>:<pass>\"daemon_dir=\"/media/apogio/BTC/bitcoincore\"db_dir=\"/media/apogio/BTC/electrs/db\"daemon_rpc_addr=\"127.0.0.1:8332\"daemon_p2p_addr=\"127.0.0.1:8333\"electrum_rpc_addr=\"127.0.0.1:50001\"index_lookup_limit=1000log_filters=\"INFO\"timestamp=trueNotice that I have set log_filters level to INFO and not DEBUG but if I need more information I will change it.Now it is time to run electrs using the following command:Code:electrs --conf /media/apogio/BTC/electrs/electrs.confAfter it is finished, the electrum server will be running on port 50001.",
