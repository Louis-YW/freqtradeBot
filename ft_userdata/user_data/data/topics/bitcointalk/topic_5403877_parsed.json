[banned mixer] is focusing on simplicity to be user-friendly while not taking away from the security or privacy. To help spread awareness of this service we are launching this Signature Campaign and if you're a quality poster we want to hire YOU!Rules and Requirements:Wear the Signature and Avatar.Make a minimum of 20 posts each week that you participate in order to receive a payment.Do not have legitimate negative feedback from a DT-member of bitcointalk.If you receive legitimate negative feedback from a DT-member during your stay you may be removed without payment or notice.Posts in Off-Topic, Games and Rounds, this thread, any campaign/bounty thread as well as on boards where your Signature is not displayed will not count towards the weekly requirement.A maximum of 10 posts per week from local boards will be counted towards the weekly requirement.You need to have received at least 5 merit in the last 120 days in order to join this campaign.Do not wear any other Signature or Avatar during your stay in this campaign or you will be removed without payment or notice.Do not enroll your main and alt in this campaign or you will be removed and blacklisted from all of my campaigns and promotions.Each payment will be sent directly to your bech32 Address each Saturday.Each week will run from Saturdays > Fridays with the cut-off being Fridays 23:59:59 according to my timezone (CET).This campaign will be open for Sr. Members at first but may expand to include other ranks in the future.[banned mixer] reserves the right to cancel and/or make changes to this Campaign at their discretion. Each started week will be paid out in full.I'm being sent funds monthly which means 4 weeks of the campaign payouts are held in escrow at the start.Payouts and Positions:6x Sr. Members - 0.002BTC/WeekThe Signature:Designed by ZweiCode:[center][table][tr][td][size=2pt][url=https://[banned mixer]/?ref=WSB4vr9][tt]              [color=#b0f6f8]▄▄███████▄▄    [color=#62c6f8]▄▄██████[color=#b0f6f8]▄██████████████▄  [color=#62c6f8]███████[color=#b0f6f8]████████████████████ [color=#62c6f8]███████[color=#b0f6f8]██████[color=#1ba6f7]██████████[color=#b0f6f8]██████[color=#62c6f8]▐██████[color=#b0f6f8]█████[color=#29b1f8]█[color=#20adf4]█████[color=#41c2cc]▄ [color=#29b1f8]▀██████[color=#b0f6f8]███[color=#62c6f8]██████[color=#b0f6f8]█████[color=#20adf4]███[color=#41c2cc]█▀▀▀▀   [color=#36bdfa]██████[color=#b0f6f8]▀[color=#62c6f8]███████[color=#b0f6f8]████[color=#20adf4]█[color=#41c2cc]█▀      [color=#34a1ee]▄█[color=#44c8fb]██████[color=#62c6f8]▐██████[color=#b0f6f8]████[color=#20adf4]█      [color=#34a1ee]▄███[color=#51d3fc]█████▌ [color=#62c6f8]███████[color=#b0f6f8]████       [color=#34a1ee]▀▀[color=#5fdffe]█████▀  [color=#62c6f8]████████[color=#b0f6f8]███▄        [color=#6ceaff]▀▀▀   [color=#62c6f8]▄█   [color=#62c6f8]█████████[color=#b0f6f8]███▄▄       [color=#62c6f8]▄▄▄█▀     [color=#62c6f8]▀███████████████████▀▀        [color=#62c6f8]▀▀▀█████████▀▀▀[/td][td][/td][td][/td][td][size=4pt].[/size][url=https://[banned mixer]/?ref=WSB4vr9][font=Arial black][size=16pt][color=#152a54][banned mixer][/td][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][td][size=2pt][tt][color=#68c9fa]█▀▀▀▀█▀[size=1pt].[/size]▄██▄▄▄▄[/td][td][/td][td][size=15px][url=https://[banned mixer]/?ref=WSB4vr9][font=Arial Black][b][color=#152a54]Your [color=#68c9fa]Anonymity[/color] IsOur [color=#68c9fa]Priority[/td][td][right][size=2pt][tt][color=#68c9fa]▀▀▀▀██▀[size=1pt].[/size]▄█▄▄▄▄█[/td][td][/td][td][/td][td][tt][url=https://[banned mixer]/?ref=WSB4vr9][size=2pt]     [color=#5adafb]▄▄▄█████████████▄▄▄   ▄██████████████████████     [color=#bcd7eb]▄▄[/color]    ▀████████████████████▀ [color=#21acf4]▄[/color]  [color=#bcd7eb]████[/color]  [color=#fdc67a]▄▄[/color]   [color=#21acf4]▄[/color] ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ [color=#21acf4]▄▄▄▄██[/color]   [color=#bcd7eb]▀▀[/color] [color=#fdc67a]████[/color]   [color=#21acf4]▀██████████████▀▀▀▀  [color=#fdc67a]▀▀[/color]   [color=#152a54]▄[/color] ▀████████████████▀ [color=#152a54]▀▄[/color]      [color=#152a54]▀▄▄[/color] ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ [color=#152a54]▄▄▄▄▀[/color]        [color=#152a54]▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀[/color]    [color=#89dd9a]▄██▄[/color]  ██████████▀▀    [color=#89dd9a]▀██▀[/color]   ▄▄▄▄███▀     [color=#c0c7cb]▄▄[/color]        [color=#152a54]▄▀[/color] ▀▀▀▀▀▀  [color=#152a54]▀▄[/color]  [color=#c0c7cb]████[/color]         [color=#152a54]▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀[/color]    [color=#c0c7cb]▀▀[/color]             ▀▀▀██▄[/td][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][td][size=16px][url=https://[banned mixer]/?ref=WSB4vr9][font=Arial Black][b][color=#68c9fa]Make Your Crypto[color=#152a54]Finances Untraceable[/td][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][td][size=2pt][tt][color=#68c9fa]█▀▀▀▀█▀[size=1pt].[/size]▄██▄▄▄▄[/td][td][/td][td][size=4pt].[/size][url=https://[banned mixer]/?ref=WSB4vr9][font=Arial black][size=16pt][color=#68c9fa]MIX NOW[/td][td][/td][td][right][size=2pt][tt][color=#68c9fa]▀▀▀▀██▀[size=1pt].[/size]▄█▄▄▄▄█[/td][/tr][/table][/center]The Avatar:https://i.imgur.com/gsaDLsr.jpgHow to Apply:1.
