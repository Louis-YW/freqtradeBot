As there are no major version changes, I assume even if you open wallet in 4.4.2 and some kind of migration will be performed, it will be still possible to open it in older version if you would like to use older version for some reason (for example to control RBF). Of course you may prepare wallet file backup, but having your seed, you are fine.",

      "body": "Thanks for all the solutions.Since I am a new Electrum user who doesn't really know all about this bitcoin wallet, it's only natural when I ask the question how to update to the latest version of the portable application that I use.I have deleted one portable 4.4.1 application but not deleted the electrum data folder.In terms of instructions, what I did was considered not wrong.However I'm starting to worry that the Electrum portable version doesn't guarantee as much security as Electrum other than the portable version as I participated in the ELECTRUM discussion on a local board and I tried to link here the Thomas V topic I took from a local forum.Quote from: ThomasV on March 18, 2013, 09:43:45 AM-snip-It is not safe to use a portable version of Electrum on an insecure computer!Don't get me wrong: I am not saying that a portable build is by itself more dangerous than a non-portable version. However, a portable version does not bring anything more in terms of security. It does not protect you from the computer you are using.In addition, portable builds encourage dangerous behaviour, because they make it very easy to use your wallet on third party computers, that might be infected with viruses and keyloggers.I was never enthusiastic about distributing portable versions of Electrum. I did it because the demand for portable versions was so high that portable builds distributed by third parties were getting popular. That's the only reason why I accepted to distribute portable builds: I do this in order to avoid an even worse situation.Because I still want to know more about security because it is very important to me.",

It makes it unsafe to use when the portable drive containing Electrum is used on several computers, some of which may include insecure computers.In essence, when you use portable Electrum, ensure the computer you use to connect the portable drive/flash drive containing the electrum_data folder is safe from viruses.",

The first question is how to update from version 4.4.1 to version 4.4.2 in the portable version of electrum.After some people gave answers, thank you for getting an answer. Likewise with my second question below it.You explain the features contained in the old version of Electrum with a new version. Certainly not what I want. But it's okay, I will save your explanation.",

Well I didn't notice the sliders in the transaction box in the old version and it was on this new version that noticed that. Well they make choice of transaction, one can switch to any of the options but as for the moment I will not advise people to use static.

There is no too much thing to explain again, your questions have been answered and where you are not clear, we can still make it clear for you to understand. If you want to update 4.4.1 to version 4.4.2, what you have to do is to Open Google Play Store and type Electrum in the search bar or box and click enter. If you have installed Electrum before in the device, you will see update then click on the update, but if you not then install it from beginning. The features are the same but there are some changes of arrangements of the links on the features and that is what confusion comes in. But all is good.",

Thanks to my seriousness in finding out in this forum from the answers from seniors and on the local board, I was able to understand after having had problems with the Electrum that I installed on my laptop as I asked about in the topic and not the amdroid version of Electrum.For the Android version, I have no problems because the process is very easy. If I want to update to the latest version, I simply press the update button available on the play store.I'm also currently studying other bitcoin wallets on android besides Electrum.Since the purpose of this topic I have got the answer, as recommended then I will lock it.Thanks to @Charles-Tim, @OmegaStarScream, @PawGo, @nc50lc, @Husna QA, and @Agbe.",
