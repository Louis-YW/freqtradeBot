That being said, we must not loose hope because our destinies are not tied to the president. We must forge ahead with faith and courage and try to make our life worthwhile while at it. We must know that just as PMB bowed out yesterday from ASO rock if the judiciary doesn't do the right thing and BAT remains in power, after 4 years he'll still bow out. Nobody will rule forever.

Love and Light my people. Omo.. Truth be told, still hoping on the case of the obedient movement to have head is just like waiting for a dead rabbit to come back to live oh, because as the whole matter don be like this now, lets just accept our faith and pray God uses president \"Bola Admed Tinubu\" for the betterment of the entire nation, because just as we been all dey pray make ex-president Buhari to die on seat and yet he completed his 8yrs today in health of mind & body, I bet you, na the same way \"Bola Tinubu\" go run am & yet nothing go happen, because the worst thing wey go fit happen na to dey postpone court cases till the first 4yrs elapses. So let's just pray our new president surprises us by doing far beyond our expectations. Na only wetin I get to talk be that oh, bcos just as the inauguration went peacefully today, I bet you na so him tenure go end peacefully.",

However, there is one Facebook post I came across talking about how Nigeria have succeeded in electing the first female president (i.e Mrs. Oluremi Tinubu) the wife of the current president of Nigeria who is still very vibrant &  healthy, and claimed that she is the one going to be in charge of decision making for the country due to her husband's old age & health challenges. But I don't know how true the source of this statement likely to be.",
