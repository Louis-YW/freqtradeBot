      "body": "Hi. As far as the service is concerned:I don't really think a lot of people would pay for that. There are multiple reasons behind this. But let's start with the basic question: Why pay for a custodial service when they can have the BTC on exchanges for free? I don't say it's good, but it's a rational question.As bitcoiners, we don't like custodial services. Instead people should be advised to own their keys.As far as your family is concerned:Quote they are too lazy to do it themselves.Do it for them.You can make use of BIP85 (https://bip85.com/). You can have the super high custody of the main seed phrase and allow your relatives to own their own seed phrases that derive from yours. So, they can feel comfortable since you can be their backup, provided of course that you are responsible and capable of following the necessary security standars. But again, doing it as a service for other people seems like a bad idea to me.",

Trust is your number 1 enemy here so you will find a hard time to strive on this business. Smart contract or timelock service will help you to clear doubts on your service since this is automated holding process but still your problem will be the point I mention above which is the competition and anyone can literally hold their asset on a hardware or software wallet without availing this kind of service.",

But don't you think it will hurt the purpose of what BTC is promoting? Which is to make them responsible for their money. By making them secure their funds on their own. Because who will have the key will have access to the funds. Simple as that, but still they have to follow some norms if they want to stay safe from hacks and scams. And what if you lost keys to the funds of your family or friends funds, then you have to return their funds from your own pocket? I hope you have some good experience in holding funds. And not holding them in some hot wallet. Just like the CoinEX exchange or any other exchange or platform that just lost their funds due to the vulnerability in their systems.But still, you are doing expensive and risky work, so you should charge them as well.",

The only difference is that the bank guarantees the money if it is stolen, and there are institutions that compensate customers' deposits up to a certain amount. Are you ready to guarantee their currencies and how will you do that if you make a mistake and it is stolen?If they are not prepared to keep their private keys, Bitcoin may not be an ideal idea for them, or if they want to think of Bitcoin as an investment, they should wait until banks in your country offer deposits in Bitcoin.There are services that provide encryption for wallet seed (Ledger Recover) so that the encryption is split between several trusted people, and it may be an option for those who do not have a safe place to store seeds, but again, do not trust anyone to store your coins.",

They had a review campaign not very long ago and they had over 100 members in the review campaign. Next time when I will see the service I will try to update the post.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on September 22, 2023, 02:53:32 AMThe idea is contradictory to Bitcoin and be your own bank, as they trust you as if they were the bank's customers. A n-of-m multi-Sig wallet where one key to a business or service providers and all other keys are between the family members may give a solution. The members can sign their own keys to move the fund but if one member does not agree or anything happen to them then the rest of the members can reach out to the service provider and show their reasons to get the transaction singed by the service.",

With this service, even if they're a family member, I don't think that I would trust them with these service because when greed comes in the way, family or blood relations don't matter much.",

That's their decision, and they will have to face the consequences if/when something goes wrong.If I were interested in having a custodian for my bitcoins, I don't know why I would pick you and not any of the other big brands out there. Nothing personal against you, it's just that you are competing against other market giants and you are one individual. Nothing makes you better than the competition. You might be honest and not have any ulterior motives, like wanting to exit scam or steal the coins, but things could still go wrong. Your keys could be hacked, which effectively means you lost the crypto of everyone that trusted you. What are you going to do then? I see it as a dangerous business I wouldn't personally want to run nor would I participate in it by giving anyone my coins.",

But there is an issue with this, the main issue is that we are in a trustless industry and no one will be able to trust you with their private keys to buy and hold BTC on their behalf. As hugeblack has said, Mixin is already in the forum with a similar idea but recently they have been hacked which I didn't expect will happen to them because of the alleged security of the mixin safe.Op, if you are still interested in your project, you may want to refine the idea to escape competition.",
