(CMIIAW please)If you're talking about the BIP39 seed phrase export option in Sparrow, it wont work since importing an Electrum wallet file to Sparrow wont produce a BIP39 seed that you can export to other wallets.With that, your option is to export your address's private key which can be done by right-clicking the address in the \"Addresses\" tab.However, it depends if ordinal wallet accepts individual private keys.Another option is to export Electrum's master private key via console command: getmasterprivate()and convert it into \"xprv\" via command: convert_xkey(xkey=\"your_zprv_key\",xtype=\"standard\")But again, the problem is if ordinal wallet supports importation of master private keys.(\"View->Show Addresses\" andÂ  \"Show Console\" to enable the mentioned tabs)",

      "body": "The Ordinals Scam is not an NFT, it is a one time transaction that injects a junk data into the blockchain. From that point the rest of the transactions spending the coins from that transaction (and the chain of transactions spending the outputs) are simple bitcoin transactions that can be send from any bitcoin wallet.In other words only the scammer who creates the initial Ordinals scam tx needs a special software to sign the scam transaction containing the junk data by exploiting the Taproot protocol.",
