      "body": "It's wrong to hold bitcoin because CZ does. The fact they're big doesn't make them smart. Nobody knows what the outcome of bitcoin price would become tomorrow. So, if a person wants to hold bitcoin, they should do that for a personal reason. Not because others do it. These people you mentioned, can wake up and sell their bitcoin. Do you expect those who hold btc because of them to sell too? that's what it'll be. Bitcoin will suffer more loss, if that happens. Bitcoin is a choice. Its risk is not generalized, the effect is different for individual investors. Some doesn't fear price drop, while many others do. Investing huge amount of dollars into bitcoin gives steady profits if the price moves. That's why these guys hold bitcoin. Even if the price adds by $1k their profit will be huge. When it falls they buy more to hit more profits sooner. The rich are into business, they get richer because of their acumen. Bitcoin has become a game for the rich traders and investors. Who may, for now, not have any reason to sell their coins. Just like someone pointed this out, without having extra income hodling bitcoin is like mocking yourself. It's true they're people's mentor and their bitcoin moves influence others to hold. But, personally, I don't have to wait for CZ before I sell my coin. Our lives are different. If selling their bitcoin would save their company from falling, wouldn't they do it? What matters most for A may not for B. They're people who don't hold a single bitcoin, but they are richer than all the names you mentioned. Because bitcoin is not what matters in their life. It could be crude oil that does matter to them or other investments. A person can sell their bitcoin and invest into other business and hit big profits, which can buy them more bitcoins than they had. It's all about planning and maintenance of wealth. Also, remember, hodling bitcoin is like saving volatile money. The hodl thing keeps popping up because we all hope for the best. And bitcoin has proven countless times, that it's highly volatile. It doesn't fail in terms of volatility. So, if a person doesn't have enough to take care of himself. It's wrong to hold bitcoin due to CZ and others are holding it. They can use their bitcoin to settle financial problems. Bitcoin was also created to do that. Not just save.",

It is a typical mistake for a newbie who has nothing, who with a lot of effort can buy $50 a month, and then has to sell because he has nothing else and may be forced to do so when the price has fallen.",

But there's this argument I've stumbled upon quite a long time ago that since even the traditional financial giants, or gurus if you may, like Ray Dalio, Paul Tudor Jones, Larry Fink, George Soros, and others have seen some potentials in Bitcoin, there must be something in Bitcoin. If even these brilliant financial institutions see something in Bitcoin, why can't you? If even they are convinced of Bitcoin in one way or another, why aren't you? Are you wiser than them? There must be some truth in it, but it must be a lot better if you're convinced of the soundness of Bitcoin yourself, and that you're getting into it not because these old men are into it but because you've seen for yourself that Bitcoin indeed has a future. These individuals aren't infallible. You also need to consider that these rich people have some millions to spare in whatever they think has certain potentials. They have the luxury to take risks or perhaps even some trial and error.",

They can afford to buy what ever they want, and sometime don't even have record of some of their assets. For such persons, a little shift or bear in the price of Bitcoin won't even glitch their net worth so they have nothing to be scared of. For us, who aren't  the rich guys but are trying to hold the line. the best way to invest in Bitcoin without being scared, is to have a reliable source of income. With this you can afford to buy Bitcoin annually using the DCA or what ever amount you choose to buy, depending on the money available at hand. Quote from: Kara3 on October 06, 2023, 09:56:36 PM Don't you think that they had more insight than you will ever have?No I don't think they have much insight.  these guys sometime knows nothing about Bitcoin, they only have the privilege to hodl more of it because they are stinky rich. It can also boost their social influence, because a lot of people probably loves hearing their names mentioned amongst tops men in the world owning a particular asset. I have heard a lot of stories of how these guys lost their funds to scammers and that's obviously because they lack the fundamental principles of storing Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency they just buy them for fame.Quote you wouldn't like to hear this, but the one buying assets now are the wealthy, they will likely continue the trend of the rich getting richerYes but not totally true. There are others who accumulate Bitcoin annually, but aren't stinky rich. The trend will probably continue because we only hear of these rich guys on social media, bragging about how much they hold of a particular asset. For other low key guys who still buys, you won't probably hear their stories on social because they know the risk involved with exposing your identity when hodling such valuable assetBTC",

Yes most of these wealthy individuals actual built a long term investment and today they are benefiting from it and base on what OP was trying to say, if these men who are supposed to be conscious of their wealth and have better risk management than some newbies decided to rally or accumulate bitcoin then there must be some sort of potential they see in it that newbies ought to also look at. Although this people have lots of money that they can spare to invest in just any thing but believe when I say that they have better risk management and their growing portfolio of bitcoin holding should be a high moral imperative to newbies to start investing in bitcoin today but after they do there own fundamental analysis.",

      "body": "The most interesting part of bitcoins is it's value, though the market is volatile, however, it is practically impossible to loose all, if you miss the bull run today, it's obvious that you won't miss it next time when you keep your eye on the next bull run. For every new investor, buying bitcoins is good but keep in mind that the market is volatile. The best moment to balance your emotion in terms of investing is the moment you see the value of your asset depreciating. This is a moment every new investor must expect before learning how to avoid it. The reason why I said that is very clear, without hitting hard side of investment at the starting point, one may loose control if they hit it when they invest much fund.  Investing and experiencing the bear market before experience the bull run help you have a good insight of bitcoins. It is best to start with the money you can afford to loose to keep your mind at rest. If you are new with no experience, start gradually, no rush  and no greed for profit.",
