  "content": "Hi guys, wanted to be sure I get the picture right. Wallets as Exodus and others add the option to delegate to different coins via the wallet, only by few taps.  So the wallet uses Dapp which works on that chosen blockchain, or has a bridge/other interoperability solution to make the delegation. Without the wallet, its a few technical steps, some annoying and unfriendly procedure that needs to be done. So when interoperability solution will be found, such as Quant network or any other, every wallet will offer to delegate any coin with ease and very user friendly way. Did I get the picture right? Thanks!",

I think it's very good in terms of user experience, but what's more important is slowly in the way of connecting blockchains and If the people behind the project continue to develop successfully for cryptocurrencies I'm sure it will eventually be mass-adopted.",

Eventually, as year goes by we'll see those interoperability and multichains available for many wallets but not for all.Each wallet has their own subject of operations and they have their own and main goals on how they'll operate together with the features they have.",

Thanks!  I don't use exodus but I know of several projects that have staking or mining built into their official wallets or websites. DERO has mining in its official wallet, NEAR has staking in its official wallet and CNDL chain has staking on its official website. When you're not using the official wallet or website things get a bit more complicated and risky.",

Thanks!  I actually don't understand what you mean the delegation here but it seems something connected with user experience. So if many wallets doesn't have such feature means it has less priority among users so they are not interested in implementing it but in future the adoption happens everything will adopt to it for their survival so time will tell the answer whether it's really important or not.",

The wallet uses Dapps which limited by lack of interoperability, and Quant offers Mapps (multichain applications) I think It is useful for developers to create a stable and reliable platform for creating independent DApps. This method of developing blockchain applications has become an obstacle for creating Dapps and various blockchain applications. The most significant problem that arises from the lack of interoperability is creating a general consensus between the various blockchains.If you want to use something other than Bitcoin on the blockchain, you need an interface. If you want to use another network via wallet implementation, your wallet should know so at least there are other options apart from that",

Thanks!  I actually don't understand what you mean the delegation ~OP conveys delegation by means of way exchanging a coin, as examples if you are trying to swap/buy some token you need to go through a DEX or CEX, Exodus solves it by directly integrating the exchange function within their own application via third-party API, either by connecting to some DEX or integrating it via FTX[1].[1] https://support.exodus.com/category/1642-ftx-exchange",
