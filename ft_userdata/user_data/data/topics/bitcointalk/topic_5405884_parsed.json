The truth is that not all Legendary members began writing quality posts when they were newbies. It's a learning process, and the longer you stay here, the better poster you become.

      "body": "Haven't been here for quite some time, I'll agree with you that it's never easy for a newbie to grow through the ranks. The pressure is always there as to reasons why, thy don't have to create posts just for the sake of seeking out merits but still, somehow needs to make quality posts enough which are subject to individual judgements to earn merits.The issue then becomes, how do they do this (quality posts that could earn them merits) and avoid doing the other (posting for merits). Let's not forget, the are newbies and presumably, doesn't know much except for those that were on some other platform or have been in crypto fa before they joined up on the forum.For this, the answers is still simply SUBJECT TO JUDGEMENT.1. That you are a newbie doesn't mean one shouldn't seek out for some quality or points that nails it in your post. You've got to try and emulate those ahead of you. It's left for a meriter to see your effort in trying and let loose his or her standard a little bit to do the needful.2. It's no doubt the beginners and help is one of the boards you can commonly find newbies and as much as ignoring the board seems out of place because one isn't doing much of the help for which the board is about although, that's not just about merits, some users have pushed for a more newbie educative and earn first merit threads. Like:I [Merit] Help newbies and those who have a little left to the next rank By RatimovII. [Merit] Hey Bitcoiners! Can You Send Encrypted Messages? By OgNastyIII. [Merit] Hey Newbies! Can You Sign A Message? By OgNasty.This is to mention only but a few and having a pattern to this would promote laziness and create a trend that would bring results such as in II & III above (posts that follows a pattern) although idea behind this one is clear and they teach a clear lesson of privacy and proving of ownership to an address and in turn account. While in the case of I, its just a helping hand to motivate that, its possible to rank up.In my opinion, they are doing just fine and the fact remains that, the ranked users knows the ways to be themselves and get merits even when they don't need them.The bottom line is, you might need to grow but still, you've got to be yourself, do the most you can and hope to get noticed for them.",

      "body": "This also doesn't look at the whole picture. How many newbies are there, compared to legendaries? How many are posting 20,30 or 50 posts a week? Legendaries get more merit, since there's some pretty significant users here which happen to be legendaries. While, I do get your point, I do think you'd need to collect additional data, as right now it looks bad, but when you factor in the amount of newbies signing up, and remaining active it's a different story. For example, a lot of the legendaries have more posts than merit per month. Therefore, that suggests you might have to be posting quite often to receive merit, not because merit sources consider that as a factor of distributing, but because there's more exposure to their posts. Plus, the section matters. Technical discussion is always going to get more merit, as people generally learn a little more or have interesting discussions, and debates. Gambling discussion doesn't get nearly as much, which a lot of newbies tend to gravitate towards. The altcoin section in general has been boycotted by a lot of users, on its reputation alone. Like I said, I understand the point being made, and I'd probably agree standards should be allowed to drop a little bit or at the very least, increasing the amount of merit given marginally to those that are good. I also believe the merit system is doing its job, and I wouldn't want to see it not doing it, if you get what I mean. Plus, we've got threads dedicated to only lower ranks, for merit sources to merit them. So, I don't think this issue is being ignored completely.",

I always respect DdmrDdmr for that, he is a very good merit source that distribute the merit appropriately as he always sends to all ranks.But about this merit issue, newbies should wake up, most merit they will receive will be from the merit sources, this is because most merits distributed by merit source will be sent back to them (the merit sources) because they are good posters and because people that are not merit sources like sending back to them. I may be wrong but this has been what I noticed.It is not false that some merit sources are of high standard, some do not care about the newbies, that is not a lie, but newbies that are good posters still rankup even as they are not really sent merits. Bitcointalk still retain being good forum with quality posters to have the most merits. This can not make this to change. Merit system is not perfect but helps against spammers and poor posters.

I'm of the opinion that the Altcoin Discussion is a breeding zone for account farmers. We moderators need to spend a little more time cleaning that area up before good quality discussion gets exposed there. I've been planning to start reporting there for a while now.",

This is basically because I donâ€™t have a precise log for Rank changes with exact date/times for all accounts.The above means that, as soon as somebody ranks-up a level, his account will drag the merit data to his new Rank. In the cases being deal with here, Legendary ranks may receive a newcomer or two per week (Hero-> Legendary), but Newbie accounts subject to ranking up a level should be greater in volume and speed. The shorter the timeframe chosen, the more accurate the data since there are less people ranking-up than in a wider timeframe.Even so, for the sake of seeing the magnitude of the effect: The Merit Dashboard shows an all-time historical (more prone to Rank distortion) aggregate of:Legendary-> Legendary: 538.953 (58,05%)Legendary->Newbie: 33.230 (3,58%)From the 01/07/2022 until the 08/07/2022 (small Rank distortion):L-> L: 3042 (56,68%)L->N: 223 (4,16%)Percentages are more or less in the same magnitude.In any case, I regularly roam B&H where one would say that Newbies would likely try to engage, but my perception is that there are not that many that post there (they may prefer Alt boards), and even less that do so with something slightly eye-catching, even if if using a lowish bar.One additional thing to ponder is that there is often a lot of repetition and kumbaya yada yada on B&H, as opposed to (apparent) genuine newbie questions for example. The first of the kind may catch oneâ€™s interest, but over time, it may get more difficult to merit things that have been expressed time and time again.",
