But the point is, why are you talking about the UK while we are talking about US dollars? Does it mean the UK doesn't give shit or care about the US dollar? Well, that's just a confusion or query, you can assume.Dedolarization is a topic discussed many times here, and all the time my answers were almost the same, and here the context of my answer remains the same, which is that dedolarization is not an easy thing to do, no matter what product our countries came up with; somehow they are so dependent on the US dollar that by weaken it they must be weaken themselves.US really have developed so much power in the field of finance, and they have the most influential impact on the BTC price too, as we have witnessed in recent events. But the point is, I agree that the US dollar is getting stronger. Even recently, I read an article here on BTT in which the OP said that this temporary dedolarization is just a strategy to make the economy stronger. The point is that I also did not understand how that strategy works, but if that's true, then things will become simpler to understand now.",

Sure, but the question is if the US influence/power is getting stronger or weaker.They have the strongest military, but it's a well-known fact that they've been struggling with recruitment. Most of their military recruits are openly there only for the money, free education and other benefits. They wouldn't be willing to die for their country. So in case of a full-blown military conflict, US would have to solely rely on the superiority of their technology and on their nuclear power.Quote from: Shortmaster on August 24, 2023, 11:38:29 AMNow people talking about bricks...that it's a backed by gold... right but who controls the gold Market? USA and UK comex its chigaco nyc and London If they want UK and USA they make gold price how they want. Gold price can be manipulated but only to some degree. When the price of paper gold and the actual, physical gold are going in opposite directions, everyone will see through it.As for the actual gold holdings, US is by far the largest holder. UK holds a lot on behalf of other countries. The problem is that those reserves have not been properly audited. There's a long-lived rumour that declared US reserves are massively overstated. If that's true - I don't know, but if significant amount was indeed missing, they'd never admit it, as it'd be against the national interest.",

They were mined in Mexico, Central America, South America and Africa and shipped to Europe and the US. There are no statistics on the amount of unmined gold deposits that still reside in these nations. There have been report of vast gold deposits in some parts of Africa.

Unfortunately, not everyone is smart, and there are still those who believe in a unipolar world. Even those who support the alliance of Russia and China believe in eliminating the US-European pole, and therefore believe in a unipolar world that is not led by America, and this, in my opinion, is the biggest mistake that anyone in the position of analysis makes.The competition between the two poles is what can achieve stability in the global economy without this reaching the point of conflict. Just as it is important to diversify the forces between the poles of the planet, it is also important to diversify the currencies used in world trade. This does not mean completely abandoning the use of the dollar or replacing it with any other currency. Rather, the use of several currencies will help in the recovery of the current financial system, which suffers from successive crises due to the concentration of power in the dollar.",

Concerns that may arise from these dynamics could be related to the loss of influence in global markets and the need to adapt to new ways of competing and participating in the global economy...

Beating them is not easy, it takes hard work because the dollar has been the world's currency for more than 50 years. But in my opinion, it will be more dangerous if no country fights against the hegemony of the US dollar, then their dominance will get stronger.However, what the BRICS group is doing is a long step that needs to be taken so that the US dollar does not print money at will. Everything in this world has its supporters and opponents. So, maybe the BRICS is not yet a group that is dangerous and has a big influence on USD dominance, but in 10 or 20 years, no one knows the results yet, while statistics say Russia and China will experience rapid economic growth starting in 2030In addition, many observers predict that sooner or later the dollar's dominance will collapse",
