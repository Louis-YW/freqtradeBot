Only the approaching merge will decide the month's momentum and I find this to experience a down movement in September and move forward further.But still not good enough imo.  I mean look, around June to August there were buyers trying to get in first before the merge expecting it to have a sustainable trend up to beyond 2k.  But all the buyers turned to sellers as soon as the first signs of weakness started showing.  If there was really a merge pump, I think that was it.  It's just isn't the kind of market where a coin goes up 5x on good news.  Now it's like be happy if your coin went up 100%.  Lol.Just check the ETH daily chart.  From Aug 26 - 28, ETH went down from around 1700 to around 1400.  Notice how long ETH is grinding it back to 1700.  As before a drop like that quickly gets eaten up with a one day bounce.",

Many don't like what has happened when the network is asking for that much fee like it has went more than 100 gwei just for the fee.Good thing that before the merge has happened, the fee calmed down and it's expected that after the merge, the fee will become lower.",

People are overreacting to 1k possibility, I do not think that we will ever see under 1k again, that was then and it is over and we should move on.Bull is on the way, it is nearly a full year since we were in ATH and that means even if we can't reach ATH again, at least an increase must be on the way. Crypto market rarely stays in bear and low prices for over a year, maybe it takes a while to go back over ATH again, but not going higher again, that happens quicker.",

Well, we have to see the bigger picture here, the upcoming update will surely bring positive impact to it’s own network so let’s stay bullish for this year. Many are already preparing for the merge update, ETH is still expected to be on a good price this month.",

People are simply running away from the riskier assets and crypto is riskier than anything else so it is not a surprise that crypto took the biggest hit along with the Nasdaq.ETH will see $2k once again but not before it goes lower first. It will only get worse before it gets better. The good news is the current situation cannot last forever so eventually the interest rates will go down again.",
