Thanks.They have no customer support, as they say on this page. But you can question your problem on their social media. I think you will not only get answers from their side, but from other fellow users as well. Here is a list of their social media (global):Discord | TelegramThat's all I can help you with, mate. I hope your problem can be solved ASAP.",

Thanks.Had same issue when pancake was migrating from V1 to V2. I don't remember exactly what I did, but it didn't need support. I think you should be able to switch back to v2, because, most likely, you are looking for your v2 pool in a place where there are only v3 pools. Thats why its not listed. I'm pretty sure I found my LP tokens using nothing but the pancakeswap app. If anything, I recommend looking for an admin on Telegram and ask him. Just watch out for scammers. Never give your private key to anyone.",

Before deciding to migrate from PancakeSwap V2 to V3, it's important to understand the potential benefits of upgrading. Every migration or upgrade carries a certain level of risk. While PancakeSwap may encourage users to migrate to V3, that doesn't mean it's the right choice for everyone right now. But, if it's an emergency you have to use V3, definitely join the Telegram group, scroll down and you can find Telegram there.",
