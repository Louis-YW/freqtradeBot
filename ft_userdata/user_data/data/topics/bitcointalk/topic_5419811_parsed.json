The accompanying blog post in the tweet is several months old, so I am unsure when Binance was officially integrated. Regardless, the partnership allows users to trade on Binance through the Ledger Live software. KYC is required, and I am sure Ledger earns a fee on each completed trade.

Basically linking all your cryptocurrencies saving with your name.Ledger live most likely share all the information they collect with their partners.I will certainly avoid all kyc procedures related to my ledger wallet. And everyone should do so as well.Once you link, your privacy is forever gone. You can try to get some degree of privacy later on by  using mixers and creating a new wallet (which will mitigate their tracking), but what is done online cannot be undone.

What a truly horrible move by Ledger.Every decision Ledger make as a company leads them more and more astray from the ethos you want from a hardware wallet manufacturer. Even ignoring their horrendous data breach, they spend the majority of their development time implementing support for an endless number of scams and shitcoins and integrating privacy invading nonsense like KYC linked debit cards and KYC linked exchange accounts in to Ledger Live. The whole point of a hardware wallet is to keep your coins under your own control and not that of exchanges, and away from their sticky fingers and prying eyes. Why on Earth would you want to link your hardware wallet to your KYC?Ledger are no longer a company which can be trusted. They consistently put profits above their users.",

That sentence makes even less sense because if you don't have a Binance account, what are you going to log in to and connect with Ledger Live? You need to have an account first. And you can't register a new Binance account today without going through KYC as well. I will check if my Ledger Live gives me an option to connect to Binance just to see how it works.

Who knows what their partnership entails. Could in theory even include Binance sharing KYC data with Ledger in exchange for something else. Ledger's firmware is closed-source, making the hardware device closed-source because of the choice of secure element. Ledger Live is open-source. If someone has the skills, maybe the truth is in the code. But in all honestly, it doesn't have to be. Those things don't have to be done automatically and for the public to see.

Maybe sales aren't going so well.30% - a good discount, as it seems to me (what difference does it make what color the device case is, the main thing is that the device works), if only there are still those who want to buy ledger wallets\"Save 30% with GONESOON code at checkout\" - when buying Nano X (Blazing Orange colour only) + Free shipping and Nano S (Mystic White, Ice, Deepsea Blue, BTC Orange colour's only).",
