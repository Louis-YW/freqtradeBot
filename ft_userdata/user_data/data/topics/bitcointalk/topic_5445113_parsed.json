  "content": "The idea of developing decentralized mining standardshttps://lithos.work/#/https://twitter.com/LithosProtocolThe LITHOS protocol plans to usher in a new era for PoW mining, one where mining pools live on-chain, fully decentralized and trustless. Stratum will serve as the \"networking layer\" for the protocol, while the LITHOS protocol will help to verify miner's work and pay them out accordingly. LITHOS is a blockchain agnostic protocol, and mining pools for ANY PoW blockchain may be supported by LITHOS.Collateralization serves as the second half which backs the Lithos protocol. Collateralizized mining pools allow for local block creation and full censorship resistance. Miners may choose whatever transactions make it into their block, and may also set parameters related to governance of the Ergo blockchain. Collateralization also supports a native DeFi application built into the Lithos protocol, in which lenders provide collateral to miners in return for fees.https://github.com/Lithos-Protocol/LitePaper#readmePerhaps this will help solve the problems of theft on mining pools.",
