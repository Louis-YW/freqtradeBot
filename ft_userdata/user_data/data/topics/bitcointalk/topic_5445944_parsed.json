Money is rare this days, am going through a lot but I just hope things well and better soon. Is not really funny here. The things you feel are things that have been felt by other people in this world, because the suffering caused by financial difficulties is almost very common, I find some people in my current environment and the only way that can get them out of trouble it is to work harder to erase the difficulty within oneself. Because it's true as you said that the current condition is not a funny condition, but this is a very serious condition and has also been experienced by other people too in the past.QuoteMy children are at home chase from school, I could not pay fees again. What could be the cause of scarcity of cash?I still don't feel a shortage of cash now so I also don't know what causes it to become scarce. But if you look at it in general, there are currently many digital transactions that can be used by many people, this might be one of several causes of cash scarcity. But if you look at the example of Nigeria, which has experienced a shortage of cash, this was caused by the banks not having a supply of currency, so the stock of cash was scarce.",

      "body": "Well. Inflation really. It plays a really large role in making it hard to save and collect money by making money less valuable and thus, you'd need more of it to buy stuff that back then would've costed a lot cheaper. Add to this the fact that the mean salary rate across the world still remains below the inflation rate, meaning you literally lose more money over time than you earn because the rate at which money loses value is faster compared to the rate in which salary increases. All of this plus a couple other factors contribute to the current difficulty in earning money that we are facing, I myself experience it, stuff that usually wouldn't have costed that much like groceries and stuff are now breaking the bank, and my salary is not increasing. This is why investing and saving your money is one of the best ways to increase wealth, because not only does it give you profit, it also protects your money against inflation.",

But there are ways such as making the cashflow in one's household efficient; planning no matter how hard it becomes because of higher daily expenses. If you will be able to save a small amount in each day, it could give you enough 'allowance' for next months especially if it will be continuous. Know alternatives and seek for what will give you lower costing such as buying in bulk, avoid wasting the food, choosing to take a walk if distance is tolerable. We were used of the daily routine but since prices are increasing, things are not really the same, therefore, adjustments should be made as well.",

Getting a side job is one of the best solutions to the problem we face in this world. Please don't convince yourself to believe that money is hard to get, transform that thought to something positive and come up with a legitimate means of getting money online. Learn a new skill.

Raising a family always requires a lot of responsibility, and one really needs to make plans on how to handle those responsibilities before taking them on.You didn't even mention if you were working or not. How do you expect the money to come, bro? Just start by looking for work or starting a trade. don't take it personal 😬",
