The game can be played with a paper trading account that uses live market prices. Because the user experience is an entirely new thing this makes sense so people can get their heads around the dynamics of VR trading. But the end game is to provide both retail and professional traders who work on distributed teams the ability to live market trade using the IMERS app. For both retail and professional you can be connected to members of your team through the headset. Each person in their own headset, in their own instance of the hub. You can pass information to other instances by physically moving that object in a specific way. But you trade your book inside the headset. You can paper trade or live trade. The data centre is already connected to 5 major exchanges and in 4 weeks the number will be 20.IMERS is a product of a company called CyberTools which codes professional trading tools and offers them to users currently for free. [https://cybertools.club] The account set up page at CyberTools.club not only handles IMERS game registration. People that want to use their risk management or basket trading tools use that page to set up their accounts as well.",

I've sat here scratching my head for about 5 minutes and still can't figure out why they are talking about boobies and chubby people? Maybe they had a big ol' blunt before they wrote that comment? Who knows... Let's try to state succinctly what this is in clear terms a child can understand. IMERS.land is a game. Each player will trade a 'paper trading' play account using live market data. There will be many competitions. Short ones, longer ones, ones that trade particular assets. You trade against other people NOT NPCS! The competitions give IMERS tokens as prizes. IMERS will be traded on at least 2 exchanges. You will also be able to buy property in the IMERS metaverse with tokens. Trading for the competitions can be done in a VR headset. You can trade as part of a distributed team or guild and communicate with them in the headset. You can also pass them charts from the headset, or news, or whatever. This means your Guild can share ideas and plan. And probably do better than people trading on their own. BTW Panxora_COO is a lady. Not a dude. So this individual is wrong in about as many ways as you can be wrong. But way-hey. Live and learn.NEXT QUESTION.",
