      "body": "Hi, sorry. I added the link to my anti-spam bot after a few hours to preventing the link from being spammed by others, as I didn't expect you to post it again. That said, I set it to nuke an account instead of just removing the post, which is what happened when you quoted Lufa's post. I'll remove the link for now and reach out to the admins to get this resolved (as I cannot do so as a patroller).Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on January 25, 2023, 08:54:16 PMWell, since it only took you a day to get banned, my guess (without knowing what the message you got was) is that you plagiarized something, did some serious spamming, or got caught evading a ban.  Are you so sleep deprived that you did one of those three things?Maybe check someone's post history on Ninjastic first before commenting. In this case Pandorak means well",
