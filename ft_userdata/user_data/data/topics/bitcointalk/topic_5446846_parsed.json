As for investing in bitcoin, you can invest whenever you are ready, but the sooner you invest, the more benefits you will get. Similarly to the early bitcoin adopters, they have made huge profits that no one can repeat at this time. If you already know about bitcoin, don't miss the opportunity, many people had heard about it before but ignored it, and now they regret it. If you don't want to regret it in the future, learn and invest as soon as you can.",

I have hearing same BS for years now, and although BTC is a digital currency it will never be the method of any tyrannical rule because its basis against oppression. Now considering this year I am hopeful for rise in price possible bull runs in the mid and late years but I dont see any \"elite class\" take over or any of those pipe dreams of yours, so stop smoking any of that cheap weed in case you have been doing it.While one must always strive to accumulate BTC whenever they have cash at hand and the price hits a low, it should never be the \"cultish\" thing of the century, because that is illogical and leads to mistakes.",

If btc happens not to be part of that agenda, so will investing into btc against 2024 a wise decision?There aren't really any sources that are going to support this new digital currency that will be introduced, so we are not sure if it is true or just a rumor. For me it is obviously worth it to still invest in bitcoin because of the low price in the market even and could easily be a big profit in the Bullrun, I mean even though this new digital currency is introduced it doesn't really matter since it doesn't guarantee that is going to give impact and affect bitcoin price, we know that there are already tons of digital currency or altcoins in the market and tons of digital currency are introduced daily but it doesn't really affect bitcoin.Remember that there was no coin in history that was able to overwhelm bitcoin considering that there are already thousands of cryptocurrencies or altcoins in the market. So I wouldn't really worried about that when it comes to investing in bitcoin,",

It is important to keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and it is impossible to predict the future. It would be wise to do your own research and make an informed decision based on your own financial goals and risk tolerance. It is also important to remember that investing in cryptocurrency is highly speculative and you should never invest more than you can afford to lose.",

In just a few minutes, I saw the Bitcoin market drop from $29K to $28KHowever, since the topic is to invest, you must carefully observe the market and invest. However, the year 2023 has started with the positive signal of Bitcoin.Â  From where the market price of Bitcoin was below $20K in 2022, the market has grown a lot since the beginning of 2023. Maybe this could be a green signal for investors. But since the market is growing gradually, it is expected that if you invest before 2024, you can get good profit.",

I don't think they will someone compete with their made-up digital currency. As we all know that there are several countries who has neutral stance against the usage of crypto, while some are totally banning it like in the case of China, there're still few countries who are unclear whether it is legally accepted or not, my country for example. Still, they didn't forget to warn the public about the risks, though there're some government officials who are heavily against investing, using, legalizing and thinking about bitcoin.",

Later on, it is possible that we are going to see all-time-high. Invest for profit that is coming in 2024/2025.",

A lot of their population still got involved at the ground roots and only during the recent years it seems that they receded (funny, during the times where volatility and unknown were at their highest). Meanwhile, the western world/US enjoy two bull runs, but a multitude of down turns and unexpected catastrophes, especially in the past year and a half.Now, it seems that the US and its counterparts are doing a 180 on Bitcoin/Crypto, tightening their regulation and focusing on CBDCs...while recent news seems to indicate that China is opening its arms back up? I can bet that Bitcoin will be propelling, the Chinese/Eastern population will benefit while the rest of the world who follow their leaders will feel regret for doing so, possibly becoming entrapped in the CBDC system that they might not even be able to escape from...Of course, the US and its leaders probably aren't even intending on this right now and think that CBDCs are their way to prosperity...boy, little do they know.These are interesting times. To answer your question OP. USA and USD are becoming less and less relevant. CBDCs will only accelerate the inevitable road toward hyperinflation. Bitcoin will always prevail no matter what they try to do at this stage.",

And second, next year will be big for bitcoin as we will be having bitcoin halving, only happening every 4 years but it's the catalyst of a massive bull run. And with that, for me, just continue to invest on bitcoin this year or the next and don't listen to those new world order or something. If you talk about CBCD, nah, it's not crypto per definition. Well if you want to be track down by government, but all means used it, but it's not a investment platform like bitcoin or any other crypto.",
