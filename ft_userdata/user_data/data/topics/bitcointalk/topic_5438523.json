  "content": "So while I was fiddling with chatgpt, I ask it about bitcoin and is suppose to answer based on the age of imaginary person.First I asked it to explain like i'm a 5 yr oldQuoteOkay, let's imagine you have a piggy bank where you keep your money safe. Bitcoin is like a digital piggy bank where you can keep your money safe, but instead of physical coins, you have special numbers that show how much money you have in your piggy bank. People all over the world can use bitcoins to buy things, like toys or candy. Just like you have to be careful with your physical piggy bank, you have to be careful with your digital one too, so that no one else can take your money.15 yr oldQuoteBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, meaning it operates independently of a central bank. Transactions with bitcoin are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which allows for secure and transparent transfers without the need for intermediaries like banks.Think of it like a digital cash that you can send and receive without going through a traditional financial institution. However, it's important to note that the value of bitcoin can be highly volatile and there have been instances of large-scale thefts, so it's crucial to keep your bitcoin secure and be careful when using it.25 yr oldQuoteBitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that operates on a peer-to-peer network, meaning it allows for direct transfers between individuals without the need for a middleman. Transactions with bitcoin are verified and recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which makes them secure and transparent.Bitcoin operates differently from traditional currencies as it operates independently of a central bank and is not backed by a government. The supply of bitcoin is limited, with only 21 million bitcoins that can ever be mined, and this scarcity has led to its perceived value.It's important to understand that the value of bitcoin is highly volatile, and its value can fluctuate greatly in short periods of time. Additionally, there have been instances of large-scale thefts in the past, so it's crucial to properly secure your bitcoin and understand the potential risks involved in using it. Despite these risks, many individuals and businesses are beginning to adopt bitcoin as a form of payment and investment, making it a significant player in the financial world.50 yr oldQuoteBitcoin is a decentralized form of digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network, bypassing the need for intermediaries like banks or financial institutions to process transactions. It's based on a technology called blockchain, which is a public ledger that records and verifies all transactions on the network.Unlike traditional currencies that are issued and backed by governments, there is no central authority controlling the supply or circulation of bitcoin. Instead, the total supply of bitcoin is limited to 21 million, and new bitcoins are generated through a process called mining.Investing in bitcoin can be seen as a high-risk, high-reward endeavor, as its value can be highly volatile and hasexperienced significant fluctuations in the past. Additionally, because it operates outside of the traditional financial system, it may not be covered by the same consumer protections or insured by the same institutions.However, despite these risks, many people and businesses are starting to adopt bitcoin as a form of payment or investment. It offers greater financial privacy and the potential for lower transaction fees compared to traditional methods, making it an attractive option for some. It's important to thoroughly understand the technology and associated risks before investing in or using bitcoin.Too bad Ived max my no.of requests. #hmmmm#source: https://chat.openai.com/chat/b0f9f946-153b-4a13-8b91-45c4e913e572",

But I also noticed that it seems to have some biases.Analyzing the responses provided by the op, it chose to tell a 15-year-old about theft but somehow failed to mention that bank robberies also exist, or that if you store your money in your own wallet to which only you have access, and you are not careless with your means of accessing the wallet, it's impossible to hack it. And that thefts largely happen on centralized platforms like exchanges, which with Bitcoin you can avoid, while with digital version of fiat you cannot.It's also a bit weird how it tells you about the benefit of privacy only at 50 years old, as if a 25-year-old doesn't appreciate privacy or can't understand it.

Most people use AI as a simple chat bot asking stupid simple questions like \"how to make money?\" etc... When you ask a very complicated question and describe exactly what you want, then AI simply amazes you. What I am telling you is that those who can use AI perfectly in a very professional way, they already know how to get what they want without AI anyway. Stupid people on the other hand, will never be as successful even when they use AI.",

Apparently, AI is already good enough to write convincing research papers that are good enough to fool scientists.Chat gpt was released only a little over 2 months ago and there are already plenty of articles confirming the problem.
