New projects are currently very difficult to succeed, because investors have lost confidence in new projects being developed at this time. Currently, we only see projects that already have the potential to survive, and have been circulating on the stock exchange even though the price is still low. We buy and hold for the long term.",

Be it low marketcap staking coins or huge cryptos, there will always be deep pockets that will try and use their position and capacity to make more money whenever possible. The reason they're in the crypto scene is because they want to make more money, why would they care about other people that they don't know about anyway?One way of making money in crypto is by being selfish and emotionless.
