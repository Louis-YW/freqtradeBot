I wasn't supposed to be joining in really, but then pressure and curiosity got the best of me. That time didn't really last long but it did stick to me, to the point where I myself tried it out on my own at my later college years.Definitely not something life inspiring (but really just lucky), but my peers just by bringing poker cards and adding in money was more than enough.",

      "body": "It is proven that a large percentage of population is vulnerable to peer pressure. I can't recall the exact figures, but I think it was something like 70%, according to social psychology experiments.In the case of gambling this percentage should be reduced, IMO. On one hand women seem to be less interested in gambling, so pressure should be higher in order to make them play; on the other hand, gambling is sometimes a private activity, so there is no pressure without publicity either.In my case, I consider that I have a good resistance to peer pressure, and I have known many lone wolves in the forum who got into BTC no matter what friends and family thought about it a few years ago, so the sample in this forum might not be representative enough; but it is something definitely to be taken into account by the different players in the industry.",

Then friends started playing and I ended up playing too. Seeing the excitement of the bet and especially when a friend won a prize is what pushed me to play.In the end I think it would be rare at that time for someone to start gambling alone. Nowadays it's much easier, from your mobile or computer.",

So yes, peer pressure does act as a catalyst, and hence people start gambling to get ahead of their peers.Such a sad mindset that just because someone was successful, you want to replicate that success in that instant as if they are the saame as you. Not even asking how they do it. I don't think that people gamble because they see others make money in it as a primary reason, maybe they just want to gamble or not get bored and to do something with their time, there's not a lot of people who go to a casino to make money, most of them just want to have fun or I could be wrong and that it's the opposite and that people are easily influenced by what they see and giving in to their envious nature.Peer pressure is a catalyst but not a substantial imo, saying it's substantial means that people gambling always have this as a factor to their reason why they gamble and thinking so means you underestimate people that they all give in to peer pressure.",

I studied how to play Texas Hold'em Poker and at the end of the course I thought that was a good poker player. It turned out that I wasn't as good as I thought. I was delusional enough to think that I'm going to make big money out of playing poker. I was wrong. There wasn't any peer pressure. Nobody is my social circle plays poker. AFAIK, nobody in my social circle is an active gambler(even though most gamblers keep their gambling habits a secret).",

Had these circle of friends back then we were all living in same environment and some of us attending same secondary school. We started with playing cards (known as \"whit\" in our local description) most evenings all for fun with common verbal challenge among ourselves of who's gonna emerge winner but as we proceed with time some of the guys were no more satisfied with an ordinary mere challenge of words alone and came up with the idea that something monetary should be attached to make the game look more matured and interesting.At first I backed out and the reason was mainly due to my religious background the upbringing was kinda strict giving me the constraint.The whole reason behind my not buying the idea of involving money was that with money involved the tempo was going to get to different level entirely which could cause quarrel leading to a fight (nobody really wants to lose their money). So each time we come to play and money is involved I had to sit by and watch, in the middle discovering that none of those things I thought was gonna happen has actually happened I eventually I sleepheaded into it and here I am today still gambling responsibly.",

I have to admit that they have the power to draw you into the emptiness of spinning wheels and limitless roulette possibilities. Sometimes peers are like keys without doors.
