And ETHW communities are the ones who maintained the PoW consensus, a.k.a decided not to merge/change the consensus. So, smart contact is still possible on both cryptocurency.Quote from: Somegory on September 23, 2022, 01:04:05 PM2. Are there projects still running on ETH PoW instead of the new ETH PoS?.Projects that previously runs on ETH pre-merge will automatically adapt or follow to the change of consensus, so all apps/platforms are now running on ETH post-merge.The current ETH and ETHW(Ethereum PoW) is a different subject of cryptocurrency, it is unrelated. The majority of ETH communities are staying their way within the current PoS chain, whereas ETHW is a wholly different subject since some communities are forking their own network.",

Are there projects still running on ETH PoW instead of the new ETH PoS?.The developers have blocked some smart contracts, so users who kept ethereum in staking did not receive their coins.Smart contracts work, but there are no projects in this ecosystem yet. And the ethereum classic situation is not very good.https://ethereumclassic.org/services/apps",

The only problem is if it needs people who interested to use this forking chain to make it happen. I saw that some people have been talking about this on its official main group. There are no projects running on ETH pow currently caused by it's a new forking chain but i saw that some people were pretty much interesting to redeploy their smartcontract in ethpow.",
