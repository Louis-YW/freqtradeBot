Normally, people would be extremely cautious dealing if they think of that here. If you can have any reputable member here to vouch for your previous works then I believe the scepticism would be minimal but even at then members would still thread with caution.Escrow would have been better if you had mentioned it for members to take note of because nobody would have the thought of doing anything with you when it comes to financial dealings but if you implore the services of a well established and reputable member here, I think you would scale through successfully.Lastly you will have to make known your fee and accepted payment medium ie the currency you would like to receive your payment with.",
