Looks like they are located in Estonia and London.If you can provide supporting evidence like the screenshot for pending withdrawal and unanswered queries from their support channels, it'll greatly help giving a better insight of your case. I'll advise you to use the recommended reporting format:Code:[b][color=black]What happened:: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Scammers Profile Link: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Reference Link: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Amount Scammed: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Payment Method: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Proof of Payment: [/color][/b][b][color=black]PM/Chat Logs: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Additional Notes: [/color][/b]This is their profile link, which already tagged by several DT, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2652465, it's quite save to say they've ditched the account, though.And, for a further info, back in 2020 they got couples of accusations as well:indoex exchange is a scamindoex.io SCAM & FAKE exchangeIndoex exchange",

Looks like they are located in Estonia and London.First to say that I am sorry for your loss, 0,5688 BTC is far from small amount. The only way to stop them is contacting authorities of Estonia and then providing all the evidence that they scammed you. Since that is much easier said than done, I think that they will operate for quite some time before eventually they do exit scam.Since they don't have thread here (AFAIK), nothing much we can do here either, like tagging & flagging their account. I doubt that would help either so, at least I hope someone thinking of using Ondoex changes his mind.",

The exchange is real scam if you read the threads of the past scam accusations made by members.Having 0.5 BTC is a random, unpopular exchange was a very big mistake, let alone keeping it in a centralized exchange. Always DYOR before using a service you don't know about.",

Next time always look after on top tier exchangers like binance,ftx or even okex since this are kinda reliable exchangers which newbie can trust. Thanks for the warning about this exchange also better try to move on since I think you cannot retrieve your money anymore in that exchange.",

If you check that company number, you will see that is mentioned in various UK companies register so that company most probably exists. After all, many other scammy exchanges like Yobit or P2PB2B are registered as well and that doesn't really stop them from scamming people, knowing that an average user won't go bother with lawsuits to get their money back.",

Looks like there have been so many victims sending ETH to the address, since the round figures can clearly be seen.The address links to Okex address for probably converting ETH to USDT, and then they send the USDT back to the address which is then sent to a centralized p2p exchange called Remitano to cash out, perhaps.If you lost a lot of money, you can actually track those guys with the help of law enforcement, since Remitano requires KYC verification.",

But that doesn't mean that the site is a scam site. To prof you should provide more information so that we can check either you are saying the trust or not. I am honestly saying I have never used that site and I am not a fond of that site. But I cant say a site is scam without any evidence.",
