I am not aware of puzzles like this, where you are given a public key and you need to derive the private key. If an attacker wanted to find a private key from the corresponding public key, what they would need to do would be to solve the ECDLP.

Baby-step, giant-step, and Pollardâ€™s rho.Quote from: pbies on February 14, 2024, 07:13:10 AMEDIT: what differs known public key and unknown for getting privkeys?In both BSGS and Pollard's rho, you need to perform operations on the elliptic curve, which requires to know the actual points involved. You can't run these algorithms based on the hash of the public key. And since both have time complexity O(sqrt(N)), you have an orders of magnitude advantage on working out private keys of known pubic keys. Quote from: BlackBoss_ on February 14, 2024, 07:21:11 AMYou can not find a private key from a public key just like can not find a public key from a public address.You can actually perform a reversal from public key to private by reversing the modular multiplications which produced the public key; it's just very computationally expensive, and considered infeasible for very long numbers like 256 bits. In mentioned puzzles, the puzzle makers have deliberately generated insecure keys, to encourage finders from attempting to break them. It's a smart way to know the progress in breaking the elliptic curve's security.
