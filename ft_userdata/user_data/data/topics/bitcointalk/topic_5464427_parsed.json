  "content": "The crypto world has seen some really exciting bull markets, and right now, it looks like we might be gearing up for another one. Whether you've been trading for a while or you're new to the crypto scene, it's important to take a moment and think about the lessons we've learned from past bull runs.Looking Back: The past bull runs have been full of excitement and sometimes nerve-wracking moments. There's a bunch of stuff we can learn from those times. Remember the big runs in 2017 and 2021? And even the recent ups and downs? What did you take away from all of that? Maybe you realized how important it is to set clear goals for how much profit you want. Or maybe you saw that it's a good idea to spread out your investments and not jump into things just because others are. Let's talk about what we've figured out so that others can learn from us too.Getting Ready for the Next Bull Run: If there's another big run coming up (we hope so!), it's a smart time to think about what you'll do differently. Are you planning to keep your investments for longer and not sell too soon? Or maybe you're thinking about taking some money out at certain points? Do you have a new way to handle risks in mind? Whether you're into looking at charts, doing research, or just keeping a cool head, lots of us would love to hear your thoughts.Remember, the crypto world can be super unpredictable, and no plan is perfect. But by learning from our past and changing our strategies, we can handle the ups and downs better.What do you think about the lessons we've learned from past bull runs? What's your plan for the next one? I'm excited to learn from all of you while I figure out my own strategy too.DYOR",

Don't sell too early2. Selling some and buying more at a lower price is not a bad idea.If you are not a bitcoin maximalist then most of you hold some other altcoin as well. In the last bull run, One of my friends sold some of his altcoins with 2X to 3X profits when they rode all over to more than 20X. He lost a lot of money and he regrets it. On the other hand that same person keep holding his Bitcoin even that touches 65K market by expecting it to cross 100k. He regrets that as well by thinking if he would have sold some of his bitcoin he could have bought 3 times more bitcoin with that same money.So i think most of us want our portfolio to grow so if i get a chance to increase the number of bitcoin i have i will take it.",

I didn't sell anything at $18-19k back then because the fees were high and I was kinda greedy, assuming the price wouldn't go down while the fees would decrease.The fork and the spam attacks from Bcash team caused very expensive fee on Bitcoin network. We can see it with the transaction fee chart from Bitinfocharts.com. The average transaction fee was about $40 to $50 in late 2017, it's crazy.I understand why you did not want to spend expensive transaction fee which is some of reasons why you missed a chance to sell Bitcoin around $18k to $19k in 2017.Quote2017 was also a time of mistakenly buying altcoins at their ATH point, believing that they'll go up even further.

Last year, in 2022, we witnessed two terrible crashes of top altcoins, Terra and FTT token from FTX exchange. Those crashes are unbelievable in 2017 or 2018 but in 2022, they actually happened and two top altcoins, one tier-1 exchange crashed within a few days.",

This means everyone learned and must learn from the past data, and they should not miss or ignore any point if they really want to make profits. Let me explain this with an example. I did not take any entries in the previous bull run, even though I knew or at least had some idea what halving and bull runs were. But still, I was afraid to take entry because I wanted to test whether this strategy worked or not.But then BTC went from $40k to $69k, and I was blown away. Then I made up my mind that in the next bull run, which probably comes after the halving of BTC, I will not miss the change to take entry, and I am happy that I have some positions. I am now waiting for the next bull run and wanted to see the results that I saw people make in the previous bull run.It's an obvious thing that this time the returns might be a little higher, as the scarcity of BTC explains that well. So, I hope you might have gotten my point here.",

Don't sell too early2. Selling some and buying more at a lower price is not a bad idea.This. I fully agree with this, I had quite a bit of crypto back when the price shot past 60k and yet I held on to all of it, being greedy and thinking it would just be an uphill, slow and steady climb where I can set the coins aside and check back again in years. Before I knew it the price crashed and I sold a few, invested in a few sites and apps that would turn out to be bad decisions due to unforeseen fees, and I'm sure I have even forgot where some of them when to. Got into ETH too and I still have some which were used for staking back then, but now the gas fees are ridiculous at around $100USD for even a single transaction.If you've made some reasonable profit, why not sell some of it and reap the rewards?",

This is a good topic to bring up before the expected bull run so people can really have thought about it, and plan for what to do when that time comes before it comes because having no plan/not planning for that time means you will make a lot of regrettable decisions then that you will get to regret later. Not planning on time/planning late (at rush hour) is also bad because there will not be the time to second think your choices which puts you at a position to make wrong choices. Have a plan on when to sell, how much of your bitcoins to sell? all or some part?",

Will you be able to sell in the next cycle, say 2028 or 2029? Much stronger isn't it.",

The essence of the waiting and HODLing was to gain and take profit anyway. OrConvert your total bitcoin to a stable currency like usdt and wait for when the bull run elapses and bear market takes over to an appreciable price comfortable to you then buy and hold again for another four year bull run. (I think this will work fine for long term investors if they could have the enduring discipline to hold the usdt conversion till when the market go bearish as expected.). Lol.I just have to stick to my strategy in as much as it's still working out so well for me, why the change of strategy when that which you have is giving you the expected results. If what you doing is working then it's expedient the right decision is to keep a cool head.",

The biggest mistake people make is they buy during the bull market and most of them buy at the top of the bull season and are stuck with their investments.The important thing to consider is to sell your coins in parts in the bull season and not buy any coins.

Same as yours, i did make up some purchase believing that the price might shoot up even more until the reality slaps you on your face and telling that it wasnt really that possible for this thing to happen. We know on how reality works and this cant be called a market in the first place if it was really just that moving on a single path or movement. There's always a correction in a market and this is why its always been ideal that you should be having that target point on selling out so that on the time that the market depletes then you wont really be having those regrets and keeping telling to yourself that you should have sell earlier but its already too late.
