If you are a trader whose fund for example is $100, and you dont want to get burn a lot. Then use that to buy a particular stock. Now if its value goes down beyond yourÂ  loss assumption let say 20% only then at $80 just sold it. If thats your allowable money to risk with. Depends on your apetite actually and time for this kind of loss. But if you are an investor, you should not look into prices like traders do cause you are doing long term. Even it goes down more than 50% just leave it. You are investing for long term goal and dont mind the drop.",

I don't know what to really say to you on this one but, you've got to study the charts and when your not fully convinced on the signs and your indicator don't seem to hit it just right, you could just jave to let it slide.Also, in the event of a lose, double thoughts could mean, leave the market. You have to agree or just don't.",

I used to buy a lot of new shit coins then, and most of the time, I sold them either at a loss or the coin got out of the market. But I had never put all my investments in one coin, I split them between some \"good coins\" and played with the rest. Also, you need a good budget to start trading, you can't even focus on risk management if you have only 100$ or 200$ in your account.In my opinion, 1000$ is the standard amount if you want to start trading with proper risk management and planning, don't take my words as an investment suggestion, do your own research.",

Therefore, you must be able to understand investment risk management well. And you can also recognize several types of risks on this Source: ocbcnisp.com",

I believe the industry is still very new for there to be any qualified professional to seek advice from. Most of the risk management guides are quite a general knowledge that you get from other markets like the stock, forex market or life in general. For example, you should never invest in what you don't understand or invest more than you're comfortable losing just incase the investment was to go wrong. You can always development a guidelines that works for you based on your own financial capabilities.Is okay to make mistakes along the way and correct then as you get more experience in the market. This mistakes should build you instead of breaking you that's why you have to make sure this mistakes aren't too expensive ones like storing your coins on exchanges or using centralized wallets that can be easily hacked. One risk management I deploy is my investment in Bitcoin. It's okay to explore the market but always make sure you never neglect Bitcoin.",

Also you should provide your risk tolerance since risk management is highly dependent on your tolerance. The best to have this kind of calculation is to consult a financial advisor especially if you are investing significant amount of money. Asking random people without any idea on your portfolio and risk tolerance is useless because we have different preference based on our risk tolerance. My own risk management will not gonna work with same with others.",
