  "content": "Many people treat Bitcoin as if it’s a value. People trade a lot of money to buy Bitcoins. People spend money to manage their Bitcoins. People spend time to learn about Bitcoins. Given how much time and money are being spent to buy, manage, and learn about Bitcoins; it makes sense to get an answer to the question, “Is Bitcoin a real value?” That is, is it something that helps sustain human life and is to be pursued for that reason? In my research, I’ve identified four reasons that people give for why they consider Bitcoin to be a value. The first reason is it’s useful as a type of currency. In fact, Bitcoin’s biggest value proposition is that it can be used as an alternative to fiat currency. This supposedly gives users more freedom than they would otherwise have. For example, if someone in China wants to trade their yuans for dollars without having to deal with governmental control over the banking infrastructure, they can trade yuans for Bitcoins and then trade those Bitcoins for dollars. The second reason is that it’s finite. This means users should be protected from a third-party (i.e., the government) creating an unlimited number of additional Bitcoins, thus, diluting its value. The third reason is that it costs energy in the form of human labor and electricity to produce. This can be referred to as the labor theory of value. The fourth reason is that people believe it’s a value. This can be referred to as the subjective theory of value.But I’ve found these reasons to be invalid.First, the fact that Bitcoin can be used as a type of currency cannot justify its value. For something to be useful as a type of currency, it must satisfy all the following conditions:1. It must be fungible.2. It must be easily divisible.3. It must be easy to exchange.4. It must be a long-term stored value.Bitcoin does meet the first three conditions.The fourth condition means it must already be considered a value before it can be used as a currency. If there isn’t independent support for its having value, the claim that Bitcoin has value is circular. See below:1. Bitcoin is a value because it can be used as a currency.2. Bitcoin can be used as a currency because it is a [long-term stored] value.Second, the fact that Bitcoin is finite doesn’t by itself make it a value. Scarcity does not determine whether something is a value or not. Scarcity only determines the price of something that is already determined to be a value because of another reason. For example, certain forms of toxic waste may be scarce but that doesn’t mean the waste is a value.Third, the labor theory of value is wrong. That is, the fact that something costs energy (human or machine) to produce doesn’t make it a value. Digging a hole and refilling it again consumes energy but doesn’t create anything of value.Fourth, the subjective theory of value is wrong. People can be defrauded. Theranos is a recent example of this. People can also be mistaken about value. The housing crash or the numerous failed investments in start-ups are clear examples of this. When people are defrauded or are mistaken, this means their belief in something being a value is wrong. Just because a lot of people believe that something is a value doesn’t make it so.For something to be a value, the reason(s) must be real. Let’s use the US dollar as an example of something that has a real value. The US is a society where producers specialize and trade their products with one another to get what they need to survive. The US government requires traders to give them US dollars whenever a trade occurs (i.e., taxes). This requirement is forced at the point of a gun. The US dollar is, at its core, a type of ticket that you must give to the government to allow you to live. That makes the US dollar valuable to your life. While it’s true that the US government can dilute the purchasing power of the US dollar, that doesn’t mean that it has no real value right now. A potential is not the same thing as an actual. As of now, the US government still exists, the massive capital infrastructure under its jurisdiction still exists, and its ability to tax trades between organizations or people who use this capital infrastructure is still strong. This is the basis for the US dollar’s real value.Bitcoin has no such basis or any other basis. Without a valid basis to justify why Bitcoin has real value, the proper default position to take is to assume that Bitcoin has no real value.",

Neither gold nor diamonds, for example, help sustain human life but they, for some reason, have maintained their value for thousands of years.QuoteFor example, if someone in China wants to trade their yuans for dollars without having to deal with governmental control over the banking infrastructure, they can trade yuans for Bitcoins and then trade those Bitcoins for dollars. Are you talking about P2P trades between independent individuals? Because otherwise using different fiat on/off-ramps still requires interaction with the banking infrastructure controlled by governments. Bitcoin allows users to make exchanges trustlessly without asking permission or involvement of intermediaries. You can do the same with cash but only locally, whereas with bitcoin it is possible to conduct international trades.QuoteThe second reason is that it’s finite. This means users should be protected from a third-party (i.e., the government) creating an unlimited number of additional Bitcoins, thus, diluting its value. Its finite supply is protected by a decentralized distributed consensus and this is what really matters here.QuoteThe third reason is that it costs energy in the form of human labor and electricity to produce. This can be referred to as the labor theory of value. Bitcoin doesn't have value because it is mined, bitcoin is mined only because it has value.QuoteThe fourth reason is that people believe it’s a value. This can be referred to as the subjective theory of value.People expect they will be able to exchange bitcoin for goods in the future because money itself is only useful when exchanged for something else. QuoteThe fourth condition means it must already be considered a value before it can be used as a currency. If there isn’t independent support for its having value, the claim that Bitcoin has value is circular. See below:1. Bitcoin is a value because it can be used as a currency.2. Bitcoin can be used as a currency because it is a [long-term stored] value.Today, bitcoin is mostly seen as a store of value or nascent store of value that gradually accrues its value. When it is established as a store of value and its price stabilizes, it will be seen as a medium of exchange and unit of account. QuoteSecond, the fact that Bitcoin is finite doesn’t by itself make it a value. Scarcity does not determine whether something is a value or not. Scarcity only determines the price of something that is already determined to be a value because of another reason. For example, certain forms of toxic waste may be scarce but that doesn’t mean the waste is a value.Never before have we seen an asset that is both digital and scarce. The very fact that bitcoin is essentially a discovery of digital scarcity makes it more valuable than other digital assets.QuoteThird, the labor theory of value is wrong. That is, the fact that something costs energy (human or machine) to produce doesn’t make it a value. Digging a hole and refilling it again consumes energy but doesn’t create anything of value.I agree that the labor theory is fallacious and misleading. But again, \"Bitcoin doesn't have value because it is mined, bitcoin is mined only because it has value.\"QuoteFourth, the subjective theory of value is wrong. People can be defrauded. Theranos is a recent example of this. People can also be mistaken about value. The housing crash or the numerous failed investments in start-ups are clear examples of this. When people are defrauded or are mistaken, this means their belief in something being a value is wrong. Just because a lot of people believe that something is a value doesn’t make it so.Quote from: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subjective-theory-of-value.asp What Is the Subjective Theory of Value?The subjective theory of value maintains that the value of an object is not fixed by the amount of resources and the hours of labor that went into creating it but is variable according to its context and the perspective of its users.You contradict yourself. If the labor theory is wrong, then the only explanation of the nature of value is that it is purely subjective.QuoteFor something to be a value, the reason(s) must be real. Let’s use the US dollar as an example of something that has a real value. The US is a society where producers specialize and trade their products with one another to get what they need to survive.

This is the basis for the US dollar’s real value.Bitcoin has no such basis or any other basis. Without a valid basis to justify why Bitcoin has real value, the proper default position to take is to assume that Bitcoin has no real value.TL;DR Bitcoin is based on proof of work, whereas the dollar is based on proof of war.",

You know that it's only printed paper (or whatever) that has value only because the central bank of your country says so. I won't insist on the fact that they're lying and because of inflation the value you're paying for that paper (i.e. work done) is not the same as the value you receive for that paper when you spend it. But what if your country's central bank, for various reasons, cannot honor its word? I know, it's not very likely, but imho it proves my point:something holds value if you and a big enough number of other people sees it as valuable.As simple as that.

(real estate buzzword: comps) .. and then evaluate the house price in comparison to see if the PRICE is good and near VALUE(lowest comp) or if its being sold at a premium(above/at highest comp)a house PRICE is not the value. the regions 'comps' is the value and although you might buy a house above 'comps'(value) the store of value still exists via a underlying value everyone in the region refuses to sell below. (the bottom line cheapest 'comps')even in the housing market. dont expect guarantee house price profits.. because the market can rescind and return to the lowest comps of recent years. buying a house at a premium does not make it great value to get great ROI sooner.bitcoin has a 'comp' tootake the lowest cost to mine on the planet. the cost no one else can acquire bitcoin for.. thats the 'comp' value.then take the periodic ATL (the all time LOW.. not the high.. the LOW) of every say 2-3 years (normally 4 year cycle)and thats the value line below the price.you can use this line to then evaluate if the PRICE is near VALUE or if its at premium..if you think bitcoin has no value then you must think house prices have no value.bitcoin is an asset. its more then a traded property. it has function it has utility it has features that make it have use.bitcoin can do things far easier then fiat.you can move value between addresses without needing to request a bank authorise it.you can set up an offshore wealth store without needing lawyers, business registrations, bank account registrationsyou can set up family trust funds without bank managers, lawyers and contracts with middlemenplus many many more things you can do with bitcoin",

To me something has value if it can help people do things that they can't do right now, or it can help people do things that they can already do now, but in a much more efficient way.Some examples:- the car has value. Yes, people could go around with horses before, but the car allows people to move more efficiently;- the iPhone has value. Yes, people could make phone calls with mobile devices before, but iPhone was the first incredibly advanced device that expanded what people could do via mobile.What about Bitcoin. Bitcoin seen at the early stage definitely had value in its electronic currency version. People at that time could transfer money online (wire transfer, maybe PayPal), but there was no way to transfer money peer to peer all around the world almost instantly. Now there are tons of apps that allow the same thing: Venmo, Revolut, etc. Yes, it's true that Bitcoin allows you to transfer money without the need to create accounts on other platform, it's true that nobody can stop you from using your Bitcoins, etc, but I would not say that this changes the transfer of money much more efficiently...quite the contrary.Then we are left with something that definitely has a lot of potential (think about the blockchain), but we are still missing, in my opinion, a true user case that will improve how we do things more efficiently.",

The US is a society where producers specialize and trade their products with one another to get what they need to survive. The US government requires traders to give them US dollars whenever a trade occurs (i.e., taxes). This requirement is forced at the point of a gun. The US dollar is, at its core, a type of ticket that you must give to the government to allow you to live. That makes the US dollar valuable to your life. While it’s true that the US government can dilute the purchasing power of the US dollar, that doesn’t mean that it has no real value right now. A potential is not the same thing as an actual. As of now, the US government still exists, the massive capital infrastructure under its jurisdiction still exists, and its ability to tax trades between organizations or people who use this capital infrastructure is still strong. This is the basis for the US dollar’s real value.Bitcoin has no such basis or any other basis. Without a valid basis to justify why Bitcoin has real value, the proper default position to take is to assume that Bitcoin has no real value.The US dollar is not adherent to the gold standard anymore. There is no value to USD other than the U.S. government willing to support its usage. You can only trust USD as much as you can trust the U.S. government, which is to say very little. Bitcoin is supported by the free market, so it isn't actually any different from USD in your example. The U.S. government has already diluted the value over 90 percent since the creation of the federal reserve some number of decades ago. If value is siphoned off so quickly with a guaranteed decrease in purchasing power yearly due to inflation, how could you articulate that USD has real value while Bitcoin doesn't?If I can go into the market and trade my Bitcoin for goods and services, it has value.",

      "body": "Quote from: reasonspace on June 22, 2022, 02:21:39 AMThe fourth condition means it must already be considered a value before it can be used as a currency. If there isn’t independent support for its having value, the claim that Bitcoin has value is circular. See below:1. Bitcoin is a value because it can be used as a currency.2. Bitcoin can be used as a currency because it is a [long-term stored] value.Second, the fact that Bitcoin is finite doesn’t by itself make it a value. Scarcity does not determine whether something is a value or not. Scarcity only determines the price of something that is already determined to be a value because of another reason. For example, certain forms of toxic waste may be scarce but that doesn’t mean the waste is a value.It’s not circular your assumptions are just off. The two criterias for a store of value are:1. Scarcity(Supply relative to other goods).2. Durability(No loss in functionality with repeated use).These two alone don’t determine if the market will assign value to it, or if this will be used as money over everything else, but you can determine how good of a store of value it is with these. But to be actually used as one, it needs actual use by the market, and for this other conditions need to be met first.There’s a good theory of what actually becomes money by carl menger, he noticed that different goods have different degrees of saleability(marketability, how easy it is to do trade with a good), the most saleable good becomes the dominant money naturally, because it will become easier and easier to exchange with it. (That’s why fiat replaced gold).Money wasn’t founded by the state, it came into play naturally before all of this. There’s different degrees of quality of money, and if a central authority starts abusing it, it looses its beneficial function for everyone(Fiat). These are things menger predicted generations ago.Your toxic waste is scarce and durable, but terribly hard to do trade with, so the market won’t use it as money and it doesn’t get more and more value assigned to it. Bitcoin is scarce and durable, and becomes easier and easier to do trades with over time(the more the acceptability rises), so it’s on its way to become more dominant money, and will have more value assigned to it over time. We’re still in the first stages, that’s why the price will keep exploding, until it’s relatively stable.QuoteBitcoin has no such basis or any other basis. Without a valid basis to justify why Bitcoin has real value, the proper default position to take is to assume that Bitcoin has no real value.Bitcoin is becoming the highest quality money we have, and all that naturally, no state is needed for this. If you don’t get why it’s winning, you didn’t compare it to other forms of money yet.",
