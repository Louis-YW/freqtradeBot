  "content": "Hi India, We all know that Indian community has lagged far behind on this forum, even behind than countries which don't have their local boards, but let's try to accumulate ourselves again and try to grow together. Let's first start with making the list of the members with us. Please post below the post if you are Indian I'll add your name to the directory here, let's try to gather more and more Indians on the forum together and help each other grow.Legendary  WebtricksHeroTeosanruSenior  MemberJunior Member",

At the moment we are staying afloat with a handful of users. I like your initiative as it will help us to know how many Indians as here in the forum. Please add me to the directory.",
