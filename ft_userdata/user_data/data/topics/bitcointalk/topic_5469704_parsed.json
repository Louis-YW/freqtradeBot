  "content": "Through Oraichain integration with the Oasis Privacy Layer (OPL), now the Cosmos ecosystem opens itself to new privacy options and possibilities. Furthermore, the Oraichain has plans to upgrade its native OraiBridge into becoming a messaging framework, therefore strengthening its integration with the OPL and expanding Privacy Features beyond Cosmos, extending to Ethereum, Binance Chain, TRON and other networks in the future.https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/oraichain-integration-privacy-on-cosmosAlthough for the present moment, these features will be explored:• Cosmos-focused developer docs for OPL integration• Exploration of secret ballots for CW20• Confidential gaming tooling• Private market makers & MoreThis news is very exciting for what it implies for the Web 3 and DeFi space, as it opens the pathway for privacy enhanced cross-chain solutions beyond a single blockchain ecosystem.One of the potential use-cases that are possible through Oraichain's integration, is a confidential multi-chain DEX that is capable of providing confidential multi-chain transfers and swaps for the Cosmos ecosystem, like how Illuminex, Oasis Sapphire native DEX is able to do through the OPL. This might be already possible for the Cosmos Ecosystem if Oraichain's integration with OPL also enhances Oraichain's own native and cross-chain DEX, OraiDEX.https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/illuminex-grant-sapphire-dex",
