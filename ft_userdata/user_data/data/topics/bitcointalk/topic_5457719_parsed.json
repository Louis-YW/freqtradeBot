      "body": "Ok, i get it, you are trying to advertise your services here and you also selected the right thread which is good for you and yet i can see no one is interested in giving you any reply here. Why? well, the reason is many, and reasons also change with every member's mindset. The first one is, you are still a newbie so why we should trust you, well as trust is built by the amount of trust you get.Ok I get it, you are a newbie and it takes so much time to earn trust then you should show your samples and experience too. to gain some trust. As many people try to show fake samples too so you also have to prove your patent maybe.Be creative and keep growing, my intentions are not to discourage you, this platform might bring success to you if you are a legit person with real skills/team.",

Unless they are willing to be dedicated to only one brand until it becomes major, because it is impossible for someone to become an important person for 2 companies with the same business.",

Unless they are willing to be dedicated to only one brand until it becomes major, because it is impossible for someone to become an important person for 2 companies with the same business.Points to be noted, but i think, these services are even used by many middlemen because you can check on any freelancing platform that people are providing these services and getting orders. which indicates that there is demand for this skill too. But the question remains here that, the long-lasting/legit companies always preferred to have their own team for developing these empires from scratch, and by time they improve the team. So who are those people who hire services like these?I mean no disrespect as this work is also of great importance like maybe to some extent people might use these services like of course there are some people in the team of big exchanges too who hire others to do their work (which of course is not the right thing to do) but then there are other small exchanges to exist so they also need skills like these. I have this idea as i have joined so many new projects and i do know how many last and how many do not, but the work of every person behind it is really who is hired by the owner.",

      "body": "Since you provide a service that helps people build high-performance, scalable platforms, why would Average Joe want to develop their own platform? Most of us trade in the range of $2,000 per week, and the majority trade in the range of $10,000 per week. Even for those who want to develop platforms, there are peer-to-peer platforms that provide the user with all solutions, and he only has to, as an end user, be interested in promoting and increasing his trust rate. Why would he go into a spiral to create a platform completely from scratch, or pay a developer and a service to do so and evolve and take all the risks instead of using the current options and even some of them are open source?As an article, your writing of the article is good and you covered important key points.",
