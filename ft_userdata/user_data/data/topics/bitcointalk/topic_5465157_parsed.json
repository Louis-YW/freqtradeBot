Ajax will beat Ludogorets Razgrad again, where they scored 4 goals in the first match, but their win odds are very low. FC Sheriff and Karabag also play at home and are favourites. Maybe the away win of Olympiakos can be tried because their opponents are really weak. I think I'm skipping this game day. We don't have to bet every day.",

I don't think that there will be any miracle for Sevilla this season as they are in a very poor performance and started their league poorly. This is an opportunity for Klopp and his men to win the trophy.Roma is another club to watch out for but I don't think that they will be able to defeat Liverpool is they come in clash. Let's see the club that will be able to stop them. Today's match will be boring and I don't like watch it at this early stage. It is when the competition has gotten to the second round that I do enjoy every bit of the fun,because it is a knockout stage and every club with be playing their best to remain on the league.",

Famous last words. Quote from: swogerino on August 31, 2023, 04:17:27 PMI believe something has changed in the formula as I see Europa League made of only from teams who get eliminated from the Champions League in this preliminary qualification round which today are the final games to the group stages. Afaik nothing has been changed regarding Europa League qualifications in the last few years but you are almost right as majority of clubs in the 3rd qualifying  round (10 out of 14) indeed come from clubs eliminated in Champions League qualifications so no wonder that you got impression they were only CL clubs involved.Overall it is a total mess and I miss good old days when everything was much simpler but current system means more games which then equals to more money and that's what football is all about nowadays.",

Its difficult for predicting who will be the winner for UEFA Europe League season 2023/24 although many people have vote for Liverpool is strong teams candidate to win tittle in this season, regarding last season with many people favorite Premier League teams between Arsenal or Manchester United as the winner but they have eliminated early and not favorite teams Sevilla success become the winner. Current performance from Sevilla in domestic league seems they have chance drop from Champion League group stage, but any possibility happening in group phase how difficult moment right now for Sevilla will back to the top performance or not and how percentage chance finish in third place of Champion League group phase qualify for Europe League play-off round.",

Football is such a lucrative business today that FIFA really makes things the most profitable for both the clubs involved and for themselves. More matches and more money flowing, it's something to be expected from the industry today. This system is set up in such a way as to be mutually beneficial, but of course there are some parties who don't see it as something fun.",

We should follow Brighton's journey in the European league this season, how far will it go. Because it must be admitted, at the start of last season Brighton appeared extraordinary and consistent. Even since the start of the Premier League, Brighton has made it difficult for strong teams such as Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United. And this season they also seem to have started the season equally convincingly.Last season, Brighton also managed to reach the FA Cup semifinals. However, they lost on penalties to Manchester United who came out as runners-up. Interestingly, can Brighton this season be as consistent as last season and make a surprise in the European league for the first time?",

I have more attention for the two teams from the Premier League and Bundesliga. Liverpool, you can be sure, will be the favorite team as one of the strong challengers in this competition. However, we have not seen the good performance that Liverpool has shown in several matches in local competitions. but in any case, Liverpool is one of the favorite teams.Another one, a club from Germany, namely Bayern Leverkusen. I am interested to see how they play in this competition, I want to see how far Xavi Alonso will take his team to advance in the Europa League. including the teams that were relegated from the Champions League, who knows, maybe, several big clubs that failed in the champions league, will add to the excitement of this competition. Well, now we just need to wait for the Europa League to roll out.",

We don't have to bet every day.You are 100% correct that it is crucial to choose your bets carefully. It's not necessary to place a wager on each game day, particularly if the odds don't appear to be in your favour or there aren't many tempting possibilities. In the long run, it may be more advantageous to adopt a strategic approach and concentrate on games with higher probabilities or better odds. and it appears that you were right about Olympiakos! A 3-0 victory is a solid outcome. Lol",

What's more, Liverpool haven't played in the Europa League for a long time, so they are back this season just to win the trophy  I also think some of the teams that were eliminated in the champions league will provide more interesting competition in the European league this season. Last season belonged to Sevilla and this season I am sure they will not repeat this again if they have to be relegated from the Champions League.Maybe one eye will be on Xabi Alonso squad this season. Because Leverkusen can provide many surprises this season. Xabi Alonso is aiming for this trophy to decorate his coaching career in preparation for returning to Real Madrid if Ancelotti leaves later.",

It's not like that in other countries.If Liverpool lose their Premier League title chance then maybe they will concentrate on this tournament. Otherwise I don't think they will focus on this one. We will see a lot of rotation in the squad. Their group is fairly easy so I believe we will see more rotation than ever.

There is also fear for Liverpool because Al Ittihad are still very interested in signing Salah, tempting him with a very enticing deal. If he agrees, Liverpool will not be able to recover this season from his move and they will fail in the Europa.
