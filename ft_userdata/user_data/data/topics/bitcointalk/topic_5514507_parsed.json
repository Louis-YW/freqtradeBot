  "content": "Good day to members of this great community.From my research,reading and studies I saw alots about  Bitcoin and Altcoin which still don't get it clearly specifically (Altcoin) well,Bitcoin is reefers to the first largest cryptocurrency and  the most widely accepted and recognized cryptocurrency with a strong security of high market capitalization.Now I learnt that the Altcoin  was lunched after Bitcoin and it was created by various individuals less widely accepted and lower market capitalization, Although I got understood the bitcoin clearly but my questions is now base on this Altcoin,since it was created by various individuals,does Altcoin deals with a specific cryptocurrency or many cryptocurrency ?Would the experienced expertise provide a neccessary examples and breakdown of this Altcoin to my level of understanding?Thank you all for putting me through.",

This basically means that it is any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin They are usually used when, for one reason or the other, you can't or don't want to use Bitcoin So, no, they don't deal with specific cryptocurrency it is a general term that covers other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin and so on",

      "body": "Bitcoin has always been holding the majority of cryptocurrency market cap, and until that change, I think we will keep referring other crypto outside of Bitcoin as Altcoins. They come in many forms, from Ethereum to memecoins like Dogecoin. Not only does the functionality of altcoins span a wide range, from Ethereum supporting smart contracts to stablecoins pegged to real world assets anchoring their prices to them, but altcoins have generally lower market caps and less widespread adoption compared to Bitcoin. However, they do offer a lot of different functionalities that will further diversify the crypto market. That makes altcoins more than just alternatives to Bitcoin, some good altcoins actually would contribute to developing decentralized applications and finance.",

However saying that bitcoin is the first crypto currency is also very correct but may seem a little vague for someone who really Keens into the contents of that article. Now personally I really never thought bitcoin was the first attempted crypto currency even before I read an article like this back then. And my reason was simply because in order to create something as secure, sophisticated and complex as bitcoin there must have been a couple of failed attempts in the past even if they weren't publicised.The idea of calling bitcoin the first crypto currency is because it was the FIRST SUCCESSFUL  crypto currency not really because it was the first attempted. Also generally the term altcoins was implemented to other coins so people literally call any coin that isn't Bitcoin and altcoin.Others like; meme coins,  and shit coins are like sub terms under altcoin. The idea  of altcoins was alternate coins aside the first crypto currency (BITCOIN) which was the cryptographic break through.",

Firstly let's start with this;Quote from: MeGold666 on October 23, 2024, 12:54:08 PMIt wasn't the first successful cryptocurrency; others were as well (in the beginning), but they failed due to centralization and all the problems that come with it.Here you are actually contradicting your self by saying it was successful and later failed because If it failed in the first place then it obviously wasn't successful. From you point of view you are literally saying that any coin or project that was launched is a successful project. Take BitConnect (BCC) launched in 2016 like some other coins before bitcoin did, and later became worthless in just a couple of months, would you call that successful?Now for this part of your reply;Quote from: MeGold666 on October 23, 2024, 12:54:08 PMIt was not a cryptographic breakthrough; it was a novel concept called \"Proof of Work\" to address the double-spending problem.The cryptography behind Bitcoin was well known, but the way it was used was a breakthrough.Before bitcoin, there was no successful coin that made use of cryptography you are also simply contradicting yourself here because both Proof of Work (POW) and Proof of stake (POS) are crypto graphic terms because they are applied in Cryptography. If bitcoin wasn't a breakthrough as the first successful crypto currency then what will you call it?",
