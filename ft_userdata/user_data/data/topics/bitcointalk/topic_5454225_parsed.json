How did you become aware that your friend is struggling with gambling addiction, and what actions have you taken to help them to over it?It is easy to know a friend that is an addict because friends do reveal themselves to other friends if they are gambling. About family, you should try and study how all your family member react to situations. If you see any of your family checking phone or laptop, happy before and just gone say like mood swing, that is one of the first sign of something to be going wrong which can be gambling. It is good to also educate your children in all areas of life, including the side effects and negative impacts of gambling.",

If you're really close to them then it won't be difficult to spot them most times you won't even have to do anything they will be the one come up to you and seek for your advice directly, but that will only be possible if you're the open type and the non-judging type.I have helped with other addictions aside gambling and most times when I see that the case is more than waht I can handle I do refer them to those who have had similar problem in the past and have overcome them for advices, and this type is very effective since the person has had an experience and won't jsut be talking or giving advice based on some studies but instead it will be based on what they themselves did that helped them.",

He is banned for eight months, not for life.^ Definitely right and in fact from the article.Quote(\"We consider this matter closed and look forward to welcoming Ivan back to training in September and seeing him representing Brentford in the Premier League in January.\")On our side, if this happens in real life, if you suspect that someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, you can show this situation with empathy, understanding, and support. Let your friend know that you are there for them and willing to support their journey to recovery. Offer to accompany them to have a long off-town vacation if they feel comfortable with it. It is important not to enable their addiction by providing them with money for gambling or covering up their financial losses. Instead, encourage healthy lifestyle alternative activities.",

How did you become aware that your friend is struggling with gambling addiction, and what actions have you taken to help them to over it?To be fair, the gambling was actually fine, the dumb thing was betting on his own club. Now that's dumb. Afaik player contracts don't allow them to bet on ANY of their matches at the very least, maybe even in the competition that they're in. I'm surprised it wasn't a complete ban even, just an 8 month one. Now I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't get another case, which means he had a pretty good therapy, if he ever did have one. I've never had a friend become an addict, well at least not yet. And I honestly don't think any action I do can do anything to help. I'd just be a hypocrite if it ever did happen really. I firmly believe addiction has no cure, you just, well, put it on another thing, which is the best-case solution in most cases.",

I didn't borrow money because again, I don't have a steady job to pay and I doubt that anyone will lend me money.

He does not abuse alcohol, does not smoke, he is not someone too that talks to plenty women as well, but his major challenge in life is his gambling addiction. Attempts to stopping for him usually does not work out because just soon after, he will hear a news about someone somewhere who has won a big amount from gambling or something else that triggers him, and that gets to him so much that he usually starts gambling again. The advice I have given him is that he should try to cut off from some of his other friends that are chronic gamblers as well and avoid discussions about gambling. Trying to recover from gambling and then keeping friends that still gamble a lot, or reminiscing about gambling is a way not to get full recovery from the addiction.",
