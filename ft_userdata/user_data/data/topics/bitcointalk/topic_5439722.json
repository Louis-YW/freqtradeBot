  "content": "Active investments require work and follow-up in order to yield results. A day trader needs to be actively buying and selling to make money, while a buy and hold trader invests in a more passive way. In the world of cryptocurrencies, someone who buys or sells trying to guess whether the price is going up or down makes a more active investment while someone who buys Bitcoin not to sell until at least the next cycle makes a more passive investment. We can apply this not only to investments, but to work as well. A lawyer or surgeon, no matter how much they earn, depends on their work to earn money, while someone who writes books, invests his time in a more passive way: once the book is written, he has invested some time, but the book continues to sell for a long time afterwards (assuming it is successful).There are ways that are neither black nor white. Someone who has a YouTube channel or a blog with some success, the old videos or posts continue to get views and generate money even though he no longer spends time on them, but he has to actively continue to update the channel or blog so that it doesn't decline.I used to follow a blog a while back that had a lot of views and was monetized. The author suddenly stopped updating the blog without explanation (not sure if he died or what), and it continued having visits and generating money but little by little, with the passage of time, the visits were declining and I guess that today will be close to 0.I have relatively passive investments like buying stocks or Bitcoin to hold, but in terms of time invested, in terms of work, I've always done active work. I've been thinking about in the future starting some project that can bring me passive income once the work is done and so I'm curious to see if some of you do such work and/or what ideas you have about it. Normally the problem with work that can bring you passive income in the future is that you have to be working for 0 for a some time to possibly monetize it in the future, so it is better to be focused on a topic that you are passionate about and do not mind devoting free hours because you may spend a year or more on the project and end up monetizing nothing or very little.",

Both a lawyer and a surgeon have to take a lot of time to perfect what they're doing so they don't mess up and end up ruining someone else's life, the same could be true of investing if you invest more than you can afford to lose, don't understand what you're doing or are trying to chase large returns from the promises of a medium article or a dev team who says their coin will do well...",

I have a full-time job and I am also considering starting up an enduring passive income source.For now, my focus is the agricultural sector. I intend to get land and plant some cash crops, in my case I am focusing on oil palm trees. These plants have a lifespan of more than fifty years. It will take about five years to mature and start producing. But once it starts, I will be able to get a passive income stream that could last for forty years. The beauty of the plan is that you don't need to be on the farm all the time to maintain the trees. These trees can also be leased to local palm oil producers.",

      "body": "Passive income in this industry I guess is through long term holding which means an investor would disregard any decline on the market prices and will only focus on futuristic price potential. Outside this industry is through other investments such as owning a business wherein you could hire professionals to run it for you to not be required of moving an inch to generate profit. Others could be some sort of staking wherein the price is expected to increase for a long run. In either of these cited examples won't save you from risk. Wether it is a passive or active income, risk will always be involved. No passive income I believe has consistent profit growth.",

I'm still searching for methods of passively investing in agriculture.Preferably in items that will be deflationary in supply over the long term. Or which are likely to grow in demand. To an extent US markets have witnessed this with chicken and egg shortages. Where a passive investment in chickens or eggs could reap rewards if deflationary trends continue.\"Demise of globalisation\" trends are shifting production towards local sources. Over the long term, this could make stockpiling of aluminum cans and plastic (Polyethylene terephthalate) bottles more profitable than they have been in past eras.I have big plastic containers outside that are around 12 square feet each. All of the weeds and random bushes I pull go into the plastic containers. Where they will passively decompose into potting soil. I have thought about posting advertisements to do free pick ups for cut down trees, leaves, bushes and plants. To mass decompose cubic yards of waste, into compost or potting soil, as a passive process. I will have to see how my initial tests go to get an idea of the proportion and quality of soil I can expect to produce from a certain cubic yardage of waste.Agriculture is a decent approach for my area. I guess which modes of passive investment work best do trend towards being regional specific. Unless we're talking about side hustles and internet investments, which could be on declines considering reports of youtuber revenues being cut.",

Truthfully, how many people are satisfied with their earnings these days? So, many need this but the nature of their primary job matters in the choice of the passive income they can do, especially if they do not want to do away with that job.For now, the best passive means of income are trading/investing, authoring books, freelancing, blogging, problem-solving, creativity and many more. One could choose the ones that are good for their person and go for them during their free periods. As for me, trading/investing and book writing are my own, and I hope I will forever benefit from them even beyond my hope.",

      "body": "There are not many genuinely passive ways to earn income. You have to put in a lot of work to establish your business or side hustle and then put in work to keep it alive. Otherwise, like in your example the income eventually goes to zero. The only truly passive income that comes to my mind right now is investing in productive assets (non-crypto), like stocks that generate revenue.I owe several blogs and YouTube channels and can tell you that these income streams will dry off if you abandon them. However, it happens gradually and you can consider it passive income until it dries off.What works for me is doing something I enjoy so it doesn't feel like a job so there is a lesser chance that I abandon it. You mentioned it as well and I think that's the ticket.I can suggest some projects in which you can invest your time and earn without directly exchanging your time for money. Let's call them semi-passive ways to earn money:- Investing in mutual funds - this is the closest to passive income you can get.- Real estate rental properties - people call it passive income, but it is still a lot of work.- Royalty-based businesses - selling your photos, videos, music, etc. This is great if you have a passion or a creative talent.- Selling digital products, such as e-books or courses, can generate passive income if you put lots of time up-front.- Affiliate marketing - you can earn a commission on sales if you have some kind of following, on social networks or a readership on your blog for example.",

I have written some stuff before and even though it had little traction, it was a test attempt and had some good imagination level. I realized at that moment that I could definitely write a book, or at least write an outline for one, but then actually writing itself takes a lot of talent to be good, what you write matters but how you write it matters even more.

Nor of agriculture either from what I remember from your previous posts. Chickens, and the eggs they lay, require active labor, and if you want to take it as a business activity even more so. The only form of passive labor I can think of in farming is typical of large landowners. Buy a lot of land and pay people to farm it for you, checking in only once in a while.  Quote from: EarnOnVictor on February 13, 2023, 03:49:13 PMTruthfully, how many people are satisfied with their earnings these days?

Your post is giving credence to natural skills that can be monitized unknowingly and without conscious effort. I understand it that way because some people are natural writers and working on newspaper houses gives them an edge as they are working on what they naturally have flair on like hobby while they still get paid for it, and in this regard talking about having passive income , they can publish books that they unintentional write because they have that natural ability to do so. This kind of passive income will not even been classified as such because they continuously have royalty paid to them in cash and recognition. What we call passive may not be so for some people and if you have someone who natural likes talking going into MC jobs or comedy, they are paid for what they like doing already. I think the best is when you build a future where you can earn even in your absence, dead or alive is more fulfilling and you can only achieve that by being independent and working by yourself doing what is passive for you and earning royalty from it.",

Of course, the difference between active and passive here is that active can bring regular profits if a person is good at it, whereas long-term hodling can easily have months when it's unreasonable to withdraw anything because it will be at a loss.If you mean something outside cryptos, having an extra flat you can rent to someone else is a good passive investment (at least, in my country), and it comes with regular profits too.
