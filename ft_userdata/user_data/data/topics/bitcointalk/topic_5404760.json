  "content": "El Salvador continues to benefit from the bear market by using it to its advantage and buying more bitcoin. Many individuals believe that because El Salvador is a poor country and because utilizing bitcoin as legal cash has little impact on adoption of the currency. If more wealthy nations had adopted it, it would have made more sense for additional nations to do so as well, and acceptance of bitcoin would have spread more quickly and been embraced by more nations.The government holds significant number of BTC (i.e taxpayers money) and has stocked more now. If these are the reserve and the price doesnâ€™t go up within the possible time theyâ€™re hoping so, it can be a big disaster to them. However, I hope they continue to use the USD for everyday transactions and that this is merely a short-term problem. As for adoption among El Salvadorans, I've read that it's not that common; hence, it won't have a significant impact on the majority. But when the price has suddenly dropped like this, it can, of course, deter other nations from adopting.",

Taking advantage of the dip now is a good strategy at positioning the economy of the country in a good economic boom in less than no time. He has proven himself to be a Bitcoin lover and an advent follower of the Crypto industry. As a pro Crypto nation, I believe the nationals would make good use of this opportunity to fill their bag this bear market while waiting for bull run.I pray other nations sees the good in blockchain and give it a try allowing their citizens be a part of the industry without any much stringent rules.",

Time will tell who is right but there's no denying that an opportunity period is ongoing. Who wants to stay ahead of the competition, will take the risk and others won't take any action. We have to remember that fortune favors the brave. You can't win if you don't try! The president of El-Salvador is definitely bullish about bitcoin so he took the right decision to include more bitcoins into the national treasury at a dirt cheap price.",
