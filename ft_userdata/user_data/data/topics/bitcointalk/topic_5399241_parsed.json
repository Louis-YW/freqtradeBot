He admitted that he took €56,000 and impersonated (the solicitor),” Det. Garda Fuller said. O’Connell was actually a client of the solicitor he impersonated. The defendant had a gambling and alcohol addiction.The phone calls and texts – supposedly from the solicitor - to the victim were a work of fiction by 48-year-old Thomas O’Connell who did not stop until he got his hands on every euro of the €56,000 the victim had inherited.",

If this bonus have been given knowing that the user is gonna end gambling, then the gambling platform too is wrong. Myself too have similar experience playing with bonus when I was in long break from gambling, and from my experience it is always good to have self control.",

The only person wrong here is the bettor, whom according to the story is a gambling as well as achohol addict, when he (the bettor) decided to close his gambling account with Boyle Sports in other to enable him control he's gambling urge, why didn't he also unsubscribe himself from Boyle Sports mailing list? Doing this would have burnt every bridge and closed or stopped any form or kind of temptation that would want to make him go back, but now he ended up falling back due to a $50 free betting bonus.",

What do you think who was in the wrong ? I think both the bettor and the Boyle Sports were in the wrong. It's not really complex if you understand the mindset of a compulsive gambler, this kind of gambler will do anything and everything just to continue gambling, losing or winning he will not stop gambling and when caught he will blame everybody that he can blame or will include people to his crime if he has a crime committed, and this story is just an example of it.The casino is partly to blame for keep feeding him and baiting him to play but they can defend their action by stating there's a glitch in the system or there is a 24 hours pause period, either way, the gambler is the one to blame, and since he pleads guilty he should be rehabilitated and make him pay for the damages.",

Whales who lost their fortunes gambling are an interesting trend.QuoteMeet The Man Who Lost $200 Million Gambling In Vegas… IN ONE YEAR!Las Vegas has a name for big time, big money gamblers. They are called whales and they are the lifeblood of every casino on the Strip. When a whale lands in your casino and starts betting tens of thousands (or more!) dollars at a time, executives do whatever it takes to keep him or her happy and gambling in your casino. In terms of whales, Nebraska-born businessman Terry Watanabe was a whale of a whale. Actually, he was a whale of a whale, of a whale, of a whale of a whale. During a year-long gambling streak, Terry lost a mind melting $204 million dollars at two Vegas casinos. Both gambling halls are owned by Harrah's Entertainment, Inc. and Watanabe's staggering losses alone accounted for 5.6% of gambling revenue for the parent company that year. Who is Terry Watanabe and how did this truly shocking gambling loss go down?(story continues at link below)https://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/entertainment-articles/meet-man-lost-200-million-gambling-vegas-one-year/The above story is an example of a whale losing $200 million to gambling addiction. There are other whales who also lost a lot of money.It seems that gambling addiction affects everyone from the rich to the poor. I wonder if its gambling that is at fault. Or whether some lack impulse control. Perhaps they don't know how to lose gracefully and never back down from a gambling fight. Its sad. But its real life.",

In the story you have shared, the gambler just didn't use the account and decided to stop but emails won't be stopped sending because there's no unsubscription action done by the bettor.The bettor is wrong here because if the dedication to stop gambling is serious, whatever promotional emails they received are supposed to be ignored.

Indeed, some gambling platforms like this won't let any users lose and they give sweet things to get those users back.Isn't there a stipulation that should be related to gambling addiction and on a platform? Sometimes there are platforms that provide services related to gambling addiction, but I also doubt whether it really works or not. Because once again if they lose a user, they lose one of the income.In this case, he tried but failed because of sweet effort from the site, this will exactly destroy the willingness to stop Quote from: fiulpro on May 18, 2022, 06:41:18 PMThe person was not infact gullible since to fuel his gambling addiction he scammed his family member and then went to court and pleaded guilty as well blamed it all on the Boyle Sports.No matter who he is, even if it's part of the family, if he is at fault, he should be.

It just says the casino \"has sent him him a €50 free bet\", so I got confused. Moreover, Boyle Sports is a popular brand in Ireland (where the story happened) and United Kingdom with more than 320 franchises total. It made me thought the man could be betting presentially at one of the houses of the brand. That is why I think the casino's approach to this man should be made more clear by the media covering the case.",

When a user of a platform would want to exclude himself, the platforms should stop sending emails of the bonuses and just don't let him access the website at all. This isn't really a problem from the gambler but from the both of the gambler and the one who've sent the promotion. If an addict tried and let himself change, no one should urge him the opposite. Yet, some websites are really desperate whenever they know that someone is addicted to gambling and they will keep making him play more.",
