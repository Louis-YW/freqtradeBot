Just imagine say you comot for your house by 4am just to go bank ATM to withdraw money. You come reach there see say people plenty and na you be like number 99. And ontop of this sef na only one machine dey dispense money. And still on top of this na only one bank out of the three banks for your area wey their ATM dey dispense. And still on still, the ATM wey dey your area still dey select banks. Even to go use POS , you go pay 5h charge for 5k and 1k charge for 10k withdrawal. Nobody fot tell me say this one nor pass stress...na suffering be this one.",

Why wait in queue for new money when the old one is still very accessable through pos that you just need 100 naira for each 5k you want to collect. Why we dey wan die for this new naira like say nobi d same currency we dey use before. We just dey over hype the thing, even before CBN postpone the date of depositing the old note, personally I no been dey worry about the deadline as if there's one thing Nigerian is known for na postponing of dates and that's one of the reasons we aren't taking things serious in this country.Sha for me na fuel oh, but I no dey too queue like dat, na person wey dey fine low price dey over queue. My own be say make I just get the fuel and na for very early morning hours I dey do my waka, get the fuel I want, go house power my Device dem then begin the hustle.
