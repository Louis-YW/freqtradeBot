  "content": "How many of you thought that cloud mining Bitcoin was the easiest way to avoid spending money on asic miners? I was one of those people and the experience was half good and half bad.I started my Bitcoin mining through cloud mining using Genesis Mining and Eobot, this went on for months and got my payment like their mining calculators revealed, this brainwashed me, thinking why the heck do people spend money on Asic miners when they can do this, I called them fools, not knowing I was the fool. I will like to show some prove of the hash powers I bought And around this, I had a dream, to make 0.16BTC in 4 months, here is the prove It wasn't up to 2 months that the cloud mining payout goes incredibly lower and I had no choice than to quit, I withdraw some funds successful and later the cloud mining stop working, one closed down and the other (EOBOT) took a bit longer to close down as well. I created this thread to share my painful past ecoerimece with cloud mining, because today, some beginners are still thinking they can get away with Bitcoin mining using cloud mining service. No legal cloud mining service can run anything right now because they are not profitable to run. If you see any new cloud mining it's a scam, there is no way they can make profit for you and themselves anymore, the few that are legit between 2015 to 2017 are no more functioning. The days where Bitcoin mining was cheaper is unfortunately no more. No Asic miners, No Bitcoin mining.",

I was so close in investing heavily with these not until I've read those concerned forum members telling that someone shouldn't be too invested on it. Because if you see some good offers giving you hash power and you'll rent it to them, it's like you're just mining numbers and not real Bitcoin. With that, the cloud mining company, known or not can easily stop their cloud mining operations anytime without prior notice. There's another option of mining through nicehash with the use of GPU and you'll get paid in Bitcoin. It's like sharing your hashpower to them but it's likely you get to share your profit to them or vice versa.",

That was how they lost everything and they couldn't trace the anonymous bitcoin mining, even when they lost their money, they were first at denial stage, it took them month before they finaly agreed that their money is gone for good, they didn't understand how mining works in bitcoin and that is what some people still don't understand till today.",

However, how much money (or BTC) were you projecting to earn every day? I have almost zero knowledge regarding mining; the only experience I have was through Nicehash quite a few years ago. Thus, I neither know nor recall how much hashing power is considered decent. I see your calculations on paper, and it mentions something as little as $0.04 per day; is that the actual amount you were earning? If yes, how much did you spend in order to get started?On the one hand, I find it quite logical that something such as cloud mining can't compete with actual ASICs; otherwise, no one would purchase them, but on the other hand, there are still platforms that appear to be showing relatively decent yields, such as Binance's newest cloud mining addition, but personally, even though it's a trusted platform, I wouldn't bother.",

Of course it would perform well, of course it would beat you in hash power, of course it's going to yield more money for less the cost when it comes to electricity. All these things are taken into account into creating a pretty solid bitcoin miner, I don't think this needs to be emphasized anymore. But I digress, just cause every other miners pale in comparison to ASIC, doesn't mean they are already obsolete, they still could really push for profit, just don't expect staggering amounts,",

Cloud mining is profitable if you don’t expect high gains. You can’t have your cake and eat it too basically.

The main characteristic of them is that they won't last long because this type of scam is not sustainable.2. The partial scamsThese are services that have actual hashrate and at the start they may even be legitimate services that might even be honest too but eventually they realize that they can not pay their \"investors\" while making profit themselves not to mention that the profit their investors earn is small so they can't attract enough money.So they too start becoming a Ponzi scheme by selling fake hashrate and go the same direction the first group went.This group lasts longer though.This is why people always say all cloud mining services are scams and should be avoided.",
