I guess some reputable managers would take far less than that. And also, never send funds first to a new manager or to one who is first timer. It might be risky , ; you must use escrow with them.Also, I have sent you my proposal just now as well. Although competition is tough, I hope you find the best manager for yourself",

What can you offer that they cannot? Why should participants trust you to pay them when you could run with the money at any time? 10% of the budget is a lot. A campaign that pays people $100 with 20 participants has a monthly budget of 8000 dollars, so you'd like to be paid 800 a month for a few hours of work. That's a good deal for a newbie, don't you think?",
