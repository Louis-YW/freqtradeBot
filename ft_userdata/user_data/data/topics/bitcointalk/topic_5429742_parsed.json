Unfortunately, you may not have many chances to copy his bets or take public advice from him, since I believe he is technically ban-evading (I don't know the duration of his previous ban, so I could be wrong).It is just matter of time untill someone reports him or something.

You have a time to tell here about you going rich and buying things on your win while you can’t provide data that will support your picks rather trusting you alone which is very hard to do given with your current status.Congratulations in your win. Even we doubted you or not that bet slip is yours and not ours. So we can’t push ourselves to bet on your pick if didn’t want it to. I think you can gain follower now on your next pick since you already prove some validity on your preferred picks. Just be consistent and less talk on useless things that off topic to your bets.",

One thing I want to tell you guys and not promoting stake but they offer refunds on split decision UFC losses so if you had a bet on Strickland you basically get refunded. As a fellow gambler telling you the offers I know that may help you get more value from the same bet plus they have enhanced odds on UFC.",
