The United States?Chinese government is looking for all possible ways to ban bitcoin but United States are looking for more ways to regulate exchanges and cryptocurrencies. Quote from: Crypt0Gore on April 18, 2023, 07:09:48 AMI read an article that says that upon the ban of Cryptocurrencies in China over 30 million Chinese are using Crypto in the country.China has even banned bitcoin more than eight or nine times.Immediately after the last ban, bitcoin mining hashrates generated by Chinese went to zero. Chinese miners are the second with the highest bitcoin mining hashrates now, while United States miners are on the top list. After the ban, we later knew that considering bitcoin as a property in China is a legal. Quote from: Crypt0Gore on April 18, 2023, 07:09:48 AMBanning crypto is no more effective on crypto itself, it's now more like a pure joke, I would still like to see the U.S embrace crypto more than China, just my own answer to my question, what about you?Government like control, but the technology which is blockchain that bitcoin came with is too decentralized for the government to handle and put under themselves. The government will be the government, but even many government officials like bitcoin.",

While Trple-A puts the Chinese percentage to be 5.5%, which is 31.06 million people.Regardless of the accurate figure, the fight against crypto is a lost course.",

Most policies are debated in the legislative houses before enactment and implementation. Individuals and corporate bodies can sue the government because of any perceived unfriendly policy. This is not the case of China where all the powers rest on an individual or group of individuals. The legislative arm and the courts are puppets of the executive arm of government. From the above analysis, it is clear that the US will always be more friendly to cryptocurrencies than China except there is a change in the attitude and belief of the ruling class toward Bitcoin and others. The government of China wants to always have strict control over the financial and other activities of its citizen. But the US will move towards regulation which might not be effective because some states still have some level of autonomy.",

As for me i would prefer China welcoming crypto in full than the US, While because they are major importers and exporters which i think would bring a huge progress to bitcoin. There's no country that doesn't imports from China.QuoteI read an article that says that upon the ban of Cryptocurrencies in China over 30 million Chinese are using Crypto in the country. It is very much possible for a country that is ban of using cryptocurrency to greatly surge in number of usage, just take my country Nigeria as for an example. We were restricted from trading cryptocurrencies to our various local bank account, few weeks after the announcement the population increased uncontrollably, So i think that is what happened to China.",

I don't know if they realize the potential of cryptocurrency and are looking to adopt it. But I see most clearly that they are trying to collect taxes, and cryptocurrency adoption in countries is focused on enacting regulations and taxing investors. Regulations and taxes are inevitable, but it's still better than having them ban us outright.",

That is the reason cryptocurrency and bitcoin will continue to flourish. Many countries are in battle of economic control of the rest of the countries. And these countries that are always in this secret battle tend to oppose one another in terms of decision-making relating to economic development. This is exactly why if China Bans cryptocurrency, United States will try to embrace cryptocurrency and regulate it. And any day that United States thinks of banning cryptocurrency, you will see a competitive or rivalry country will embrace bitcoin. This is the reason bitcoin will continue to flourish amidst controversies.",

Bitcoin has uplifted its users from hardship and this a good impact,the US government understands this fact and that is why the US government will not ban crypto but regulate it so that both the citizens and government will be happy using bitcoin. As for China,the president wants everyone to see him as god. That is why he is why he wants to have controversy over their financial life by banning bitcoin and other crptocurrency. I still believe that as time goes when bitcoin have started conquering almost in all countries and China has seen the value that bitcoin is adding to the lives of those countries,he will shameful remove the ban on crypto in China.",

The latter can literally make you disappear if they don't like you, and your family won't be able to do shit about it. Whereas in the US, you can evade the law for a long time and you can even get out of the country when things go out of hand. Compared to China, who often employs drastic measures to eliminate those deemed enemies of the state, the US is still relatively lenient.Even still, people will still find a way to play around these bans and restrictions, as they always have throughout history.

There is simply no possible way to ban it and that’s what power of public ledger mean in broader sense. If it wasn’t for blockchain through millions of computers then it should have been for nothing. The technology is literally being explored and used by various governments for their own purposes. Let’s say data vault.
