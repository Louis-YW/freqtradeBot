Im in Monaco spain and france area  I would assume that the process is no different than if you were selling it for cash. You might have to declare any change in the value of the crypto from the time it’s received until the time you sell it for tax purposes, but there’s nothing special you have to do outside of that. The most difficult part would be finding someone willing to spend their crypto on a vehicle, but once that’s lined up it should be as simple as making the transfer and dining the papers.",

Im in Monaco spain and france area  You can post ads on regional websites that facilitate the sale of goods for cash. Just say, \"Hey, I take BTC or whatever.\". You could also upload your ad to the OpenBazaar marketplace, but I believe that option has since closed. Or perhaps a brand-new decentralized market place LibertyTown that supports anonymous transactions. However, I don't believe it will be helpful in your situation.",

Im in Monaco spain and france area  Regrading selling car it is a very long procedure cause if they also pay with crypto than there will be a lot of things to be considered. You might sell Car in Monaco cause it is just s Tax free country. Other countries have very high taxes too. So I will say that you should sell it through Cash. And it would be more suitable for you. That's also depends upon you.",

Im in Monaco spain and france area  Easier way would be to first exchange Bitcoin for cash using p2p exchange and than just buy car with cash.Problem is that some countries have limitations for cash purchases, and you would need to check law for that in Monaco, Spain and France.You could also try making one ad asking to buy a used car and add Bitcoin as one of accepted payment method, among others.I saw Bitpay is offering a way to buy cars with Bitcoin, so you could research this option more.ImportMarques is one of the websites in Europe that accept Bitcoin with Bitpay.https://bitpay.com/blog/how-to-buy-a-car-with-bitcoin/There is one more website but it only operates in UK and Ireland:https://www.autocoincars.com/",

Im in Monaco spain and france area  It is good you want to sell your car for Crypto as a means of payment. If I may ask why do you want to sell off your car by accepting Crypto as a means of payment? Are you trying to evade tax payment just like a member said here or what? Well if you deem it right to sell your car for Crypto, that is my an issue it would also create a good business link for you though. This is also one of the functions of bitcoin no much stress or third party involved and less transaction fees to pay with a swift transfer.  In this case, if you are trying to make your deal confidential peer to peer would be much better to get involved with so as not to create awareness of your transaction. You would only need to change ownership which would not be an issue if any inquiry comes up about the ownership of the car.",

On my part, I don't see how transacting directly with Bitcoin should  be a  problem. All OP has to do is get someone who also will want to transact in Bitcoin. Get an escrow to receive and release funds once deal is reported to have been done/executed. Buying with Bitcoin, is in fact, the easiest way once you've factored in the volatility.",
