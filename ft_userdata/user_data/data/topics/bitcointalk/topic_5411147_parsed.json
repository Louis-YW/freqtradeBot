  "content": "So I have been recently trying out some games in womplay and here I earned some NFT. I got lucky today and got a $53 worth of NFT from one of the games. I have already cashed out about $10 worth of EOS but I'm having a hard time selling the one worth $53 in their market. I'm not sure if there is a alot of users in it. Have you guys used it? Would it be possible to sell the NFT I got in another platform?",
