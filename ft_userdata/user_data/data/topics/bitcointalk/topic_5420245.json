      "body": "Well, at least you earn something while playing. I personally enjoy playing solitaire, so for me, it would be like a win-win situation if it wasn't for the high withdrawal levels and fees.The issue with this sort of game is much like faucets in that you have high withdrawal levels that prevent the big majority of players from withdrawing their earnings. It either that or the site ceases to exist...That is about why anyone will tell you that is not worthwhile.",

Though there are some user review on googleplay that can give us hint on the potential of the game just like this one...Quote from: SatoshiWise JanxUnlike others, my wife and I have been winning quite often, about 40% of the time. You just have to know how to play. ;-) Wish adds could be muted and just watched. Have to play the game with the sound off to get through the adds. Oh, and the 10% referral is awesome. I got 50 SATs when my friend hit 500 SATs! I've found that I can easily stack a penny or two in SATs every day.Quote from: Lanatsa on November 09, 2022, 09:59:38 PMI would be tending to  download these games later on and would find out.

That is another good way of getting BTC I also know a site that offers some tasks it is called https://jobs.stakwork.com/workers, mentioned by a blog of Pouch.com.  I like their banner slogan.Quote from: Yogee on November 09, 2022, 10:23:09 PMAnd now that the market is crashing rewards must increase even more, so it might worth to work on those tasks for now and save the rewards for the future, once bitcoin gains more traction again.

It would be best to try it from your backup phone. Although the money in the gaming industry is huge, they are not approaching the Bitcoin circle. In fact, if investors try to make better quality games by contracting with big game companies, the prevalence of Bitcoin will increase even more. I've looked at a few of these games, but I want a game where I can earn money while playing, to be of good quality. These games are very low level games. There is still a big gap in the market in this regard. I don't understand why the gaming industry still hasn't made a big splash in the Bitcoin space.",

Playing on this games is not worthy at all because it consumed too much time rather do the regular faucet that only asked for a captcha.

Because we would discuss the obvious reasons why not to install these games?You earn minuscule amounts and you're not going to make the minimum withdrawal in months!They bombard you with thousands of ads after each level during each game, three times before the game starts six times during the game?The games are just crappy games that rival the ones I was playing on my 486s 20 years ago?That it obviously states it shares and maybe sells your data.That the payment is between 5 and 1000 satoshi, which makes the lowest amount 1/10 of a cent now worth even a charge of your smartphone once a year? The fact that are trying to sell you upgrades to earn more satoshi and you end up paying for \"winning\" plans in which you will never recover your money?That once you reach higher levels you will need to spend more gems than the game is giving you for free and you have to actually buy if you want to play more than 5 games a day. And one \"wagon\" of gems is just 50$? While the full prize pool is 5$ a day?Interestingly that you made a moderated topic, and handpicked the good reviews on google, ignoring the multitude of bad reviews, actually I'm amazed you managed to get a few good ones, and clearly stipulated you don't want to hear anything bad about them.Why?",

It is a pity that the creators of popular games don't add a similar feature, which would create a micro-revolution in bitcoin adoption. It's just incomprehensible how the user base would expand bitcoin because millions of people play the games. If thinking about bitcoin popularizing, then need to look in this direction. The games that OP briefly described in his post will attract their audience, but are unlikely to become mega-popular hits, and yet, there are still few games with a reward of satoshi. The fact that it appear, even if slowly, is still a movement for bitcoin, albeit a small one, but forward.",

Look at axie and how it crashed, not because of the market or anything, it crashed before that and of course the bear market made it impossible for it to recover. But the mindset is the same, games will always crash until they fix one thing which is \"how do you sell and not drop in price\".Games will have tokens that pay you, and you earn that by playing, and after you earn it then you sell it, and there needs to be a lot of buyers to keep the price up. Unfortunately that is not always that much possible, most games don2t have that many buyers.",
