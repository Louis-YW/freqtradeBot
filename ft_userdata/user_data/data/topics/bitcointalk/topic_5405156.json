  "content": "Hi, i'm new in the forum and i'm french, so not very good in english, sorry...I'm downloading a node with bitcoin core but, since 4 days, i can't continue to download ( it's at 75%).Computer closed bitcoin core and when i try to open it, there is this message : \"Error opening block data base\" or in french ( erreur d ouverture de la base de données de blocs ).They ask me if i want to built again the data base now but if i put \"ok\", it stop.I m not very potent with computer but i'd like to have a node to participate in the decentralization.Iwill learn with time...Is anyone know how to restart it?I m with windows 11 and i download on 1T hard disk.I tryed to stop firewall to restart and i have read something with \"-reindex\" but i can't find how to do.Thanks for your attentionChristophe",

You may also edit the properties of the “icon/shortcut” you have, and add that parameter to the command.Tell us if it solves the problem or if problem persists.",

(use it only once since it will trigger reindex again if reused)",

As mentioned, the blockchain is currently nearing 500gigabytes... so unless you have at least 500 GB of free space... there is a chance your node is simply running out of storage space and is unable to download any more blocks.",
