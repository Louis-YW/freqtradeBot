If the deal between both of you was contacted after \"2023-05-16\" then you made a huge mistake of trusting an account that has both negative tag and active flag against him/her.I doubt if anything can be done at this stage if the account was free from neg-tag probably some DT members could have helped you with the tagging but since the account at this stage is now useless then nothing can be done.Quote from: clusterphys on June 08, 2023, 02:22:52 PM if anyone has been scammed from him post it here. Yes, there was an accusation against the same user before that led to his account being tagged. Here's the link to the thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452962.0",

He continues his activities by targeting some newbie users like you and you are already a victim of his scam. If you tried to use escrow and refuse to pay in advance with him, he would have blocked you a long time ago. Because they don't actually have the product they promise to give returns, it's all just scamming tactics.",

We are aware on this guy because he have an active flag and red trust as result of scamming other user prior to your case. You should try to use the trust system next time because you will see a big warning about dealing this user might result to your money loss. There’s a lot of scammer on the forum marketplace especially from newbie and other low rank account. Deal only on user with good trust score or use a reputable escrow. It will cost you an extra money but you can guarantee safety of your deals here. Keep safe next time!",

Also there are visible DT tags on his profile by The Sceptical Chymist and Bitcoin_ArenaThis is the best the forum could do as scam is not regulated here. However, I am concerned that the scammer is smart by locking a thread after creating it and the SEO of this forum is high in google. That is why you were redirected to his profile.Quote from: clusterphys on June 08, 2023, 04:07:39 PMMaybe is a bad advice, but if admins could delete all his posts or edit anything so we could protect other people. This would have been the best thing to do,  but the admins won't intend to enter into the headache of investigating who is a real scammer in order not to punish an innocent user. This is the reason you must check the profile of who you want to trade with.I don't even understand why those with negative tags still have new clients/victims to scam. Is it that they offer to do a certain job in amount lower than expected? If yes, that's still one of the attributes of a scammer and therefore a flag.",

And didn't you find it a bit suspicious that he didn't get any reply on that topic, although it has been active for more than a month!Keep in mind: bitcointalk and its moderators/admins do not moderate scams.

In future whenever you want to deal any Bitcointalk member then i will suggest GazetaBitcoin Escrow service or any other but i found only this that time.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5432278.0Your second mistake is not checking out the profile of this seller. newbie could not be trusted to send first payment and If someone recieved negative with flag then sending first is just like throwing money into sea and asking sea to give you diamond.",

If the seller had a newbie flag, it's hard to overlook as everything is self-explanatory after reading the banner above the user's profile. Still, if you look how clusterphys writes, English is certainly not his strong side. Unfortunately, neither is his knowledge of bitcoin because the seller managed to trick him that \"Bitcoin kept too much fees\" and that he needed to send another transaction to make up for it.",
