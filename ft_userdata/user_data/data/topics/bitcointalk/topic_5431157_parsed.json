When he hand over the source code or binary to the buyer, there's always chance it'll leaked either due to hack or intentionally leaked by buyer.Quote from: Riocasino on December 23, 2022, 11:05:12 PM2. He also told me ridiculous  thing that he has 100% refund policy if something go wrong (When he accepts only Bitcoin)It's not ridiculous, usually it means the seller would send the money back to you manually.

Most casinos are built in a very complex way and it is extremely unlikely that someone will be able to replicate the software successfully and securely. Even if they did, it would be worth a fortune. I could not load the loom video, but if he was not able to provide live demo or not willing to use an escrow for the transaction, then these are also red flags.",
