      "body": "So what does your title really mean? I don't think it has anything to do with your post. That aside, it is hard to recommend anything if you don't provide more info. What's your risk profile? How much can you afford to invest? Do you want quick profit or you're more of a long-term holder? Did you have any experience with crypto trading before? If you don't have any experience but still want to spend a hundred dollars on crypto, maybe buy BTC instead. If that's what you're interested in, then moving this thread to trading discussions board would be better since you're not really talking about altcoin mining.",

You could probably buy coins that have stood the taste of time, like survived a couple of bear markets, and they are still strong. The likes of Doge, ADA etcSo I don't know how you relate your title to the post you made.",

It was actually one of the first POS coins released which wasn’t mineable like 8 years ago or so.If you want ripple you need to mine something like ETC and sell it and exchange for XRP. Or some other alts. My advice stick with the top 20. Avoid anything which is considered small cap.",

If you want to mine, Monero, Ethereum Classic and Monacoin are a good choice since it's still profitable among other coins. If you looking to invest, I'd stick with Bitcoin right now since Bitcoin is always survive on bear market or any worse scenario in cryptocurrency situation.",

I'm considering investing in altcoins any coin that can recommend to me?Are you planning to mine coins or invest in cryptocurrencies? I stopped mining at 5 cents and don't see any interesting coins to mine yet. Perhaps Ethereum POW will gain popularity in the future because there is no censorship for transactions. But this coin is now more profitable to buy and not to mine.",
