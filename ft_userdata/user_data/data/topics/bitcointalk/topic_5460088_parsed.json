  "content": "So this is a rather strange one so far? So I'll try sort things as much as I can. I'm not creating this in the Scam accusations board because I rather want some discussion about the topic before anything; and I'll be pleased if shitposters stayed away, but I guess that's just a too big ask. Anyway; so far we have: - One casino that has stopped operations around July 1st - Website started to show a \"scheduled maintenance\" pic on July 2nd - No official communication on any front.And I'm actually surprised that besides some talks on the casino thread, there has been nothing more about it. Just call me crazy, but a casino going dark for 2 weeks now would bring some more attention if you asked me. Now, I know that the casino has invested some money in general creating community content and promotions, and I understand that people don't want to start pointing fingers. But come on, 2 weeks and nothing?I'm personally not affected by this, because my relationship with the site ended rather abruptly for reasons that are public and others that are not. But what is bugging me is that no one wants to break the ice about it. Well, here it is. And I would value that people that actually want to contribute posted here; because there is a lot of things that are unkown to the public about this site or that people don't ask questions about, and I really want to dig deep into it. (just from memory, the ICO they had, what happenend with the money and investors?)",

      "body": "So far, It was confirmed that betnomi users received promotional emails to join another platform and make deposits. User notblox1 confirmed his email was exclusively for betnomi and he received the promotional email while betnomi was down. I assume either they sold their database, their database was hacked/leaked, or they rug-pulled and opened another platform where they forwarded their users through email promotion.

Not sure if any forum members are investors of Betnomi.",
