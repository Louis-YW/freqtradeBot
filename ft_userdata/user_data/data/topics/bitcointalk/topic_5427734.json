  "content": "I tried to google but could not find an answer. If I'm querying bitcointalk from a script what's the minimum time I should leave between each call? To avoid any IP ban or tagged as DDoS? I have been doing this for quite some time and I always keep e.g. 2~2.5 second delay between each request. But this seems very slow now can I decrease it to 1 sec or less?",

Not that it matters a lot (no competition here), but it's still nice.Edit: Wew, lol. Seems like it take a lot for me to type this reply, while all the mentioned guys already made a reply.",

For me I don't do much but for my own searches mostly, I also have data of some the users e.g Satoshi, Hal Finney, theymos and of course some of my favorite posters on WO (i don't want to name..) and I use it to query and refer to old posts for a quick search. For example this  or when recently LoyceV said that he did not use word vibrant so I thought of confirming myself and at first I found he did use it but... later on manual inspection I found that it is a quoted word but quoted in a wrong way, wrong in a sense that bots will not know, and here too, that's where the AI fails Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on December 10, 2022, 01:32:50 PMShit Bot was supper fast ðŸ¤£.

You generally will not get permission to make more frequent queries unless you are paying for some kind of API access.",
