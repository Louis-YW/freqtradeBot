  "content": "While doing research, I ran across two bugs taking place in Samourai's Whirlpool coinjoin protocol that could be spotted with the naked eye.  On October 25th, I opened two Gitlab issues describing the bug with links to the addresses and transactions the behavior occurred under. Within hours, both bug reports were deleted without comment. Since Samourai does not want to comment on their existence, I am publicly disclosing them:https://web.archive.org/web/20231025112756/https://code.samourai.io/wallet/samourai-wallet-android/-/issues/461https://web.archive.org/web/20231025112815/https://code.samourai.io/wallet/samourai-wallet-android/-/issues/462Issue 461 is the most straightforward: You are spending 305 sats to yourself and paying 369 sats in mining fees to do it. There is no privacy benefit from creating this output since it is known to belong to the same owner as the inputs of the transaction.Issue 462 appears even more straightforward at first but is actually more nuanced: The coinjoin coordinator is reusing addresses to collect its fees, with one receiving up to 36 incoming payments. While this might seem like an obvious privacy leak that can be fixed with a debug, it's not effective just to rotate the receive address. It would actually require an upgrade to the coinjoin protocol itself to hide the amount paid the coordinator (and save block space) with participant paying their fee directly in a coinjoin and the coordinator mimicking the participants' output size.",

Samourai acts as a surveillance app, sending everyone's financial history to their servers. You claimed that it's \"absolutely vital\" to keep your privacy by connecting to your full node and using Tor, and yet this \"absolutely vital\" privacy improvement was DELETED from Samourai's Gitlab repository: https://web.archive.org/web/20230417145554/https://code.samourai.io/wallet/samourai-wallet-android/-/issues/458Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on November 07, 2023, 03:39:52 PM1 - Both Samourai and Sparrow tell you the size of your change output prior to signing and broadcasting Tx0.

The privacy of Whirlpool coinjoins does not depend on this fee payment being secret. It does not matter if you and I both pay to the same coordinator address - there is zero loss of privacy. Apparently you are not aware of Samourai's statements regarding reuse of coordinator fee addresses: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/150/QuoteStephan Livera: Also. So recently there’s been this whole debacle around Wasabi wallet getting flagged. So essentially some users, so the two recent examples, which to my knowledge, are the third and fourth cases that I know of. So there was Catxolotl from Binance Singapore. And then the other guy was RonaldMcHodled. RonaldMcHodled was withdrawing from Paxos. And so it’s sparked up this whole debate about basically how easy is it to flag CoinJoin transactions. My perspective on it was, look, these are like an unforced error. Wasabi should not have had a fixed fee address. And in fairness to Wasabi they are now changing that, after a lot of debate and a lot of time on this topic.Samourai Wallet: It doesn’t matter now though. The impact has already been made. There’s no going back from more than a year of address reuse. It’s tied into the architecture of the mixes now. So it’s very good that they finally changed that. But it really isn’t going to do all that much.If this is so important to Samourai that coordinator fee addresses are not reused in Wasabi, why would they delete an issue from their Gitlab repo proving that the coordinator fee address is reused in Samourai?",
