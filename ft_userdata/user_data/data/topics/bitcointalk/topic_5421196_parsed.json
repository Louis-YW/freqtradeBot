Are they going to pay upfront and stick around until the channel builds up more than 10k subscribers? They'd be more interested to hire streamers with tons of followers than having a new channel.Had it in mind to hire managers in bitcointalk forum and market the casino here?",

Stake, Roobet, and a couple others. Other then that, streamers have still been streaming for Gamdom on the platform. As far as Train goes, Eddie mentioned that Train will start streaming again sometime this weekend. He will likely be using the Kick platform for streams now.",
