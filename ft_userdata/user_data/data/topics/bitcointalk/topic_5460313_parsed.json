Great minds, who do you think is behind the killings in African region? Should we blame just African leaders or the western block. Terrorism is a separate sector that can never be fully understood. The least you can expect from it is to be surprised when the unexpected occurs in them. Terrorism is just used to cover up crimes, corruption, and plunder of public monies. Terrorism can be controlled and stopped, but those who have the ability to do so are often culpable for it, and the few who are not involved and have the ability to stop it are being threatened with their lives and the lives of their families as a result. This is not the time to assign blame because it is impossible to determine who is to blame for terrorism.",

To control such places, they fund terrorist to cause chaos and then later send \"peacekeepers\" who are in actual sense the real looters.Take an example of what happened in Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, Congo etc",

When terrorist have more mechinery to fight the government , it means whatever effort made will be defeated.  However, somehow there could be external forces in the African struggle because of market for their weaponry.",

However, I won't deny there are terrorist cells in the continent, being one which I recall the Boko Haram group which operates in eastern Nigeria. I personally think that the national Leaders of each African country which unfortunately is dealing with terrorism have more responsibility than some western country could possibly have on the existence of radical cells in Africa or anywhere else.",

Blame the leaders for negligence and trying not to make good policies that will reduce the number of people orchestrating the terror by either putting them in prison or putting them in offices to work responsibly for money instead of idly causing havoc and terror for their gain.",

It is not fair or accurate to blame just African leaders or the western bloc for the killings in the African region. Terrorism is a multifaceted and multidimensional problem that requires a comprehensive and coordinated response from all stakeholders at the local, national, regional, and international levels.",

      "body": "We must define a concept of terrorism in order to be able to discuss it. Unfortunately, the absence of a clear definition of terrorism is the pretext on the basis of which each party issues its own definition and acts on the basis of it. And this is what is happening in Africa, as it is happening anywhere in the world. There is no clear definition of terrorism, and each party supports or opposes terrorism according to its own concept. Let us take the Boko Haram group that operates between Mali and Niger as an example. At a time when the whole world considers it a terrorist group, including the local authorities in Mali and Niger, this group has a popular support on the grounds that it is a group that is resistant to the corrupt in the two countries and against the foreign presence because it targets Foreign companies that steal the resources of the two countries, in addition to those who are believed to defend the rules of the Islamic religion.Africa is considered the most affected because terrorism in its various concepts finds a good popular incubator for it. It feeds on people's ignorance and their easy mobilization under religious, ethnic or ideological cover. What is happening in Sudan today is the biggest proof of that.The problem with defining a clear definition of terrorism is that it may affect the activities of major countries that could be condemned according to the same definition.",

Other nations are archiving it and with less corruption plus more anti terrorism move, Africa can archive that too.A secured environment promotes development and could promote other neglected means or not so patronised means to generating funds such a tourism within the African plans for a number of nations.",

There are many reasons for the increase in terrorist activities in Africa. I will mention and deal with three of them.Politics: in my country most opposition parties sponsor terrorist activities to discredit the ruling party. They want the populace to believe that the government in power can not protect lives and properties. They also use it to destabilize the country so that other sectors like the economy, education, and others will suffer. Investors will not come to an insecure country which means there will be unemployment and less revenue. The ruling party could also sponsor terrorist groups to silence opposition. They are mainly used to intimidate, kidnap and sometimes eliminate opposition figures. Tribal and religious sentiments: Some of the terrorist groups in Africa either have a religious or tribal undertone. Some tribes form these groups to attack other tribes or to defend themselves from the aggression of other tribes. The major cause of terrorism in my country is religion. Some religious fanatics come up with extremist ideologies that promote violence against other religions. They destroy schools, places of worship because their teachings are against peaceful coexistence. Western influence: Some selfish Western powers promote instability by sponsoring terrorist groups. If the Western-backed multinationals feel that the government in power is enacting unfriendly policies, they will seek means to dethrone them, which include sponsoring terrorist groups. The recent instability in Libya is the design of world powers to destroy a fearless Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. This singular act by the West has led to an increase in terrorist activities in Africa.",

They use the act of terrorism to give the country a bad image to the outside world. Terrorists can be found on other continents as well as in African nations. Terrorists primarily arise when a nation's government refuses to give its youth enough work, has no money in circulation for its inhabitants, and has no means of subsistence for its citizens. This outcome may cause the citizenry to turn against their political leaders, making their mantle of leadership ungovernable",

They are not the same thing, hopefully he knows that. Edit: I guess the user has made adjustment to his post.Anyway, to fight terrorism is difficult because government can not fight itself. It is the government officials that fight themselves because they bring those groups to distort and make a government they don't support ungovernable and when they want those groups to surrender or repent from the assignment, that becomes an issue of its own. Those groups see it as a source to make ransom and continuous intimidation of successive governments. Therefore to fight terrorism, the government must ensure there are no proliferation of arms and seizure of those arms found.",
