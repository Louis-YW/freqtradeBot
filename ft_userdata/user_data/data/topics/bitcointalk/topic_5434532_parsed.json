  "content": "Just to mention i was jailed and layed 6 y for mining, because back then it was illegal  in Eastern Europe, even tho i didnt steal electricity and payed high bills this prolly put eyes on me and maybe the heat and they thought it was a weed farm, but no. Anyway smh one of my adresess is still alive and its not seized, also im suing my country for failing my future i was young 24, and ruining my life, in this cage so long i did lose part of myself, but yall can't imagine my feelings when I found out the adress is still alive.. I will give my life to find it everywhere, anyway its my last hope for rebuilding my life. Privet, I've been trying to find an legacy adress in its definition by everyway, except using scripts and programs, im not so it, but spent like 20 days in ian coleman website, searching for my adress pkey, i succeed to \"calculate\" the secret exponent, and when i do decrypt it in base58, its the same adress, can i really find any suggestions or everything that i can use to officially be a crypto millionaire, or my days will pass in ian coleman wsite  . I mean i will lose sleep, eat, everything if needed, because im dumb and i suffer from success. Thanks in advance, im not really a newbie but, from my understanding the so called secret exponent is just the public key? Im using brainwallet even tho we all know what we know about this. Tldr, can the secret exponent help me in any way?",

And when they rushed my apartment like im damn criminal smashing all 20 cpus i lost around 1 to 3k btc back then, the rest are in 2 adresses, idk how they missed them, one have 75btc,the other some dust",

Thats why i assume its just a pub key, but i know that inside the adress is the private key also the public, they're asymmetrically connected if im not wrong which is very likely to be wrong, i missed a lot even tho i still did my best to not lose all the strings with the crypto, had hope that one day maybe i can be again into the endless loop of codes and cryptos all that. Sorry i will rephrase, my secret exponent is the riped160 hash with the checksum behind. Its really confusing, but I'd do everything that's possible without harming other people adresses and keys, to regain mine, like I did say i spend my days scrolling in ian coleman, guess if i search for 1 particular adress whose archives shows me writing here about things, and explaining how to mine, more precisely block 100,and how to get the forked bch, in couple forums, even there is one in the github archive in raw version, me couple other adresess and the coinbase, if I remember correctly they did the transactions, i can see my adress there both in btc and bch format, lets say i was kinda in depth back then, but now far away from what i used to know, things changed. I will read the whole post still of course, like I said its my chance to get my life back for a second time.pS.Also i have to mention that if it wasn't my aunt Ruzha Ignatova, with her bullshit Onecoin and her ponzi scheeme, i would be happy living now, but it is what is, plus nnoone of the thiings written on the net fir her are true, she's still somewhere with her huge amount of coins.. But she dissappeared, for sure alive and free",

I did tried some phrases i haven't, unluckily didn't work, but no joke, im amazed how your answer reached parts of my brain. But still 24yo my brain was like 50yo. Everything was made like I'd do it now at this age, i had big plans for the future, was sure that btc will blow, i had if im not wrong 13 wallets, ironically the adress start with 13,so i can work on this string too. I won't give up untill im back into the wallet, it is my last and only wish and opportunity to rebuild all that i missed and lost. Thank you man, wishh you to climb over every mountain and share it with your beloved people. Sorry just got me emotional, im bit traumatised still, there is nothing to repair from what was, everything was brutally smashed and seized.. But i have hope.",

      "body": "i want you to save yourself timeagain you cannot reverse engineer the true private key from the public address...there are more computations to force than there are grains of sand in the universe if you tried backward engineering. even if it was a project of trying 100,000 attempts a second for the rest of your life and then passing down to your offspring and then your descendants, after 2 millenia later, they wont be any closerlets give an examplesaoshi(bitcoin inventor) has a bitcoin address of coins that the address was used a few times thus generated signatures to pull out the public key and other things.. yet. 14 years later.. no on has been able to backward hack those funds. and thats with many many people trying and many years trying.thats the beauty of bitcoin its not backward hack-ablethe only option if the hardware from years prior is destroyed. is to re-enact your life from years ago. remember the way you thought about things. the hobbies and interests. the room you were in. what things your eyes seen and mind thought about that would later that fateful day of making the wallet would have come to mind that day to have created that walletlist(on paper for you to see) all your hobbies, interests, girlfriends names, pet names. songs, books, games. inspirational messages. favourite foods, drinks. everything you can think of that as a 24yo you would have considered to MAKE a wallet. and re-enact the process as if you are doing it the first time. see what comes to mindits the only way.if you can think of just some of it. try some of those combinations. as that is atleast a more possible route then reverse engineering a public key.the odds are more in your favour re-engineer the initial events leading towards the past wallet creation process.. the odds are against reverse engineering from the final public keydont get too obsessed or stressed about it. if the funds have not moved yet(government found private key) i doubt they have it to move it now. so dont think about stressing self and worrying to need to solve it right away, do it calmly and patiently when you have spare time. the coins are not going anywhere so you have time. and plenty of itits not something you might solve in a weed(unless you already know most of the words initially used). it may take a longgg while. but instead of being a project you hand down as inheriters to attempt to force. the odds are less than that by working forward from your hobbies/interests and whatever you would have envisioned as a easy rememberable phrase back then",

Because now it shows completely different thingsThere's not gonna be a difference. Where did you find this hex again? Wallet software doesn't ever tell you to save that. Before my farm was destroyed, i had 13 wallets, easy to remember the adresses at least them i did not forget, and i just browse around and found an old archive in github written by me how people can withdraw their bch fork, stating my adress then, and decided to see with the hope that is untouched, fortunately it wasn't, from there i simply calculated the hex, i know its just the public key, but i thought there are tips and tricks or anything that can lead me to getting acces again, unfortunately no. So here i am still lookin for the privkey, long story short, i won't stop untill i find it before someone else because i saw that people drain adresses like mine with balance in it, which for me can be double edged sword if someone drain it i can find the person legally, but if noone try to, im sticking to ian coleman tool with big hopes to find the priv key.",
