  "content": "Circa 2014 the block size wars took bitcoin by storm. Eventually after a lot of drama that has been well documented elsewhere (I made my own attempt documenting a time line of the blocksize wars, its outcomes and conclusions here). But I'm starting this poll in hopes of getting the community's opinion. So for this post I'll not go through my opinion in the OP. Please feel free to answer the question in the poll and even better if you can also explain your answer. Back in 2015, and after the adoption of a compromise in the form of SegWit, the topic of the block capacity was very taboo. Well, we're in 2023 now, and for different reasons congestion is still an issue. Increasing the capacity of bitcoin blocks could potentially be a solution to the issues of high fees and congestion. So I think it's worth exploring what people think about this issue. Please share your thoughts below.",

      "body": "I'll start by dedicating this thread to stompix (honestly, no hate, debate with him is enjoyable even though we sometimes disagree) who dared me to make this thread. Quote from: stompix on November 15, 2023, 04:16:26 PMBe my guest to open a topic about increasing the capacity, I'm grabbing my popcorn!Common, do it, I can't wait for it!It's already 2023 now and I think having a taboo over mere discussion of block capacity shouldn't be shunned or considered taboo. Continuing the debate:Quote from: stompix on November 15, 2023, 04:16:26 PMAs for me, I was just this week shown how it's physically impossible to have blocks larger than 4MB because only nodes that own a Titan computer and their own private global fiber optic cables would be able to cope with larger blocks!Well well well... This is an age old arguement. Quoting my post that I also linked in the OP:Quote from: alani123 on October 25, 2023, 12:54:30 AMThe concerns over big and dynamic blocks in 2015It's important to not forget what the talking points for each proposed solution were back when it was decision time. In early 2016, Jonas Schnelli, a full time bitcoin Core maintainer, was quoted stating the following against 2MB blocks. QuoteThere are consequences with 2-megabyte blocks. Chinese miners -- they are now [for] 2- megabyte blocks, but maybe it will turn out to be a problem for them . . . Every second really counts . . . When you mine a block that is no longer valid and you don’t get the information that a new block is here, you’re wasting lots of energy. If it’s just ten seconds you mine on the wrong block, you lose energy, and you lose coins in the end. That’s why, with Chinese miners [especially], every second counts, and [with] 2-megabyte [blocks], it’s twice the bandwidth you need.In this quote its easy to see how conservative bitcoin developers sought to be with the blockchain size, and how an increase in block size might severely affect the decentralization of bitcoin due to bandwidth constraints in many parts of the world. Contrary to the path projects like Ethereum have followed by having a full blockchain size in the terrabytes, bitcoin still chooses to form its network with full nodes. Users of bitcoin can still to this day download and easily synchronize the full blockchain therefore also contributing to decentralization. This lack of compromise is what has defined bitcoin through the years. Yet, in the end, we got 4MB blocks and still no super computers are needed. It's probably safe to say that even higher max block size increases could be easily accommodated by a run in the mill home computer. Moore's law is still a thing. Computing and storage space becomes cheaper. So, surpassing 1MB blocks didn't destroy BTC. Even 4MB blocks didn't. But now, so many years after 2015, storage, memory and computing power are cheaper than ever. So this argument doesn't stand. But what do you know! It doesn't even matter if bitcoin full node requirements are raised. Why? Because decentralization doesn't necessarily guarantee trustlessness and immutability. And in a way, mining nodes are already way fewer and with much higher requirements than normal network nodes. So we've already been beyond the point where maximizing decentralization mattered ever since ASICs were introduced for bitcoin. Even satoshi admitted to such: Quote from: satoshi on July 29, 2010, 02:00:38 AMThe current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.Quote from: bytemaster on July 28, 2010, 08:59:42 PMBesides, 10 minutes is too long to verify that payment is good.  It needs to be as fast as swiping a credit card is today.See the snack machine thread, I outline how a payment processor could verify payments well enough, actually really well (much lower fraud rate than credit cards), in something like 10 seconds or less. If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423.msg3819#msg3819But people often forget that satoshi didn't romanticize decentralization over trustlessness and immutability. Instead only this part of the quote became famous. Quote from: satoshi on July 29, 2010, 02:00:38 AMIf you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.",

I thought you'd know the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin. Even though the Ethereum Blockchain is above 15 TB, minimum gas requirements put it in a situation where fees can never be low. And to think, these gas requirements were programmed while ETH had an ICO pricing it at 30 or so cents. So this is entirely irrelevant to our discussion. It's a different architecture, very inefficient, and built on a very different approach. As of the lightning network, it has been in development for so many years and still no end on sight to ever being viable. I wrote about it here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5471172.40Also, economic wise, lower fees will result in higher transaction numbers which will potentially balance out the total amount of fees to a bigger number. It's basic economic principles: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5474087.0",

LIEnodes verify 99% of transactions as they are relayed pre confirm.. nodes can handle hundreds of megabytes (as proven by bitcoins node mempools of each node).. and funnily enough devs own admissions that nodes on mainnet and subnetworks can sign and pass millions of transactions a second)(yep when LN \"co-signs a state\" both parties can sign relay and check in the same time as verifying a bitcoin transaction.. and if LN can do that then its admitting bitcoin nodes can verify the same \"millions of transactions a second\" unconfirmed too)mining becomes less competitive... LIEthere is more to the reward vs fee vs market price economics than just \"tx pay more\" 16000 X $1 (using unified 4mb instead of segregated 4mb) = $160004000 X $2 (usual segregated 4mb when not spammed) = $8000as you can see mining can get a bigger fee bonus by letting in more transactions without having to cost users moreand by the way.. every time there is a halving idiots think this is the time to 2x+ the fee's to offset the reward halving.. another lie.. its actually where the MARKET increases to compensate the reward halving. but that makes fee's $ more so fee's need to decrease to prolong bitcoin utility and desire of people to want to use bitcoin..if you want to keep the bitcoin market alive you need to keep BITCOIN usable. otherwise people move over to altcoins that have the same crappy subnetworks. but have cheaper feestrying to suggest halt bitcoin growth and promote subnetworks solves nothing. because people will just use the same subnetwork. but with an altcoin as a the settlement.. i find it absolutely hilarious how sponsored devs pretending to be bitcoin devs but having subnetwork adoring motives, say how LN can verify a channel partners \"state\" to the tune of 1million x/sec... but then tries to say bitcoin is broke can cant verify more then 4k/10min before breakingsuch lies, such deceit , such scumbag methods of promoting an underclass subnetwork but trying to say its a network \"ontop\" of bitcoin.. SHAMEFUL tacticsreality is when doing the tests on how fast LN can sign, relay and verify states.. they are admitting how fast bitcoin pre-confirm relay can be",

Sorry to impose on myself like this before my probable disappearance...---------------------Why Is Money Valuable?Interestingly enough, the peculiar procedure of economic measurement is opposed to the methods of measurement in science. Indeed measurement in science is based on the impartiality of the measuring technician. Measuring by money is actually based on the bias of everyone involved. What is more, in science units of measurement are presumably stable, yet money as a standard of economic measurement is constantly changing value.Before I discuss the instability of money, the following question should be answered: why money generally retains value despite many reasons for value variations, why we somehow expect money to be stable despite the knowledge that it is not?The utility of a certain consumable commodity be it cattle or sheep skin when that commodity played the role of money was an understandable reason for that money to retain value. In the case of gold or paper money rarity, social convention or respect for the government which issued the money can be the reason behind the fact that such things can start playing the role of money but not yet the reason why that money will retain its value.The actual reason for money to remain valuable is the fact that people want more of it and once they get it, they choose to hold it and not give it away easily. this explanation alone is wrongbut your post is in the wrong topic",

Not changing bitcoin at least slightly to accommodate for biger volumes of transactions, especially when there's demand for that, is actually against satoshi's very vision.",
