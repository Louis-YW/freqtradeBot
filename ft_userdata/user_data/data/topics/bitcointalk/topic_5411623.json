I'll ask mods to move this threadAnyway, about your PHP issue have you read the Coingecko API documentation? I think you need to try to ping your API status through this command below to check if your API is onlineCode:$data = $client->ping();Also, I would like to ask if you already created an account in Coingecko is it a free one that has limited API request daily?I think you can try the Coingecko PHP code from this link below it might help how to install/use those codes properly.- https://github.com/codenix-sv/coingecko-api",
