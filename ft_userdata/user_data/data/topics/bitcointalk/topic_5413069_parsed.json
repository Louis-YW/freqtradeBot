The Nakamoto represented on the canvas in pictures below is a mosaic of individual RARE PEPE cards (or pixels, in the case of the NFT), each one being the true representation of a different Rare Pepe card, with individual GIFs painstakingly curated from the complete Rare Pepe NFT series of all 1774 cards that comprises the full Nakamoto image.This is 1 of 4 Dank Mosaics created by Leary using the the entire Rare Pepe collection (https://pepe.wtf/assets) and acquired by fellow XCP artist and newbie forum member, Rocco (Rochigg), that I have agreed to help him sell and act as escrow unless buyer's agent is preferred.The artwork measures 27.75” x 27.75” in 2” thick silver metal studio frame. This sale is for the physical print only and does not include Shawn Leary's NFT.More about the artist here: https://youtu.be/A1y4CDOtvosComments or questions can be addressed here.Please DM with offers.",
