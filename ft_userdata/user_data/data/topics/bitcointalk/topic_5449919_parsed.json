You are just a newbie with a total of 12 posts made in the forum. You can't be trusted by ppl with these things.And as @shasan said above, there is a high risk of getting scammed here + anyone who deals with @OP is also risking his identity details to an unknown guy.Quote from: Pattersontech on May 01, 2023, 02:45:24 AMLet keep the orders rolling please.Lol, how many orders you got till now? Im sure it wont be much.",

It is great that you have already received a few orders and completed those without any issues. You have found those orders from this forum or from somewhere else. If you got those orders from the forum then I think you should update them as a reference.",
