I haven't heard about it before, but then again, I'm a bit out of the loop in recent news.Anyhow, as I mentioned in the first post, I don't think that what Musk said was even worth writing an article. I take it as just him saying \"don't invest more than you can afford to lose\" in an awkward way.",
