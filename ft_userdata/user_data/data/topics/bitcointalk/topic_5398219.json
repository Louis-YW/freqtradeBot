      "body": "Rhel 8 when searching on Google it is pointing out that this OS is Linux which is why they are giving you Ubuntu or RPI guide on how to install it. Actually, I never heard of this OS RHEL 8 have you tried all docs that you found recently for Ubuntu OS?Why not try it first or check this link below- https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx/blob/master/docs/HOWTO.rstOr if you are looking for automated ElectrumX installer script you can check this one- https://github.com/bauerj/electrumx-installer",

There's no step which heavily depends on OS's package manager (such as apt) or init system (such as systemd). RHEL 8 seems to be most recent version and already include Python 3.6 by default[2]. But personally i'd rather setup ElectrumX[3] server if you have multiple Electrum wallets since EPS require you to add master public key manually.[1] https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server#quick-start-on-a-debianubuntu-machine-with-a-running-bitcoin-full-node[2] https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/11/14/python-in-rhel-8-3[3] https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx",
