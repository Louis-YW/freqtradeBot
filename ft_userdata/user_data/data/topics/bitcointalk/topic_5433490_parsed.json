      "body": "bitcoin is feeling the pressure to stay below $17k for one reasonmany \"futures/options/leverage\" traders done \"contracts\"(bets) on bitcoin to be at or below $17k when their contracts expire. and so they are putting alot of their other investment pots of cash into public spot markets to \"whale-wall\" the price from exceeding $17k so that they do not lose when their contracts expiresooner or later once contracts expire and new contracts of \"below $17k\" are not put. then the walls will disappear and speculation will raise the spot marketlooking at real economic fundementalsbitcoins spot market was only ever going to swing between $10k-$75k in 2021there is reason why buyers fizzled out at $70k in 2021there is reason why sellers fizzled out at $15k in 2022its because there were ways to acquire bitcoin independently from the market that made buyers see that the premium of spot was getting to be too much compared to other bitcoin acquisition methods(mining)in short if bitcoin mining was at a most efficient low cost mining operation of $10k in 2021 then no one would want to sell below that because no one could make btc for less. which created a low level value support line. everyone had costs above this amount and so speculation kept prices above that linein short if bitcoin mining was at a most in-efficient high cost mining operation of $75k in 2021 then no one would want to buy bitcoin above that because no everyone could make btc for less, even hobby minors in remote locations like hawaii. which created a top resistance premium  line. everyone had mining costs below this amount and so speculation kept prices below that line2022 was a $15k-$90k economic windowand so far first week for 2023 is the same rough amountwe may see this window rise allowing for speculation to possibly see an ATH but so far the max position of a potential ATH is less than $100k",

It's your feeling. Should I say bitcoin will have an all-time high again in the future because it's my feeling, would you trust that answer? lol.Anyway, back in the day, when I was a kid, we used to buy gold 1 vorhi (a local word) with 2k BDT. I can't imagine even that now. It's 80k BDT now. Does it change the fact that I can't live without using BDT? No. It's impossible.The same is true here as well. It's a currency. If BTC doesn't ever hit new ATH, it still will be the same, a currency. This won't change anything.",

When this happens, the number of btc per block mined decreases by the half, so new bitcoin entering the market becomes more scarce and valuable, theoretically. By looking the history, halvings have never disappointed investors previsouly.

It is not easy to digest an 80% price dump from all the time high and still hope that bitcoin will recover from there.However, you need to see the price history of bitcoin from 2009 till date and you will realize that this is not the first time bitcoin is down. Previously, bitcoin has recovered from 80-85% dump and it will do the same this time. Bitcoin will follow the four year market cycle revolving around the Halving.",

However, it seems unlikely because over the course of almost 14 years, Bitcoin went through various bear markets with always not just recovering but significantly surpassing its previous highest point. So there just doesn't seem to be a good reason to believe that it will be different this time, especially given that nothing truly threatening happened to Bitcoin. If there was something unique about the current crash to suggest that Bitcoin can't come back from it, that would be another thing, but it's just FUD over a big exchange crash, nothing new.",
