Or is it that privacy coins make the public feel that they are always connected to criminal activities?The majority invest in bitcoin or cryptocurrencies as an investment, and therefore privacy is not a priority, and therefore we do not see a high demand for Monero compared to any currency that can give any high investment return, even if it is bad..This thing will change in the coming years, especially if cryptocurrencies are regulated.Quote from: j1792 on August 05, 2023, 11:06:24 AMWhen I was using Monero, I found that for offline cold wallets, it is a troublesome thing to check the balance.

You can do this by using the coincotrol feature in some bitcoin wallets and always request a new address for each transaction, then ordinary people will not be able to know all your money.Litecoin has a privacy feature[1] that has been incorporated into some transactions.[1] Explaining MimbleWimble: The Privacy Upgrade to Litecoin",

Or is it that privacy coins make the public feel that they are always connected to criminal activities?The state of privacy coin within the cryptocurrency market is a niche. That should explain why it is not popular, compared to another type of coin, that you also mentioned ETH, LTC and many others.Most people in general also did not mainly and necessarily pick privacy-by-default cryptocurrency as their choice. Monero by far is the most private coin, currently, so in terms of features, XMR is good enough. The regulation does indeed also affect people's choices, but not significantly.

For example, in Bitcoin, transactions can be tracked through the block chain, but these privacy coins cannot be tracked. It works a lot like Bitcoin Mixer. And that's why Maybe's height was also very high at one time, because they take user's privacy seriously. But I also think that the future rules and regulations may have an impact on these coins.",
