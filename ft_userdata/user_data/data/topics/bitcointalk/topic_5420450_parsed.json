Did you mean this guide?If they point you to the guide on the official page above but it doesn't work (not accessible), I'm afraid there are actually some restrictions for UK people using Kucoin.I do not recommend that you continue using Kucoin because you will experience the same difficulties when withdrawing money to your local bank.",

This way seems faster, try to use binance or coinbase, whichever exchange is supported in your country. Deposit through those exchanges and then you can transfer all your crypto assets to kucoin if you still don't want to leave kucoin. But in my opinion, OP, you should give up on Kucoin if their service is really that bad because if you later have bigger problems with your property that they don't solve or guide you poorly then you're in trouble.",

It is peer to peer means of trading in a way intermediary is eliminated and not part of it. Which means you and someone can exchange crypto to fiat or fiat to crypto. You should be able to do that on Kucoin, you can follow this Kucoin guide about P2P:P2P fiat trade - KuCoin",

Well since the problem isn't caused by yours, I think it's fine to send some crypto to Kucoin, but make sure you're only send small money and then you can try to withdraw it. If there's no problem, you can try bigger amount.What I know is Kucoin has restrict against US territory, it's possible if they restrict against UK too.Maybe you can try to other exchange? I believe the coins that listed on Kucoin at least listed on some few exchanges since get listed on Kucoin is a bit stricter.",

I believe the coins that listed on Kucoin at least listed on some few exchanges since get listed on Kucoin is a bit stricter.This is the best advice on how to resolve this problem. You can buy USDT on Binance or Coinbase, pay with your credit card and then transfer that USDT to KuCoin. If the only restriction on KuCoin is that you can't use your credit card then there shouldn't be any problem. But try one transaction with a small amount just to be sure. It will cost you 2 USDT if you transfer it trough TRX network, but it's better to lose 1 USDT than the whole amount in case anything goes wrong.",

An altcoin or possibly a shitcoin can prove to be an expensive lesson for you long-term. But if that is what you want, be ready to suffer any consequences as well. You can always use sites like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap to check what other exchanges that asset is trading on. Maybe you will have more luck there than on Kucoin.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on November 11, 2022, 08:59:16 AMSo is it best that I send some crypto from either Coinbase or Binance to Kucoin and then from there can convert that into the crypto I want?  Yeah, that's one way to do it. Bitcoin would be the obvious choice, but you will lose out on withdrawal fees when you make the transaction from Coinbase/Binance to Kucoin. Maybe something like USDT on Tron is better and cheaper to move. Also pay attention to the trading pair that is available on KuCoin for the coin you want to purchase. Each trade requires paying maker/taker fees as well, so you will lose a bit on that as well.",

I am hoping and wishing that this will be the end of this comedy show, however, it might only be the beginning of a clear out of the weak exchanges because they're solvency will be tested. In any case, if we speculate on an exchange's insolvency, speculate responsibly. Do not spread fud but ask the right questions. Also for @everyone, not your keys not your coins.
