Three wallets stand out the most:Seed \"summer summer summer\" took 51 blocks to sweep 0.17BTC in 2019: 77f914eaeb3aa408b534c64e9506defa9f80b51d52fe8f59b02b2ad0e49ce38a.Seed \"like like like\" was used in 2013, when it took 10884 blocks to sweep 0.031BTC, and again in 2021, when 0.027BTC was swept instantly.Seed \"sad sad sad\" has a fitting name, whoever lost his Bitcoin here did it again 10 days later.Lesson to learn from this: don't make up your own seed phrase.--Knight Hider",

I mean really! i am also shocked because at first reading i didn't get your main context but after reading 2 or 3 times i understood. Really, what a dumb idea but of course, they just might be testing things out because i have also made many wallets address for some purposes. And many times i have to see the word \"summer, Sad. Dad, above, wet, whisper, \" coming again and again.",

If you ignore the checksum and import them as BIP39 seed phrases you get empty wallets. Rather you reach these funded addresses only if you import those seed phrases in to Electrum and let Electrum assume they are old style Electrum seed phrases, bearing in mind of course that Electrum seed phrases existed for 2 years before BIP39 seed phrases.Old style Electrum seed phrases originally used this word list of 1626 words: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/18cf546aab7d1a4d122a85ae2b49935cf64c9510/electrum/old_mnemonic.py#L31. There are quite a few words on that list which are not on the BIP39 word list, so OP might find even more such seed phrases from word on that list, too.",

My point was that electrum generates the seed phrase completely randomly and when it comes to security and randomness of your seed phrase, there is no tool that is \"better than electrum\". If you generate your seed phrase using electrum on a secure air-gapped device, you are safe enough. If you generate your seed phrase using electrum on an unsafe environment, your wallet wouldn't be secure, but that's not electrum's fault.",
