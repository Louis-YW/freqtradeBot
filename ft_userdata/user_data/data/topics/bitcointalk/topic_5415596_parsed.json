We should trade manually and grab our profits.Means you know nothing about algo trading. Any strategy you can think of can be coded and executed 1000 times faster and 10 times better than any human can do. If you trading strategy is buy after resistance break with volume and daily close above, with RSI at XXX, MACD at XXX and FIB at XXX ... its like 20 lines of code and bot will scan all trading pairs, you want it to scan, 24/7, check buy/sell criteria and trade for you or just allert you.Not even talking about arbitrage, triangular arbitrage, market making bots that are earning continuously with little to zero risk.",

It can trade a 1000X faster but it only works based on how it was programmed and when the market gets complex or outside the model it was trained with it makes silly preds. Bots are nice when a trader uses them as a complementary too and not as an automated signal generator It depends on what type of bot we are talking. Arbitrage/triangular arbitrage/marketmakers bots can trade 24/7 almost without a human. And even if we are talking about a regular bot that tries to do what humans are (investing long/medium/short term) its still much better. Of course its not a tool that you buy and run and it will generate cash for you. You need to know what you are doing but I'm far from this:Quote from: alik111 on October 01, 2022, 04:19:48 PMAgain I don't think using trading bot is a good idea at all.

Although we can use Google Translate, it will be better if you add the English language since that can ease people to know more. But I don't use a bot to trade because I think that will not work for me. I prefer to trade manually, try to analyze by myself, and learn something from the analysis.",
