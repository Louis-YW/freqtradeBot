It seems to me that until the issue of security and simplicity is resolved, which even a beginner can master, the widespread adoption of bitcoin will be delayed. There are alternatives, like hardware and other wallets, but still, the incident is alarming.For me, here's what else looks strange. Luke Dashjr is not a stupid person, but for some reason he kept such a large amount of btc in one wallet. What about the famous diversification? Then part of btc could be preserved, and not in such a way that the entire balance was devastated as it is now. I sympathize with him and this is a bitter example for others to be able to keep the wallet safe.",
