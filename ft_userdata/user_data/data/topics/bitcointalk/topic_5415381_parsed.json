  "content": "Flood in general is a natural disaster but of course can be artificially triggered through the opening of dams and as such it leads to a lot of damages which include destruction of properties, destruction of farms and displacement of people. Over the years, the government always warned people of flood areas to relocate and abandon their territory but what has been done to ensure that they get access to new homes and safe places to finally lay their heads is a question yet to be answered. It's a thing to ask people to leave their houses because of a threat but another thing is providing where they can be safe to call a home. I think our attention should not only be focused on telling them about the dangers of being in the areas of flood but to provide a substantial places of more comfortability for them. \"An avoided problem is much better than seeking for a solution.\"",

Depends on the place of each environment.Yes indeed. Avoiding problems is better than finding solutions. But, are we going to keep avoiding and not looking for a solution. There is not only one answer in this world. There are many answers and different ways for us to deal with problems.This is what I read on one of the websites, for flood disaster management.Make the function of rivers and sewers to function properly. Rivers and sewers are places where water flows so that it is not contaminated with garbage or becomes a final disposal site which ultimately causes rivers and sewers to become clogged.Carry out reforestation of plants, especially types of plants and trees that can absorb water quickly.Expand and provide open land to create green land for water absorption.Stop building housing on the banks of the river, because it will narrow the river and house waste will also enter the river.Stop building tall and big buildings, because it will make it harder for the earth to support its weight and make the ground level drop.Avoid cutting down trees in the forest illegally and also on the banks of rivers, because trees play an important role in preventing flooding. Actually cutting down trees is not prohibited if we are going to replant trees and not allow the forest to be deforested.",

When people are asked to leave their homes during a disaster, it is mostly temporary.Most countries, especially developing nations, have corrupt and wasteful governments that are insensitive to the plight of their citizens. Most of these countries are rich, but the wealth is not evenly distributed making the people live in abject poverty. I have read news of countries that were warned or aware that there would be flood disasters and these governments made no provision for the people living in flood-prone areas. There was no plan to evacuate them or move them to IDP camps. The people were left to suffer without any form of assistance or help from the government. Most of them are now homeless without access to health facilities and education. The most painful part of it is that these people have continually suffered from floods for so many years without any solution from the government.",

Each year floods are coming in developing countries but zero preparation is done on behalf of government to save people from that.  At the end of flood when everything of poor people are destroyed their houses their livestock government comes for help with meagre cash to just show their good will. The corrupt government in developing countries they don't work for the betterment of people or to improve their lives they are just there for their benefits.",

Some countries don't do much about this, when home is provided it is not good enough to live in and food is far in shortage. Countries of developed countries can do better than third world countries , for example with the Ukraine war, the humanitarian support of Germany, US etc is really commendable.",

The problem is the water won't go easily because of the garbages stuck in the canals and also the bridges are inaccessible at that time and the cars are stuck as well. Too bad there are lots of casualties and in the other provinces, landslides have occurred which was the reason why our city has been declared in a state of calamity. I'm back after a week but the other people are still in the evacuation centers waiting to get help to build their homes again. That was just a traumatic experience because you are not only worried about your own life but about the lives of your family and friends as well.",

Building IDP camps and provision of food is not the solution because most times these displaced people properties,crops and livestock got lost during the flood.This year in my country the government didn't provide any IDP camp for flood victims the people were left to fend for themselves. Flood victims turned government schools into their IDP camps after which private donors came to give them relief materials. It was after this that the shameless government came around to show little concern. All these are happening because of bad government in our countries, why can't the dams issues be fixed up to avoid this yearly disaster",

But appropriate response to it is how fast the government of a country can quickly contain it and avoid a difficult and unsafe situation for it's citizens. It's not about establishing bodies saddled with such responsibility alone, but have them trained and equipped to be able to function. When the recent flood broke out, emergency agencies did little to nothing, (or assuming they did more), corrupt and greedy individuals pocketed the greater part and gave little to the affected.Flood is a natural occurrence, but it would be appreciated if our leaders do not use it as a medium to line their pockets to the detriment of the citizens.",

The government is already assisting them by relocating them to another area, and the government has built a house for them, but they are complaining that it is too far away from their work and that they will starve or otherwise suffer. They have a point, but that is the government's solution to keep them safe from flooding. With technological innovation right now, there are a lot of new things that can prevent floods, and also, dredging is always conducted along the rivers.",
