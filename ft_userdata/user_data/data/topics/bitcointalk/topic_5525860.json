If you have 1 BTC, you'll always have 1 BTC whether that's stored in an exchange or a hardware wallet. It's the USD value goes up and down, but no, just because you see the USD vslue going down in your hardware wallet does not mean that the funds can be accessed by a hacker. Your hardware wallet software just use exchanges to request the Bitcoin price based on your holdings. Doesn't affect the safety of the funds.",

As for the fee, it's when the blockchain is congested they you can pay high, but if it's not congested, it's just something little that you pay. You can use https://mempool.space/ to check out the transaction fee of the amount that you want to send for adjustment.",

Imagine it like gold. Even you look it up in your personal safe, the value will still increases or decreases, you will just keep it safe and once you sell it you get the market value, thats basically the same idea with keeping it on your trezor. In the trezor software you will also always see the total value of your crypto kept on your trezor. So, you can always stay on top of your portfolio.Quote from: Lovingman on January 09, 2025, 12:03:09 PM*Does it cost to send from soft wallets to the hardware wallet?

How much is in cheap or costly?Yes, the fees are solely determined by the network. Sending from an exchange may be more expensive as you cannot fix the fee on most of them and you are overcharged sometimes.- Jay -",

You can use a hardware wallet, an exchange, or a software wallet. However, the safest option is a hardware wallet because you have full control over it.Do more research man, you need to understand the basics of Bitcoin and how to secure it properly. Since it’s your investment, you definitely don’t want to lose it due to a simple mistake. Take the time to protect it!",

The hardware only generate and control the keys that can be used to have access to your coins on the blockchain.Many newbies makes the mistake of thinking that their BTC is stored in their wallet, not knowing that the wallet is the access to their coins on the Blockchain. Some will also panic when they see their Bitcoin reducing in USD value, not knowing that it's because Bitcoin is volatile and it's price can pump or dump. Adequate knowledge of how Bitcoin works is very necessary for newbies that wants to start holding it so that they will not worry unnecessarily when they notice any changes in price. Knowing that if your BTC is in a none custodial wallet, that makes you to be in total control, if you lose your wallet keys you lose the access to your BTC on the Blockchain.",

Or I can only benefit from the value of the bitcoin increasing when it is on the open network, therefore susceptible to hacking?Other users here have pretty much given you a base explanation of how it works. Think of bitcoin like an asset which actually makes sense if you are Hodling it. What happens is when the value of bitcoin goes up ,the value of the bitcoin you have regardless of where it is stored also increased based on how many units of bitcoin you own.  It's a matter of increase in value when compared to fiat and not necessarily increase in the units of coins you own.QuoteDoes it cost to send from soft wallets to the hardware wallet? How much is in cheap or costly?It's best you store your coins on a hardware wallet because it's safe from online attacks which is the most rampant. As for fees, it's the same regardless of the wallet. The only difference is that for the case of CEX they add up their own extra fees sometimes to cover tax and other charges as the case may be.",

And if you can access Binance using your local ISP the  you're good to go. I suggest and preferred P2P to buy as is much cheaper to buy bitcoin. It just needs KYC, and read/follow all the notes and warnings shows in the P2P page for your own safety.[1] https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/12198392258345",

How much is in cheap or costly?One Bitcoin will remain at the same market value whether you keep it on a trading platform, in your own wallet, or even in a casino.The transfer fees will not exceed a few dollars, and perhaps even less than that. This is if we are talking about fees on the network. However, if you are going to transfer Bitcoin from a trading platform to your own wallet, the fees will be a little high because the platform imposes additional fees for its services, and Bitcoin withdrawals are always expensive.Your question confirms that you are still a beginner in this space and it will be somewhat risky to invest in a way that you do not master. This will make you vulnerable to hacking or manipulation by any party that may use it. I advise you to spend more time learning the basics of crypto and I suggest that you focus on Bitcoin and its protocol because it will make it easier for you to understand the mechanisms of the rest of the networks",
