Nothing stops the network. Tik tok, next block.Since this downtime has happen before, is an evidence that bitcoin is grooming more strength and technology. The pump this time is going to take long journey and that's going to be cool on traders and investors of bitcoin.I remember the first downtime people where acting like losing but the whole thing play out well and this time will be better of. https://twitter.com/thomas_fahrer/status/1633690952748666881",

I think Bitcoin has survived many speculated crashes after experiencing some downward surge in price which forced some peeps to panic sell unlike any other digital coins. It has proven to have the potential to do better and even though prices are not so stable right now, I expect to see some  positive outcome seeing as the next Bitcoin halving is a year from now.",

If anything, I'm pretty sure most people don't even know that bitcoin went down twice in the past. Even if it had literally 100% uptime, if people don't see its importance, then they'll think it's unnecessary.",

It is, on its last downtime wayback 2013, but it doesn't take long after it was fixed 5 hours later by satoshi himslef.But yeah, that was a decade ago and look what bitcoin had become up to this very moment, it may seem have usually downtrend but it won't go the very same moment 4 years ago.",
