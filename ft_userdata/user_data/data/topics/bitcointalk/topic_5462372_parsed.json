The current circulating supply according to CMC is at 44,376,440 - https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/paypal-usd/It probably won't be long before other exchanges will list it. Expect the supply to also increase so entering the top 10 is only a matter of time.",

This is also boosing the adoption from the crypto. We have known so well if paypal has a lot of users. It will be also indirectly promoting crypto. That's gonna be a real competitor for USDT. Paypal must fully disclose their practices and comply with regulations. PYUSD will be ethereum based token. I think that so many people will be using it rather than USDT as it's backed by clear entities that's fully transparent. Im waiting for major exchange sites to add it. This news is good since paypal had 426 million users. QuoteStarting today and rolling out in the coming weeks1, eligible U.S. PayPal customers who purchase PayPal USD will be able to: Transfer PayPal USD between PayPal and compatible external wallets  Send person-to-person payments using PYUSD Fund purchases with PayPal USD by selecting it at checkout2 Convert any of PayPal's supported cryptocurrencies to and from PayPal USD  https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-08-07-PayPal-Launches-U-S-Dollar-Stablecoin",

On the other hand, I don't have any doubt in mind this new stablecoin will be somehow centralized, Paypal will reserve the rights to make void coins gathered from illegal activities and won't guarantee full redentions for everyone. It is also strange that Paxos is doing this move with Paypal, keeping in mind they still have an unsolved lawsuit coming from the SEC. The BUSD case.",

This is a clear middle finger to bank transactions...They say it's ERC-20 in eth network. So what i am wondering is if they are going to use layer to like arbitrum or polygon for moving it?

Correct me if I'm wrong with this one, but if this turns out to be true... then nobody cares already unlike what it was a few years ago. Overall, nothing very surprising TBH. I'm not using Paypal anyway, and will not use it at all. Well, those Paypal users that are using crypto are the ones who will benefit the most in this one I guess especially those freelancers who wants to get paid into crypto, but it just released a few days so let's see if this will gain traction, or it will be beneficial to both the crypto users, and the Paypal users. Also I saw this topic coming from a users, and it says that there is a code in the system where they can just freeze your assets: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5462423.0I'm not a programmer, but if this true then this is an early red flag already.",

Having its own stablecoin can certainly make things a lot more convenient for anyone under the PayPal umbrella.

All they want is to hold Bitcoin and allow people to speculate on it, without leaving their own pockets. Also, it keeps Paypal in good terms with regulators. The BUSD case and the fact it has not decreased in value has more to do with the strong backing Paxos has, rather than how good or bad the lawsuit is going for that company. The fact Paypal decided to go together with Paxos, makes me assume Paypal does not think his token would ever be tagged as an unregistered security",

To be honest, I'm not surprised that they're entering the cryptocurrency world. Quite a few years ago, they were against them at first, then they integrated coin purchases into their platform, and now they're launching their own stablecoin. Not surprising if you ask me. On the one hand, I'm not too fond of major financial corporations entering the cryptocurrency world, but on the other hand, there will finally be a competitor for USDT, in which FUD and rumors are always circulating.I see plenty of negative feedback for PayPal; however, I've been a regular user of PayPal and eBay and never faced any major issues. I don't use them as regularly as I used to, but I still occasionally prefer them for purchases due to the safety they provide, at least for buyers. I've heard quite a few stories of users abusing their chargeback function in order to receive goods and services for free.",
