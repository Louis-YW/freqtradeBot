As for the exit strategy, it is subject to the profit tax, but if we ignore that, then we can talk about the strategies above.For the first time I know that the Dollar-cost average strategy can be used as a buying and selling strategy.",

So for every beginner traders, it is very important that you follow this to the tee, otherwise it might be devastating at the end. As for me, I have to learn it the hard way.

This is something that might make a difference of 10-20$ on just 100$ honestly it might not be too important for most people but I do think it's essential to keep in mind when you don't have a lot of money. But if you do have enough for investment how about you pour it in BTC then trade it for Altcoins which they are making +10% profits and then keep the amount back in BTC for long term investment. For a holder I don't think these terms applies as well, since I know people here have been holding way before the first ATH in 2017, for them it's just hoarding and waiting which helps make the market more stable and more articulate for traders! At the end everything balances out each other.",

A bull cycle can easily be identified and people can enter the market but when you are talking about taking profits then it's a bit harder to determine the perfect time. Because if you do not exist at in right time then you have to leave big profits from the hands. Actually, I try to wait for the market trend to turn from bullish to bearish. It can be identified by investigating certain elements like people's sentiments, whale's behavior, etc. Like when people's sentiment becomes too positive and they became confident about more upward momentum then you should be ready for starting off a bear market. In these points, I would like to cash out most of my funds from the markets.",

This isn't good because what's the point of having wealth when you're not using it for anything (and not letting anyone else make use of it)? There are also those who are holding until there comes a time when you don't need to sell for fiat anymore and can exchange BTC directly for goods and services. It's partially already possible, but overall still on a very limited level. But what if we don't get there in 10 years? How about 20 years? Does it make sense to hodl for that long if you already have enough in cryptos to bring meaningful change to your life? So having limitations, targets, and perhaps a habit of selling some BTC regularly and using the money on something is a good idea.",

As there's always been it's best entry, one should also know when is to make it's best exit. I think its certainly the right timing to make a good exit, and its more important that you have maximize your gains already than your losses. Otherwise, you will have to exit the crypto market because you aren't making profits anymore and are drown into losses. But by using stable coins or do the DCA, you will have less worries to make an exit as you could get back to it when you're ready.",

Having a safe and inflation protected asset class to deposit funds in afterward.An example of this could be selling a crypto exchange trading account on ebay, rather than selling assets and withdrawing funds to avoid fees and taxes. Or offering to trade an account for gold and precious metals. They might have to sell for 10% less than what their crypto holdings are worth. But a 10% loss would still be better than what they would end up paying in fees and taxes which works out to a gain.While some are selling and exiting the market. There are others who are HODLing until the next rewards halving who might be willing to acquire holdings at 10% lower of market value. That could be a win/win scenario for both buyer and seller which is a good business practice to pursue imo.",

The value though didn't go up and maybe that's one reason why I'm holding it. But as for bitcoin, well the last all time high is $19k at 2017 and then almost $70k in 2021. So that alone is a huge profits already if let's say you hold it for the last 5-6 years. So maybe some of those holders exited half of their stash and then continue to accumulate again this bear market.",
