But who knows, even some holders of shiba doesnt believe that they could attain fortune through the hype of it but be careful since we dont know what could be the outcome. Its like invest only you can afford to lose when you engage on this kind of project.",

I am being bombarded with pepe ads from my friends now. And  i accidentally stumble on this tweet:If i would have got in earlier i would probably shill it too. but it's already 120 Million marketcap. I give it maybe max 3x as it got in poloniex instantly. But it would need way more effort on their roadmap this to get any further hype.",

I personally are very much against meme-coins because for me they are all useless shit-coins that were only created because the \"team\" behind them just wanted to make a quick buck without putting in any effort, after Elon Musk made that Dogecoin tweets. I have to admit though, that Shiba Inu has managed to really create attention and hype and therefore they are by far the biggest \"second-generation\" meme-coin out there. I also think though that Shiba Inu is also not the number one pick if you look for a possible token to invest into.I also think that there won't be a new meme-coin anymore that will grow as big as Dogecoin or Shiba Inu.",

But then if you're able to take advantage of your situation of having this pepe coin too early and then there have been a bunch of people being optimistic on it.Do not forget that there are those early folks that are just waiting for the right time to take out their profits from it.",

Yup, getting in early is key and even then, it's not a sure thing with these meme coins.  A lot of them are only good for the first couple of days or so then the liquidity goes away leaving you holding the bag.As for PEPE, I think it's something special and could rise to a billion market cap or more.  I think a couple of exchanges have already listed it, so it's not just isolated in Defi anymore.  A lot more people are gonna know about it.  And I heard some Defi services have accepted it as payment.  The project prolly has some major backers.",

The crypto market is acting very crazy and a random meme suddenly is making an epic move up while the SHIB is not making a huge pump.  It only makes you see that crypto is full of memes.",
