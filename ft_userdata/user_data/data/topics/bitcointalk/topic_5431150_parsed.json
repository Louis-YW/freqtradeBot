  "content": "Just to point out, I had read somewhere else that many of the paper ballots were the right size, but the printing on them was an inch narrower than it was supposed to be. This threw off the electronic tabulators so that they rejected the ballots, because they couldn't read them... poor alignment. Then, these ballots were counted in an illegal/inappropriate way afterwards.Another major point was the 'chain of custody'. As ballots are stored or moved before and after they are counted, they need to have the handlers sign off, on paper, that they transferred the ballots, to or from whom they transferred them, the time, the location, etc. This was not done for about a third of the ballots. This means that nobody really knows where those ballots came from, or how many of them might have been manipulated illegally.Kari Lake Trial SHOCK: 42.5% of Ballots Were Illegally Printed; Couldn't Go Through TabulatorsQuote from: https://welovetrump.com/2022/12/21/kari-lake-trial-shock-42-5-of-ballots-were-illegally-printed-couldnt-go-through-tabulators/Today is day 1 of the Lake v Hobbs trial, and the Kari Lake legal team is NOT holding back.One of the key developments is that the ballots were inappropriately printed on the wrong paper.You see, the ballots are supposed to be 20 inches long in order to go through the machine.But election day ballots were printed on 19 inch pieces of paper.This meant that the vote tabulators were unable to read the ballots.This jammed the machines and led to widespread issues on election day.It also raised the question: Were these election day ballots counted appropriately?Here's the thing: Almost 50% of the ballots inspected had this issue.More specifically, 48 of the 113 ballots that the Lake legal team was able to inspect were printed on 19 inch slips.But this is just the tip of the iceberg....",

Well, honestly, I am speechless .   I watched the trial and this election was botched.  It's a stretch to say it was intentional, but they admitted to having the printer issues in the last 3 elections.At this point, I am seriously considering moving to El Salvador.",

      "body": "Regarding the election officials who control the logistics of the election, where is the dividing line between themselves being victims of a botched election, or the cause of the election failure?The point is, they have the authority to make the election work smoothly and correctly. They didn't do this. So, why is the judge and everybody else looking for intent? The point of intent or accident doesn't matter. They botched the job, and they should pay for it... and the election should be redone.Technically, the judge should act according to the wording of the lawsuit, rather than simply ordering a re-election or something. So, the Kari Lake people better be smart with how they word lawsuits, and the things that they go after. The wording counts a great deal.",

      "body": "^^^ This is one of the problems with bringing many 'points' in the same lawsuit. The suit is one. If one point is found to be false, it drags the whole suit down with it... because the suit is one. The judge has to find an 'outside' reason for rendering the suit dismissed, and in this case, he has to make it look really good so as to not incur the anger of the people, but to pacify them instead.----------Two major example of why their should be a re-election are plain. The Lake team simply failed to bring them before the judge in a way that he could rule on them to overturn the election (if he even wanted to). These points are:1. The-chain-of custody of about 1/3 of the ballots was broken. That is, ballots were handed from one person to another for storage, or for moving to another location, without a required, signed, receipt between the hand-off. This means that there is nobody to question about where the ballots came from or went to in the time of the hand-off. And, of course, it's a little more complex than simply saying it this way.2. Thousands or several hundred thousand ballots couldn't be counted by the machines. Why? They were misprinted in a way that makes machine counting impossible. My question is, how were they counted, later in a recount, if such happened? This might be important, because the method of recount might have been illegal.----------The real question is, was there enough of a mix-up so that the election should be redone?The judges answer was based on a focussing on the technicality of the lawsuit rather than on the point of the need to have a proper election. Probably his mind was made up ahead of time. Possibly he was influenced by the other judges and law people he who advised him. Likely he had to do it this way because of the points and wording of the lawsuit.The thing that still stands is that the election was not a proper election because of anomalies. And the correcting of the election may never be accomplished, because the powers that be wont allow it easily, and the people who want it done right are too stupid to effectively combat the powers that be.",

Kari Lake's legal team didn't produce evidence that the ballots weren't counted which sunk any chance of this lawsuit succeeding.",

So, my question is, how were they counted? Note that hand counts are strictly forbidden in Arizona. Besides, we are talking about thousands of ballots. Was there good observation by both major party members to see that it was all done accurately and correctly?Note that this wasn't a recount. It couldn't be, because there wasn't a count in the first place. The ballosts were originally rejected by the machines that were supposed to count them.",

She also requested that the Arizona Supreme Court immediately take her case, bypassing the Arizona Court of Appeals for several reasons.\"We're going to appeal this,\" Lake told Steve Bannon's War Room podcast Tuesday. \"We think we have absolute merit with this lawsuit, and we're going to appeal it and take it even higher.\"----------Kari Lake War Room@KariLakeWarRoom·Follow\"Arizona GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake has filed a petition to transfer her appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court after her election fraud lawsuit was dismissed.\"----------The article is very interesting. The people who are going to judge the legitimacy of Lake's appeal need to be careful that they don't perjure their Oath's of Office by the way they judge. We are talking about the spirit of a proper election, not the individual points of what Lake is doing.We need to be looking at the election as a process. Was the election done correctly? Are we sure? Why and how? Forget about Kari Lake and her emotions and her ideals. Keep our eyes on the election process ideals.",
