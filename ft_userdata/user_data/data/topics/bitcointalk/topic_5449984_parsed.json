      "body": "Before I consider using any wallet, the first thing I look at is its security. and I think that's the most important part of every wallet. One should check out the security. Is the wallet secured enough? Do I fully have control over my assets? Those are the things I look at the most in any wallet that I want to use. Transaction fees vary; most wallets usually have a custom transaction fee. You can adjust your transaction speed to how you want it, but the lower the fee, the slower your transaction will take to execute.",

Secondly is security and this is mostly achieved by using a cold wallet but there I also own hot wallet to store some funds for easy access. The cold wallet are where the huge funds are saved in. Thirdly is choosing an open source wallet, there are self custodian wallets that are closed source and it is entirely frowned upon. The transaction fees are also important but not just like the others listed above. The transaction fee problem is solved by using a wallet that supports the RBF opt-in. With this I could navigate around the amount of transactions fees to use.",

      "body": "I am generally and only referring to noncustodial wallets.Wallet is not an organization, no need to consider customer support, this forum is more than a customer support, just ask any questions about any of the reputed wallets. Transaction fee are taking by miners, not the wallet. What should first be considered is if the wallet is a cold wallet/offline or hot/online wallet. Cold wallets are safer. Then considering if the wallet is supporting RBF, very important when the mempool is congested.Other things to consider are:1. The type of address it is supporting (a wallet that is not supporting segwit should be avoided)2. Having coin control3. Having excellent fee estimation algorithm (but best to use mempool to know the fee rate to use)4. Fee customization etc5. Know if it is open source (close source wallets are not recommended).Some people may prefer privacy and go for full node wallets like Bitcoin Core, using Tor with it.",

      "body": "The most important thing before choosing a wallet is the security of the wallet. Because if the wallet is not secured then our money will never be safe there. We should avoid using wallets that have weak security systems. That is, we should always avoid wallets that can be easily accessed by others. Because when our wallet security is completed then our resources will be safe in that wallet. No matter which wallet you use, we must pay a transaction fee when making a token transaction in every wallet. The transaction fee from one wallet to another is not very high.  We never use wallets with less security due to small transaction fee variations. We should always use a strong and high security wallet even if the transaction fees are a bit high.",

We should discuss that!For a user like me, the first priority is ease of use i.e. I prefer simplicity over complex and advanced functionalities. Technical support is an important part but if the wallet is not difficult to understand for a newbie, not many ppl will require this. Transaction fees is not a question to ask since every self-custodial wallet has custom fee option where you check the mempool and set the fee for your tx as per the traffic.Also for me, pay-to-many is an important feature for bitcoin wallet and you wont find many bitcoin wallets (especially the mobile ones) having this function. I use bluewallet for all my day-to-day use. Its the best bitcoin wallet for me till date.",

We should discuss that!You are right, cryptocurrency wallets are a lot. Also, there are many different types of wallets, which you forgot to clarify. When choosing a wallet of different types, you have to take into account certain features each time. In general, I would like to highlight the following thoughts.If the most important function of a wallet is to save money, then security comes first in importance. Technical support is next. Without this, it is almost impossible to keep the security of the wallet at a high level due to rapidly changing trends in technology (attackers will simply hack a wallet that will not be updated). The next parameter is the simplicity and convenience of the wallet, which allows any user to master and use it.",

It does have a lot of complicated things but as a beginner, all you need to consider is it's a Non-custodial/decentralized and open source. Most of the users are concerned about centralized exchange because you don't have control over your money and at any moment the wallet or exchange could easily lock your account if they wanted and you can't do anything about it, unlike if you own your private key your the only one who has access to your wallet.But if you have the budget you could just buy a hardware wallet which is the best when it comes to security overall. But I would still suggest Electrum as well.  [GUIDE] How to Safely Download and Verify Electrum [Guide]",
