You send them coins and never receive any coin back.Another serious issue with third-party mixer/ tumbler is you never know what they do with user data including yours. They can write in their service terms that they will delete all log data after each session like 7 days but in reality, they might not fulfill it for their users.Recently when Chipmixer was sezied, from report we can see there are 7TB data gotten by authorities.",

There are actually tons of scam mixer websites so just avoid them completely :Scams Bitcoin Mixers List and Services closed.There are also chances to get involved in some illegal transactions because the mixer was used to not detect its history so it was used in a lot of them so it's always a big risk especially if you're going to send big funds. So I suggest just using mixers that the forum trusts so you would actually get scammed since there are members that already tried using that mixer, But still, be careful recently Chipmixer is one of the most popular mixers here in the forum was shut down and probably related to the illegal transaction so I guess just do a lot of research first before doing it as long as you finished your transaction it doesn't really matter.",

      "body": "There are various zero-trust mixers for Bitcoin and Bitcoin forks available, but they are not as extensively utilized as centralized mixers that rely on third-party trust. JoinMarket, which employs a CoinJoin mechanism to allow several users to mix their transactions together in a way that obscures their history, is one example of a zero-trust mixer for Bitcoin. Wasabi Wallet, for example, employs a Chaumian CoinJoin approach that similarly obscures transaction history.Multi-signature transactions can give an extra degree of protection to transactions, however they do not always obfuscate transaction histories. Multi-sig transactions require many parties to sign off on a transaction, which can assist to avoid fraud and enhance security. Yet, because the transaction history remains public on the blockchain, it does not obfuscate transaction histories in the same manner as zero-trust mixers do.",

Seems what you found is a centralized mixer. The recent prominent one goes bust, but there are other options. You can take a look at other services that are advertised here, but just do in mind it is still a centralized option.If you want to find a solution without centralized intermediaries or any trust, yes, there are a few options. In Bitcoin, there is a thing called Coinjoin, and various implementation of Coinjoin also exists, like Joinmarket, Wasabi, and Whirlpool. Each platform has its own advantages and disadvantages. Specifically about Wasabi, note that it recently implement shady features that you should take a look at before you want to use it.",

There was something called \"Tumblebit\", but it seems development stopped for a while ago (also a Bitcoin mixer). For ETH, there's a \"Zero-Knowledge\" mixer called Tornado.Cash but it got sanctioned by the US. Some developers forked Tornado.Cash and made a new mixer called \"Privacy Pools\", but I'm yet to see how long will it last. I guess the risk of using a mixer is being \"flagged\" by the government as they believe you're doing something suspicious such as money laundering or tax evasion. With governments hunting down mixers lately, I'd steer clear from them just to avoid bringing unwanted attention. Hopefully, privacy will survive as defenders oppose governments' actions in the long run. Who knows if they'll give up in their efforts to eliminate privacy in crypto for good? Just my thoughts",
