      "body": "One of these became popular during the 2017 bull run and bitcoin took up one square on its own iirc and that was it (I think each square was $200bn). A lot has changed since then.I didn't think a single company would break the valuation of $2tr for quire a while and then apple was worth $3tr (not sure if that happened before or after I thought it). I also thought a lot of markets were beginning to stop growing a few years before they did (about 3) so there was a bigger rise than I speculated for. Even with all this, I didn't think a $6tr market cap for crypto or bitcoin was far reaching, particularly over a larger timeframe of 4 or so years. At the time this was equivelant to the majority of the UK's property market and the market cap of gold (both have risen quite a lot since too).",

But that's the thing, a lot throw money at start-ups because they think it can give them a solid return, not that many go for old reliable companies that have a solid business model but which can't double their profits overnight.",

Some look at it and see 200x profits already, and they ask themselves, should I wait for another 5 years to double the money or should I simply stop worrying now while I don't have to spend money on blue pills to have fun? Not everyone is a long-term holder, if that would have been the case, how do you explain the drop from 65k to 16k?Each person has his own plans, his own goals and so on, that's why we will keep seeing people liquidating their coins and not buying back every single day.Again, it's possible, I would never write it off as that would just be stupid, but it's not as simple as it you make it look.",

The worse has already happened but instead of focusing too much on the negatives, why can we just focus on the positive instead? It was still not the end because as we can see it is still recovering.A drop in market cap means a drop in the price and this means people can invest more. We are not in the beginning anymore because like I said earlier, we are now recovering but if you mean the age of the market then it wasn't really new. Bitcoin the first crypto started in 2009. If fiat continues to inflate then I think it will affect BTC in a negative way because it's now difficult for them to invest here.",

They're not. It's estimated that about half of the demand for gold comes from investments (I think it's more as a lot of \"jewellery\" demand would also overlap into this category). That's x7.6 more than entire crypto market.Big money don't tend to be chasing risky >x100 opportunities, and greedy kids throwing their lunch money into get-rich-quick projects will not take crypto market into the next level.So it's not about having a cake and eating it, but just shifting from one type of investment into other, which will have to happen eventually if bitcoin carries on.

If you're at the stage of your life that you need to cash out, than you will cash out. But what's next? You will carry on working and accumulating wealth that has to be stored somewhere. If you look at the wealth distribution, people's investments grow as they age (no surprise here), so why would they switch from holding an investment that appreciates in value (be it BTC or anything else) to depreciating cash?Thinking that cashing everything out is somehow a way to stop worrying and the only way to \"have fun\" is flawed.

That's over 20% of crypto market cap we are talking about.That's a good question. In my personal opinion, stablecoins that are meant to be 100% backed by cash/treasury deposits should not be included in the total crypto market cap, as they're essentially just a token representation of fiat currency. I would make an exception for projects like dai, which is designed to keep its value at par with USD but is not necessarily backed by it.By the same logic, WBTC (Wraped Bitcoin) also shouldn't be counted. The same goes for any other \"wraps\" that are just representations of other coins on different chains.I wouldn't mind if CMC/CoinGecko or others worked out an \"adjusted\" market cap to weed out any fiat, wraps, or derivatives.Quote from: Lucius on February 20, 2023, 11:44:46 AMHere, as an example, I will state that for the first time in history, my country is issuing state bonds, the purchase of which ordinary citizens will be able to participate, and the interest rate is about 3% with a maturity of 2 years.

Many bonds would allow you to do that but you'd either lose accrued interest or have to pay some sort of fee that would reduce the interest you earned, but you would unlikely end up losing money (in nominal terms) unless you decide to redeem in the first few months.Quote from: Lucius on February 21, 2023, 10:57:32 AMIt is far from the fact that I will advise someone what to do with their money, but I know that I would rather invest in something else that can very likely bring me a profit of at least x2 or x5 in the same period, regardless of the risk that always exists. Out of curiosity, can you name a few of such? I don't think pointing investments \"likely\" to yield 6%-15%/year is as easy as it seems at first.If you have a family or other financial responsibilities, or if you just like to 'play it safe' with your finance - you probably won't go 100% on those investments anyway, as the risk is just too high. Again, we are in quite an unprecedented period, where anything could happen (markets wise). People are jumping on those bonds (or other forms of sub-inflation rate deposits) as simply there are no better, safe options.Even seasoned investors like to sit on some cash during market downtrends or recession, waiting for good buying opportunities, and if you could park that cash somewhere that yields an interest (provided you have quick access to it) - that's even better.",

But then reality kicks you in the head when you realise you're already overexposed to Bitcoin and face the dilemma of whether to further increase that exposure by putting in money you can't really afford to lose.I figured it's best to play it safe for now and see how the situation pans out in the near future. There are no safe options that allow you to beat inflation, but accepting a small loss in value seems more sensible than going all-in and hoping for the best.It's a cliche but diversifying is the key.",

Until now, I have not had the opportunity to invest in government bonds because that option did not exist, but considering that I come from a highly corrupt country where the former prime minister is in prison, and the current one is up to his neck in affairs with all his ministers, then you can understand me that I would rather invest 500 € in toilet paper than in their bond",

World Food Programme feeds over 100 million people facing severe hunger in more than 120 countries and territories every year. In 2021, we did this with a budget of $9.6 billion dollars, which was still $5.2 billion dollars short of our total funding requirements. Clearly, ending world hunger will require more money. Back in July of 2021, U.N. World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley told us it would take an estimated $40 billion each year to end world hunger by 2030. \" - https://www.wfpusa.org/articles/how-much-would-it-cost-to-end-world-hunger/so basically we can end world hunger if we allocate military spending to this",
