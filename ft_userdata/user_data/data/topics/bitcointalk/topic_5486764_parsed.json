If you are not trained well on how to trade it and you only got a little knowledge about this then provably you might get affected if certain unexpected movement came. Remember that to many people lose their money due the volatile nature of bitcoin so they should not expect anything easy of it especially if they are going to trade for short trade or even try futures trading.But if they are into long term hold and think about investing for bitcoin for long term without having any plans touching it then maybe we can say it really is since we can just use DCA method then wait for long time without getting affected whatever might happen to market because we have big goals for future. For transaction I guess bitcoin is really good option not unless the price surge high since for that situation I don't like to use bitcoin if I need to pay huge fee just to push some transaction using it.",

It's a wrong talk.QuoteJust have a view of an anonymous Bicoin P2P transaction where you could trade and transact millions of dollars legitimately with a zero risks of being physically attacked for theft or bridged of trust with a dealer after successful transactions.Bitcoin network has very high hash rate and decentralized too so it's super hard to successfully have a 51% attack on Bitcoin network.Basically if your Bitcoin transaction has 1 confirmation, it's safe. If your fund is big, you can wait for 3, 6 confirmations and even more. 6 confirmations equal to about 1 hour of waiting time, as 1 block is about 10 minutes.If your fund is bigger, wait for like 12 or 24 confirmations and you will have no worry about safety of the trade.How Many Bitcoin Confirmations is Enough?QuoteIf you are patient enough to wait for at least one confirmation then you are no longer vulnerable to race attacks or Finney attacks. Now your only concern is 51% attacks. What's the rule of thumb for an acceptable number of confirmations?1 confirmation: sufficient for small payments less than $1,000.3 confirmations: for payments $1,000 - $10,000. Most exchanges require 3 confirmations for deposits.6 confirmations: good for large payments between $10,000 - $1,000,000. Six is standard for most transactions to be considered secure.10 confirmations: suggested for large payments greater than $1,000,000.",

Before existence of exchanges in my country Nigeria what's no we normally do concerning bitcoin exchanges is through, P2P that will normally use for exchange or transaction of Bitcoin before arrival of exchange become popular so awesome that time we don't have any distrust from anyone that want to transfer with you because you must to see the person before you transfer to the person I don't know if any other person loss their bitcoin through search scenario but it was what we are using to thread Bitcoin as of that time before begin to see a different exchange and where you can read your Bitcoin without any problem, I know bitcoin for long time but I don't know where I will get more knowledge of Bitcoin like this bitcoin community, so since I'm here I've gotten different experiences of exchange which is someone can trade with not going through p2p because as on that time what is the main really important is to sell your Bitcoin because it is hard for you to find a buyer.",
