  "content": "The legendary referee Pierluigi CollinaThe only referee who had the VAR in his eyes.. This referee could communicate in 4 languages on the field (French, Spanish, Italian and English).Before each game, he studied the game and the players of the teams he would lead and learn the names of the players.During the 2002 World Cup Final in Japan, Ronaldo gave him his shirt and the ball. The players from Brazil and Germany have congratulated him on his performance. He was ruthless with his cardboard, charismatic and respected. Footballers had huge respect for him and even fear, just by his presence. This is also the only ref who has been on a video game jacket.Credit: Aiscore SportsIsn't this man a true legend..?Who is your best referee and what is his outstanding achievements.?",

He may be ruthless on the field and look terrifying at all times, but you can see and feel that he is this way in order for the players to maintain a clean game at all times and respect each other and of course, the ref's decision.Also, I don't think this man ever committed wrong calls at all. He is revered by a lot of fans and players for years for his fairness and love for the sport.",

      "body": "This man should be a professor of refereeing in top schools in the world. In my estimation, he is the world's most objective referee. He is in charge and in control of every game with depth. He can't be compared to the poor power hungry referees we see right now. Does anyone remember the moment Pierluigi Collina changed shirts with David Beckham at the 2002 World Cup?",

VAR has made it no better at all, arguably it’s made it worse because they have the tech now to do it right but still do it wrong.Something needs to be done.",

IMO the field referee doesn't have to see the display, he can just hear the advice of the \"replay referee\" and just act based on the suggestion. The decision is then final...",
