We arent on a NFT hype as of this moment but we do recently see some surge when it comes to nft purchases and volume but there are really things like these on which it would really be raising up some question.Due to the fact that there's no way on knowing on whose behind on such address, then all the thing we can do now is to speculate into those probabilities but without having those strong evidences.Its not new anymore into this market on which someone could really be able to clean up their tainted money via these kind of methods and ways on which it is really that somewhat effective.",

I seriously doubt that anyone from outside of the crypto ecosystem is coming with their $$ to invest big money into NFTs - maybe it happens occasionally, but it looks like most of the investors are crypto whales.",

With all the scams and large losses that the total NFT market has recorded this season, people are still buying NFT for millions of dollars. Well, I'm not even supposed to be surprised, knowing fully well that those buying are just business people, and they are trying to take advantage of the hype of the ordinals. If they buy at that price, they can equally sell back to their fellow big guys in the crypto space. That's if the sales and the buying are really genuine, as the market can be manipulated with just a single person or two people in the same place just to make trending news in order to fine a victim who will buy the NFT with a higher bid. We will all be here watching to see how long this ordinal hype is going to last and how many of those buying those tokens will be able to take some profit, as well as those who will also complain if they lose at the end of the day, as we are sure to see both.",
