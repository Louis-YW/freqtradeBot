No. Why? Because they all have centralized authorities. Just like ethereum and many others. Decentralized exchanges with those smart contracts have central authorities.Decentralized exchanges which are using smart contract have central authorities. Or am I wrong? The central authorities can change their decision at anytime in a way the meaning of decentralized would be changed overtime.",

Quote from: PrimeNumber7 on August 14, 2022, 09:59:24 PMThis is something that will probably cause many exchanges to rethink how they handle customers who have received transactions from illicit sources, and may even lead to litigation surrounding \"taint\".Since this is the crypto world and since in the last period we've seen only moves towards centralization and even worse proposals, for example, the rollback proposed by CZ after the hack of Binance we're not going to see a change in the definitions but more likely some new features, some shitcoins have already come with a proposal of individual whitelisting and blacklisting of addresses to which you can send funds, so Pandora's box is wide open.Back to dydx:https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1558088426926313472Some people have really no shame, after blocking accounts how they are proclaiming they will fight against this till the last satoshi....",
