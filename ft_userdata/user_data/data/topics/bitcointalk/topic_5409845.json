Bitcoin.org also does not have the most recent releases. Lastly, Bitcoin Core is changing how releases are signed and the current 23.0 release and all future releases will no longer by signed by the release key. Rather they will be signed by a large number of Bitcoin Core developers and you can verify the signature(s) with whichever developers' keys you wish.Your software should be able to retrieve and update keys from a keyserver. The keyserver that Bitcoin Core primarily uses is keys.openpgp.org. You can also download the key directly from https://bitcoincore.org/keys/laanwj-releases.asc",

AV is Windows Security. It is not deleting gpg.exe file. It is deleting its content. The file is there but with not content. Dir command showsd a 0 KB file. Can an AV erased the content of the file without erasing the file itself? Maybe it can... I have no idea. Thanks.",

It is deleting its content. The file is there but with not content. Dir command showsd a 0 KB file. Can an AV erased the content of the file without erasing the file itself? Maybe it can... I have no idea. It can. GPG4Win's installation directory contents wont delete itself.If it found that the file contains a similar malicious fingerprint, it will quarantine it and will try to \"fix\" the file (that may be the cause of the '0kB' file).",
