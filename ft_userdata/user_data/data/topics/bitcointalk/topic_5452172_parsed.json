In the lower volatility games, people will win more often, but it will be smaller wins... and with the higher volatility.. they will win less, but when they win it might be much higher. So it depends on your amount of money that you have to play with.... if you have enough to ride out the higher volatility, then play those games.... but if you have a small budget, go for the lower volatility games.",

Hacksaw is a lot more volatile on bonuses, but if they hit they have massive payouts, while Pragmatic usually pays 50x on average. In reality, you're going to lose on slots in the long run. The point is to have fun and only lose what you can afford to lose.",

Can you tell us more about your favorite slots? I do agree on this but the only problem was there's no way to determine the exact mathematical model of each slot provider because their software is not an open source. You basically relyron your hunch and experience which is not enough to prove anything since the game is base on chances. You might experience a lucky streak all the time on a certain game provider but there's no guarantee that others will experience the same because it's all about chances. Slot provider will obviously not gonna design a slot games that they have the disadvantage. I believe that the game is design based on the general RTP which means the gameplay of each user that playing same slots is connected ergo if you win then someone losses.Quote from: www.Gambler.Casino on May 10, 2023, 12:12:18 AMü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What is your favorite software?

Very long time ago I played certain online slots which seemed to be bugged because the win/loss rate was really high to me: most probably it was only my case.",

Even though you understand all slot machines, it can bring you bigger chance of winning big because luck is the only thing that will give you big win. In my opinion you will not able to increase your winning chance in slot games, but your knowledge about slot will help you to minimize bigger losing only by choosing the best slot to play.

Also, new sites offer thr bigger bonuses and promotions because that is a part of their marketing strategy and a player could make use of that. I've tried as well Pragmatic's and I'd say it is a good one just before I moved to sportsbetting afterwards. What I am trying to point is that there are .any slot providers given that it is one of the traditional games in this industry both online and land based. They would differ from UI and some sort of pattern but regardless of that, always check for its credential and to avoid rigged ones.",
