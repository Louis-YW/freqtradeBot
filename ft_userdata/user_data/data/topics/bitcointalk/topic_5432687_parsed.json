  "content": "Greetings and happy new year to you all! I've been following this website for a few months and decided to finally create an account.I'm from Australia and want to purchase 3 Bitcoin and store them offline in a cold wallet.I have never purchased cryptocurrency before but plan to invest heavily in the next 12-18 months.Given the recent collapse of FTX and other exchanges in Australia and around the world I thought it would be best to post here and get your opinions before making any transactions.I plan on purchasing 3 BTC from a large and reputable exchange (Binance at this stage) and then storing it on a cold wallet. My three questions are;1- If I were to transfer my BTC from a cold wallet to a hot wallet would this weaken the security of the cold wallet or increase my chances of being hacked?2 - Where can I securely buy BTC from without paying ridiculous fees?3 - What are your predictions for BTC in the next 12 months?I apologise if I have posted this in the wrong location and for the newbie questions. I will be reading and researching like crazy in the next few months and hope to become a productive member of this forum.Cheers,MiliMil",

Then talking about the best wallet to store your currency you may also visit Wallet software lastly since you already mentioned 3 btc you are advised not to accept any trade from personal messages from any member otherwise you could likely got scammed. For me it would be ideal you buy from p2p service provider maybe a reputable member from your local thread or any other reputable p2p service provider.About Btc price, well this is just the beginning of the year and would be very hard to speculate what would be the outcome of it but since we all looking at the next bitcoin halving meaning after it then we may experience a tremendous increase.

Making it public that you're about to purchase 3BTC and asking for some sort of assistance would surely attract lots of scammers to you.Also, why not make a smaller transaction first, and familiarize yourself with how Bitcoin works and how to store it. As you said, you've never purchased any cryptocurrency before, so it's much better to start light and grow your investments as you learn more.Quote from: MiliMil on January 02, 2023, 08:14:39 AM1- If I were to transfer my BTC from a cold wallet to a hot wallet would this weaken the security of the cold wallet or increase my chances of being hacked?2 - Where can I securely buy BTC from without paying ridiculous fees?3 - What are your predictions for BTC in the next 12 months?• It doesn't necessarily weaken the security, except that when you make a transaction from a wallet, it exposes the public key and further transactions from it can be traced. Ideally when sending out from a cold wallet, you should not reuse it.• It heavily depends on your location. If you have a local board on the forum, it would be a good place to ask.• More of the same in 2023, possibly some upwards movement towards to $25k - $30k range, but mostly sideways movement.",

      "body": "First answer: You should not be too scared about this hot or cold wallet of a thing, try to use a non-custodial wallet for the hot wallet dealing, and make it an open source. Many keep their BTC with the hot wallet, and nothing bad has happened to it. It's your choice though, it might be a cold wallet in your case as it's more secure and doesn't connect to the internet. Also, you might want to read the advice from @ theymos here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5421039.msg61293646#msg61293646.Second answer: You have to be careful of Binance in purchasing the BTC. The reason for that is that there are cases in which Binance seized people's money in the guise of some conditions and security checks. You might save yourself the drama by using your credit card to buy directly from your non-custodial wallet through their partners and transfer to wherever you want to save it.Third answer: I would advise you to keep the BTC for almost 2 years for maximum earnings. The reason is that 2023 might still be challenging for BTC, it might reach some highs and lows over the year. However, 2024 is a promising year for the coin as it's the year of halving where it could move significantly higher as per its tradition every 4 years.",

But since he is looking to use the lowest-cost exchange, I don't think Bisq or any decentralized exchange will have cheaper fees than Binance. Currently, I see that Binance has the cheapest trading and withdrawal fees, exactly as OP requested.And as a newbie without much trading experience, I don't think using DEX will be convenient for him. I think it won't be a problem if he uses Binance to buy bitcoins and then moves all bitcoins to cold wallets.",

In my opinion, the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange had a negative impact on the entire crypto industry.  This negative effect will have far-reaching consequences.  In the future, the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and Tether is possible.  The collapse of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange is also possible.  The collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange has weakened the position of Bitcoin lobbyists in Washington.  As a result, there are many uncertainties associated with the upcoming legislative regulation of the crypto industry.  All this does not contribute to the rise in the price of bitcoin in the next 12 months.  In this regard, in the next 12 months, I expect a flat period (low volatility and stabilization of the price of the first cryptocurrency).I agree, I think there will be long term and negative spillover on crypto because of FTX. Ordinary investors will be turned off by it. If that can happen to FTX what's to say it can't happen at Binance? I think people should store their crypto in their own wallets so they are in full control. Do you mind if I ask if you keep your holdings on an exchange or your own wallet?",

Any tips would be greatly and humbly appreciated.I think that you may be misunderstanding something, so let's make the terms clearer.Cold wallet or cold storage is usually a wallet software running on a laptop that's always offline.Hardware wallet is an external device that can create wallet seed and sign transactions; this also needs a wallet software running on a laptop or smartphone, but they can be (should be) connected to the internet.So, in order to get the master public key from a cold wallet you need either an USB stick, either (better) a camera, since Electrum allows sharing all kind of info, including the master public key, as QR image. If this is the \"connect the cold wallet to the laptop/smartphone\" you had im mind, then maybe you've used bad terms and I'm too strict.If you meant hardware wallets... then there's no sharing of keys between the HW and the software wallet from your laptop/smartphone you should do. By connecting the HW to the wallet software the wallet software knows what to do in order to show you the addresses and request signing transactions. In this case, some wallets (Ledger Nano S plus, Trezor T, Trezor one, some others too) work with cable connection, others (Ledger Nano X, Satochip, some others too) work with wireless connection (Bluetooth or NFC) hence don't need physical connection.",
