I just wanna try to remind you if you can use the new poroject as investment for the future but remember that if this is also a big gambling for you. The fact that if this time people known that so well. investing in the new project is not a bad thing at all but the result may be giving you a lose.",

The cryptocurrency industry is faced with rapid development and that explains why we have several short lived projects. I agree with you that in the coming years we'll be having more new projects replace the existing ones. It's no news that projects are lunched daily and the industry is characterized by massive competition and it's a situation of survival of the fittest.",

Now is a difficult time for the crypto industry, but for some, this is a time of fear, and for some, the best opportunities to enter or launch a project. Based on past years, there is a high probability that it is at such a time that the most influential and profitable projects are born. Hard times are just the beginning of a new phase and new investment opportunities. Specify the sites of the projects you indicated (Mohash and Dynamic) and I will conduct an analysis for myself.",

During the last Bull run i mainly invested into new and upcoming projects because i am part of a few launchpads and there i could take part in the private sale of new projects. During the height of the last bullrun in may 2021 my portfolio had a significant value, at least for my standards, but sadly now the portfolio value is now down at least 95% from it's ATH.That is the reason why i don't really follow new and upcoming projects at the moment and why i have never heard of Mohash and Dynamic before.It can definitely be true though that if projects are confident enough to launch during a bear market like these and are still doing well, then the chance that they will be pretty big projects in the future is definitely there.",

You may be right, but it's not entirely possible to suggest that a particular project has the same potential. Because we've seen a lot of downs and downs of scam projects that just take profits and walk away with millions of dollars. Especially the shitcoins which this year have damaged the crypto market. Precisely with the current phenomenon, people will be much more careful in paying attention to new projects.",

We know that the bear markets will bring down a lot of the coins currently in the market and make them disappear, and we also know that many developers will see this and try to take advantage of the situation and take the market share of those coins for their own projects.However while all of that is true this is not the moment to blindly invest in a coin with an uncertain future when not only this market but the whole world economy is having huge issues and we are about the enter a recession, if we are not in one already, right now is the moment to play it safe, and investing in a bunch of altcoins no one has ever heard about is not the definition of safe of the majority of those investing in this market.",

This is good advice, but new projects that have potential will need someone who is an expert in hunting them, but for a new investor, the top coins will be more secure for him because of the large number of new projects in the market, which will make him confused in choosing the right project and he may choose a new project that does not have goals or market value and anchor it The case until he finds his capital has become shitcoins, so he has to constantly check new projects in the market and listen to reviews from experts about the projects he wants to invest.",

New projects can rise up to the top but then again, it will depend on how good the project is so its really advisable to analyze before you invest on new projects, usually it takes time before they reached the peak and get the attention of big investors so having more patience is also a requirement. They are all came from a new project status, its just that they continue work and implement good updates, that’s why top coins right now are still performing.",

It's because there are no proof, this are all speculations and marketing strategy of some new coins to displace those old, but that seldom happens. If there is a new project that is great then it will succeed and compete wit the best, by not totally replace them, that is the wrong mindset for a new project.Quote from: S3300 on June 30, 2022, 02:49:22 PMAnyone noticing new projects still raising millions of dollars?

I'm sorry but I'm not going to take your advise. Matic, Polkadot and Avalance are projects born out of the bear market.

There will always be new projects that could give us short term profits, but remember we are not here for short term profiting, but certainly for long term investments that could give us more huge and clearer profits. However, if you want to engage in new projects which you think have high potentials, then just invest an amount you can afford to lose. After all, investments take risks, there is no guarantee when to make profits and when is not. So always invest with caution and as much as possible, invest in established coins that have proven their utility cases already.",
