      "body": "With the so many messenger apps available such as Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger. I don't see the point of the app. Maybe an inbuilt troll box within the Binance App could be OK. This reminds me of the time Binance launched a “decentralized exchange” just because the likes of Etherdelta, Forkdelta were so popular, but it was all a complete fail. I don't think that messenger app will gain any traction in my opinion.",
