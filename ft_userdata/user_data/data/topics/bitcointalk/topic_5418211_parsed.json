  "content": "Here's the current situation in BritainThe incoming PM of Britain has a lot of work to do because, last month, sterling plunged to a record low against the dollar and government borrowing costs rose sharply in the aftermath of outgoing Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget. Also, On Friday last week, the pound fell as low as $1.11 and government borrowing costs rose amid continued political uncertainty and fresh warnings about the UK economy. The new PM has been advised to set out fully costed plans to deal with the big issues facing businesses; soaring energy bills, labour shortages, spiraling inflation, and climbing interest rates.  If you have been following up with the news, do you really think that Mr Sunak has what it take to take Britain to it days of glory? What does his win mean for investors in Britian?",

Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt went the populist route, reducing taxes left, right and the center and in the end destroying the fiscal equilibrium. Sunak on the other hand always warned against such steps. He is well educated and professionally qualified for the job of British PM. Sunak has worked for various hedge funds, including those from Goldman Sachs. This experience should help him in his job.",

It's one of the far-from-unexpected results of leaving EU. EU still have some funds left and those may make a huge difference in the following months (or years!). UK is missing all that.The new PM to be.. I don't know much of him. I know that some called him supported of crypto, but then it turned out he is more a supporter of CBDCs than actual cryptocurrencies.If he survives long enough as PM he may give some good laws related to this industry, but I would not hold my breath.What he will do for UK economy is debatable, he may have very narrow space to change anything.",

What does his win mean for investors in Britain?For Britain, the rising cost of inflation is telling a lot both within the country and for all other countries who depends on the pound for trade. Taxes have become so heavy that if it is continued to be imposed, market crashes will occur and investors would be forced to explore other options. With the new King of England, things are with Mr Sunak a welcomed development and as we watch him start his work to ensure stabilization of the pounds and reduction of inflation we hope to see more investors come in to do business. We also hope he embraces the crypto currency as part of resolution to reduce inflation .",

Sunak has worked for various hedge funds, including those from Goldman Sachs. This experience should help him in his job. Rishi Sunak officially became Prime Minister of Great Britain today, October 25, after an audience with King Charles III. The king invited Sunak to form a new government. He became the country's third prime minister in less than two months and the youngest prime minister in 200 years.Sunak said his government will prioritize economic stability and confidence. Also, previous statements by Rishi Sunak indicate that he is not going to change the course of Britain previously set by Boris Johnson in support of Ukraine. Therefore, one should not expect a change in the course of Great Britain, especially in the foreign policy arena. Let's see how Rishi Sunak does it in practice.",

The resident of 10 Downing Street is a big assignment that will not only oversee the economy of the UK but to manage UK under EU and that is where the challenge has been for those outgone PM. I hope we still remember brexit and this will keep interfering in the political climate of EU. Rishi Sunak is the youngest PM of UK for like 2 centuries , I hope he is going to be dynamic to lead the UK economy to more stable pounds and economic growth.",

I don't just know what she and her team was thinking when they came up with those controversial policies. The truth is Rishi Sunak has an enormous task to accomplish if elected.I think the resignation of Liz brought a little relief to the market. But the incoming prime minister must have to build back the confidence of investors and this can be done through well planned viable policies. Getting a cheap source of power would not be an easy task for the new government because almost all European nations a competing for gas supplies and OPEC+ has no intention of increasing the daily outputs. And Iran which was predicted to be an alternative gas supplier would get more sanctions because of the use of it's military drones on Ukraine.",

But however, personal experience, qualifications and exposure to the world's economics are never enough when it comes to running a successful political position without the help of loyal and good supporters working around you, not to mention Britain a very powerfull nation. Theresa May did a wonderful job during her 3yrs in office, and same did Boris Johnson under the leadership of a queen, but Rishi Sunak happens to be the first Prime Minister of English to rule under the leadership of a king i.e King Charles. So I think this is a sign that there will likely be a greater change in Rishi Sunak administration.",
