At that time I was just 16 years old and liked bitcointalk on the one hand because there was an incredible amount of meme shitposts and giveaways (bitcoin giveaways and not shitcoin drops like today), but on the other hand I was fascinated that random strangers on the internet would basically answer every question that could potentially arise about bitcoin. Over the years bitcointalk has change a bit and has grown into a more professional platform, even if at the same time it has lost some very great minds (and found some). My wish for the next ten years would be that we can keep this platform as it is and at the same time are able to preserve all this knowledge that was stored here for the last years (since for now it mostly depends on active, well educated users answering questions).My wish for bitcoin however is that we can have as much adoption as possible since even if not everyone thinks the same, for me this is the most important step for the long term success of a decentralized payment system.",

Many people created account in 2013 but couldn't continue to be active. Indeed you got this forum very early and gives valuable time. It's fascinating to see the growth and changes in the these ten years from meme and one line post to more professional, helpful posts with full share of knowledge. We expect something more professional in the next decade. Many members are using their potential to make this forum most accurate, useful, knowledgeable which is backbone of this forum. we are hoping for continuous growth and wider acceptance of decentralized payment systems in the future.",

I love your courage and of coming back to the forum after you went for 5yrs and 5 months, this shows that during your absence, you were missing the forum and it's bag of knowledge for you to come back again to enjoy the benefits of learning in the forum about bitcoin and its various angles. I guess that maybe you forgot your password and you couldn't login, if not by now you should have been a Legendary member. I hope that you could stay for another ten years like you said.

In my current understanding, this forum and bitcoi are forever inextricably linked.I would like to see more and more \"active, well educated users\".

Was it a coincidence, or did you search for Bitcoin and the forum suddenly appeared to you?I saw a video about bitcoin mining where they set up a block eruptor for solo mining but basically said \"don't do it it will lead to nothing\". Still I was very interested because they said that with bigger machines you could do some real mining. Since I owned quite a nice gaming PC then I searched for more informations and the best (and maybe only) source then was bitcointalk. Today that has changed and I feel that many young people prefer reddit for bitcoin related stuff, but I think thats somewhat the result of the old forum design. Because in 2011 when the forum was started this was a state of the art design, but it is not anymore. Quote from: Sim_card on November 03, 2023, 04:20:10 PMWow, congratulations mate. I love your courage and of coming back to the forum after you went for 5yrs and 5 months, this shows that during your absence, you were missing the forum and it's bag of knowledge I had a lot of trouble with exchanges that stole my funds and therefore bitcoin was not the best topic for me. After some time I got over it and came back to start over again. This time with a much more solid cold storage approach, that I did not really understood when I first entered bitcoin. Also there are now very good cold storage options like seed phrases that were not present in the beginning. I think this lead to many more coins that are lost forever than people may think because of the modern possibilities for backups now.Quote from: digaran on November 03, 2023, 03:14:13 PMWhat a coincidence to have 826 activity and 628 merits when celebrating an anniversary.
