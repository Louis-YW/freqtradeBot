  "content": "I been here a month now and finally got my first Merits  (I really like the point with them, it shows that you have been here long and have contribute with good posts! Thank you guys with a lot of merit I have for sure read a lot of your helpful post!)What Merits is the hardest Merit to get? Is it the first one's or maybe the later ones? I understand this is a bit confusing, but maybe to a new account people are aware to not giving out Merits to easy just because so for example someone that had bad intention here getting ranked up to fast.And some people are lucky that are a part of a Local Board and I see that them get a lot of much more Merits then the rest of us! Nothing wrong with that at all, but just noticed it! But.....Can't that be a bad thing? Because for those people, it would be easier to make more accounts and then maybe get in more of this \"sign campaign?\" Or maybe that's it's not against any rules. What do I know  Just a interesting question I started to think about.... I think it can be logical to have it harder to get Merit in the beginning before the forum learn to know you. I don't know... What do you guys think? and What do you guys think it should be? But should it no also be like... If you are a really good guy that can handle posting good, you are good in words, can't then people get like to high standards for that person? So it can be hard for him also to get Merit.I am pretty bad in words, and explain my self, often it don't come out as i want it, but very rarely it does. So I would guess getting Merits for me will be very hard since I am not in a local board!  But hey, that don't bother me, I am in no rush at all to get Merits! I just enjoy to learn things about crypto on this forum that I basically do daily.I don't think the Merit system is wrong or bad in anyway I really like it. But say that some people don't take advance of it, is wrong. But hey nothing can be perfect! You need to make some effort to be a part of the forum and I really like that concept, but it just that it's way easier for some people to rank up faster then other, and all of these people that rank up fast.. Maybe they don't can contribute to the forum as they should with comparing to the their rank.  Maybe a possibility is that... One person create a lot of accounts and beg for Merits and then join a lot of Signature Campaign, but that's maybe it's not wrong and are allowed. Excuse me for not being on point on everything and know how everything works, it was just some thoughts  I had.  Thanks in advance for answers! & I hope I i didn't step on anyone toes. - BabyBandit",

As you continue to grow in the forum merits becomes more easier to get that’s if you keep up what you were doing initially without changing.",

After Full member rank, first 100 merit, you will feel ranking up is more easy. And earning from 101 merit to 250 merit will be easier. You even can earn 150 merits more quickly than first 100 merit.Because after first 100 merit and time for it like 3 months or 6 months, you have enough knowledge about forum, merit system, Bitcoin and surely you are more helpful in forum.

In 2018 when the merit system was introduced we could talk about difficulty getting the first merit for newbies (and most users too) but it's not that way now with merit sources and others putting up threads to help people rank up. I acknowledge that it might take genuine newbies time to find these threads and to post in them as the usual navigation problem most of us had coming here too. However, if they do find them, just a single merit doesn't take much to give out if they've enough activities for it. Again, I've come to realize that most people find it enticing giving merit to those are at the verge of ranking up. Perhaps, it gives them satisfaction knowing they helped push someone to their next rank. So, in that case most newbies easily rank up if they aren't having just bounty reports.

The user: \"PytagoraZ\" https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3559721 Got a lot of merit just because he begged in the Local board, I don't say it's wrong, but you can't compare it with someone that don't have a local board and need to start from scratch and use the brain to create good posts that other users like.  Quote from: Mpamaegbu on September 15, 2023, 11:53:58 PMQuote from: BabyBandit on September 15, 2023, 10:19:39 PMJust a interesting question I started to think about....

Based on my personal observation and experience, my first merit was not hard to get; it came easy to me, which was a bit surprising as I was never expecting it when I got a merit added to my profile. This was from my first thread, which I created when I began my journey here. The place where I experienced some difficulties and it almost turned into a nightmare for me was after I crossed 10 merits and achieved a member rank. Ranking up to full member was like I was chasing 10,000 merits and not 90 merits extra; it was as if everything was going very slowly. 1 merit added to my merit count looked very odd to me, and this was the time when I had a missed feeling regarding whether I was ever going to get enough merit for my rank or not. But lucky for me, after sometimes being able to make enough and rank up to full member rank, I have never had a hard time again making some merit, as I hardly look at the flow of it again as they were just coming in more than I expected them, and sometimes I got the required rank merit before I met up with my activities. Full member merit was what gave me a hard time to achieve.",

But yes, at that time I was \"ill\" from the bounty, and of course, no one would give merit to a bunch of reports. But after completing my stupid journey of hunting for shitcoins and the next steps to expose scam projects, they gave me a lot of merit. The point is that you can’t just sit and wait for someone to come and give you something. Publish what you know; your skills will probably be useful to the forum and community. People see sincerity and know how to be grateful. The main thing is not to go out of your way to always be where there is an opportunity to catch merit. In addition, ranks that have a lot of merit cannot transfer some of the merit to their alt accounts. Firstly, this is not fair, and secondly, the community will see this, and it may turn out that, due to greed, a person will ruin his account, acquiring a bad reputation.",
