Bitcoin.org is the official website for bitcoin it provides a detailed introduction to bitcoin mining and how it works. You can find the information under the \"Getting Started\" section of the website https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/how-to-minenext is Bitcoin Mining Hardware it provides information on the latest Bitcoin mining hardware, including reviews and comparisons of different ASICs.https://www.bitcoinmininghardware.org/You can also read some discussions here at mining section, also you can ask questions and learn from experienced miners. It has an entire section dedicated to mining. Just don't be shy to ask or share some of your thoughts about mining or maybe if you are also interested in trading.",

There is no different between this thread and this https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5450563.0. this thread would have been a comment in the other thread. Op I know that you are looking for for Merits but this not the way to have it. Read more than posting, so that you have a quality post to have what you are looking for. CPU is good in the Mining field and also ASIC mining is good as well. All what you have to do is to have the machines and start with the ones you have first.",

Motherboards have 1 processor, Chinese budget motherboards have 2 processors, but these are old server processors.About FPGA read the posthttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5446401.0",

And the practice of bitcoin mining is also known by the majority of the community here that it will really require a lot of money and knowledge. So I strongly agree with what you said that even if the capital is small, it is a better way to buy bitcoin than to do bitcoin mining.",
