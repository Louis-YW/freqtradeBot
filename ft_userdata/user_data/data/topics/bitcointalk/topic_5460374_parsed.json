And that USB is even going to be hotter that you barely touch it based on what the guy said on that video.",

Later, when Bitcoin mining comes to GPUs or FGPAs, ASICs, you can not return to mine bitcoin with CPUs or USBs. Because difficulty on the network is very high and even solo mining with an ASIC is impossible to find any block. Chance is nearly 0% with solo mining nowadays.",

Why not? If the USB miner is using bitmain S9 or s19 chips, what's stopping you from mining?You need to differentiate between a CPU or GPU which are standalone units and USB which is a standard for connectivity.",

God have mercy on your soul, it's better to buy Bitcoin with what you have, your money will be safe with Bitcoin instead of meme coin, you can wake up one day and find out that the meme coin is no more existing, maybe rug pulled. Even if it's not a meme coin and it's PoW alt I still won't try it because Bitcoin is the best bet for every new crypto investors. If you can't afford a Asic miner today it's not the end of the world yet, tomorrow is another day, maybe trying to buy Bitcoin now will open door to buying Asic miner someday, it's possible, think about doing this rather than some altcoins.",
