How could it carve out space in the financial world as fast as it did? Especially considering a comparison to traditional markets. The number of trading hours shows whence it comes and what real value it brings to investors.I find it very interesting to look at how this will shape the overall financial future. Fast adoption and innovation in cryptocurrencies tell us that we are in for a huge shift. It is going to be quite interesting to see how traditional markets react to it.Quote from: joniboini on September 22, 2024, 12:30:43 AMHow is this data calculated?

CMIIW.The information is generally US stock market-based, but of course you're right that with global trading times comes a different view. In the Information Age, the 24/7 availability of Bitcoins sure does make it a standout from traditional markets.I do agree, as to how that downtime with Bitcoin comparison by the traditional payment services would indeed provide some interesting insights, especially towards those who consider anti-sharing. It really shows how it is a readily available and reliable source of payment. Stories about this continue to evolve. And I'm curious to see how these comparisons will affect people's perceptions in the future.",

With stock market, it is since 1970s and with Bitcoin market, it is since late 2009. The Bitcoin genesis block is in January 2009 but it takes some months before there are exchanges for Bitcoin to have active trading.First Bitcoin exchange: New Liberty Standard was active in October 2009.Bitcoin market is 24/7 and all days each year but because there are about 40 years in difference, I really doubt that total active trading hours of Bitcoin market since 2010 is more than total active trading hours of stock market since 1970s.https://bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price/QuoteOn 2009-10-05 the market price of Bitcoin is first established at $0.000764/BTC by New Liberty Standard, the first Bitcoin exchange ($1.00 buys 1309.03 BTC.)

First of all, Bitcoin market is not an official single market and it doesn't close, so I guess it's just considered open 24/7. As for the stock market, it's an important point that it's only the US stock market, not world stock market, and I also think the calculation difference is probably because the stock market does open and close, it's not open 24/7 and not even open every day. So yes, it's possible that Bitcoin market surpassed the US stock market by some calculations, and it's still interesting trivia if true, but that doesn't signify the importance or significance of Bitcoin because it's based more on a technicality and on Bitcoin (not just in the US) vs only the US stock market.",
