  "content": "This is something I've been working on since chatting with @TryNinja and @LoyceV about how they repair holes in their post archives after an outage. The way SMF combines topic IDs with message IDs makes it very awkward for scrapers to fill in gaps, because even though they know what ranges of message IDs they're missing, they often don't know what the corresponding topic IDs are.Normally, the link format for a given (anchored) message, looks like this: /index.php?topic={topic_id}.msg{message_id}#msg{message_id}This patch changes SMF so that it will also accept an asterisk [1] as the topic ID: /index.php?topic=*.msg{message_id}#msg{message_id}Here's the diff for @theymos:Code:--- baseline/Sources/QueryString.php 2011-02-07 16:45:09.000000000 +0000+++ modified/Sources/QueryString.php 2023-08-23 12:36:25.000000000 +0000@@ -65,41 +65,41 @@   - makes sure a string only contains character which are allowed in     XML/XHTML (not 0-8, 11, 12, and 14-31.)   - tries to handle UTF-8 properly, and shouldn't negatively affect     character sets like ISO-8859-1.   - does not effect keys, only changes values.   - may call itself recursively if necessary.   string ob_sessrewrite(string buffer)   - rewrites the URLs outputted to have the session ID, if the user     is not accepting cookies and is using a standard web browser.   - handles rewriting URLs for the queryless URLs option.   - can be turned off entirely by setting $scripturl to an empty     string, ''.

Quote from: TryNinja on August 23, 2023, 03:26:44 PMThis would make a huge difference for current and future features on multiple projects of mine, thank you for coding it, @PowerGlove.No problem, it's cool to hear that it'll make a difference to your projects. I enjoy messing around with SMF, but it means a lot to me when my stuff ends up making a positive difference (of course, I'm at the mercy of theymos' preferences and schedule, but I think there's a pretty good chance that this one will get merged).Quote from: LoyceV on August 23, 2023, 04:37:49 PMI guess an asterisk was easier to patch than isolating just one post?Yup, this patch is basically just one if statement with a 4-line body, placed in just the right spot. I could make it more complicated and isolate a single post, but I don't think that's worth the complication.When this feature is being used for its intended purpose (helping scrapers to fill in gaps in their archives, and gracefully recover from DDoS attacks, etc.), I don't think efficiency is a major factor; like you said, you only have a few thousand posts missing from your archive.Interestingly, if you misuse this feature, and try to build a complete scraper from it, then it returning multiple posts per request actually helps efficiency. What you would do is start from post 1 (/index.php?topic=*.msg1) and then parse all the posts that come back (if any), being careful to (conceptually) knock their message IDs off the list before advancing to the next post. In practice, that'll probably amount to keeping track of already-visited messages with some kind of data structure that allows for doing lookups in sublinear time (like a map, or a set).Quote from: LoyceV on August 23, 2023, 04:37:49 PMOne question: will the resulting page also show the topicID somewhere?Yup, the asterisk is (mostly) transparent to the rest of SMF, so the page will render just as if you had supplied the correct topic ID.",
