      "body": "As it's difficult to manage a person, family, friend or yourself same thing is applicable to managing strangers that work as a team to achieve a goal in a project. Management is always easier in real life compared to online. But, a ruthless manager will gain his goals whether online or offline. People tend to learn from punishment and moderation especially on the internet. However, if a manager celebrates failure with his team they're possibility that they'll win someday (applicable to offline). Always love the people you manage, family, friends, or co workers and don't treat anyone different from others. Care for everyone of them equally if you expect positive results.",

Managing a person doesn't mean they willÂ  adhere to instructions neither will it limit their spamming that is why reward systems helps put all things in check. Everyone does what pleases them the only time people try to get co-ordinated is when incentives get included then we see a certain level of co-operation. If we are to judge it from a fair point even bounty managers are only committed because of the incentive the get.",
