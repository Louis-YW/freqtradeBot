In fact, I'd like to see bottle flip introduced as a popular competitive game than that butt slapping contest.",

If in that game you bet, you play with money, even if it is sometimes as the OP said, I understand that it makes sense for it to be here. Could you explain what it is, OP? Is it about throwing the bottle and having it land on its feet? Or catching it in your hand? What kind of bets are usually involved? As it is a game that looks like a street game I imagine it will be low stakes.",

They can decide to add money to it to make it more fun, so that if you can flip more than five times, then you will have the money. Apart from that, I don't see this as real gambling. It's just something that can be done by friends to while away their time of leisure.",
