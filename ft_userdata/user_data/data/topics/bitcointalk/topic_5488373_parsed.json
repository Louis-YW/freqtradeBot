If you haven't started investing yet, do it now because if you keep waiting, you will never move to start. Verify your finances well and make a portion of the money for investment or to meet your living needs, so that it won't cause financial problems when you want to invest. You have known this forum for a long time, but you haven't learned to understand current developments so you are left behind in terms of age on the forum because now there are many people who are involved in investing even though they are younger.It's never too late as long as you want to do it and all you need to do is make a responsible investment portion. Some people don't have a stable source of income making it difficult for them to invest but there is a way if they want to do it. Study the DCA strategy and do several studies to bring you complete knowledge before investing because there are many people who just force it without knowledge.",

We are still in the early stages and opportunities still abound for us, what matters is how long you stay in the market, not how early or late you enter. Because even if you bought bitcoin 10 years ago, I bet you wouldn't have been able to hold it until now. And to be able to survive the longest in the market, you need to have knowledge about it, so I recommend that besides investing, you should spend time learning and researching the market carefully. That way you can survive and make a profit from it, but if youÂ  invest only because of Fomo, then sooner or later you will lose money and leave the market.",

Sure it would of been wise to invest in bitcoin in 2014 for $200 or buy the ETH ico around the same time but we all have investing regrets.I mined so many ETH all thru 2016 to 2017 and sold it all when ETH broke $20. Later in the year it went to $1100. No way could I predict that since when I mined it, it was $10 or so. $1100 an ETH made no sense and most never held until then.",

You can see how the value of Bitcoin is increasing and its adoption is increasing - this proves how great Bitcoin's potential is in the future. It's never too late to start investing in it. Just start with a smaller amount and invest regularly, try doing that for the next few years and you will definitely be able to get a profit from your investment.

But of course, now it's not too late to invest in BTC because the Bitcoin halving hasn't started yet and the bull run is still a long way off, namely the bull run is predicted to be around 2025.If you like this forum, I'm grateful and indeed this forum has many benefits because here there are many people who are great in their knowledge about Bitcoin. If you are interested in investing, of course you can start now or you can also wait for the Bitcoin price to correct. However, there are also many people who use the DCA system, but you need to remember that investing in BTC is certainly not free from risks, so you have to be prepared for the risks and only money that you are ready to lose is worth putting in Bitcoin.I think many people have known about BTC longer than you, but they were not at all interested in Bitcoin until now and actually you are a lucky person because you are interested in investing in BTC.",

Like you, I believed in cryptocurrencies but never bothered to touch it because my fear of the risks outweighed logical thinking back then. I wasn't earning much before, and had my investments fail, I would have just wasted time and money. Nevertheless, I still followed my instincts and began putting in small amounts every time I receive my paycheck. It's never too late to invest in bitcoin. You can still create a sizeable portfolio through DCA. You don't have to buy coins outright if your wallet can't afford it, but you can buy little bits and pieces and it adds up eventually. 10 years is a long time to not do anything. Hopefully this time you get the initiative to do something about your positivity towards bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.",

What do you think?Investing in bitcoin is never too late. If you want the event of bitcoin at a low price, then a sudden bull run will never happen again. Yes,Â  there are still bull runs happening in bitcoin. You just have to find your way of knowing what and when is the right time to invest in bitcoin. You can do a DCA, wherein you buy a portion of bitcoin at the right price at the right time and then wait for the price of bitcoin to increase, just as you brought bitcoin.Â An example of this is what is happening right now in bitcoin, where it already surpasses its ATH. Take note that this is only a preparation for the actual bull run, meaning we are just accumulating bitcoin assets, and due to demand, the price of bitcoin keeps on increasing, so is investing too late? No, because if you can take the risk and enter the market, you might experience bullishness and earn from it.",
