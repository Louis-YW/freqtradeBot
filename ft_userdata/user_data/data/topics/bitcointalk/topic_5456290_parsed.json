If you transfer to the Bitcoin network address, we will charge a 5000 sats base fee + a miner fee.The way they introduce the fees is not that of someone with in-depth knowledge of Bitcoin, it's the first time I've heard of Bitcoin transaction fees for transaction volume i.e. total amount being transferred or why the wallet asks for a fee besides mining fees.QuoteIs our wallet custodial?Yes, because we want to make Bitcoin and Lightning Network accessible to the general public around the world. Therefore, the current LifPay design without people owning their node is the best way we can think of to encourage as many people as possible to join the Lightning Network. Custodial wallet , there is no reason to use them, we have better open source options.[1] Bitcoin Tipping Service on Twitter is a Scam",

But the app stores are already saturated with bitcoin LN mobile wallets, so if someone really wants to stand out, they should make a desktop solution as well. It could actually be easier even, as desktop apps have the capability to run in the background.",

Yes it's custodial, but as I like to point out ANY funds on your phone are not secure so you should not have that much in it anyway. So yes it's bad, and not your keys not your coins. But it's another LN wallet out there and that is a good thing.As for people running their own LN node, yeah I do it and so do a lot of other people here, but we are edge cases. Most people just want things to work magically in the background and don't want to know how or why.-Dave",
