As you have already received a full list of payment processors that will help you to accept bitcoin, I wouldn't go that route. Rather I would request you to focus on two important aspects,1. Is bitcoin a legal tender in your country? It is important because otherwise you will face issues while doing business taxes. 2. Have you considered the volatility of bitcoin price? A risk analysis needs to happen before you go ahead with your decision of accepting bitcoin. It has both upsides and downsides.If you are certain about these two points, go ahead and start accepting bitcoin.",

Then, you need to create a Bitcoin wallet if you want to accept Bitcoin for the payment of your products. You can visit this site to know it https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/create-bitcoin-wallet/. And, when you already got Bitcoin, you can sell the Bitcoin on crypto exchanges. Here is the list of crypto exchanges https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/.I think you should let people pay with Bitcoin if it is legal in your country. You will get a bigger number of customers if you allow a crypto payment (ex: Bitcoin).",

It's nice that people are now discovering cryptos and they think that it will be good to use for online shopping other than PayPal, credit/debit cards, Payoneer, etc. Speaking of traditional payment methods, maybe they got bored of them and wants to try something out of the box.You don't really need to look for a third party service but you can always do it on your own. Just install a legit crypto wallet and take that QR code and receiving address and put it in your site but you may need to ask the help of your site developer if you don't have a knowledge when it comes to those things.",

The services however is a yearly subscription which you'll pay but just like Bitpay, you can accept different cryptos.With the current price of BTC, I think its perfect time to accept BTC for stacking to wait for its price to rocket.",

Even though the OP's business isn't involved in even \"dark\" transactions, sometimes services have subjective reasons for freezing assets.^Probably you need to because you need their API to connect to the payment system, they are payment processors and I think there is no decentralized service doing this. But all you have to do is don't store long-term BTC in any of those payment processor wallets because they are not reliable, once the BTC payment is transferred, quickly transfer it to your hardware wallet.",

Even though the OP's business isn't involved in even \"dark\" transactions, sometimes services have subjective reasons for freezing assets.Read all my words first. I mentioned 2 ways. Now if you feel risky to business on exchange then you can definitely use bitcoin wallet. And I would say it's better to use a wallet than an exchange to do more transactions. Because the exchange always monitors your transactions. And so, if you transaction dollar more on the exchange, you will be at a bit of a risk. Because business in Bitcoin is not legal in all countries.",

It's indeed profitable in the long run but I think customers will lose a lot since Bitcoin is very volatile and spending for example an $8 product plus transaction fee right now would be more like $16 when Bitcoin's price pumps again.

Anyways, this is just my own opinion. I would also think the same, because if the site is hacked, it is most likely that the Hacker will look for all the currency that has to do with Bitcoin, and that is what should be protected the most, for me these things have a lot to be careful about, It would be great if the entire platform could be managed under LN, it's the best, and it could also give that the fees are cheaper and everything, obviously this is a suggestion, but I like the Cold Wallet as you say, security above all , because if they are capable of exploiting sites like casinos, exploiting them all with a simple vulnerability, now an online site is easier for a hacker.",
