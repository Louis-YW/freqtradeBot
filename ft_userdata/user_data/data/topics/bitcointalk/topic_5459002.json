Any estimate which mintage range you are aiming for?And a follow up question, how are you handling priv-key generation and what material is used for printing and paper?Thanks! I love them. Currently only around 200 have been built/sold, but I will go to 5000 if I need to. Even if I produce 5000, they will still have a scarcity to them as I stamp pieces with the location they're purchased. Someone purchased from Kentucky recently and they have the only KY stamped piece for example. They are already  in 15 states and 4 countries. These were designed so that they could get into as many hands as possible. Rich or Poor. On the island I use them for barter, trade and tips. Latest exchange was given to an individual who helped after I had a tire issue on the side of the road.  he was very excited to receive his first fraction of a bitcoin. I funded it on the spot for him and showed him how to verify on the blockchain explorer. Which can easily be done by scanning the QR code on the hologram to get the Public Key. We are still early guys.  All keys are generated on a computer that is air-gaped and has never been online. The laser printer wifi has been removed. Instead of installing updates on the computer later on, I intend to destroy it in some kind of epic way. Probably in a similar way Hillary C did during the destruction of her deleted email computer or possibly the scene from Office Space. Either way you can count on fire and explosions.  ARRRRRRGI'll just buy a new one and call it the cost of business.  There is always people that have little faith in humanity, so I do have options (Mary Ola or Custom Silver bar) where people can generate their own keys (BIP-38) and send me the public address to build a piece with, but I won't be able to 100% back them like I do all of my self made pieces. It will be more difficult to resale if using this version because I will use different holograms for easy identification. After I witnessed people having difficulties reading / redeeming some of the earlier pieces due to fading and poor quality paper. I re-evaluated and moved over to the Terraslate water /tear proof paper. Thanks to Krogoth's paper submerging test that sold me on it. It will definitely lengthen the life of the paper key when compared to earlier Casascius/Lealana wallets.  I don't engrave because I love the fact that I can rebuild my pieces a 1000 times if I'd like. Just need new holograms. If you engrave its almost like a one use and done. Might be nice for the pieces you store away in a safe, but I want mine used and circulated. Gives them more of a historical vibe. It will mean flawless high grade pieces will be scarce. Having the smaller funded value will also ensure that they stay funded longer. It will be pointless to redeem if the fee eats all the sats making it unattractive to redeem them. unlike a Casascius piece that will most likely be redeemed within the next decade due to bitcoin price increase and fading keys. I do have a few more smaller silver fractionals coming out soon (5000 Sats and 7500 Sats) but these are the beginnings of a physical currency, if you will, in the Caribbean. Base metals and fractional silver first. I will be slowly expanding wallet size, denomination and reaching new countries. Of course I'll still make custom rare pieces on the side for the hardcore collectors and fun. If you aren't having fun and becoming more free, why do it?website is in the works. to make viewing and purchasing easier for people. CT",

Virgin Islands and PR are technically USA, so they don't count. If you aren't from those locations then there will only be 10 from your location woot woot!......so far at least.  You can message me if you'd like to discuss away from the public",

(Don't list them tho please)?    without looking, I think there is about 16-17 states for the brass. Although, some are sent out without being stamped, because I don't bring the dies with me everywhere.   20 were sold in Vegas and some were given away to children, so I could introduce physical bitcoins to them. I have a lot of repeat buyers because they like to give these pieces away to friends and family or for tips, so the # of states aren't growing very fast because they are sent to the same states.  The CT line of product is growing. I have some 1/4 oz silver 250,000 satoshi coming soon.  Its about time to start the portrait pieces  These aren't just collectable (they will be though) , but they will also be a useable barter trade currency backed by precious metals and with the option to use the blockchain at distance. Making the individual who holds them unstoppable if targeted by a controlling government. Not only do we want a government that won't behave like that, but we want to make sure they won't be able to be financially controlling even if they want to.",
