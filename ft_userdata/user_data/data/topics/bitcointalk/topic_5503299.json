He didn't üòä. His choice isn't Bitcoin but gold bars and a luxury car.Most of the people that claim that Bitcoin helps is carrying out criminal minded activity always forget that it takes a criminal to make plans on how to carry out those kind of activities. You have to first of all have the ability to fraude people before even looking for the medium that will aid you in carrying out the act. Same politicians in my locality that sees crypto users as major course of the evaluation of our national currency are the same people that spend millions of dollar on regular transport fare and sorting out of logistics for themselves and when it's Bitcoin or crypto it's now an issue.",
