  "content": "Imagine the year 2100. The last Bitcoin has been mined, marking the end of an era. Back in the mid-century, somewhere between 2025 and 2030, Bitcoin surged to an unimaginable value—$1 million per coin and beyond 🚀. Mining farms became modern marvels, surpassing the computing power of the world’s most advanced supercomputers by orders of magnitude. But it came at a cost. 💡🌍 The energy demands of these mining giants rivaled that of entire nations, reshaping climate trajectories and darkening our skies. For a time, the world marveled at their might. Yet, as the century drew closer to its end, cracks began to show. Profits dwindled. Computational behemoths sat idle, their potential wasted. Transaction fees soared into the stratosphere, threatening the very system they were built to sustain. 💸⛏️The once-glorious age of Proof-of-Work (PoW) became a fading echo. And the miners? They were left wondering: what now?---⏳ The Turning Point ⏳Some of you might already be shrugging. “Why should I care?” Others may ask, “What’s the point?”Here’s the point: this doesn’t have to be our future. Our future can be smarter, brighter, and better. 🌟💡 Read more",

      "body": "Technology have advancement, the power used by mining rig in the future will not be as extensive as today.  Just like how ASIC are power hungry way back years ago, the improvement enable these ASIC to produce much larger hash with smaller amount of energy. Besides these mining farm are turning to green energy ie Solar-Powered Bitcoin Mining: Green Energy For Profitable Crypto Ops.  In the future, I believe technology will develop a more efficient way to use solar energy to power these rigs.  The wasted solar energy can be efficiently converted to power this mining farm.  So I guess there is not much to worry about the power consumption of these Bitcoin mining farm.I look at your link and see your POR(Proof or Result), I believe it is the same as other existing cryptocurrency known for scientific medical research such as Folding, so I believe there is nothing new to the concept at the end of the day it might end up as another form of Proof of Stake.  If there is please enlighten me.  And how could it be as secure as the POW of Bitcoin?",

      "body": "The computing power will ensure the security of the blockchain, in case of disputes the network can switch to PoW. This provides the same level of security as Bitcoin. The security is guaranteed not by blockchain data file itself, but consistent decentralized copies of these files. You can find an introductory article in the section dedicated to PoR.",
