Was wondering - is their anything more than anecdotal evidence for the existence and order of said \"seasons\"?Altcoin season is just another term for a long term bullrun that covers most of different altcoins. I haven't heard the phrase memecoin season, i think that's invented by someone who wants to hype memecoins. I would call \"memecoin season\" as a meme coin trend. Difference to season would be that trends are very much shorter.And there are only 2 \"seasons\": Summer (Bull) and Winter (Bear).Someone might disagree with me as there are no real definitions to my knowledge to these terms. They are just memes from long time ago",

Was wondering - is their anything more than anecdotal evidence for the existence and order of said \"seasons\"?It's just the cycle though, bull run and bear market season. I think for this market, altcoin season might be the pattern that it might break away from Bitcoin's own bull run. We all know that every altcoin is based on Bitcoin or at least their is a relationship between the two as every altcoin is a trading partner with Bitcoin. So if we same altcoin season, the market is on a bull run regardless if Bitcoin is on it's own bull run or not. And in the altcoin bull run, not only that it try to detach itself from Bitcoin, but maybe it's run is significant higher that Bitcoin itself. So if Bitcoin can let say in a day increased to 10%, in altcoin season, this market is going crazy like 20% or higher uptick in a 24 hour timeframe.",

Donâ€™t be confused and just focus on what matters here, continue to analyze and you can be good. Better to take advantage with the situation now, and have some profit.",

Like what it happened to Shiba Inu and Dogecoin had pumped out while the rest of the altcoins are still quite sleeping, and they called it meme coins season. I'd never think it was overuse OP, it will depend on how you called that particular time as this usually use to determine the market cycle like bull season and bear season. Besides, you can call them in a different way but this is already known to the market, and that sounds okay.",

All I know about the altcoin season is that it's a season where bitcoin's dominance score is gradually diminishing, which shows that people are starting to switch to investing in altcoins since bitcoin itself has already passed its all-time high. People are searching for an alternative to find another way to gain profits. They sell their bitcoins, buy cheap altcoins, wait for their price to rise, and then sell. Usually people get hyped to buy any altcoin in this altcoin season since many altcoins will bloom. Many newcomers get FOMO and jump in to find their position. The altcoin market has turned green, and more people are interested in trading.",

There's also no order for it really, it's just what people label whenever a period of time basically has the same hyped event. Most people usually use it for bull and bear seasons which is a general description of it, and in all honestly that's probably all you need. The rest are just, if I were to describe it, a \"sub-season\" for bull and bear seasons that target a more specific say, asset/s.",

Was wondering - is their anything more than anecdotal evidence for the existence and order of said \"seasons\"? Its just a term made by the folks here to denote a specific time, like \"Open Season\" indeed it is more of a name than anything else. Nobody knows when the good times to buy/sell will happen and people tend to use the older years to predict these but truly speaking its not a 100% science.It a neologism but it keep coming back because people like it and it becomes an easy way to denote the time. For bitcoin maximalists like us, it has little significance and it would be better for people to not follow these trends because they can be misleading, rather watch the charts and decide on your own.",

Like, sure, there are times when certain types of coins seem to be doing better than others, but to call it a \"season\" might be a stretch. I think a lot of the time, it's just shillers and people behind those shit coins trying to drum up some excitement and FOMO. They want people to think \"Oh, it's memecoin season, I better buy in now before I miss out! I will invest $1,000 now, few months later I will have a million dollar sitting on my protfolio.\" But really, there's no solid evidence that these \"seasons\" actually exist or follow any particular order. So yeah, I'd say let's take the whole \"seasons\" thing with a grain of salt and focus more on fundamentals and actual market trends. That's my two cents anyway.",

You need the evidence just open CMC or any similar site and open bitcoin price chart then choose life time frame and zoom in to view the both seasons one after another and who knows we are still at the bear trend or bull so that unpredictability is the beauty.",

Like for example what happened a while ago, the bear season, it's to show that the market is in a state we don't want to see, because the market price fell from its ATH in the past. Actually something like this shouldn't be an issue because it's just an illustration, everyone may have their own term, it's just that the more popular term to describe the situation in this cryptocurrency is \"season\".",

Was wondering - is their anything more than anecdotal evidence for the existence and order of said \"seasons\"?I do think that it is right. There is no set thing like real seasons. For example winter is not as cold as it used to be and yet spring is getting colder, we didn't start calling April winter though, we still call that spring. Which means that it is set and it won't be changing, or it requires something much bigger to change it at least, like the whole world getting together, plus its summer in south hempishere as well.All in all I would be guessing that seasons in crypto is nothing alike, if it is a bull period it is a bull period, doesn't matter when that happens, we all know thats it. Which is why I am assuming that the seasons part is true and it is something that should continue to be used and I think it changes based on who you ask anyway.",

However, not every \"season\" is equally reproducible.In your case, about meme-coin season and stuff, it's different than the seasonality I've been talking about. The meme coin or altcoin season is simply jargon, the more accurate term should be a trend, in it's a short-lived one. I mean meme-coin trend only last a few weeks/months without any reproducibility, thus next year there will be no meme-coin \"season\" IMO.",
