  "content": "Hello BitcoinTalk,Since today I have been using hot wallets and cold wallets both. My problem is I don't know if there is a wallet where I can send coins but cannot withdraw for a set of time during panic times. For example I send BTC or ERC-20 Tokens which I want to hold but don't want to touch( unable to touch) for 4 years. I know not your keys not your crypto but is there a service doing this, I'm not talking about putting to staking on a cex or dex. Thanks in advance!Tetaeridanus.",

Just leave it there and manually don't touch it for the set period of time and you're still free to touch any time you may want to.This isn't really a good idea but that's the least way of doing it through staking it but if that's not the one that you're looking for.Just leave it as is and get back on it after several years.",

Thanks in advance!Tetaeridanus.I don't encounter such feature on non-custodial wallet but you can achieve by locking it through the use of smart contracts which require coding knowledge to achieve.The most convenient solution for your problem is to stake your tokens on a trusted DeFi that has a timelock feature. It's equivalent to a timelock since they are using smart contract to hold and lock your funds.",

Thanks in advance!Tetaeridanus.Coinb.in support this kind of time lock features. TryNinja explained it in details how you can use this features.How do timelocked transactions work?You can check this thread from LoyceV where he explained how you can do that.

For example I send BTC ~ which I want to hold but don't want to touch( unable to touch) for 4 years.There's this:Quote from: achow101 on November 17, 2017, 01:34:48 AMIn order to make coins that are unspendable until after a certain time or block height, you will need to create an address that uses OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. Only coins sent to such an address are guaranteed to be only spendable after a certain time.Be careful though: there was recently a topic from someone who added an additional zero to the target block number, and accidentally locked his Bitcoins for 125 years. My advice: learn not to panic  And keep your funds offline, make them labour intensive to access. Bury them deep, if you need to sweat for 2 days to get to them, you'll have 2 days to think about what you're about to do. Just make sure you know what you're doing before doing anything.",

The best way is to make it hard to reach, the reason I asked this is I don't wanna panic sell during dips.With respect,Tetaeridanus",

In other words holding coin in the wallet is a place to be a savers side avoid stories. And finally, is good to stake coin that generate profits on APY and the assets value increase after a long run holding.",
