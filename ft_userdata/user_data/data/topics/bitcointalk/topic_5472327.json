  "content": "BTCITCOIN UNVEILED: Revelation of Bitcoin as a divine phenomenon.        BTCitcoin has been a subject matter of digital archeology for its mysterious invention and we are thrilled to reveal the invention origin of Bitcoin has it roots in the bible. Our purpose is to take Bitcoin out of the origin myth of \"creatio ex nihilo\" or \" creation out of nothing\". Bitcoin is a permissionless, chiefless, peer-to-peer decentralized electronic cash system that invented a native value layer in cyberspace. The bitcoins are energy packets of transactions bundled into a block, and wrapped by a cryptographic hash system to form matter or energy(let's say digital gold) in cyberspace. So unlike the common narrative scarcity doesn't give bitcoins a value but a price.    The book of the Watcher Ezekiel is one of the sealed and closed books of the Bible. And Ezekiel is one of the greatest men to walk the earth. By the scrolls he ate or higher consciousness he acquired he was exalted to the decree of beings called the watchers. Legend has it he was the teacher of Pythagoras himself and the revelation points to this watcher for a consciousness behind Bitcoin. In the book of this watcher, we open a reading of Bitcoin's invention origin.Bitcoin is defined in the book of the Watcher Ezekiel as a seller-to-buyer financial system, that doesn't allow the seller not to return to which that is sold, even though they are alive, and is a vision that touches the whole multitude thereof. This above sentence is a dark sentence written in the white paper defining Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer network, that solves the double spending or reversibility of transactions problem and decentralized system.   As a divine command of God to the watcher we see the watcher making a chain for our financial system and to track everything. Block is just a bundling of transactions and the term blockchain denotes the time-ordered cryptographically interlocked chain of transactions. If we do block analysis on some important blocks we see them encoded with divine messages. Let's not forget the 1st block or the Genesis block of this chain has the message encoded in its coinbase that reads  \"The times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks\" and another headline hidden under this that reads \"Isreal prepares to send troops and tanks to Gaza\" it is astonishing that after fifteen years history is repeating itself and we are at almost second bailout for banks with their endless printing of money and we are in times where Isreal now has ground operation in Gaza. And what a lot of people might not know is that the 666,666th block or the Apocalypse block has a message encoded in it that reads \"Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good\" It is a verse from the bible.    And we have all the evidence to reveal that Bitcoin has always been a divine phenomenon. Read The full paper entitled \"BITCOIN UNVEILED\". It is one of the revolutionary papers written about Bitcoin since the release of the white paper fifteen years ago.Full paper here:  BITCOIN UNVEILED",

That's why he chose that specific newspaper as the source for genesis message. It all makes sense now. But I wonder, why do you think anything related to knowledge, wisdom and technology is not a divine intervention? Bitcoin is not an exception, anything good or evil comes from a single source, we decide and choose which one to use.",

I can't wait for the halving to be effected and I know that it would leave a mark of excellence that other crypto companies would want to follow or live up to.",

It's been a long time since I've come across a bigger piece of nonsense on this forum. Jehovah's Witnesses should stay away from the Internet and continue with their old tried and tested \"door to door\" method.Quote from: amanuelgetahun on October 31, 2023, 12:42:36 PMYes  correlation doesn't in every case imply causation, then again read the entire paper, and you will know how correlation is the basis for causationBitcoin and everything around it are numbers. It is very easy to correlate numbers with anything and people like you use it to come up with nonsense like this.Of course, for example, you own the number 666 and wherever that number is used it correlates with some of your theories. I would love to get some clear proof of any divine involvement in Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Divine phenomenon, these words sound very interesting. One of the strong correlations of the birth of Bitcoin into this world is because the thoughts of a group of people or individuals calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto began to distrust the chain system run by the government. Society will never feel freedom. Every payment system is always restrained by the government, people seem to be dragged and treated like prisoners in a prison without fences to always obey the rules made by the government.People from various countries are starting to get guidance and withdraw from the old system, they are starting to use Bitcoin for any transactions that can penetrate the system limits implemented by the government. Bitcoin belongs to the people who put their trust in it, the government can only watch the wider development of Bitcoin without the power to control it and limit every transaction.",

Of course, each religious sect has its own interpretation of the Bible with many opposing each other and calling each other as false. Now, as to Bitcoin, I do find it a little bit cringy to associate with the Bible or divine intervention though I have to admit that there is a big stroke of genius in here but I am just leaving it there.",

      "body": "In general, I like it when major religious and philosophical frameworks can be used to explicate and justify positive phenomenons for a lot of people to whom such contextualization can be important. So, in that sense, I like the reference to creation out of nothing. But it's important to not go too far and to ensure that there's no false information included. What do you mean regarding a Genesis block, and Israel and Gaza? In the post, it sounds confusing. In the paper itself, it's mentioned more as a chronological coincidence (but, again, where's a link to the proof?), but it's still going too far, in my opinion, into completely irrelevant things.Also, it's important to understand that it's more of a persuasion strategy than actual stuff, and that in very similar ways very bad things can be justified, which is widely explored in dystopian novels (a couple of examples that come to mind are Handmaid's Tale and Unwind, both of which have Christianity-based justifications of terrible stuff).",
