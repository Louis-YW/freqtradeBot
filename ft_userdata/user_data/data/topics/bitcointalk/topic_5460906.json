I myself have been involved with Bitcoin for a long time and my cousin knows quite a bit about Bitcoin. Whenever I have any problem I discuss it with him and he gives me a lot of helpful words. I will discuss some personal matters of my cousin with you all. My cousin and his friend are studying in the same college. His best friend said to him what are you doing.  He said I have been involved in Bitcoin for a long time and his friend knew he traded in Bitcoin. Bitcoin He works hard and because of this hard work he is a successful trader. Seeing his success, his best friend requested him a lot and finally he agreed. The problem is that he had no capital. He borrowed about 800 dollars from my cousin. My cousin did not share this with anyone. His best friend worked hard enough in Bitcoin and now he is successful. So my cousin said friend pay me the 800 dollars you took from me. As soon as my cousin spoke, his best friend said, \"Dude, I paid you 800 dollars long ago. He could not understand what to say as if he was losing his language after hearing this. My cousin just keeps saying one thing and if he doesn't pay me back the 800 dollars I won't have much financial loss but I can't trust anyone else who did this to me I will never forget it. My cousin is very broken mentally and can't share this with any of his family. He can't take any legal action because Bitcoin is not legal. My cousin keeps saying one thing my best friend cheated on me then I told her a lot that what happened happened don't worry about it anymore.",

Your story ends with a suspense I guess he wasn't paid back...It's  not really a bitcoin story, but a story about lending in general. You should always take steps to protect yourself. Maybe next time write this down on paper and get a witness to sign it, so at least you can take this to court.",

Your cousin should know that her friend wasn't a true and was only there for her based on what he wants to benefit from her. This is a lesson to your cousin not to trust anyone with money because we have greedy people that will never appreciate whatever that you have done for them. Instead they will leave you heart broken because of the good that you did for them. Investing in bitcoin should be done with one's own funds and never borrow anyone money to invest into crypto because the market is very risky and you can loss that money that you borrowed out thinking to get it back later. Money can seperate two friend forever and I am not surprised that this was done to your cousin.",

Your cousin's friend doesn't have the capital to invest in Bitcoin, I assume he doesn't have experience in the Cryptocurrency field referring to the question what are you doing to your friend.2. After getting a loan of 800 dollars from your cousin, who taught him how to invest in Bitcoin, what I know investing in Bitcoin requires established knowledge.3. Why didn't he pay off his loan immediately when he was already successful in investing in Bitcoin, isn't your cousin very close to him. 4. How does it end, does he immediately pay off the loan or does he run away after being successful in Bitcoin, from the title you apply \"A warning against cheating and lending to a trusted friend\" people here assume he is not the type of person who can be trusted.",

Ahahaha! Omen, this is a Novella from the nightgale of the creek. Op such is life, that is why lending without written documents is bad. If you cousin wrote everything down plus the collection and the repayment dates, all this melodramas would not display again. And now there is no evidence to show that he has paid him or not. Even bitcoin is legal, your cousin cannot take this matter to court because court believe in written documents on cases like this and also believe in evidences. So where are the evidences? Op, for your cousin friend to understand everything, it is to give him a break down of everything and how it started to the present narration.",

There are many such incidents in our society because people are slowly becoming unscrupulous/traitors due to the greed of money. the one you benefit, you will find harming from him. I have seen far worse things happen around me than what happened to your friend. So now I believe one thing is that it's foolish to ever teach others everything you do, once you do that, they won't appreciate you and on the contrary won't hesitate to harm you. this is the current reality",

I think such people are always there to teach us some lessons that everyone in this world can't be trusted and your cousin's friend also did something that only a scammer would do. He took money from your cousin when he needed money, and now when he is financially stable, he just take U-turns and falsely says that he had already paid him that $800 dollar which he borrowed when needed.You should tell you cousin that there are always such kind of people who take advantage of one's generosity and take U-turns by say false words and lies to convince other that they have already done them a favor when they needed it, or totally ignore the people who favored them. I think those people really don't have any morals because they can sell their soul for money, and they don't really care about someone's goodness, or about someone's emotions that they hurt with their behavior.",

The moment you ask for the money or refuse to give them the money in the first place, you are bad to them. I have faced this many times and I am someone who will not ask for that money back. For this, I have suffered a lot. People still owe me money, I never ask that back. Now I just make up an excuse to not give them any. People are just so much ungrateful and greedy these days. Your cousin made a mistake. Now all he/she can do is just leave that and move on. That friend who took that money will lose double the amount one day. this is how the world works. Nature loves balance and that will be achieved one day. Take good care of your cousin and seek mental help if necessary. Depression is not a light thing. It could ruin life. So make sure your cousin does not walk that path. Also, tell him/her to avoid such people in the future.",

If he doesn't have money to pay back, he will find a way to not prejudice us, because a friend would never want to see us in trouble, as it will hurt him as well to know he put someone he cares in a bad situation.I fear this money is already lost, as no formal agreements were made on the lending operation. Your cousin was scammed and has to move on now. If you are going yo lend money any time soon, make sure to have a collateral as guarantee.",

Unfortunately, it does not always reciprocate. In bad friendships, friends take this privilege unappreciated, like they are entitled to it, and most of the time will never pay it back. If the friend is appreciative and immediately works to repay the amount so that they are no longer indebted to the friend, maybe there are better chances. A friend exploiting another out of some Bitcoin just because Bitcoin matters can not be handled in court should not mean that there are no consequences. If the supposed friend is not paying on purpose and out of greed (and this is 100% confirmed), why not just confront them for the money and see how much resistance they show to pay it back? Your cousin and yourself are entitled to do that if the supposed friend really is showing no signs of respecting the agreement.",
