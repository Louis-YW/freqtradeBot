  "content": "Source: https://cryptonews.com/news/turkey-projects-finalization-of-cryptocurrency-taxes-by-next-year.htmTo further strengthening the regulation within the country, the Turkish government is now projecting to finalize crypto taxes sometime next year.However, they did not mention in the article yet about the percentage of tax that will be imposed on cryptocurrencies converting to fiat in any regulated bank, digital bank, remittance or so. India's crypto taxation currently stands at 30% which is somewhat \"too much\" in the eyes of many.In my opinion, crypto taxation would be a great challenge for the government in tracking our transactions especially when it involves the cryptocurrencies that we have in our non-custodial wallets. Usually capital gains and/or realized income would be the main basis of computing our taxes when converting cryptocurrencies to fiat money. I believe regulation is far more better than just outlawing or outright banning them them but a double-edged sword for decentralization, data ownership and user privacy no matter which country you are in as they are aiming to co-exist with cryptocurrencies leading to massive adoption.",

Because this seems like a plan or trap that Turkish government is trying to discourage crypto speculation and encourage more traditional investment because the proposed tax rate is between 15% and 30%, which is quite high compared to traditional financial transactions according to what I read here . Although it has not been approved but I don't expect anything less. The Turkish government has been considering imposing a tax on cryptocurrency transactions since at least from 2021 And from what you posted, it seems that they're getting closer to finalizing this tax. If it's approved it would make Turkey one of the first countries in the world to impose a tax on crypto transactions. However, we are watching to see how this tax would be implemented and enforced.",

So any tightening of legislation could harm the Turkish economy, which already has many problems. And in Turkey, just like in Russia, there are many laws that are not respected.",

Surely they cannot impose taxes on Bitcoin transactions, rather they will try to track any conversion into Fiat through the banking channel. That's how other countries are texting cryptocurrency. But one good thing is going to happen, probably after a structured framework a lot of merchants might become interested in accepting Bitcoin payment. But we are yet to see this.",

Usually capital gains and/or realized income would be the main basis of computing our taxes when converting cryptocurrencies to fiat money. That's what they are aiming also, they don't give a damn on the coins you hold in your wallet they are targeting specifically exchanges and capital gains, and for a trader you simply have no way out of this, let's not even mention DEX, it's not there were the real money is made, it's all in CEX and they know they can grab that data with a single click.Quote from: Poker Player on October 29, 2023, 04:58:05 AMTurkey is going in the wrong direction.

I don't think there is another region in the world that with the same income and education has the same hate for paying tax and the same affinity for tax evasion as southern Europe and that part of the middle east, if it's one thing Greece and Turkey have in commons is their hate for paying a single dime in tax, and you can see what that has lead to in both cases.",

The draft law aims to govern crypto asset service providers, crypto asset platform operations, crypto asset storage, and crypto asset buying, selling and transfer transactions.I think it makes sense and is legal, considering the increase in crypto users in Turkey, very high, this could add to the government's annual asset income in crypto taxation, that's something that advances regulations with comprehensive thinking about the crypto sector.However, there are points that in my opinion are not possible for taxation in Turkey, as is said about tax for transactions, this will have a few obstacles to regulate legally, What's more, as reported 0.03% in one transaction, it seems this is difficult to do, unless government taxation focuses on crypto exchange services operating there only, maybe that makes sense, as is done by other countries.",

If you hold a stock whose value goes up making you wealthy on paper, the government cannot impose tax on that. They can only impose tax only when you sell it. Crypto taxation will work similarly. Also there are more practical problems in crypto taxation. It will be interesting to see how Turkish government plans to handle it.",
