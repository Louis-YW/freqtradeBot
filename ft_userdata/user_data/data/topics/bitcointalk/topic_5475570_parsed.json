      "body": "i think you already know.. your still in the EU.. the debt will follow you. the banks talk to each other so when you open a bulgarian bank account they will link you back to the other account and the other account will link forward to you. you will get letters in the mail from the previous bank, maybe a court summonsinfact if the only address they have on you is the NL address and you have not informed them of a change of address(your suppose to), they will send letters to old address under the legal presumption you received notice. so while your ignorantly in bulgaria of the situation, they could actually already litigate you and take you to court and win by default due to you not turning up. and by the time they do find you(via court orders asking other bank tracing services), they already have the court order to pay the debt and they will do things to you like send debt collectors or garnish your income from your bulgarian account or employeryou might have had a chance to hide away for X years statute of limitations if you were to abscond to a non relationed country with no extradition agreement.. but europe is europe so your not escaping your debt you are atmost delaying the letters while they take time to find you again. but that delay can work against you because their overdraft fee's add up in that time and also they will already be a few steps forward in their litigation process due to lack of communication.i think you know this but want someone else to confirm it",

It could be a trap which can ruin your life. .Â  And with alot of things getting too centralized in the future with AI scouring through your entire financial records to look for issues, you could be blackmailed into doing what you do not want. In regards to what could happen to the debt. If you have your biodata with the bank and they still went ahead to lend you money knowing you are from another country, they probably have ways of recovering it (assuming they are aware of your nationality) when they need to. Could be through some sort of regional central bank or with the cooperation of your country's financial institution etc.Try to owe no one nothing to feel really free.",
