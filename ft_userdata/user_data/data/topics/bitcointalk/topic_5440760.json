(not your private key or seed phrase). The only thing you should be worried is the fact that if these data will be compromised, hackers knows exacly how much money you have and where it is. If you used your email to register, the same email you used somwhere else with your personal data (like phone number, name, surname, address - like when you buy in online store) its possible it was already compromised and traded in big leaked files on darknet. They can now attach more sensitive data (your net worth) to old packages and continue to trade it on the darknet. Guess who will be intterested in buying such database (mr XX yy, home address zzzz, net worth >...... ).",

Although bitcoin addresses doesn't have names, who knows, maybe someone is going to track you down and try to hack you.Privacy centric individual uses or create new address for every transaction as far as I know. So if you want to protect yourself, much better to create a new address, in my opinion.",

The idea of tracking your assets is not bad but the fact that the wallet would expose your networth us the problem. Hackers if I am not mistaken uses these app to gain access to people's funds, stealing of information linking your wallet to steal your assets. I suggest you give this a rethink because apps are softwares designed for some specific purpose and here you are thinking of downloading the assets tracking app without any knowledge of the developer. What if the app is designed with some malware to stealing or exposing your information to hackers, do you not think you have granted them access to your assets?",

If you just keep BTC in your wallet, you can immediately see how much your wealth is in FIAT, so you don't need to use a financial tracking application, especially if it's issued by someone else. Also, on bitcoin core, you can see how much BTC and money you have.It's better for you to see the total/transactions in your wallet than to use the application.

If you want to, you can probably manually enter the amount of your cryptocurrency holdings (like BTC) in some applications to achieve the same effect as using an automatic API or integration. The specific application you're using will determine whether or not this is possible, but it's definitely worth exploring as an option.Quote from: InnerSeabird on February 21, 2023, 11:11:29 PMDo I have any reason to be concerned about giving this app my bitcoin address?

I can add a bitcoin address and it will keep track of my BTC, and include it in the total. The first question why do you need additional software for something that can be done with software that initially generated your address? Your wallet, for example, can track your balance and show it in whatever form you wish. If you are also a mobile user who value privacy and self-sovereignity in transactions, you can download Bluewallet which offers some advanced functionality: you can connect your mobile to the Bitcoin Core full node you are running on your computer. Check this small guide, it may give you some food for thought: https://bitcoiner.guide/blue/ QuoteDo I have any reason to be concerned about giving this app my bitcoin address? Will it only be able to view my wallet total/transactions?You should avoid services asking you to whitelist your address via providing personal information.",

Even if it's just a BTC address it can trace your accounts from which exchanges you have been by tracing the origin of your coins. It depends on where you are from also. If you are from a country where the government is cracking taxes on crypto then I guess you might just give it so they know you are paying.",

When I first generated my address I did not even think about public and private addresses from bitcoin org website. I was so excited about it that I sent screenshot to my friends who introduced myself to the bitcoin universe. Believe me they had greatest laugh on that day in WhatsApp group. Why would not they? I had laughable mistake but they soon taught me what went wrong. Since then I am not even taking screenshots of my addresses which is again malpractice in the crypto game. Better learn basics before using them. As stated here it wont be problem to share your public address.",
