  "content": "MASSA LABS BLOCKCHAINIt was long assumed that banking and currency policies had to be defined by central banks, governments and authorities.Those powerful entities take critical decisions with an often-criticized lack of transparency, and are subject to corruption, and are costly, and usually take less than optimal decisions because they cannot aggregate/process enough information tooperate.                                                                                              Massa vision and innovationAt Massa, we believe that decentralization is non-negotiable. That’s why we spent several years of research on a new consensus protocol.Our multithreaded technology allows thousands of transactions per second in a network with thousands of nodes.We combine transaction sharding and a multithreaded block graph architecture allowing parallel blocks with compatible transactions.We extend the Nakamoto consensus rule to the case of parallel blocks, allowing a secure and decentralized consensus using Proof-of-StakeThe Blockclique architecture can handle thousands of transactions per second, on par with traditional financial systems.Moreover, we ensure that our network will be fully decentralized from the start at several levels:Coin distribution: First, one of the most important things in a Proof-of-Stake system is coin distribution. At Massa we ensure that our system is decentralized from the start by doing a fair initial distribution. No entity, including ourselves, will own more than a small fraction of the coins. This is exemplified by our private sale, which is, to our knowledge, one of the most decentralized private sale, with a large number of entities and no whale. Our public sale will follow the same design, with a limited amount available per person. Our goal is to have a Nakamoto coefficient above 1000.Entry price: In Massa we target low hardware (standard desktop computer) and staking requirements in order to lower the barrier for entry. This is a necessary condition to ensure that people can run a node on their home computer and to have a healthy and resilient network. Our low hardware requirements already allows more than 6 500+ nodes to run on our testnet.Smart contract innovationsBuilding a blockchain from scratch is an opportunity to incorporate the lessons learned after the experimentations of previous blockchains. This is one of the reasons Massa team was able to bring — and showcase — innovations in the field of Web3 and Smart Contracts, in particular Blockchain-hosted websites, games and dApps, as well as Autonomous Smart Contracts.Massa’s autonomous smart-contracts reduce the need for bots and human interaction and pushes the boundaries of decentralization.One innovation brought by Massa is the ability to register “.massa” domains and store websites’ logic directly on the Massa blockchain. Those websites will be accessible directly from a browser through the Massa extension or any compatible extension, without any intermediaries. We believe that innovation will increase the security of critical applications such as DeFi platforms.Another innovation of Massa is the asynchronicity and self-wakeup capabilities of smart contracts, allowing them to function on the blockchain without being explicitly called by off-chain humans or bots. Massa smart contracts can register actions to be executed later and emit signal events, which other contracts can listen to. Once an event is triggered the corresponding handler functions will be automatically executed. Autonomous smart contracts reduce the need for bots and human interaction and push the limits of decentralization. We believe that autonomous smart contracts have a wide range of applications from autonomous trading bots in DeFi to autonomous agents in decentralized games.What’s NextIn Episode 6 of our testnet we released a preliminary version of our smart contract engine, and a first version of autonomous smart contracts and decentralized web hosting in Episode 9. At the time of publication of this article, Episode 12 is live, and developers have already been able to try to host their own websites and dApps on the blockchain. We are constantly improving our testnet and in the coming episodes we will showcase Proof-of-Concepts of autonomous decentralized dApps.Those innovations are still a work in progress and we’ll give more details in future blog posts.About Massa:Massa is a high-performance blockchain designed to be truly decentralized from the start. The Massa testnet was released in July 2021, providing an easy way for anyone to test our protocol, and has been constantly improving since then. The Massa testnet has now more than 6,500 nodes running.1st in google search on the most decentralized blockchain in the world.Anyone who participates in the testnet program can participate in the reward on the mainet massa, everyone is welcome.Website: massa.netTestnet explorer: test.massa.netDocumentation: https://massa.readthedocs.io/Source code and tutorials: github.com/massalabs/massaTelegram: t.me/massanetworkDiscord: discord.gg/massaTwitter: https://twitter.com/MassaLabsReddit: reddit.com/r/massa/Youtube: youtube.com/channel/UChVfdvYpn0eFk4B-T7TGmOg60this forum will be updated to keep you informed and improve the appearance.",
