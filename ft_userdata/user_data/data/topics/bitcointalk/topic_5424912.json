  "content": "[ANN] [USdigitalGold] [USDG] US Digital Gold is Asset-Back, Inflation-Adjusted Private MoneyU.S. Digital Gold is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform built from the original Bitcoin code, then upgraded to Blackcoin’s PoS. USDG is meant to preserve wealth against the erosion of consumer inflation. The U.S. Digital Gold open-source project is the first private digital money focused on being widely accepted by merchants through regular audits and transparency as well as a demonstrable stability of inflation-adjusted value, speed of transactions and clear cost-savings compared to credit, debit, retail and gift card purchases. U.S. Digital Gold intends on having the largest decentralized PoS network in the history of cryptocurrency and has made it easy for anyone with a PC, Mac or Linux computer to download a desktop wallet and start staking any amount of USDG for an annual reward of 0.275%. Since tracking inflation to price USDG the creators of the USDG Inflation Index chose the election “victory” of one U.S. Presidential Administration to the next. Since November 2020 the consumer inflation as tracked by the Bureau of Labor & Statistics has risen ~12.5% while circulating U.S. Dollars as tracked by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank have increased by the same, brining the total inflation on U.S. Dollars to about 25%. As U.S. Digital Gold is pegged to one hundred dollars plus inflation on one hundred dollars the total perceived value as of October is about $125 per USDG from $100 in November 2020.The original creators of U.S. Digital Gold include pioneering members of Blackcoin (BLK), which was created in early 2014 as the first cryptocurrency to operate using the PoS algorithm. U.S. Digital Gold’s founder is one of the foremost experts in compliant cryptocurrencies and receives the advise of a former SEC Commissioner. Investors have committed more than one million dollars to pay team members, and there have not been and never will be coin sales, nor free coins to any team members. We hope that dApps are developed by community members, in the payment space and to crowd-source inflation in a similar way to GasBuddy, but against the inputs of the Consumer Price Index from the Bureau of Labor & Statistics to get a true and daily reading of inflation in the United States. All coins were premined and belong to NotFiat, LLC, a Delaware company that acts as custodian of all coins and provides regular audits and whom acquired 100% of all coins from its creators.The first block was mined on July 15, 2022. U.S. Digital Gold was first listed on the LBank exchange on November 22, 2022, and expects to be added to new exchanges on a monthly basis. U.S. Digital Gold is forging partnerships with merchants and crowd-funding portals, and expects the first announcements of merchants to accept USDG as payment in December 2022. https://explorer.usdgcoin.orgThe U.S. Digital Currency was created by teams in the United States, Europe, Dubai UAE and India. NotFiat, LLC, the custodian of the treasury and for-profit business that acquired, audits and protects USDG, is based out of Delaware, USA. NotFiat expects to open its global office in the city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.",
