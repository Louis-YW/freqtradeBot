This is a good thing to do towards helping your friend have a financial future with bitcoin, there's no way he will ever wanted to make a refusal since he's receiving it as a birthday present, but before then, we need to talk on how you can make this presentation, the first step begins with introducing bitcoin to your friend, teach him the basic knowledge and help him towards creating a¬† decentralized bitcoin wallet address which is what you will eventually use as the address you will be sending him the bitcoin gift, he will need to first have an idea on bitcoin so to be able to value and cheriah the gift whenever been presented.",

Imagine having to gift someone ¬†something he actually has, more so money gifts is seen as a random gesture done to kids and if the person already has knowledge of bitcoin then it falls in same category. I have seen people cherishing material stuffs which could not be worth much than been gifted with money. As a friend think of what your the person cherishes so much then try to get him that. But just like what BlackHatCoiner said if you think he is obsessed with bitcoin and might be all over the place then gift it to him. That also might depend on the person‚Äôs worth, to some so rich fellows 0.03 might seems little to them considering your friendship status",

Would you love to accept Bitcoin as a Birthday Gift? That's a beautiful and creative idea for a birthday present IMO! If your friend is interested in Bitcoin, then receiving some as a gift could be a unique and exciting experience for him It's also great that you're considering their financial situation and finding a way to give them something they enjoy without putting a strain on their budget.As for the amount, 0.03BTC may not seem like a big amount of money but it's still a valuable and significant gift. Plus, the value of Bitcoin can go higher over time and that gift may get more valuable with time.

I'd say it's too much as far as most birthday presents go, but I don't see why anyone would be unhappy with such a present. Some things to consider are whether Bitcoin is legal and easily exchangeable or usable in your country, and whether you'd be okay with your friend deciding to sell it for fiat. If you'd be offended by your friend selling it, maybe gifting it isn't a good idea. Or you should gift a smaller amount, that way the motivation to sell will be lower.",

In my opinion, it would be appropriate to first gift a hardware wallet to a friend or teach him how to use a non-custodial wallet, and only then consider a gift in the form of BTC. Of course, all this in order to prevent the surprise from turning into an unpleasant surprise in the future.",

Bitcoin has monetary value and people always love, accept and appreciate valuable gifts, so he will appreciate it. Since you mentioned that your friend already has an interest in bitcoins and has always wanted to invest in it, it makes your gift even more of a thoughtful one for him. However because people who invest are to invest in bitcoins are encouraged that it be an amount that they can stay without, the investment you have started for your friend can go two different ways. Your friend due to hardship and the difficulty he is facing may decide to sell off the bitcoins after a while of keeping it to sort his needs, or he may take your first investment for him as a push for him to start investing any amount he can get and spare into bitcoins.",
