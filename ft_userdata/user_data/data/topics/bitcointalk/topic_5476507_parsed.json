Most of the casino here indicates on their ToS that they have the right to confiscate the profit or deposit if you are proven violating the ToS.You can recover your deposit but all the profit including the bonus will be confiscated by the casino. No casino allow you to take profit if you caught violating the ToS unless you already withdrew all your balance.You can use this list by @Mahdirakib https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5405581.0 as reference for existing promotion of all the casino here.",

Today bookies can accuse for anything and take your money, cancel bets, etc as in their t&c is stated that they can do whatever they want.I am doing this for more than 15 years and I could write a book about sportsbooks, bonus hunting, arbing, value betting, courtsiding, etc.",

Bookie can easily confirm this since crypto casino usually use same bookie and they have connections to each other so that they can match players information and to check possible connections of all accounts from different casino. This is what most players that have a problem do.",

Thousands, or even Millions? YesHow many of the main sportsbooks provider in this world? hundreds? Nah, far less than that.Is it hard for them to detects it with all of the data they have?
