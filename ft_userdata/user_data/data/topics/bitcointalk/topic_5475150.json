  "content": "okay here I just want to find out the answer from the members here because I think about it and sometimes get curious  People say that if we save 100k$ in the bank and take it out, say 5 years later, the value will not be equivalent to 100k$ 5 years ago.then if I put my money 100k$ into bitcoin 5 years later the value let's just say it rises to 300k$. just for example.My question is whether the price of bitcoin is rising or is fiat experiencing a decline?because someone on the internet I saw once said, house prices don't rise, fiat is the one that weakens every year.so if you buy a house for 20k$ in 1980 then sell it now for 500k$, he says that the house is not going up but the fiat is going down.that's why we see rising prices in commodities in the long term.Are all commodities actually stable, but fiat is weakening or are there exceptions?I saw Robert Kiyosaki say he owns 15,000 houses and doesn't like Bitcoin a few years ago, but recently I looked back at his interview when he said he bought Bitcoin, and said it was a valuable asset?does he see that bitcoin is an opportunity?any suggestions would be greatly appreciated",

But be careful as this is not the case all the time, there are times you would invest in it but might lose /5 of the money, so the knowledge and the time of investment matters. And for fiat, if you save it in the bank, the interest would not be as much as that of Bitcoin, and we all know how inflation is battling the economy, therefore it won't be able to retain the value as it were when you bought it like say 5 years ago.Quoteso if you buy a house for 20k$ in 1980 then sell it now for 500k$, he says that the house is not going up but the fiat is going down.that's why we see rising prices in commodities in the long term.Are all commodities actually stable, but fiat is weakening or are there exceptions?The person is saying nonsense about the house remark, an investment is an investment whether Bitcoin or property buying or anything, it's about making more money. If you invested $20k in housing and gained $500k, that means you have earned x25 of your investment, which is against inflation. Bitcoin can't do more than that, and real estate is an investment just like Bitcoin, it's your choice to invest in either of them. Don't mind them misguiding people that Bitcoin is the only hedge against inflation. QuoteI saw Robert Kiyosaki say he owns 15,000 houses and doesn't like Bitcoin a few years ago, but recently I looked back at his interview when he said he bought Bitcoin, and said it was a valuable asset?does he see that bitcoin is an opportunity?Yes, he saw an opportunity in Bitcoin. Of late, the media is propagating the halving season of Bitcoin, this is the season when Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appreciate significantly in price. This might be what Robert Kiyosaki realized and trying to diversify his portfolio. But he can't sell all his property to buy Bitcoin.",

The best performing currencies against the dollar may witness limited growth and the collapse of the value of the dollar against fixed assets. Gold is measured in terms of 5 to 10 years. As for Bitcoin, during the past few years the price has proven that it rises regardless of the value of the dollar. If we take gold as a measure of value. The value of Bitcoin rose sharply against gold in a curve that changed from the dollar. This leads us to conclude that Bitcoin has not reached its actual value and will continue to increase until it reaches it.",

Many people think that the value of an asset such house is increasing over time but the real reason behind the increase of value is due to the fiat weakening of buying power due to excessive circulation over time since fiat has unlimited supply.You will notice that most of the commodity including salaries is increasing too not because of appreciation of their value but rather fiat supply is already saturated that makes it value less in terms of buying power.",

If you save $100M in a bank for the next 5 year, your money will not be valued at $100M again because the price of commodity in the market must have increased over the years. If a bag of rice sells at $60, in the next 5 years it might be at $100 or more, so the fiat is declining in value as a result of high inflation rate. But if you use same amount to buy Bitcoin during the bear season, you hodl and sell during the bull season, inflation will have no effect on your savings because your Bitcoin would have also appreciated in value. So Bitcoin is an edge against inflation.",

As far as I know, inflation can indeed cause the prices of goods and services to rise over time and thereby making it seem like the value of fiat currencies is declining but this is not always the case especially in the housing industry that you use as example. The prices of different commodities can fluctuate quite a bit over time depending on factors like supply and demand. Houses increases in value regardless of inflation is high or not but it depends on where the house is located and how liveable the place is.if we look at the nominal price of the house, it has gone up by 2,500% since 1980. But if we look at the real price of the house and taking inflation into account, it's only gone up by 29%. So the nominal price increase makes it seem like the house has gained a lot of value but the real price increase tells a different story. The argument here is that both fiat and commodities can go up or down in value over time depending on various factors.",

Likewise with houses, the price of which may never increase, but only the materials used to make the house increase in price, causing the house to become more expensive.
