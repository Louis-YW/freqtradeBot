If your country is restricted, you should use another exchange instead or the one supported in your country rather than buying an account that if noticed it is bought, would be banned.",

This is not a legitimate way and I do not advise anyone to sell you their account on these exchanges, and even if you get the account from someone your IP will be different from the seller’s country, and the account will be banned by the exchanges and your money will be frozen. You must withdraw from the idea of ​​purchase and do not use a VPN and abide by the policies and conditions of the exchanges, or you can trade on another platform available in your country or without KYC.",
