To expensiveI built the same resetter myself for $40 - 3 years ago  such a thing is not needed, and if someone builds such a resetter - the price should be under $80, but only if the user interface is better than the original one  You find this controlable relais boards on aliexpress for example in different sizes with a integrated webinterface to set the relays/restart the rigs.Here is a relais modul with 16 relais for 16 rigs - if you no how to connect to your rigs.https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4001135209856.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.291d399acvAE0s&ad_pvid=202211070147081780175363640900031601137_4&s=pI also made some plans for building such device for under 100$ retail price in the past. I created the case, had some plans for better connectors on the relay board side and so on - but I have been no software developer so for the user interface. Maybe we have some good coders here and make a forum project?Simplemining had the same resetter in the past for resale - but with better connectors and also for over 200$ https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1695298.0",

I am read the power consumption seperatly. There are many ways to solve problems, i find a resetter the smoother and better solution, but everyone has other prefences.Quote from: examplens on November 08, 2022, 09:18:58 PMQuote from: sxemini on November 08, 2022, 09:48:34 AMQuote from: miner29 on November 08, 2022, 02:56:11 AMYou can buy a wifi power plug for $5-$7 and reset / reboot from anywhere in the world from your phone.  This whole problem was solved years ago.  Ive had 45 rigs on them for years.  Look at Amazon/aliexpress for smart plugs.This is not hard people.

But i also have a backup connection over 5g and a some programs like Anydesk to connect to the main pc, if other connections are not working. Yes i manage 16 rigs with 1 resetter every rig seperatly. He also use the same Relais modul from aliexpress. They must be physical in the same place, like the resetter from kickstarter.",
