  "content": "The WCCFTech resource was able to gain access to graphics solutions market statistics - the full version of the Jon Peddie Research report for the second quarter of this year. Reading excerpts from this document allows us to find out that in the market segment that is most interesting to our audience, NVIDIA was able to strengthen its position from 78 to 80% over the year, but was consistently forced to give way to AMD, which strengthened its position in this segment from 12 to 17%. This \"revenge\", however, for AMD was accompanied by a loss of three percentage points of the market in annual comparison.In total, more than 6.4 million discrete desktop graphics solutions were shipped in the second quarter of this year. Intel has recently also joined these statistics, but its state of affairs cannot be called stable. If in the second quarter of last year it was content with 2% of the market, then by the first quarter of this year it was able to double its share to 4%, but by the second quarter it had lost all its achievements to the level of a year ago.If we return to the statistics for NVIDIA, its share in the desktop discrete graphics segment consistently decreased in the second quarter from 84 to 80%.sourcehttps://t.me/HomishTG/6037",

Tho GPU mining also decreased there was no reward above ETH back in the old days, but I'm still impressive that Intel can manage 2~4% of market share  But after AI booming Either AMD or Nvidia I believe can make profit again from their Enterprise GPU",

I don’t track the sale of professional video cards, and mining is impossible on modern game consoles, so they won’t compete with miners. And mining on laptops is also unprofitable.",

That's up 6% on a sequential basis and 20% up on an annual basis. Processor shipments in the PC segment generally grew by 24% year-on-year, which is the maximum in 25 years.According to the study's authors, between 2024 and 2026 inclusive, GPU shipments will increase at an average annual rate of 3.6%, with nearly 5 billion GPUs in use worldwide by the end of the forecast period. In the PC segment, in the next five years, up to 30% of all systems will be equipped with discrete graphics processors.https://t.me/HomishTG/6853",
