  "content": "NFL Week 12 Play of the WeekThe Atlanta Falcons 5-6 visit the Washington Commanders 6-5. The Commanders have won 5 of their last 6 games with the only loss coming to the Minnesota Vikings in a game which they could have easily won. Washington was stricken with the injury bug and have been getting healthier week by week. Taylor Heinicke has secured the starting role at QB and he brings a spark to the team that they didn’t have earlier in the season. In the last 3 games, Washington has only been averaging giving up 17 points per game. I can see Washington winning by at least 7 points.Washington -3.5 Winhttps://cryptogamingrevu.com/sports-picks/nfl/",

Miami and Tua Tagavailoa have been great this year and Tua has plenty of weapons in Hill and Waddle. On the road, Miami is only 3-2. The 49ers have been playing great as of late and some injured players have returned. SF is 4-1 at home with the number one scoring defense in the league. Miami has been playing against some weak defenses as of late and this will be a much tougher test. I see SF winning by 7.San Francisco -3.5 Winhttps://cryptogamingrevu.com/sports-picks/nfl/",

      "body": "Croatia vs Brazil :We mentioned that there’s been plenty of upsets so far in this World Cup, however there will be no upset here – Croatia have the 3rd oldest squad at the World Cup and Brazil with all their attacking options will simply be too much for them. Although Brazil have had a couple of players drop out due to injuries, Richarlison, Casemiro, Neymar and Vinicius all look in imperious form going forward, and the whole team are playing delicious football which has excited the crowds. Croatia on the other hand have had to cope with extra time against a tough Japanese opponent and Brazil will surely be one step too far for them.https://cryptogamingrevu.com/sports-picks/worldcup/",
