I have not checked that out before to know if under 18 people can use those centralized exchanges, but there are decentralized option too. Do not encourage him, but if he continues to seek for your help, first start with all the disadvantages of trading, there are real life cases of people that have lost millions to trading and regretted about it, you need to show him all these to let him know where to start and what to avoid. After he knows about that, you can teach him, I know risk management is another topic you will teach him to let him know how to manage his risk and about what to avoid financially also.",

What is more important is to get the concept of trading first-hand. The KYC and other legal stuff will come later on.Quote from: Plaguedeath on March 08, 2023, 07:26:21 AMa kid doesn't need to learn about trading too because it's risky. Unless otherwise they are given the correct information of what to do and what not to do in the first place. Come on! Life is big risk in itself.In my opinion, it's not a bad idea to teach your friend kid about trading or finance in general, as long as they are given correct information on controversial topics like \"money\".When I was 18 or 19, I learned the basics of trading and investing through an online game called \"CASHFLOW Classic\" by Robert Kiyosaki. The premise of the game is to mimic real-life scenarios of growing your wealth from scratch. You are given a dream to escape the \"rat race,\" and you must do everything you can to grow your money passively by earning through incomes, trading stocks, investing in properties, etc. I think this is probably the best approach to teaching someone the basics of \"financial education\" because it's more fun and enjoyable than diving into trading right away.Afterward, your friend kid can use a trading simulator like this basic one[2] and later progress to a more complex[3] trading simulator. You can't just teach someone all the jargon involved in trading without them seeing a visual representation of what's happening when they buy a crypto/stock at a lower price and sell it later at a higher price.[1] https://www.richdad.com/products/cashflow-classic[2] https://bitcoinflip.app/[3] https://cryptoparrot.com/",

No country would allow any children below the age of 18 to trade, and even at 18 years old, I will still not encourage it because the child just entered adulthood, and what he starts embracing at that time might be what will impact him for the rest of his life.Trading is challenging and addictive, and it might not augur well for children, I had passed through this stage, so I know what I am saying. Even if the lad must trade, first expose him to the reality of life in terms of business and other means to make money.Later after years, trading could be introduced if he is mature enough for it.There is no need to rush!",

They bought food, juice, water and other things I need for my life and my education, they did it because they want to protect me from many risk related to money.They did give me very small amount of money each day just because they wanted me to enjoy childhood fun like buying a candy, ice cream then enjoy eating it with friends at school. That's all and with such small money, I can not do anything else.I don't agree to let your kids knowing about trading too much as they have yet been able to earn money and at such ages, they should concentrate on learning. That is better for their later lives. They should have time to enjoy most interesting time in life of each person.If parents can not control themselves in trading, why do they think of exposing their children with trading and believe that their children will be able to control emotion.",

At the age of 15, he already knew about money, and what the boy wanted was to make money fast, not seriously learn about trading. This age should focus on learning, if you teach him about trading, he will probably neglect to learn. As OP said: he doesn't want to lose the original amount, which means he is still using his parents' money. If he loses, it's easy to steal money from his parents. There are more disadvantages than benefits to letting a 15 year old know about trading.",

Nonetheless, if someone below 18 years of age is addicted to charts and technical analysis and was doing well, the guardians or parents can simply create an account for the kid to use it. If doubtful like your concern OP then why not make him a demo account for him to prove if it is worth it or not? Or you can even provide a real account but with only a minimum balance. Binance minimum spot trade is $10 or $20 only. No leverage trading, of course, otherwise the kid is just biting more than it could chew and must rather focus at school.",

Here are some good books for this:- \"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator,\" written by Edwin Lefèvre- \"The Intelligent Investor\"- \"Market Wizards\" and \"The New Market Wizards.\" Both books consist of interviews with some of the most successful traders of the past half-century- \"The Disciplined Trader: Developing Winning Attitudes\" written by Mark Douglas- Trader Vic II: Principles of Professional Speculation, written by Victor SperandeoSource: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/090216/top-5-books-become-professional-trader.aspBy clicking on this link you will also see links to Amazon where you can buy these books.Try to explain him that you can only become successful in trading if he has enough knowledge for this. Let him learn all the available information, and then try. Explain to him that this is a difficult task and involves great risks.Let him succeed!",

So what your opinion please I need help? because I think is too risky for them to go in to trade for now. If you already made up your mind that it is too risky, why bother asking?Anyway the safer method to approach this is whether the person understands the importance of money and why they need to save money or grow it passively. If they are a careless spender, if they get more money at hand they will waste it - something that is difficult to identify at younger age but possible from upbringing.I would suggest the kid's parents to talk to him/her about it first and set up their own piggy bank and see if the kid has interest in it. Then only go for trading on a dummy market. That is how we old school people started here, by saving up remaining change on a piggy.",

But he can always trade on exchange that doesn’t have KYC requirements like DEX or P2P trading. I don’t mind my kid exposed on risk but with some limitations on how much many he can risk on it. This actually good to open his mind about the danger on trading so that he will be more careful by the time he grown up.",

In fact, they are not too young to grasp ideas from what we taught to them to think that we are wasting our time. Well, the idea is just about learning to trade and it was okay, but if it needs to do actual trading and create an account, this could be a problem, especially if they are asking for KYC. I know that there are exchanges that never require KYC which is an avenue for them to practice more and do trading. Just like the normal thing we do, start with small amount and keep that limit until they become ready to big responsibility.",

Remember early experiencing a big failure might create bad scenery to him and worst he can't handle the pressure towards what he/she learn about trading's. Its really good to engage them with this significant earning option so that they became more wiser on investment when they grow but this need full of attention since they are still a child they are prone to make mistake and if they are misguided they might do bad decisions which can harm them.",
