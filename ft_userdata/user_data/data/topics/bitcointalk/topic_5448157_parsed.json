I'm sure there is a way to determine that. I am just also unaware of that. Maybe if you managed to & record their back-end to those times that you were playing their games. I also think that regulators can help with this process (it could be long & expensive process though). Technically, I do not have any knowledge for your concern. But generally, regulators might be a good help, this is why we should better play to those casinos that are licensed.",

But note, not all casino offers such services only those who have an effective properly fair system and blockchain based that could generate your games harsh for verification, few casinos offer such service. I may have not given an in-depth explanation about that development but you can do a few Google searches to see how it works and what is at stake, with a list of casinos that have such development.",

Most of the online casino use the typical 3rd party games which the developer of the game itself only knew the code since it’s close source code. I think only the house game ca be rigged by the casino itself and the rest rely on the provider credibility on how they will make their games probably fair.I believe there’s no reported incident like this on the forum to the crypto casino here because all of them use the same provider with their games. I think the only possible scam attempt which casino can do is not paying the winning amount of the player since they can hold the withdrawal but rigging the 3rd party game is not on their hand(correct me if I’m wrong here).",

I have also played over 20 slots and lost but this does not mean the casino is rigged.If you keep checking the ANN threads of different casinos here you will come across the most reputable and trusted ones,they do not cheat people as they know people are their greatest asset and you can easily spot them,they have the ANN thread full of positive reviews and ongoing promotions.I don't know about Aztec or any other casino as I don't play there as for me the casinos who have a great ANN thread here in this very section of the forum are more than enough for me.Always check the house edge as some slot providers offer the casino different house edge levels.Also check the big wins as the reputable casinos show you the biggest win of persons and for example some also let players boast about it in their chat.That is the maximum anyone can do,then if you still think games are rigged go back and play sport betting.",

As far as I know online casino operators, have access to control the players who bet, they have the right to do so, however, there are also places where at certain game points and on certain days, certain times the operators do not control some of those who place bets, that's when they have the opportunity to win big, of course this is different from sports betting, cheating often occurs in types of games such as: slot games, poker, craps, blackjack etc.Talking about being cheated, yes like I said above, if someone bets in a losing streak, it's a sign that they are monitoring that person's gambling activity, if that happens, stop betting there, look for other games, but other games are the same, that day don't bet, repeat tomorrow or the day after tomorrow where users really escape monitoring and win.The concept that I'm telling you is based on my friend who works at an online casino, believe it or not, it all depends on each other's thoughts, thats how i know every casino is cheating they dont let user win lose lose their target for that user.",

      "body": "I have not heard of such as rigged game in casino but that doesn't mean the possibilities are not there especially in casinos that have not been confirmed to be reputable and also where the gambler has made substantial winning against them. On a broader note, casino is gambling business, based on luck like gambling itself and owned by an individual or group of individuals with the aim to make profit like any other business establishment. So don't expect to have a winning edge over casinos because they are programmed to have a reasonable winning advantage over the customer, so that whatever you do to win the chances for that is mathematically reduced against the customer. So it may not be rigged but chances of winning is very much limited. This link on how to know if casino games are rigged or not  will be useful to this thread",

Yea sometimes it's just like that and then I feel like these people are cheating just so I would never win. I too think that these casinos do cheat. If they don't do this most times, they can't make their profits.imagine they don't rigg these games and let's everyone win, they will actually start running at a huge loss soon. Now, we have lots of experts out there that can predict games or master the physics behind these games and of cause the casino knows that there are people like that coming to play their games and so they tend to change or cheat most times to avoid the risk of Lossing to these cheaters or players.so yes I would say casinos do cheat....",

What I just know is that you should use a reputable casino instead, a casino that people do recommend other people to use, the possibility that a game is rigged is not likely. I have gambled on many casino before, if I play like 3 to 5 games, I would have won at least once, so if I played 20 times and I lost all the games, I will be suspecting, but that has never happened to me before because I use the casinos that are on this site, or before I will register on a casino site, I will do my diligent research.",

Well, as much as gambling is concern, once you’re unlucky, it’s possible that you will end up losing from all your games and eventually used up all your money. However, in cases that the games are rigged, that’s the main reason why we should avoid playing unlicensed casinos because they can actually do that, unfortunately we can’t sue them for that since they are even unregistered. And maybe there’s a way of identifying the games that are being rigged, but maybe the casinos are not practicing it or it’s just that no casino will ever admit that their games are rigged regardless of how reputable or not the casino is.",
