  "content": "Just to get some opinions.Mixsafer's profile: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3345417(note 1: not showing a message such as 'email/password changed')ANN thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5364665.0;topicseen(note 2: Dated from October 2021, but the service existed well before, I don't remember when)Twitter account created in 2020: https://twitter.com/Mixsafer(note 3: only 10 followers, keep that in mind)note 4: Keep in mind an old post from me in which I'm pointing the website is showing a different Tor URL than the one he posted Last month, the Twitter account posted that since October 2021 they closed all services (link)And added that the domain was recently restored by outsiders (link)In October, so that's when @Mixsafer introduced the service to the forum (see note 2)It's possible and when taking care of the domain @mixsafer forgot to change the TOR URL with its own (see note: 4)When I moved the website from my list of the legit mixers, the user contacted me and said the Twitter account was created by a social media manager and \"digital marketer\" that he hired, he wanted to scam him.Pretty bad community manager and marketer I could say because see note 3He also added some users sent less than the minimum, it is well explained in FAQ. Yes, it's true, there is a minimum of 0.003 btc otherwise the mix doesn't start. But a person clarified that he sent 0.2 btc (see here)New Twitter account updated on thread: https://twitter.com/RealMixsaferThe account was created one week ago and has 500 followersEither the person is a scammer and joined Bitcointalk to introduce his scam, or either the scammer has access to the forum account and that's why there is no message email/password changed (see note1)At the same time since it's a white-label, it's supposed to work with Jambler's API in an automatic mode, and no other services seem to be problematic. He could of course disconnect the API. I contacted @Jambler here a few days ago but he never replied. I'm probably more interesting when it's about to PM me to add his partners lol",

      "body": "I think the service is a scam, and they started it from the time the first owners supposedly shut business. All I would like the complainant to do is provide the letter of guarantee to one of the trusted members like LoyceV to verify. This could help confirm that, indeed, the complainant tried to mix the 0.2 BTC using their service.The domain was registered on 30th - Nov - 2019and then updated on 15th - October -2021I think that is when the scammers took over.The original Twitter profile appears in the archived version of the sitehttp://web.archive.org/web/20201001193339/https://twitter.com/mixsaferThis is before the domain was last updated.",

      "body": "I am not sure how they were scammed or when. Mixsafer was connected with me through Telegram. I had designed his announcement thread and press release for his mixer. Still, he is connected with me on Telegram. According to him Twitter account was hacked and unable to recover. So he creates a new one. According to him, the forum account is still under control. I am not aware of a scam nor investigate. Recently he is working to redesign the website as far as I know. I would make sure about the forum account is either compromised or not by simply asking on Telegram.",

Therefore, until their internal problems are clarified, we remove them from our site.Thanks for responding here, I'm sure you've got enough work without getting tied up by this drama.  Just a quick question; does removing them from your website mean they are no longer able to use the [banned mixer] API for their mixing service?Quote from: The Cryptovator on June 12, 2022, 06:01:48 PMAccording to him Twitter account was hacked and unable to recover. So he creates a new one. According to him, the forum account is still under control.I'd be interested to know who made the post in October claiming the service is going down.  Was it the hacker, the original owner, and what was the purpose of that post?  It's also worth noting that the \"new\" twitter account, @RealMixsafer no longer exists.Quote from: Jay Johanson on June 12, 2022, 05:51:31 PMI am not aware of a scam nor investigate.There's this one in their ANN thread, but I don't know of any others.  Judge for yourself:Quote from: JoaSM on June 07, 2022, 12:13:34 PMQuote from: Mixsafer on June 07, 2022, 01:39:01 AMQuote from: dkbit98 on May 14, 2022, 09:33:32 PMQuote from: JoaSM on May 13, 2022, 12:55:54 PMTo report a scam I don't need to be a legendary user or open a thread.Nobody said that you need to be legendary member and you can do whatever you want. this was just my suggestion to bring more attention, but I guess you know everything you are smart, that is why you lost money with this website...Anyway, I think that MixSafer closed all their services back with onion mirror in October 2021, but according to latest tweet posted by old owners, domain was recently restored by scammers and they are using it to steal coins:https://twitter.com/mixsafer/status/1525194177390288896Some users sent less than the minium BTC(0,003), they didn't read carefully FAQ...The real twitter account https://twitter.com/RealMixsafer That's the excuse you always make. I have lost 0.20 BTC in this scam (I exceed the minimum by far). You are a scammer, you have rescued the domain and now you have access to this bitcoin talk account. And you have created another different twitter to continue scamming people. From the official Mixsafer account they already said that they stopped providing service, and you are trying to impersonate them while you continue stealing bitcoins. And paying others users with stolen money to share your lies.The real twitter account https://twitter.com/MixsaferThe new fake twitter account https://twitter.com/RealMixsaferQuote from: The Cryptovator on June 12, 2022, 06:01:48 PMRecently he is working to redesign the website as far as I know. I would make sure about the forum account is either compromised or not by simply asking on Telegram. Thanks, that would be helpful to know.  Not that it would really prove anything other than the forum account and the Telegram account are controlled by the same person.  Of course the one individual with whom you are in contact is going to claim the other person is the hacker.Based on what Jay said their having some internal conflicts, which doesn't make me think this going to end well.",

One of the operators could get angry and try to damage the service alongside the customer funds.",

Likely he will not continue and will delete Telegram as well. I owed some funds for design to him, but he paid before deleting the telegram. So I can say everything has been stopped by the owner from today. According to him, the scam allegation is fake, however, I didn't investigate. Likely this allegation is from the Twitter hacker, who knows the truth.",
