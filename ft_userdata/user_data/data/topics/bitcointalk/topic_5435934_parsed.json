So if you see a 1000% staking APY on a coin which supply goes x10 in a year ... you are not doing a great deal... Its much better to have a low APY on well established coin rather than a high apy on a coin that is going to rug-pull sooner or later. For istance deflationary BNB with APY from lauchpads. But if you want high risk on low marketcap coins ... I have one interesting coin that have high apy for small investment combined with low inflation. But remember, do your own research before investment.Idena - its first POP (proof of person) blockchain. 1 person = 1 node = 1 vote. No KYC, sybil resistance achieved by turing test combined with POS type of rewards. Its interesting because they achieved non-linear increase in payments for nodes. 1000$ investment - 100% APY, 100 000$ investment - 18% APY (on a coin with supply inflation ~25%). - https://www.idena.io/staking. So it benefits small investors and you cant have 1000 small nodes to cheat system thanks to POP type of consensus. You can also start with 0$ investment, test network, acknowledge risks, and collect small rewards for helping network with turing test.But DYOR first.",

My friend is also doing this 1-2 years ago, however from 100 coin he was mining maybe only a few of them can be sold.It's like gamble, nothing guanretee and the exchange is also small.",

If you want to play, why don't you play with microcaps instead of something that's doomed by math. Why would they be worth the shot when you can mathematically prove that they are unsustainable and will always go down in price? Or are you hooked on passive income? That's a byproduct of a good project. Like buying and trading NFTs got you PAINT, GODS and IMX airdrop, or that using uniswap got you UNI airdrop. People who bought apes got a lot of expensive free stuff later just because of holding them.But projects with whole point of inflation are just sad. They are doomed to die because their whole idea is around wealth, something that should be a byproduct, not a whole gimmick.",

Ceremony that happens once per few weeks during which turing test happens simultaneously for whole network. Nodes that pass this test, are proved to be owned by a human and can mine until next validation. So if you want to test network and see how it works and how turing test looks like ... its the best to do it tomorrow. No investment is needed.",

It is a new project from the COSMOS ecosystem, EVMOS. At first it was offering 1,000 or more percent for staking. But now that rate has dropped noticeably and the price has dropped 10 times in just a few months. It seems to me that it is better to stay away from POS projects in general.",

Unless the server is very strong to withstand many validators.But what if you focus those funds on trading instead of putting it on masternode. As many validators join the league it will shrink to a smaller one.",
