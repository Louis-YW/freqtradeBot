Will they give refund for those who feel unsatisfied because of losing? I doubt about it ofc, and I think it is impossible to give refund just because satisfaction. Even without deposit, I'm not satisfied for few things already about this site. I created an account, receive sign up bonus few hundreds satoshi and played their slot game several bets. What makes me not satisfied? There is no bet history unless I missed it and there is no information about the fairness of the game, afaik the available games are their own original games but it seems that it is not provably fair.I'm shocked to see their stats on top of their page where it informs visitors that they have 3k+ players already, is this real stats? Too good to be true for a fresh new site.",

It's really is the first time to see a casino that will offer a refund if users are not satisfied. I worry about the sustainability of the offer that you guys made, Do you have at least a mechanics on how it will work since I believe that it is a too good to be true offer. Multi account abusers will surely enjoy your casino! As it can easily be abused, The cash back percentage is pretty insane too. With the offers you guys showed here, It's too much for a casino and I think I'm doubting the future legitimacy of your casino.Also you can try to improve your ANN thread since it's not very alluring to eyes of viewers.",

You can't just come to a forum and start pooping threads all over without engaging in discussion with those replying to your thread; you've made a total of four posts, all of which were thread starters with not a single reply; you should reconsider your marketing strategy and look for a more effective method. Second, your bonuses appear to be too good to be true. I just went to your website, and the design is very poor and not mobile friendly, and for a casino that can't even afford to spend money on a good web design to be promising those kinds of bonuses seems like a bait to me.",

It looks too good to be a genuine offer. But hey, why do you think people would believe such things? A brand-new casino that doesn't make its name yet offers a full refund if the player is unsatisfied. Whoever loses at any casino is unsatisfied with the game because they lose. Another thing is 900% Cashback on any deposit. I mean, WTF? From where will you get that money to give 900% cashback? Regular casinos cannot even afford to give 30% cashback, while your casino offers 900% cashback. Why will a brand-new casino run its service at a loss? Moreover, I noticed the player counter shows 3444 Players online, and it's not updating. How does a brand new casino has 3444 players online while they are in the market for a short time? That's an impressive growth  The domain is not too old. The domain was registered for a year. It was registered in December 2022 and will expire in December 2023.

      "body": "This promotion is too good to be real, so, the question is where is the trick? well we can figure it out on the Terms of Service.Look at those withdrawal fees:QuoteThe Services support Bitcoin (BTC) only. The minimum deposit and withdrawal amount is 0.0001 BTC. Additionally, a network transaction fee of 0.001 BTC will be deducted from your withdrawal amount.If you win big you will get the payment in Monthly installments:QuoteNFTonSpin.com reserves the right to pay substantial wins in monthly installments, until the full amount is paid out. The number of installments will be determined by NFTonSpin.com on a case by case basis.If we take any of the promos we only have 2 hours to make the wager:QuoteAll games must be completed within two hours from the time funds are deposited. And if you are in the wrong jurisdiction they will lock your account, the site determines your jurisdiction by your IP, so, it's a tricky point because they don't have a list of valid or invalid countries. So, I would recommend avoiding this casino, even if the promos look nice the TOS will give an excuse to not pay your money back, in other words, this is just one more disguised scam. If op had a gambling license we could think about playing on the site, but he doesn't even have that.",

The minimum deposit and withdrawal amount is 0.0001 BTC. Additionally, a network transaction fee of 0.001 BTC will be deducted from your withdrawal amount.so the person deposits 3$ and plays, wins and is left with 6$ and will not be able to withdraw, irritated the person continues playing and then he wins and is left with 30$ and when he thinks about withdrawing he will be left with 3$ because it will be deducted 27 $, so I ask why people should use your casino when they can use stake.com casino which will only be discounted $1.90 at withdrawal time, knowing that stake.com is one of the best and oldest casinos you really intend to compete with a casino as big as stake.com and other old and trusted casinos doing that kind of thing?Could it be that you, before creating this casino, did some market research so that you would bring advantages that other old casinos do not have? because everything I saw in your casino doesn't make any sense, you only have the option of depositing and withdrawing, but you know that in this cryptocurrency market there are many cryptocurrencies, some with high fees and others with very low fees, so it doesn't make sense to just have bitcoin as the only option. I'm not going to talk about the other nonsense things that are in your casino, but it's unbelievable to have so much weird stuff in just one casino",

Also, your announcement is very lackluster. If you want to catch the attention of a lot of players in here, at least try and get a copper membership to post images and get a decent-looking announcement thread. Better use another tagline as well, as the 'leading crypto casino' is a very hard feat to achieve, and as a new casino, you're nowhere near the leading unfortunately.But yeah, try working on those things and re-post this thread again.",

      "body": "Welcome to the forum, @nftonspin! It's great to have you here. I'd like to address a few points that have been brought up by previous members. Firstly, it would be helpful if you could provide clearer details about your \"full refund\" policy. Transparency is key when it comes to customer expectations.On another note, I must commend your casino's low deposit/withdrawal threshold of only 0.0001 BTC. That's a user-friendly feature that makes your platform more accessible. However, I feel compelled to express some concerns regarding your \"network transaction fee\" of 0.001 BTC. In my opinion, this fee seems excessive considering the current network conditions.Typically, with a transaction fee of 100 sat/vB, which is the recommended \"high priority\" rate, all transactions are confirmed without any issues in the first block. For an average transaction, this fee should only amount to a few dollars. Comparatively, your fee is significantly higher, which may discourage potential players who are simply looking to try out a new casino. It's worth considering the impact this fee could have on attracting new customers, especially since your platform doesn't have an established reputation within the community yet.I hope you take these suggestions into account.",
