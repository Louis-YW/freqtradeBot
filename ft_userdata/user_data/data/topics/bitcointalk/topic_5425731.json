But I'd prefer to pay in Bitcoin just to save money in fees (if you know what I mean). A forum member made me a interesting proposition via PM lately. I've already sent him a reply waiting for an answer in return. If the deal goes through, then I will lock this thread. Thanks for the suggestion, btw. It's much appreciated.",
