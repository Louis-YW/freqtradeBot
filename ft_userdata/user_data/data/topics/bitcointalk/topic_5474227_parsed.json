  "content": "Hi, I never received a response from Netent tech support. I was playing multihand Netent Jacks or Better Double Up Video Poker. The first draw and deal works fine for multihand, but I have to reload the game whenever I want a new deal and draw for multihand (always works fine for single hand play in this game  - no problem). This has happened at more than one casino. I am on windows 11 with firefox and proton VPN. I noticed on a demo site like Casinoguru, the game works fine,but not at online casinos when wagering. Does anyone else have the same problem ? If anyone has solved this issue I would appreciate a posted solution.Best, tableplay.",

You should first try to contact or find out where you can talk to their most supportive customer service so that you know the most basic problem with their platform, because none of the community members here in the forum can answer the concerns you have with the platform.So didn't you first find out that the site you entered is also a platform, dude? You should first carefully check what the TOS is; maybe later on you will just play the game without doing any research. There is nothing else to do but wait for now if you have contacted anyone from their support team.",

      "body": "Well, since it happened at more than one site (https://i.imgur.com/gkW8Otf.mp4), I assumed that the problem is on my end, rather than a configuration problem with a particular site. But, regardless, I had contacted customer support at one of the sites and they said the game works fine (maybe they only tried single hand) and that was the end of it in terms of their assistance.For example maybe a particular configuration setting for Firefox (I also tried Edge with the same result). Since this is a popular game I thought some people here may have already encountered this issue if they use a VPN to play. If the game didn't run at all (\"access forbidden\") then I would assume it was a TOS issue rather than a configuration issue. Maybe sites prefer to shadowban  a game if they don't want someone to play it to meet turnover rather than just not let the game run, but this is an odd way to go about it (i.e., the game works for single hand play, but for multihand play you must reload the web page after each deal/draw) if that is true. Finally, I figured that the sites would just forward the issue to NetEnt anyway (who might have the issue in their error database) and that Netent would have the technical expertise to sort it and the sites would not. I appreciate your recommendations and comments.Best, TP.",
