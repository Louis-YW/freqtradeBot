And no matter where the direction of the market has chosen to point to, i will just buy until when i feel it has gone too high to keep buying.I am longer paying attention to all the noise that comes with short term investment anymore. It is better to be in red on a short term than to lose out on big opportunities on a long term. If the market is selling at a low price i will buy, If it is buying at an uptrend i will still buy. The only difference is i will try not to buy too high because in all the buying profit is the target. The goal is not to get rich but to catch up with the next trend and ATH.The fact is on a long run the market will do what it wants to do and not even the best analysis can change it from making its desired moves. Bitcoin long term prediction is becoming even more harder to make as external forces keep playing out in the market more often. Staying positive for long term goal has given so many good profit in time past and it won't be out of place if similar occurrence happens again on the long runWhat do you think!!!",

Catching up with the trend means wanting to set yourself up for the right trend and getting the trend right means easier profit, profit is additional money  . Anyway my point therefore is while catching up with the trend, don't take the wrong hasty decision and invest all you have just because of your convinction that price will automatically start improving. Remember to invest what you can bear to lose. The market don't go up all the time, the corrections are still there",

But you must also pay attention to your needs, lest you be forced to sell what you have collected due to urgent circumstances. It's a good situation when you are pressured and forced to sell bitcoin when the market is recovering and it gives you profit, but if it's the other way around, it's a loss, of course. My advice, besides investing in bitcoin, we also have to prepare savings that are separate from the assets that we will hold for a long time, so we don't have to sacrifice our bitcoin assets in a state of urgency at any time.",

Remember to invest what you can bear to lose. The market don't go up all the time, the corrections are still there But in my opinion, what Op said is also true, because being rich is different from making a profit. If people aim to be rich they usually become greedy, and many of those who aim like that do anything, even though, they don't know what they are doing. As for getting a profit, we must have calculated what target to achieve, and after hitting the target we usually always emphasize taking everything, or just taking profits. Because if you say so, who invests without thinking about profit?",

Sometimes silence in the market space means much, but money flows into market hype, where I decide to invest 20%. Most people ignored meme hype and made money from most market hype, however, a 20% decision requires a managed risk decision. It may also depend on how people react when it becomes popular.",

You can always buy a fraction of Bitcoin whatever the price is so I doubt you can set a price to determine a too high for you once the price continuously pump. Everybody says this same thing when Bitcoin price first reach the 1000$ mark since the price stays below 100$(Correct me if I’m wrong) for a long time then a sudden bull run appear. People adjust their valuation of Bitcoin as time passes by base on what is ATH. So having a hypothetical price for you to stop will be very hard to follow imho.",

Look at all those BTC withdrawn from exchanges, and many were sold and withdrawn into fiat because nobody trusted any exchanges. Many exchanges wanted to keep people calm by publishing proof of funds but even that had a negative response because those proof of funds didn't always look genuine. So people just quit and never came back. Retail left crypto.The OP is the only one that actually bought in at the bottom, most buy at the top. And this is why many end up losing money. Not only with crypto. Same with stocks and real estate. Look how many people overpaid for real estate and they are now holding the bag on a property that lost double digits value in less than 1 year. People need to be patient and value investors like OP and not have FOMO and get caught holding the bag for many many years while everybody else is making good money.",

Unfortunately, I don't have the budget now to keep buying, otherwise I would. I've stopped bothering about the market situation, not to mention that during a bear market you can accumulate more, so that's a huge plus that I don't mind at all.I don't see the point in caring about the market situation during a full economic recession; nothing much is performing well now, and there's absolutely nothing we can do but wait it out. I'm in the red during the bear market, but with the first real bull run, I'll reach my DCA; I'm just a little off.",

But DCA has done a lot at this point. and it seems that long-term investors have done a lot of that. and i also do the same thing. Average Down is also needed in a bearish market situation. and makes the average purchase cheaper. so that it is hoped that it will provide maximum profit for the long term when the increase has started.Having a target price is a strong enough motivation to invest. and coupled with the strengthening of a mature analysis will keep us mentally awake. But in the end, sticking to the money we are prepared to lose will make us calmer.",

The market will do what it wants to do, and no amount of study can alter that. On the other hand, I believe it's crucial to strike a balance between paying too little and paying too much while making a purchase. It's great to be ahead of the curve and make an ATH, but you need also be aware of the dangers and volatility of the market.Having a diversified portfolio may help reduce the impact of any one unforeseen event. Rather of placing all your money into one security, diversify by purchasing things like stocks, bonds, real estate, and Bitcoin. This may assist mitigate any losses and boost your chances of making a profit.As with any investment, Bitcoin is no exception; prospective buyers should do their own investigation and analysis before to making a purchase. As part of this process, it is important to learn about the underlying technology, the state of the market, and any proposed regulatory changes that might impact the cost.",

People who speculate tend to get greedy and lose much more in the long run. It's not like investing in a company, where they are making tangible profits each year and either re-invest it back profitably or pay it out to shareholders who are the real owners of the company. Ultimately most people need to convert bitcoin back into something they can spend and use in the real world, so it's a bit naive to just keep saying buy, buy, buy without a fixed point you've got in mind to sell.",

Buy most coins as you can afford, keep them stored safely, preferentially forget about your investments during your routine, do your stuff and live your life.

In the event that catastrophic electronic or internet failure occurs.There are physical assets and commodities which could be described as being deflationary in the current era, similar to deflationary digital assets like BTC.Real Estate.

Trees are a deflationary asset, although this may not be completely clear at the moment judging by market trendsd.Common metals.  Metals markets and industry has become extremely reliant upon globalisation. The decline of globalisation and global trade could result in common metals like steel and aluminum becoming deflationary in terms of local markets. Agriculture.  Natural gas is used to produce agricultural fertilizers and agrochemicals. Agriculture is also very reliant upon globalisation. Which overall could lead to agriculture becoming deflationary in a local sense.",
