Don't expect any huge since for now this is just another good news but it will not bring any huge impact if we talk about global adoption. Yes this could create some changes but its just for temporary pump only and what I think could bring big impact in terms of adoption is the US will announce thay they adopt and make bitcoin as their legal tender. For sure with this we can see bitcoin will be globally adopted even in small merchants on our places.",

Every successful story builds up on small starting. Now Bitcoin users will be able to use their Bitcoin directly as a payment method.If they are going to use lightening network as a payment method of Bitcoin that will be great which will ensure fastest transections with a very small fees. But usual transections aren't much suitable for little payments as it will cost higher fees. So I really appreciate this initiative. But this news will not impact huge in Bitcoin Adoption because we need Bitcoin as a legal tender in most of the countries which will be the biggest achievement and obviously mass adoption will occur.",

Great news fir the cryptocurrency industry but I don't think this news will suddenly increase the adoption  of bitcoin  and in time past, we've heard of news of a full country accepting bitcoin as a legal tender and bitcoin  wasn't even bullish about the whole incidence and I don't think this very news  will also make bitcoin  suddenly bullish. Nevertheless, I think this is a welcome development  and a great news for the entire bitcoin industry since Europe is already very big and I look forward  to seeing more of this especially  in Africa.",

What that makes this more interesting to read is that it shows how lightning network can help. I see this as a means of how bitcoin lightning network adoption is increasing. Quote from: https://finbold.com/bitcoin-now-accepted-at-60000-ev-charging-stations-across-europe/Specifically, German start-up Satimoto currently has around 60,000 EV charge points that accept non-custodial and pseudonymous charging and payment through the Lightning network in multiple European countries, as the company stated on Twitter while sharing a part of its recent (not yet published) map on July 26.But this type of news may not just cause increase in bitcoin price, but as the adoption goes on, expect more positivity and increase in bitcoin price.",

This approval is long overdue and for stores that are not currently accepting Bitcoin,  if the country has a cryptocurrency regulation and approved its acceptance under guidance and regulations to checkmate the transaction and with that in place,  we must be assured that all cryptocurrencies related payment are all done under strict adherence to the regulatory frameworks that approves its acceptance within the region. Any store that is found around source and enabling environment that enable and allows cryptocurrencies as a form of payment and refused to take advantage of the wide range of advantages that surround Bitcoin as a payment method and as an asset which will serve a double purpose for the store if the market moves in their favour while holding a large sum of the capital in Bitcoin as results of many sell and payments using Bitcoin,  this could increase the total amount of the DCA value of source bitcoin holding at that moment.",

There's a local saying that goes something like this - The faster you grow, the faster you fall. I guess if you think of it like that, then Bitcoin is doing the opposite and this will be the key to its success. Currently, this news won't have that much of an impact. It will be a part of market sentiment. It is not that big of news to make it a trend or a cycle to start a bullish market. There are lots of negative news going on recently and as far as I can tell, this particular news will fade away soon. I didn't even know about this until I came across this post. So as I said, it won't make that much of an impact. But these small positive events could really help Bitcoin to grow in the long run. Bitcoin took over a decade to come to this point. So it will take some more time to be accepted worldwide. Or it could happen in an instant if somehow a piece of news could change people's perspective about Bitcoin and everyone will be willing to accept it. Let's not think much about it. Just sit back, and watch while HODLing BTC in your bags. Cheers.",

There’s a disclaimer on the introduction of the article that most of that 60K EV station will be on experimental phase which means it’s still not official. This news is really good in general since people will have an option to use Bitcoin but also this guarantee that gonna give huge impact since this 60K EV only add Bitcoin as option for the currency meaning there’s still a lot of currency that can be used aside from Bitcoin.This is massive if customers that will use Bitcoin will have a discount which other currencies don't have to push people to use Bitcoin due to this exclusive benefits.",

As you have stated, not all countries are in good terms with the US and will not want to follow suit or accept the idea of adoption if the US does so. Bitcoin is decentralised and does not have preference of people who use it, but because everything nowadays is political, we may still encounter some obstacles in the global adoption of bitcoin. Having said that, this does not mean that bitcoin will cease pushing its adoption on its own, as it is already doing.",
