DCA does not have to be done every week or 2 weeks, you can do it every quarter in the year which will be every 3 months of even every 4 months.You have enough to esave up and make larger purchases decreasing the overall fees paid.I will recommend you use decentralized exchanges cause of the privacy they offer but I cannot recommend one which will save up on fees as you want.",

I suggest you look for a better option. One option is P2P. Ask in local communities if someone offers the option of buying and selling in person in your area. There are also P2P platforms, or you can view market offers on this forum. Just be sure to choose a reputable member or use escrow services.",

My solution for you is to buy from someone whether it's someone you know in real life or someone in a forum. Make one thread, it may save more fees for you.Centralized exchanges seem to rarely adjust withdrawal fees on bitcoin networks even though low priority transactions are processing at 8 sat/vB as I write. Paying 0.0005 for $100 worth of bitcoin assets when you make a withdrawal still seems like an expensive fees to pay for it, so explore alternative solutions.",

Signature campaigns are another solution - that is also great to consider instead of just buying.That's quite better than having to buy at CEX which will cost you a shipping fee which you just have to pay considering the number of Op purchases each week. The number is small, so it is necessary to find a reliable P2P service on the forum, there are many services to choose from, just need to see how their reputation is. I once made a Bitcoin purchase by directly transferring Fiat to a Bitcoin reseller and it was done quickly. And the DCA of the signature payment is a pretty good idea, it can be set aside at least 50% so that we don't have to buy again, no fees, just hold it.",

This means that the salaries might be not competitive compared to fiat economy. Not to mention that a lot of people have non-online jobs, and it would be nearly impossible for them to find a job that pays in Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is not a legal tender in most of the world.Trying to start earning Bitcoin is a good idea, but if it's clear that it isn't working, it should be abandoned, rather than desperately trying to make it work and losing a lot of time and opportunities in the process.",

I guess that's the best solution so far.Using Binance for DCA isn't really a good thing to do IMO especially if you are withdrawing your money there on a monthly basis, and at the same time you are investing a small amount like what you're doing. The fees will just eat your capital, and unless the price of Bitcoin goes up significantly in just a matter of weeks, transaction fees on these Centralized Exchanges really is high.Well, if you don't want to do any of the 2, I think there's a 3rd option. To limit your withdrawing to at least once every 3 months if you aren't thinking of increasing your capital, or to just increase your money you invest if you really want to withdraw on a monthly basis.",

It's possible that he just miscounted his zeros, and that's why he came to the wrong conclusion.I don't use Binance anymore, but I can confirm that the fee for withdrawing is currently 0.00005 BTC. However, you're mistaken about KuCoin, as they do charge a fixed fee of 0.0005 BTC for withdrawing to SegWit addresses (the same as for legacy addresses). You can check it here: https://www.kucoin.com/vip/levelIt's also possible that the fee is actually lower now, and they haven't updated the information. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to verify that, and I can't recall the last time I withdrew BTC from KuCoin.",

He should be passionate about crypto (and I believe he is) but he should also get involved in various topics on the forum, come with wise arguments, contribute to discussions, earn merits and so on. Then he should also try to make some deals, prove himself that he is trustworthy... And I don't know if he is up for doing all these. Not all people are interested in debating on forum, in trying to educate themselves or help others.

I have been using PNNV.com instant swap for the last few months as I was having the same problem as you. It works perfectly fine for me by saving some good amount on fees. They charge a very little commission + on-chain tx cost only. However, instead of buying $15/$20, save up to $100 or so and then buy Bitcoin. That will be good for you. Since you are saving Bitcoin in your wallet, every time you are receiving Bitcoin = 1 input and counting which will eat a large fee when you will go for sending Bitcoin. The less frequently you receive, the less input = less fee you have to pay. And don't forget to consolidate your inputs when fee is low.",
