  "content": "Hello, I really need some advice, I am relatively new to this.I am using Bitcoin Core 22.0.0. I had an issue with Armoury 0.96 after I imported a private key which would not send to a deposit address on the network, after importing the private key I did back up the Armoury wallet with a paper backup.After importing the private key to the Armoury wallet the balance showed correctly in my wallet. On the blockchain address the bitcoin still sit unconfirmed, after trying to send them a bitcoin deposit address.I did get a message saying the transaction fees might be too low & to try again but the same message appeared over & over, I did see the link to report the issue to Armoury but instead i tried to reseach the fault & ended up loading Armoury 0.96.3 over the old wallet, that did not work so I reverted back to 0.96 & the wallets that I had are still there but the one with the imported private key is now showing no bitcoin balance.i have tried to import the private key again but it says the address I am trying to import is already part of my wallet, can I get the coins back?I also tried to restore the paper backup on another PC but the balance says zero.I can say the coins are there unconfirmed on the blockchain, you can see they were redeemed but they remain unconfirmed. Is it possible get them back to my wallet now they do not show in either my original Armoury wallet or the backup on the other PC that i tried to restore?I am thinking because I reedemed the bitcoin from a cold wallet to the Armoury wallet, but did not get to send them on the network to be confirmed that they are lost, even with a backup?Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thank you.",
