  "content": "Hi alt miners, I am not expecting a great day because, as we know, GPU mining is becoming less profitable day by day. 2021 was a great year in GPU mining history. At the peak rate, we have mined over $5/day with Rx 570 8 gigs cards at 30 Mhs. But, A few months ago, $10/day was standard for a 100 Mh/s Mining rig before the electricity cost. But, At this moment, We can barely mine $2.15/day with a 100 Mh/s. If you have RTX 3090, You are still mining $2.55/day before the electricity cost. After the electricity cost, it's reduced to around $1.75, which is low compared to 2021. I have some Polaris cards like Rx 570 8gigs and Rx 580 8gigs which can give you around 30-32 Mh/s on the eth hash algorithm. With this hash rate, You can barely mine $0.65 before the electricity and $0.35 after the electricity cost. As ETH POS will be introduced very soon, What are you planning to do with your Polaris cards? Because if you have the Latest Nvidia cards, You can mine other coins like Sero, Ergo, and Flux. But, I don't think Polaris cards will be profitable. Also, GPU prices are dropping drastically, and old cards' resell values are also falling. I am planning to sell my Polaris cards. What do you planning?",

      "body": "You sound as if Polaris cards are the only one affected, I have very limited AMD cards and others are all Nvidia but the fact is only Ethereum remain profitable on the Nvidia cards as well, can AmD and Nvidia mine other algorithms? Yes, but other coins are less profitable, Polaris cards can mine Ravencoin and Ergo too and the difference in performance comparing to Nvidia is not Night and Day.",
