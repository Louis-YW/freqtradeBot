This type of thread only creates FUD and nothing more. Op, we have so many people that still are hodling their coin even when Bitcoin price dropped from ATH to the $15,000 and yet still not panicking because they know what they have involved themselves in.",

Do you think BTC will experience better and high price?I guess you're new to Bitcoin. Yes of course it will rise. Bitcoin is always growing. As always the next 2-3 years it will go up and go far higher than the previous all time high price. In two years from today it is almost guaranteed it will be over $100k and likely continue going much higher than that before the next crash in 2026. This is what it does every market cycle. Nobody has lost interest. Interest is growing in Bitcoin as it always does. Bitcoin price will be in the millions of dollars eventually so there is no need to worry about if it will keep growing from $20k, because the answer is of course it will. Bitcoin is still very early in its adoption, nobody is worried about whether it will keep growing or not.",

No surprise here from a Newbie worrying about Bitcoin price  It took Bitcoin 1211 Days from the 2017 ATH to the 2021 ATH and from that time till now, we are just 686 days. There is no question whether Bitcoin will touch a new ATH cos it certainly will so just relax and buy some more",

Don’t be surprised if it rises above its ATH because thats how it behaves. At the current down fall we I think we should be buying the dip and be prepared what the bull run will bring. I have never give up hope for once and I don’t think i ever will because we are yet to see what BTC have in store for us.",

      "body": "Bitcoin started the year strong from a depressing and arguably hard to redeem year end, due to the fact that FTX made some pretty disastrous moves that were shed to light just last year, most of which involve the mismanagement of funds and when things went south, people couldn't withdraw their money which lead to further collapse and loss of confidence over bitcoin. Still, as the first part of my reply states, bitcoin surprisingly recovered and has since been retaining a relatively high price point at 20k. With the halving coming in next year there is a good possibility that bitcoin would be able to recover from its $60k ATH price point for a while before stabilizing once again, if things go really well we might even see it go as much as $80k or maybe even reach the coveted $100k mark.",

And who exactly are those billionaires that lost interest in Bitcoin because I haven't noticed any known bitcoiners changing their mind drastically? Or you are  maybe referring to  Elon's tweet from few days ago in which  he said \"I used to be in crypto, but now I am in AI\" or something along those lines. If yes, then you shouldn't worry because he was never truly interested in bitcoin and he got into for shits and giggles and to make some money and not because he is into what Bitcoin represents. Bitcoin existed and did just fine before any of people like him showed up, and will do just fine without them.I guess this is your first bear market and that could explain why you are worried that bitcoin price will reach the previous all time high. All you have to do is zoom out the chart and see that this is nothing that hasn't happen before. Instead worrying about whether Bitcoin will survive, focus on acquiring as much as you during bear market as that's what this period is for.",

The market is still fluctuating, it is one sign that it is active, others get out while others get in.  It is a sign of people or institution investing in Bitcoin market.Quote from: Godlovesyou on March 05, 2023, 05:55:25 PMNormally I understand this wasn't the first time BTC has experience this down slide but then it was normally market situations but now many billionares has withdrew interest in this project, then what is the hope of this project? As many billionaires withdraw interest in the project, there are far more normal people investing in Bitcoin in hopes to get a profit one day.  If a huge amount of fund is exiting the market, this creates a window for other interest parties to get into the Bitcoin market because Bitcoin is at a discounted price.Quote from: Godlovesyou on March 05, 2023, 05:55:25 PMDo you think BTC will experience better and high price?Haven't we just experience a Bitcoin surge recently?  from $16k+ to $24k,  what do you call this increase in price?",

I recall that you don't have much Bitcoin experience. Thereby further, you must study more about how a Bitcoin chart appears. If you own Bitcoin, your heart shouldn't feel weak. Otherwise, when you see a red line, you'll start to panic. It's common for cryptocurrency to pump and dump. But, I think you should read the forum more frequently.

The price of bitcoins is still not fixed yet, the current price is not the price bitcoin was a few months ago where it was lower, that tells you that the price of bitcoin will not remain the same by tomorrow, and even with the downward movement at times, the value of bitcoins is expected to rise really well when the next bitcoin halving occurs, which is in 2024.",

Most problem with newbies is that they're easily shake by any common stories and news update. I think he has few knowledge or less of BTC and he worked by opinion of people but I love this threads coming out often because many people out there are panicking, it will ushered opportunity for you guys who have grand knowledge and technical system of cryptocurrency to keep encouraging newbies in this forum.This dude is a bit confused of what must have trans-led through his mind hearing different opinion from people and internet.

Leave everything aside if you see the chart of BTC closely you'll see high volumes bars during last few weekly candles plus ofcourse you'll see price of bitcoin not falling beyond this point which means even after such heavy selling volumes price could not fall beyond this point so makes sense that this is accumulation only and nothing else.",
