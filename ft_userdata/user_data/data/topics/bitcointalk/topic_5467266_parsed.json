  "content": "My pipo, I say my return back the hands of time here about sometin segregating and sentimental going on in this country way dey cause escalations of inhumans and unprogressive ness in our societies today.Previously, I make a post titled \"Sentiment in the poor and the rich dead values\" https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5463400.msg62701206#msg62701206 way call about the public reactions against when the poor dies and or when the rich dies.I want to emphasize more inside this bcos dem say \"if u no open mouth ask, then no blame them if e no reach u\" and \"when u always dances my the tones, then means everything dey alright \".Now me dey para and spreading out my grieves expressions about how the public dey always underrates and disvalues the poor when them dies on whichever ways or tins rolling along the common man in an overview but them dey overrates and values the death of the rich  on whichever ways or tins rolling along the rich in an overview.1 of my native adage says \"if u Sabi pound, u go pound Inside the molter so others go folo u chop but if u no Sabi pound, and u go pound for ground then na only u go chop am just the way we lay on our beds the way we dress am.For this our country 9ja, our Govt dey always like copy the abroads but only on the aspects way go favour them the political allies and governance allies.The underrating of the common man by the publics and of course the governments na him dey yield the expantiated monsterous breeding of the nuisance and predators here in our country making it feel like a curse or a culture that has com to stay as an inheritance with us here for 9ja.Why our Govt no fit adopt and or copy wetin go favour all of us for this country?Them suspend abi band cryptocurrencies bcos na decentralized digital currency way them no fit take control of cuz wetin dem like na to frustrate the people and expects the masses to work like elephants then chop/earns like ants. That 1 purge them I know.However, my keep hitting on my points.  I remembered a time around Feb 2019, a group called an \"Euro Group for Animals\" entered a heavy protest tagged Justice for the sweet pit bull killed by a Municipal Police officer somewhere there in Europe.https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/news/protest-dog-killed-italian-police-officer.This na country way value lives and where all things in existence matters. That was just for animal oh then imagine if na human being how the nature of the reactions for be my people?And if them keep mute maybe say na just animal na... Na so small small them go dey hunt humans so commonly join and things go just go likely.Now I want to talk about here in 9ja where a 100 poor masses(common man) dey die probably on daily basis self in one way or the other and the situation go just go likely. Some dies my hunger, humiliations, mobile accidents, armed attacks, brutalities, suicides and all that and na just to burry them along conscienceless and remorseless amongst the people even rejoicing the decease(s) out of hatreds and the govt would take no record and not even a correspond able action towards the common man's lost lives.At the #endsars Lekki shooting 2020 October, many of 9ja youths lost their lives on a free protest against Police brutalities yet the Govt on its own took laws onto themselves, gave the military order prompted the sporadical shooting that left many youths lives lost that period and til date, nothing happened and no perpetratorship investigation even when the masses could point hands on some person's yet it was to no avail bcuz na common man (poor citizen)die and the perpetrators na dignitaries (rich men) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Lekki_shootingMy friend died in police brutality news no carry am, nobody cares e end just like that.My innocent brother died by some armed gun men, news no carry am no body cares e end just like that.I lost my aunty for hospital due to no money for her treatment news no carry am, nobody cares and e end just like that.A politicians convoy armed personel shoot my uncle on a high way cuz him no slow down for some 1 like a 1st class citizen to pass b4 him and news no carry am, nobody cares and e end just like that.My brother dey prison over 5yrs now for wetin him no do til now news no carry and nobody cares just like that.A lot don happen and a lot stil dey happen to the common man (poor man) News no dey carry am, nobody cares and e still dey happen.Why? Bcoz when somtin happens to the common citizens (common man) here in 9ja notin has happened in this side of the land of the living Meanwhile... A politician (rich citizen) car tyre go deflect along his way with a convoy, news don carry am keeping security agencies at alert Incase of enemy attack, arriving at their destinations them dey call on traffic awareness and keeping security agencies on standbys all for a safety of just 1 rich citizen.Just of recent, a DPO was killed and butchered at Ahoada East LGA in Rivers State and so sudden the State Govt suspended some traditional rulers for the indulgence and maybe incompetent to maintain Peace in the environment just bcos a high class of a citizen (rich man) has died.Why them no arrest those suspended traditional rulers as accused say them get hand for the DPO killing instead of just suspending them from their thrones?Bcos na rich men all them be so just small law or sanctions hold them abi?But if them point hands at a common man them go respond rapidly with an execution style.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/09/cultists-behead-police-dpo-in-rivers/E no end there, the state Govt declared the perpetrators wanted with a bounty of #100M for just who go disclose their whereabouts. https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thecable.ng/fubara-places-n100m-bounty-on-criminal-gang-for-killing-rivers-dpo/amp&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjds-uFmrWBAxXxhv0HHTVRC2sQFnoECAQQAg&usg=AOvVaw2gH_fPQPQYd3SiDA6rbbBRWhy? Bcos a high class (rich man) has died but kept mute and be playing adamant games when the same perpetrators were busy killing the common man (poor man)Ok. Let me just point a little hand were a famous Superstar (celebrity)e.g Mohbad the Singer and a rapper died. If not hi famousness, who for know care? Likely... Him na still rich man bcos him dey surrounded with the men of milk and honey despite what.Him death now don cause lot of stares including the NDLEAs and other celebrities to be questioned. Everybody dey show lovew, remorses and hearts broken emotions.Why?Because he is not a common citizen but a famous celebrity (rich man) Everyone is eager to his death avengeance even without a political, geographical regions and religious is not undermined among the masses down to the government.And the government and security agencies has set up an intelligent and special force for the demise investigation.https://www.google.com/url?q=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9Db9unU8v_Q&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjglaXPmrWBAxXBgv0HHRvtBccQtwJ6BAgJEAE&usg=AOvVaw1rD_rqg89AZHorUEVNqse1 My just pause here. I know the love is massive and creditable But either big or small tin go happen to the riches (famous/political citizens), News don carry am.CNN go carry, BBN go Carry, CBN go carry, Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, YouTube, Twitter bloggers, TV/Radio stations go carry, village town cryers self go carry the the news and e fo bcom a trending in some periods of time. why?Bcos sometin has happened to the 001s that matters in the land of the living at this side of the world 9ja.9ja which?Please let all that matters matter so we can move forward. Adapt to systems to carry everyone along without a segregation and sentimental bridges against the common man and the rich man abeg else there will be no stabilities of good deeds in the society.#Let all that liveth matters#Let all in existence matters.Then.... #9jaforlife",

However, talking about the rich and the poor regards to the attention wey dem dey get, it all depends on the circumstances but make we know dey expect an egalitarian society even China wey dey practice dey practice socialism, you still get big men and women dere that are respected. Again it depends on the circumstances of death. No be all big men wey die dey create fuss or get people notice am for public apart from say you don be known public servant for state or federal. Also, if the circumstances of death of a poor person dey mysterious, painful like being lynched or has political/religious undertone then the public go hear am and we don see examples of such deaths like that of Deborah Yakubu Samuel around may last year.Coming to Mohbad own now, the noise wey dey public no say the guy dey but na the secrecy concerning his death, if any poor person too create such fuss online while alive and death, it will still create attention.",

      "body": "Mate, I've been trying to connect your words from the way you started up till the end of the story, but because of the longevity of the story, I couldn't. Please, next time let's try and minimize what we post so that all of us can have a view and understanding of what you are talking about.As for the death of the rich or the poor, depends on the area to which you are viewing this. For instance, the Muslims prefer to bury the dead, whether rich or poor, in their white plain garment regardless of what you possesed in your bank account when you were alive, so they don't discriminate between the rich and the poor when it comes to burials or something of that nature.  I feel like at the end of the day what matters most is the kind of environment you live. There are environments where people are buried with much respect and value, without minding the kind of financial status or the kind of materialism  that have been done to the corpes, whereas there are other places that bury the dead due to probably their culture, in the way they feel like doing, which you may find diminishing.  I think that should be the bottom line of the discussion is that we continue to value humanity above materialism. Whether you're rich or poor, is a worldly possession which should not stop you from being treated with respect. This is not to ignore the privileges that comes with affluence.",

If u read me clearly Sir, I say since the State Govt say those traditional rulers failed to maintain Peace in the environs and also accused them of taking part in the DPOs killing, why Only suspended them from their thrones? Why not get them arrested since they are suspects til then find them not guilty? But if the public points hand at a common man being part in the DPOs killing, wetin we go dey hear na kill am kill am die.Suspending those traditional rulers was not enough as accused suspects them be. This na my point there.",
