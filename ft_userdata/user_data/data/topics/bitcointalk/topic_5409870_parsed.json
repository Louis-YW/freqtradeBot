In addition the block chain technology will help many institutions like the health sectors keep record, they'll be more job opportunities available for the skilled. Many will get employed without degree. So except for the bullish and bearish state of cryptocurrency, the blockchain network if adopted by the world it'll boost the global economy. https://www.pelicoin.com/blog/what-is-the-economic-impact-of-cryptocurrency",

So many Government will not Legalize cryptocurrencies for obvious reasons. One of them is that they have no control over the cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.Maybe what we shall see in most counties are Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)",

If that be your question then it is pretty much simple there will be improved economy and decline in inflation rate because the government won't have access to prints more coins and since the coin in circulation is been regulated by consensus algorithm it means we will definitely have improved economy. But why this will never happen because the government will never allow you be your own bank.",

      "body": "I will be assuming that you are talking about legalization of bitcoin and other shitcoins in today's economic world.Economy will become more globalized. It will be easier to perform cross-border transactions and trades. Which will create an influx of new investments. This could go either way,  but if such cross-border investments with cryptos are done in a controlled and regulated manner then it will be very positive.On a domestic level, monetary policies will become redundant due to free flowing nature and volatility of cryptos. It will have a huge impact on everything. So it's not going to happen unless the state can at least control the supply of cryptos and have an influence over its price. These two conditions have to be met, before they even think about legalizing it.A stable implementation of cryptocurrency will increase the participation. Which means more money to invest in new businesses, which means more jobs, which means more spending, which means booming economy  This is an ideal case, i.e. the cryptos were integrated in a very controlled fashion into the system and citizens are smart enough to access its potential. Otherwise it will be a disaster.",

It is true that some countries in the world have opted for introduce Bitcon as a legitimate currency, but if we talk about globalization it will not end up happening, at least not for now. The user \"logfiles\" mentioned it before and I reaffirm the comment of QuoteMaybe what we shall see in most counties are Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Since this is if several governments are beginning to use and consider CBDCs as a good strategy, if you do not know what a CBDC is, here is a link for you to read and know what I mean.Link: https://acortar.link/cfe4pI",

Currently, cryptocurrencies are subject to various regulations from each country's government and even impose income taxes on cryptocurrency users. so in real it will not happen completely, crypto is still under the shadow of the government and will not be able to escape. When cryptocurrencies dominate all sectors, they also cannot regulate the global economy, and the risks posed by cryptocurrencies will also be dangerous for those who do not understand and do not understand how to use cryptocurrencies.",

Because governments don't want to take further risks when control is not with them. The government owns the banks and the position of the banks is not to like cryptocurrencies at all which always makes them lose the profits from the taxes created. The habit of escaping taxes to crypto is the only thing that has until now been the reason why CBDC was created.",

My question is if the government legalize cryptocurrencies are means of payment, what will be the implications on the global economy?Due to the nature of cryptocurrency as being volatile, It’s very to get even a slightest approval for crypto to become a legal tender. Only few country do this and the most popular was El Salvador which didn’t go well because there people protest about there leader moves that result to huge loss of there countries funds. The government wouldn’t allow this to happened because this will change the global economy and will make fiat less use since people will choose the currency with limited supply over fiat that is probe to inflation.",

Legalizing crypto as payment are impossible since it need Bitcoin is successfully legalized in the entire countries, this will attract other countries plan to accept other coins. But sooner or later when one of coins they've accepted but become scam, anyone will realized only Bitcoin is a coin which never scam or manipulated.I'd say it's high likely Bitcoin will be accepted in most of countries as a payment alternative in the future, but not with the other cryptos including Ethereum.",

My question is if the government legalize cryptocurrencies are means of payment, what will be the implications on the global economy?Even if a government legalizes cryptocurrency, they will not promote it. They will only focus on their own fiat. Also they will most probably create a separate tax class for cryptos and then impose heavy taxes on it. Overall, a government will never encourage its citizens to use an alternative currency over their own currency. Exceptions are there but that will remain as an exception only. So with such things and no government backing, bitcoin will never be able to become a favorite payment method. To be honest, bitcoin is a bad payment method. Better alternatives are available. So it will stay as a trader's asset or investment largely.",

If the government of one country legalizes bitcoin, it will have no effect. But there are also details here: we are talking about small and weak countries, like El Salvador, changes in which have no effect on the rest of the world. The picture is completely different if bitcoin is legalized in an influential country like the United States and China. The consequences will be colossal. The catch is that strong countries are very reluctant to move in the direction of bitcoin adoption, in contrast to, for example, El Salvador, which took such a step not from the best life.",

What we should realize is that corruption happens in ALL governments, some people think it is only their own nation but it is in EVERY government, some do it big, some do it small but they all do it. That means taxes are very important. Because, the more taxes are paid, the more they could get rich while still managing to keep some sort of infrastructure of the nation as well.So, if there is 10 billion paid and 2 billion pocketed while 8 billion is used for the nation, if you do 12 billion then you get 10 billion all spent, and 2 billion still pocketed. That's why crypto is probably loved by many nations.",
