I would not be surprised if that was the case though, that is how politics work, unfortunately, it is a part of the current society full of hypocrisy and lies.It reminds me a bit what happened during the crisis of Soviet weapons in Cuba, It was okey for the western allies to have weapons in Turkey (very close to the Soviet union), however, it was not acceptable for the Soviet Union to arm Cuba, which was very close to the continental United States. Sincerely, I think Turkey may be one of the most eccentric NATO members.",

We could argue that those which are not easy to manipulate by the Mossad are attacked or ignored by mainstream media, so cannot be chosen by the masses, but that would also imply the Mossad has control over all mainstream media in the United States.",

The joke is over.I don't care who is involved the bottom line is that nobody deserves to die if he is innocent of the crime. In most cases, more civilians die in this conflict than even the militants. Ankara has claimed that it has neutralized 58 Kurdish militants but if you closely investigate you will unveil that many of the victims are civilians. Hama killed about 1,400 Israelis most of them innocent civilians and civilians in Gaza don't deserve to die that is why Israel should cease fire. Also, the civilians in northern Syria deserve to live and not be killed like chickens. I don't think we should compare the killings of civilians to the actions of politicians. Joe Biden and Â Tayyip Erdogan are playing politics with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militia and the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia. We don't want killings anywhere in the world because humans are equal and civilians should not suffer the consequences of the military Rules of engagement should respected.",
