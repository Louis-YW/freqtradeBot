The same media cheering raids on Trump's house for the same \"crime\" are strangely silent this time.

But this is not the case in most countries because each government would always want to influence these agencies so that they can be shielded from all forms of investigation and even prosecution. I don't think we have to expect the police to raid or investigate the various crimes of Joe Biden and his son Hunter until the president leaves office. An investigation would be carried out swiftly if he is succeeded by a Republican. But a democrat would keep on covering the crimes of the Bidens'. Political associates, friends, and cronies would always hail the president because of the financial gains they get from these hypocritical actions. I also think we shouldn't feel the Bidens are guilty until they are convicted by a court.",

However, where is the FBI? And where is the Judicial working on some investigation. Why is Congress not stirring itself up to for a 25th Amendment action, or some other, and really quickly?Sure the media talked about it some. But what is happening to investigate what is really going on?With today's technology and communications, Biden has been, with his son, doing way more\"evil\" against our country than any other president could have. Why isn't somebody in authority making more noise about this and a bunch of things that the Biden crime family has done, and still is doing?And Obama was in on it.",

Now he is fighting against the people who stole it... since nobody is prosecuting him or Joe for their crimes.And, what a joke a raid on Biden's home. I mean, tell Biden that you have found all kinds of classified documents on his property, and then do a raid a month later? Lol.Hunter Biden admits ownership of “laptop from hell,” requests federal probe for data thefthttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-02-07-hunter-biden-admits-ownership-laptop-from-hell.htmlPresidential son Hunter Biden has effectively admitted that he is the owner of the infamous “laptop from hell” as he requested a federal investigation over possible data theft.“Hunter’s admitting that the laptop data is his. Because otherwise, if you’re suing someone for having data that’s not yours, how do you have standing? So the only way you could possibly have standing, Hunter, is if the laptop itself is yours,”Dan Radiostyle pointed out during a recent episode of the “On The Fringe” podcast, citing an article from 100 Percent Fed Up about the matter.According to the article, Hunter’s counsel Abbe Lowell asked the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate former President Donald Trump and his allies for stealing the laptop’s data and publicizing it ahead of the 2020 presidential elections. He also requested a probe on former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, former New York City Mayor and Trump’s counsel Rudy Giuliani, Giuliani’s lawyer Robert Costello and Wilmington, Delaware computer repair shop owner John Paul Mac Isaac.Isaac backed up a copy of the data in the laptop’s hard drive per standard operating procedure for laptop repairs back in 2019. He sent a copy of the data to Costello, who then passed it on to Giuliani. The former mayor of the Big Apple then shared the data to both Bannon and the New York Post.Lowell claimed the presidential son did not consent to his personal information being shared, writing in one letter to government authorities: “This failed dirty political trick directly resulted in the exposure, exploitation and manipulation of [Hunter’s] private and personal information. Politicians and the news media have used this unlawfully accessed, copied, distributed and manipulated data to distort the truth and cause harm.”Meanwhile, Giuliani’s adviser Ted Goodman commented in response to the requests for investigation: “The work order is as clear as it can be. The laptop became abandoned property under Isaac’s control.” He added that the laptop “reveals 30 years of corruption by the Biden crime family.” (Related: Video: Greenwald slams Hunter Biden laptop coverup as “biggest media fraud” in a decade.)FBI found nothing in a scheduled “raid” of Biden’s home...",
