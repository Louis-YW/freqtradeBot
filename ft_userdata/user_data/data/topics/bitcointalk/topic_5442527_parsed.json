But who are the DT1 members? Who is on the trust list of theymos? But I see theymos is also a DT1! I would be very happy if someone could kindly explain it to me. And kindly give advice on how a member can become a DT1 or DT2 member I know it's  very hard to become those positions However, some initial steps were suggested.-",

You are wrong. For being a DT2 member, you need to be in the trust list of a DT1 member and don't have more DT1 exclusions than DT1 inclusions. Having a positive or negative feedback doesn't matter at all. Quote from: Perfectos on March 04, 2023, 06:08:56 PMBut who are the DT1 members? Who is on the trust list of theymos?

If you are on DT1 or any of the DT2 lists, you are on \"DefaultTrust\" which is the default trust system every account starts off with. However, every member on the forum has the option to exclude/include anyone from their own individualized trust list. But by default, everyone starts off trusting DT1 and DT2 members.",

So, one who desires to be on DT should be able to give good give feedbacks and follow them up, to know when to reevaluate them.The trust system is not one that you deliberately try to get into, as this could cause you to give out wrong feedbacks. Do not chase being on default trust, just act naturally and try to improve the forum experience.",
