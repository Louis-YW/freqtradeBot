Thank you very much for your answer.

But I'm trying to keep it organized so that other beginners can easily find the answers if they have the same questions.And I can also find myself in the answers that will be well arranged too",

So, if you have multiple questions that pertain to related topics, it's preferable to ask them one by one within the same topic rather than creating a new thread for each question.For instance, let's say I just replied to your second topic, and now I want to reference it. It is not convenient to do so without opening that topic in a new window and manually searching for the relevant parts in the post. On the other hand, I can easily include quotes from other posts within this thread, making it more seamless and accessible to refer back to previous discussions. I hope you understand what I mean.",

Thank you very much for your answer. (I have problems to install electrum, despite all the good advice, but I'm not very good I think ...)Sparrow wallet is a good open source alternative, and I think it works just fine in combination with Bitbox and other hardware wallets.https://sparrowwallet.com/",
