  "content": "It’s truly upsetting how these scammers operate without any sense of morality, even targeting individuals dealing with serious health challenges. But before we proceed, let's define first what is a Parkinson's disease...QuoteParkinson's disease is a movement disorder of the nervous system that worsens over time. The nervous system is a network of nerve cells that controls many parts of the body, including movement.So there it is, and it might get worse over time, especially since the victim is already 77 years old. Based on reports, elderly people are particularly vulnerable, they’re not tech-savvy and are often looking for opportunities to invest and grow their money. Others are scammed by people pretending to be authorities offering to “protect” their funds, which is exactly what happened in this case.Here’s the full story... https://nypost.com/2024/11/13/us-news/oklahoma-woman-with-parkinsons-disease-duped-out-of-20000-in-bitcoin-scam/QuoteAn elderly Oklahoma woman stricken with Parkinson’s Disease lost $20,000 in a cryptocurrency ploy that was crafted as a scam within a scam, according to her daughter.Jamie Moore, the daughter of 77-year-old scam victim Marsha, knew that a swindler had tried to reach out to her mother when she received an odd email about a Bitcoin transaction being finalized.“I received a text from my mom that said, ‘Jamie, I think I’m being scammed’ and I said, ‘Don’t fall for it, I get those emails all the time,’” Moore told KFOR.It was supposed to be smooth sailing from there since the duo had recognized the fraud.Then Marsha, who has Parkinson’s and Multiple Myeloma, reached out to the number listed in the phony email, looking for some clarity.She told the person on the other end that she had never made a Bitcoin purchase.The scammer, pretending to be a federal agent, told Marsha that her identity had been stolen and that she needed to make a withdrawal from her bank account to protect her money. He also told her to keep the situation a secret, including her daughter.“She was on the phone for probably five hours, he stayed on the phone with her,” Jamie said.Marsha followed the grifter’s instructions and made her way to the bank, where she even lied to the teller in order to justify the hefty $20,000 withdrawal.“She had been coached by this ‘FBI guy’ not to trust anybody and told the teller that she was having her house remodeled and she needed $20,000 — wiped out her entire savings account,” Jamie said.From there, the scammer told her to go to a liquor store 45 minutes away in Ponca City, Okla. to deposit her savings into a Bitcoin ATM.It wasn’t until Marsha had completed the transaction that she realized she had been duped.“I never thought it would happen to us and she’s humiliated, she’s embarrassed, she’s doubting her choices and she’s a smart woman, she’s bright and so it’s heartbreaking,” Jamie said.The family filed a police report, but there is little hope that Marsha will get her savings back.",

So when the person pretending to be an FBI agent told her to keep it secret, she agreed. In short, that call made her lose trust in her bank and instead trust the stranger on the phone, who was likely very convincing, as scammers often are. It’s almost like she was hypnotized.These scammers really are experts at what they do so elderly individuals or those unfamiliar with these types of scams are easy targets. It’s a sad story, really. That’s why we can’t blame the government for enforcing strict KYC regulations as they’re necessary to improve the chances of tracing and stopping the people behind these scams.",

These guys are driven by greed and an uncontrollable quest for money. They don't care if their victims will starve or even commit suicide after the scam. It's unfortunate that the elderly are prone to these scams. Children should always be in contact with their patients. However, the problem sometimes is that some of the elderly think that they are smart and can handle issues.

Why do you think scammers usually target people from that age group? It's because the success rate tends to be higher.

I have read and seen hundreds of such stories of people above 60 or 70 getting scammed. The reason is simple and it is that things we understand are not right might not sound the same to them, especially if they are not very tech-savvy or have some sort of disease to support the scammers in their mission further.It's unfortunate, and shouldn't happen, but the harsh reality is, it will, with someone else from another state, or country.",

I wonder how people even enjoy stolen funds. $20K for a 77 years old is never a small amount, assuming that she had long retired from whatever job that she was into. From a general view, it's very bad to steal from others, regardless of the person's condition. It's quite disappointing to so many people are after success and wealth, but don't want to take the hard route. If at the end of the day, those funds ends up in a cex, then 5-8 years jail term awaits, which can even be more than.Quote from: SatoPrincess on November 17, 2024, 08:10:50 AMBitcoin is for everybody.
