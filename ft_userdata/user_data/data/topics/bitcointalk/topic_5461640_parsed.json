You talk say Nigeria na one of the poorest  country in Africa nd I go put wrong.I go only outline two major reasons Nigeria still dey like we be the poorest in Africa:1. Bad Government: This want no need too much explanation, everybody for this country dey face the consequences of bad government. If our government go use there head then realize there mistakes I go assure u say this country go change. We get all the resources wey even white men they envy us dey pray to get wetin Nigeria get so my brother na to remove bad government first then we go see the change.2. Secondly, Population size: Naija we too many inside, every body want born a dozen before dey go rest. In the whole Africa, Nigeria get the highest population where else we get bad government. If our resources no dey meet up the population inside this country then how we expect to progress and this na role every body suppose put hand to correct, e no bad to born children but make we try dey use birth control then also find way remove bad government",

Because eh dey very sad and disgraceful. But However, I just made a little research about this coup matter and I was made to understand that this coup is sponsored by the \"Wagner group\", the same people who organized the coup in Russia few weeks ago which led to the run-away of President Puttin, and now they are  experimenting same thing in Africa through the help of Niger soldier, whose sole aim we are yet to know. But from stories trending online, it seems the Niger soldiers claiming the coup is at a result of bad governance of this current administration inability to fight terrorism, corruption and provide a stable economy e.t.c. And I'm yet to see how this ends, but make they no bring any war come Nigeria oh.",

Because Niger is a French-speaking country with over 25 million population governed by president Mohamed Bazoum (who is been held hostage by it's military) unlike Nigeria which is an English-speaking country with over 144 million in population and governed by president Bola Ahmed Tinubu.",

As a matter of fact, the military leadership don already ban the export of uranium to France and this na major concern for France as uranium from Niger is used to power some of their nuclear power plants.Quote from: Riginac111 on August 01, 2023, 12:34:02 AMThe soldiers of niger dey sama warning dey give nigeria president make e comot in hand for the matter and they also sama warning give all the ecowas ( Economic Community of West Africa State) leaders for other countries in Africa, but our presido wey be Tinubu wey the chairman of ecowas say wetin in give niger soldiers na seven (7) days to release their president otherwise he will deploy soldiers for nigeria to go for war ( attack) for niger, na the soldiers of  niger come verse say they are waiting for nigeria. My brother, for this matter, Tinubu is between the devil and the deep blue sea. This is a major test for him to prove his power as the leader of ECOWAS and on the other hand, this fit scatter out own country because any war in Niger will enter Northern Nigeria. From wetin I dey observe self, good proportion of youths of the core North will fight for Niger against Nigeria because that is their country, tribe and kinsmen. Rumor has it that good number of Northern politicians have lineage to Niger. So the matter for hand, e heavy for mouth o.",

The coup has raised a lot of tension among many African countries and states, and many corrupt African leaders will be trying to ensure that they are not the next because they know that they are at risk with their bad governance.ECOWAS is not respected because the president of ECOWAS who is the current Nigerian president is still seen as an illegitimate president because of how he got into power. Soldiers have taken over because of how corrupt the leaders are in those countries and how they have subjected the people there to extreme poverty. I hope that Nigerian soldiers do not die unnecessarily for these same corrupt leaders that these people are trying to take out of power.",

This issue is just like a repeat of what used to happen back in the days when coup was how powerful leaders come into power. It might just have been that Niger were waiting for a new president to be crowned in the west African country, Nigeria. Funny enough, they weren't expecting the current president to take power and am sure its what motivated the coup to happen, because they simply were done with their state of living and commander change. This current president should tread carefully because as he thinks he took power and is the chairman of ECOWAS, other neighbor countries saw how he took power and now feels he is above and has the power to do as pleased. Make em focus on how to improve our economy abeg, it's not funny anymore I must say.",
