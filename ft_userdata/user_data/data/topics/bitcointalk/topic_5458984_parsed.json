      "body": "I’m not sure this thread is in the right section. This being a Bitcoin forum, things like web3 usually can not be found in the main sections of the forum. Your typically have to look to the altcoin section for this sort of thing, so perhaps if you aren’t getting the engagement you desired, you could attempt to make a thread somewhere there.",
