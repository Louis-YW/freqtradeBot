As for your question, we are not a crypto gateway. We will provide virtual Visa/Mastercard debit cards that can be loaded with USDT.Quote from: Pmalek on December 11, 2022, 09:43:32 AMI guess like with any other service, most people will want to know how much will this cost me and how big are the fees? Will the card only support USDT or can people load it with Bitcoin and some other coins? People aren't that fond of custodial services, but every product has its buyers. Good question! The first question, we will offer 2 type of cards. The first card has a spending limit of $2K/Monthly and will cost around $99/Yearly and the second card will have a spending limit of $5K/Monthly and will cost around $249/Yearly. Funding your card will cost around 3-4%. At this moment, we only have plans to support USDT/USDC because of the volatile crypto markets.",

The last thing I want to do is fire up a dusty old Guarda or Trust wallet just to exchange some TRC20 USDT. (I prefer the USDT uses ERC20 as Ezzocard does I only pay Bitcoin there though.)OP, make sure none of your cards are from Russia (or Belarus), because all hell is breaking loose in payment platforms for these cards.",

Maybe it's best if there was support for both network tokens. In that case you could use the Ethereum variant if you wanted to and someone else who doesn't mind those third-party wallets could use the Tron TRC20 version. The Tron tokens have become popular because they can be sent for free. Actually, if you have enough energy to burn in your Tron address. If not, you need some TRX to cover the transaction fees. The Ethereum variant, on the other hand, always requires gas. The ETH network fees have stabilized in recent times, but anyone who uses this network will remember how crazy they can be and how expensive. When it comes to 3rd-party control by the issuers, they are the same. Addresses can be blacklisted and tokens can be frozen on either of the two blockchains.",

      "body": "Well strangely the ANN thread is locked, but I made an agreement with CoinPayCard to post my review of their card, so I will put it here.I got a hold of the $99 Basic CoinPayCard, which has a $200 monthly spending limit and tried it out for a week. Here was my experience with that.First of all it is a virtual card so I wasn't expecting to be able to buy physical stuff it, so I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to link it to an eBay and Newegg account - although I did not attempt to buy anything with it on those sites, see below for why.My first purchase was a WinRAR license key (because I happen to be a huge nerd). I had set it to send me en email of the key, instead of any physical shipment. However, that order was declined. I'm not sure why, but the WinRAR people were manually processing that order. Hence why I decided not to buy anything on ecommerce sites.Though, I have successfully purchased a number of other stuff with it, using different payment processors:- Github Pro- Bootstrap Studio- a bunch of Udemy courses (this used Stripe)Note: I tried to top up my Vast.ai account with this card, but it was declined, even thoigh it also uses Stripe. That's probably because computing vendors have an anti-VCC policy, in general.So this card will work almost everywhere (except for cloud computing sites).I loaded the card using a P2P transfer of USDT and also using ChangeNOW, and did not encounter any problems. I really got my money's worth out of it and will definitely use it some more.",

But correct some merchants can block virtual cards, but 9 out of 10 they are blocking prepaid cards. So we are definitely fixing that in the coming days.",
