  "content": "I have a TX stuck, and seems the culprit is an INCOMING TX I got to my wallet.I was not aware of this incoming TX and spent an output that depends on that mysterious input. So my TX has 18vByte/Sat which is ok, but this weird 860 Sat TX has a large size and a fee of 6 Sat/ vByte and is unconfirmed.I have no idea where this is from, but here it is:https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/95e315f00b48201655877d8d86817748fe32b1d7d339c5a334dac28328a4c939so this TX has 79 receivers that all got 860 Sat and 6 Sat per Byte, and has been stuck for 3 days now.Effectively blocking 79 addresses with expenditure of0.00068022BTC (17.62USD) and Transaction fee 0.00018345BTC (4.75USD)...fun fact: I tried https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/ and the free service did not work bcs TX too large, and the paid service.....came up with a price tag of ..... 0.09BTC !!!!! $2100 to accelerate this TX!Can anyone make anything of this? Is this some kind of mapping attack with dust (like cpl years ago),Or is it a sabotage attempt to block as many wallets as possible?Anybody else finding themselves in this trap?This appears rather sinister...Because as a matter of fact, my TX as well as the rest of the funds in my wallet now seem to be effectively frozen...if this is is not the right place for this, please direct me there - I looked around but did not see anything about it",

      "body": "This seems to be a dust attack. I don't know the kind of wallet you are using but for wallets like Electrum. You could uncheck the option of spending unconfirmed coins.Sparrow wallet has an option of you selecting the UTXO's you want to spend. This can effectively enable you to spend coins without including the dust sats into your transaction inputs.AFAIK, right now there is nothing you can do, you just have to wait it out until the unconfirmed transaction finally get confirmed if the fee rate drops so which is likely hard to achieve or until the unconfirmed transactions get dropped out of the mempool.",

You can do this easily with Electrum if you are able to import your wallet to Electrum using either your seed phrase or a private key for that address. You should do this on an airgapped device for security reasons.Otherwise, at the effective fee rate of ~7.5 sats/vbyte, you are going to be waiting weeks for a confirmation.Quote from: nc50lc on September 13, 2023, 07:03:59 AMIt's nearing the bottom of mempools with default size setting.The parent transaction with a fee rate of 6 sats/vbyte will already have been dropped by default nodes, meaning OP's transaction will have been dropped as well. There are however an increasing number of nodes using non-default mempool settings, which is why we can still see OP's transaction on most block explorers and he can still see it in his wallet.",

Thank You so much Sir, this worked!!!I created a view only electrum wallet on another device, found the spurious dust TX, went through the servers, found one that listed this TX as 'local', deleted it from there, and was able to send (from another, secure rig) a small-ish TX with a beefy fee from another address to that my original address.Now my original child TX has disappeared, while the spurious dust TX is still pending, but I can send funds again!Hard to follow how this could work, but it did!Thank You!These two precursor TXs look interesting, they do seem to be some kind of consolidation protocol.The latter one that blocked my TX was someone spreading out a change TX over 79 other addresses (seemingly random),and the precursor to that one received 60 inputs with almost the same amounts, all from 3xy addresses - looks like some consolidation or intermingling going on ..Also, why would someone disperse Â 0.00086367 BTC - 22.38 USD of change, seemingly just to get rid of it?This is the precursor TX to the offending change dispersal: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/ba3c96897174501fec909952ae590176b9211f2a3ae4d3b844fcc26a474756bcI am not that much of a blockchain sleuth, but it sure looks weird...So if the sender does not up the fee a bit it will bounce sooner or later, and to what purpose was it sent then?Was this done specifically to bounce eventually?Or a SPAM attack on BTC with underfunded TXs that are meant to bloat the mempool?",

Eventually the mempool clears because you cannot keep creating spam at this rate forever, and all of the transactions get processed, making the whole attack useless.",
