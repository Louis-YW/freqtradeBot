But I would have preferred it more in only English. I knew most people will choose both at the time and I also went for what people would have chosen. I do not think we need any other vote, the local board has been created already and we accepted both English and Pidgin. I see those that will come up with only Pdgin suggestion to be biased or to be newbies because we all know how things are in Nigeria. I can give more evidences that Nigeria supoort more English officially. It is English that unified us. If not English, we would not be here.The people that are coming should respect what other people have rules for before, not to come with their own ideas that we have discussed before.

You even send our board rules 2 merits.You apply to be a merit source, first thing you have to understand is that you don't send merit just because you agree with a post, I might have agreed to the post or not but the meriting is done to highlight a quality posts. How many where we when we got the local board, just few people shouldn't expect to make a law that govern everybody and expect them to accept it. Even the constitution get adjusted when deem fits. You can't silence the new members because you feel they should respect decision that was made when they didn't have a voice and just few people came together Â to make it at the time when there wasn't a big representation of the people.In the future if a change in rules is deem fit a vote will be recall because at a point people will want to write in their local language that isn't english or pidgin and you can't deny then that privilege because it's a local board. In the future we might have other subboard that isn't in English (strictly for other dialects). You can't stamp on we not needing other vote and neither can the people present today say that because tomorrow things might change. I voted English and Pidgin as well because that's what the board needed back then but it mightn't be want we need in future (but we can't say that until it's the future). The rules isn't changing now but nobody can say it won't in the future, change is constant and as humans we have to be reasonable to accept change. Quote from: Charles-Tim on August 08, 2023, 11:59:52 AMThis is off-topic to merit source application. This is not silencing anyone. One of the things you don't do as to opposing been a dictator is to force people to accept what you feel is best for them. And secondly, meriting a posts doesn't mean you agree to what the post is saying as an aspiring merit source for the local board, you should take note of that and not use it in an argument to validate your point. PS: The forum is centralized and not decentralized like Bitcoin that you think should maintain its 21 million supply. Quote from: Charles-Tim on August 08, 2023, 12:09:42 PMDictatorship? Remember you have once deleted my post in English on local thread before we cast the vote. You are more inclined to Pidgin which what many people went against.You sounding like one while calling me one, then we had an agreement that post should be only pidgin but you opposed it and now you don't want others to opposed your opinion?",

He suddenly changed one day that Brainboss messaged him to be posting in Pidgin. I do not care if anyone believe this or not.I still want the board to be in pidgin and I'm not hiding that fact (but the community has the final say that's why pidgin and English got my vote), they were many people that wanted pidgin as well but the main reason we considered English was because many people wrote me about you not been able to speak pidgin very well and it's mostly because of you that many people finally accept English if not we were all okay with Pidgin. They gave me reasons and I so sense because then you were one of the most active user and only pidgin means you'll lose interest in the board. If you're not been a dictator now (like you accused me of been when I insisted of pidgin been the official language to make us unique then), you'll let people air their opinion when the time comes. Me meriting dat ur friend just shows that even though I wasn't in support of English I still merited his quality contributions when I saw them. As I have said there's nothing constant on the board, when the need for a change comes in the future we'll not suppress that voice and we'll let it to a vote any opinions that wins that time between the three options will get implemented. You're quick to call someone a dictator when the decision doesn't favor you but feeling like you're not one when you don't want people to air their opinion. We shouldn't shut anybody from airing their opinion, just dat nothing is changing now but in the future things might depending on the community feedback (but we wait until then).Quote from: Charles-Tim on August 08, 2023, 12:52:05 PMI like that theymos did not choose a moderator for this board.

As e dey hard for other local boards to write with English I know no why e come dey too easy for we 9ja (aje-pako) to write broken bottles (pidgin), if we check my local board posts I dey always use pidgin write because e too easy to flow, even if English dey e no go pass one, imagine say as you dey write with pidgin you dey get more lines.",
