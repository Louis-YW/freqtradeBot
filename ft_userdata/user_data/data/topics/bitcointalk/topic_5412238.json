Bitcoin certainly hasn't gone anywhere close to the way eth did with transaction fees either (so I barely noticed the fees when they were high).",

I remember last bear market fees got down to the 5-10 cent range. Not too far from there at this point.There are many altcoiners whose main narrative is that bitcoin is expensive to use, just to divert people's eyes from the fact their supported coins are copycat shitcois or useless forks.Quote from: thecodebear on September 03, 2022, 03:48:45 PMI paid a 0.0063% fee on my transaction!

Meanwhile whenever I go fill up on gas I'm getting charged about 2.9% extra for using a credit card....ahhh legacy systems!The tx fee is completely unrelated to how many coins you send. It's related to the size (in bytes) of the tx, which comes from number of inputs, number of outputs, the type of address you use (SegWit is cheaper) and obviously how much you're in hurry / how much you want to overpay for speed.Don't take me wrong, I'm happy you've discovered that bitcoin is not expensive to use. I simply want to point out that you still have a lot to learn",

Usually I use trustwallet for receiving bitcoin payment transaction and taking about under $0.2 on every transaction fees. I think most cheapest fees when you use with segwit network for sending bitcoin, but never have choose if you sent bitcoin trough exchange market because all exchange have limited bigger amount for bitcoin sending fees except with FTX exchange market have lower fees for sending bitcoin. But you can adopt with lightening network sending bitcoin fund without have to pay fees but include with the same exchange between receiver and sender of bitcoin.",

Last time I sent a transaction when fees were higher about a year ago I paid a 0.001% fee (but that was me moving most of my bitcoin). Transaction fee doesn't depend on the amount of bitcoin you send. So, it doesn't make sense to measure it based on a percentage of the amount you send. Transaction fee depends on the the size of the transaction and the fee rate. Transaction size depends on number of inputs and outputs and their types. The fee rate is determined by the sender and can be set it at any amount higher than minimum relay fee which is usually 1 sat. If you paid high fee, there are following scenarios:1. You set the fee rate by yourself and set it to an amount more than required. 2. The fee rate was set by your wallet automatically and your wallet didn't estimate the required fee rate well.3. You made the transaction when the network was busy and your wallet set the fee rate to a big amount. 4. Your transaction included big number of inputs or/and outputs.",

This leads to few transactions made for both BTC and ETH and as less transactions so the blockchain becomes more free or less crowded to complete the transactions. Hence the transaction fees for the blockchain also becomes less.In case of BTC earlier the tx fees were also not high, I mean it was taking a bit longer but yes the fees were pretty normal, so whether it’s bear market or not, if you don’t want your coins in urgent, then the fees will seem fine to you everytime.",

We can't know if this is the cheapest fee you could have paid just by knowing the total fee in dollar or sats. We need to know the size of the transaction or the fee rate (sat/vByte). In your example, 38 cents or 1921 sats can be seen as high fee if we are talking, for example, about a segwit transaction with 1 input and 1 or 2 outputs.But, you are right. Right now, 1 sat/vByte is more than enough for your transaction to get included in the very next block. This is the perfect time for inputs consolidation.",
