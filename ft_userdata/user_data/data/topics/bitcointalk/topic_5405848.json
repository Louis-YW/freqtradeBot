I don't use preev, but Google's price ticker for BTC is actually just using Coinbase's price internally (same for all cryptocurrencies).

Why use preev?  How is that price even created? is it from binance, coinbase, a mix of many exchanges?Coinmarketcap price is way more transparent and much better IMO.What does preev even mean? lol",

That alone, answers your question on why preev is important to many users here. I too use that other method you provide but what I type is \"btc usd\".It will then show me the btc price. I think this trick only works with btc but for other coins, you will still need to visit one of the results that you see in your screen before you see the value of that crypto you are looking for. This is why having something like preev can come in handy. We can just bookmark it in our browser and that can save us a lot of time and effort.Another good alternative to preev can be this > https://coinval.co",

Definitely not in 2022, but if you've got it bookmarked like I do, it's quicker than doing a Google search or having some other site that displays the price bookmarked, because preev's only purpose is to do just that, and it's a very simple and unbloated site.  Besides, at this point it's a bit of a nostalgia thing for me.  I've been using the site for years.  And remember, it's only been in the last few years that you could find bitcoin's price shown on tons of financial websites.  That didn't used to be the case.OK, thanks for the replies.  Gonna lock it up now.",
