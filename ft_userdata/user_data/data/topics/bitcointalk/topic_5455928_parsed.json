Are you talking about marriage? Economy? Or are you trying to point out similarities between economy and marriage.Let's recap on what is marriage based on a definition given by a oxford dictionary\"the legal relationship between a husband and wife.\"and the definition of business in a oxford dictionary\"the activity of making, buying, selling or supplying goods or services for money.\"both marriage and business has totally ZERO similiarity in this context. However to save the business or marriage, it is not easy, I'm talking about saving a collapsing multi billions dollars worth of business, it is not a one person problem anymore, who is capable to fix a billions dollar problem alone? Is it even possible?",

For some business like you see not all is good for bailout and trying to continue bailing out will lead you to bankrupt.

If a business owner has a problem with a colleague, they should sit down together, try to solve it together and find a solution.But marriage and business are not the same thing and they are different. Business is how we can take advantage and develop the business to be bigger. At the same time, marriage is how we can maintain a good husband and wife relationship until we die later.So even though marriage is a problem for everyone, we must be able to find a solution so that we don't separate and can still maintain the marriage. It's about maintaining that relationship well and having children who will pass on what we teach them.",

Let's be honest we need the products they provided, we gotta save them, it is cost effective to save a failing but established business.Quote...you can move on... have to move not to stay...better days ahead...moving on in business, just goes broke and liquidate the bad business... but moving on in marriage, mean dump the relationship and breakup?

Obviously there is HUGE mistake to be found here.Quote...when big businesses fail there are many people affected,...when a marriage fails...This is some very interesting observations too. Yup, when they both failed, it's damages would ripple through the surrounding. When a powercut, the entire city goes into darkness, and everybody has no access to power, they couldn't live their comfort life any longer.",

Subscribing for such an asset pushes the man to have sex more than he should and it also sets some men backward. A famous saying; if you want to be happy for a month get married, and if you want to be happy forever, become a priest. I don't know how marriage looks like, not married. But, I see it as boring, nothing special seeing same person everyday for years. The value diminishes, as the wedding ring wears off.",

Although they are similiar, but one should not easily confuse the two terms.Quote...bad business practice... where paying for subscription make more sense... loses its value over time...that is very absurd, but hold some truth. There is nothing we can literally do when the life itself is as bold as it can be, every life goes through the same life cycle, and gender too has the same gender life cycle. Although I dislike people who prejudge the value of everything based on \"value goes up\", but it does make perfect financial sense and make money too. War is bad but war is profitable, making weapon is profitable. The reverse is true too, making the point of trying to make progress or trying to build is itself a losing endeavor, because it is profitable the rich people keep doing its dirty job, to make sure they are the rich, and getting even richer. Renting instead of marriage make financial sense, surrogacy make financial sense, it is absurd, it has no moral compass, but it make perfect financial sense.But what can we do about it? There is nothing can be done. Whether go poor trying to change or do nothing and not getting poorer, of course every change must come with heavy protest. And the change would also benefit only the person who have their own selfish interest and they would even sponsor the change themselves with financial aid.Quote from: robelneo on April 24, 2023, 02:45:11 PM...the thread is about marriage but... the title should be Marriage and Business...well, the main objective of the title is to express it is a huge problem, and the problem would require everybody else hardwork to trying to save it, the problem is too big to failed, it have to be bailout, because a failure would lead to undesirable consequence, it could mean total carnage, big crisis!Quote...and marriage should not be a concern of everybody but family members only...that is exactly what is decided in the legal system, family members must fix the problems itself, doesn't matter their capabilites. Not until the system begin to collapse, when the family members also could not save it anymore, because the problem have grown into multi billions dollar problem.Quote from: Accardo on April 24, 2023, 02:45:11 PM...Subscribing for such an asset pushes the man to have...What can I say about it? It is all convenient, the legal system even legalize the services, everybody would take full advantages of the convenient, due to it being very convenient, boomer begin to abuse it, make it a national sport, to see who could be the champion in abusing this convenient, but not knowingly the convenient also come with moral crisis later, that would be the zoomer who is gonna face the crisis themselves, the zoomer are gonna pay the price of the convenient enjoyed by the boomer.

Marriage is a relationship between two humans who love each other, and their relationship is bound by the name of marriage which continues to be a family. So it is certain that after a couple is married, all aspects of life such as economic problems, attitudes towards each other, and other problems, of course the couple must be able to solve them, because indeed that is the obligation of a married couple. So the point is to be more mutually responsible for all the problems that exist in the household ark. So in my opinion a marriage has nothing to do with all nations or a country, even though a marriage is definitely registered in all governments of every country, but in terms of married life itself, it is the husband and wife who play the most important role.",
