The words should go with pictures ICONs. And this what I can say for now. Do well and progress in the forum.",

As a brand new account you have restrictions on posting image and posting links [if I am not wrong]. Buying a copper membership will unlock the restrictions. It does not cost much by the way.

But with what I have access from the site,  I can say that the casino is a good raising new platform that has a lot to offer to the overall gambling industry.",

After couple of months that you haven't touched it, they will forfeit, according to their terms.So for new players, much better if you will browse their terms before depositing on their site.Their wagering requirement is 50x if you will get your free credit bonus and they have cap of how much you can withdraw from your winnings.",

      "body": "I take a quick look at the site and want to consider testing the waters there with the use of free coupon.The reason is just simply, my favorite game providers at our local online casinos are present there, KA Gaming and CQ9 Gaming, but unfortunately, the lucky games that I specifically want at both game providers are not present there, King of Dragons (KA) and 5 God Beast (CQ9).Anyways, on the withdrawal page, the option is only limited to USD and EURO but the required field is asking for a \"Wallet Address\" (I assume crypto wallet, right?). Basically, the withdrawal amount that is seen in either USD or EURO value will be converted automatically to crypto once withdrawn. Is this right? The withdrawal field should be fixed as there are lots of cryptos. The supported currencies for crypto withdrawals should be clearly seen there. P.S. Is the site functioning as live now or it's still on a test run? There are lots of errors in most games. I'm smell something unusual hmmm.",

In previous review it also looked weird winning the $900 jackpot (due to machine failure), but instead of fixing bugs or canceling wins, support asked him to deposit more.Looks fishy considering this is still the beginning of the promotion",

So will you be entitled to withdraw both your deposit and your bonus if at all you send them the deposit? In any case, IMO I won't have to send such deposit to claim a bonus even if it is in their ToS.",
