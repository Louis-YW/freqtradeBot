Bounty is like you are chasing peanuts when you can just be patient to build up your account and yourself in the forum. From my own view,I can see that you only have ten merits...if you can abandon your account and register a new one to start learning with. This will be better because I guess that your account has been noticed by reputable and generous merit givers in the forum,this might slow your quick growth in the forum. Like you said,you have been here for a while a would be able to earn for merit easily if you register a new account. Just my own suggestion.",

Actually nothing is wrong enrolling urself with bounties but it doesn't pay that much anymore unlike before back then 2017 I believe and is been a long time I focused on partaking in such activities anymore.Then back to your post history, I don't think you should delete them because I believe they are there for a reason because you would also likely to share your experience in time to come with other beginners while giving them advise just as we have been doing so far. If there are reflection you would tell them to take a look at your profile maybe they would learn new things from your profile. However those people who started before now some of them where bounty hunters then upgraded themselves to be more productive and useful to the forum.",

Bounty no bad entirely but make I give you wan secret always delete your reports and application after stakes are updated for that week or campaign has ended.Always keep your profile clean, plenty merit wey I get wen I just dey start to dey grow my account come from reviews and I no request for am self because back then request for review wasn't a thing. As people see me say I dey try dem go look my profile and na so I use dey get merits wey I no plan for self. Keep your posting record clean and change your boards of writing. E get some boards wey be say na waste of time to write because merits no dey flow there or better merits fit no come out like Altcoins and gambling board.
