      "body": "I'm curious about the response of US users as more and more top exchanges are sued, instead of the authorities wanting to protect them, instead they feel increasingly restricted in this business space.Of the exchanges that I have used years ago, on average they don't have a US license and don't even serve US users even though the market potential is actually very good. Are the licensing requirements there that strict (or expensive)?",

They have a international license from the Seychelles, and for a while they have been operating under it. at first they were not strict because it is small and it works in trading cryptocurrencies, not cash. they allow withdrawals under the money laundering limits, which are often 10k dollars, but I think that the mistake they made is that they did not ban members from the United States, so if they wanted to comply, they had to either obtain a license or leave the US market and pay the fine or settle.",
