A woman was accused of killing her husband, his body was never found and she was sentenced. Years after serving her jail term, she found out the man is living with another woman.Being the wife and the first person to be suspected, they have no right to jail her without having any concrete reason that serves as an evidence, there are maby cases of disappearance whereby after along while they discover the lost was not dead but only missing and some got found at the end of it, there could be many reasons to what led to his disappearance and except they have a cognit reason to proof that the wife is behind the incident then it's very wrong to sentence her.Quote from: Victan22 on July 07, 2023, 02:27:02 PMShe went and shot the man several times and he died for real this time around and she was re-arrested for the same murder on the same person.In doing this, she does not only qualify for a jail terms, she should also taste dead as the same experience on her just as she later did to her husband, which means there might be serious dispute that led to the disappearance at first and later after the discovery of the husband being alive, the wife must have gone so far in some dealings that could go wrong as against the wish of her husband and the only way she will want her secrets not to get exposed is to kill him, but she would have thought about appealing as well.Quote from: Victan22 on July 07, 2023, 02:27:02 PMAs a judge what will you do ?The will also taste death, after which we have gone through a recap of the whole story and what transpired that led to the man's disappearance, but the judge also have little fault as mistake in this, she deserves not to be sentenced from the first place, maybe they may have mercy on her by giving her a lifetime imprisonment in compensation for the first jail terms she received.",

She was erroneously convicted when she had not committed the crime and now that she committed it, she didn't cause the first conviction, probably the prosecution and judges were hasty to do due diligence on the case. So she should be free.",

This is why you never leave it up to the court by designating an attorney to fight for you.Whomever is written on the indictment is the one who is accusing you. Much of the time it is an artificial entity, like a government or county or city, that is indicting you. Require them to get on the stand in their person so that you can question them. They can't do it because they are paperwork. Your attorney won't/can't require this of them, but you can if you don't have an attorney.If the prosecutor tries to force the indictment without the accuser getting on the stand, then require that the prosecuting attorney get on the stand. Then ask him what first-hand-knowledge/personal-eye-witness-admittance he is going to testify to. He can't. He wasn't there. If you have an attorney, yourself, he will never demand these things of the court.If you let the court decide by having an attorney, yourself, you lose if they decide to let you lose. You have essentially shot yourself in the foot. It's your fault.Marc Stevens Confronting Scottsdale City Council - Where's the Evidence Your Laws Apply? - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi4XDTyeHqA.",

But the woman was really wrong in her actions; she should not have taken power into her own hands. There were other ways she could have sought justice. For example, If I were her, I would just drag him to court again and demand he pay for some emotional damage he has caused me, and any amount I require is what he will pay me. Or, I will request that he go to jail and serve for all those years I also spent there.That's why it's always advised that we never be ruled by anger. I damn hate the action the woman took; by the way, who knows if she's done something bad (a bad habit), which was the reason the man disappeared? Her actions said it all.Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",

Over to youIn my personal view, the first case that befell the woman, it was a slander, which made the woman languish in prison. Then for the second case, maybe the woman is angry with her husband, because with the past events, this has put her in prison (slander). Therefore the woman shot the man or her husband and finally the man died. So in conclusion, the two cases cannot be combined from a legal perspective. Because the time and place are different. But if the case is seen from the personal problems of the man and woman, it is clearly related. But if legally it is not related. So if the woman is arrested again, I think it's only fair. Because maybe in the first case it is a slander for the woman. But in this second case, the woman clearly committed a crime by shooting her husband.",

Over to youThis sound funny but although it’s not as this is a case of murder. If I was a lawyer, I would have set her free this time around since she already served the term for the murder she was accused of earlier. The case of the recent and proven murder should be served by the judge who has sent her for murder the first place without having a proof of that. With this, he’ll try to be more careful in the future when given verdict for a case of murder. Thousands of people suffer for crimes they never committed and the world turn blind eyes on that since they’ve no one to stand for them.
