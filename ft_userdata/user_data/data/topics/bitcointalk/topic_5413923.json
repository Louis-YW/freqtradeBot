Look on bitcoin, it doesnt have much dapps or any use case aside from being traded, and store of value but still its number 1. Theres a lot of other projects with expandable and flexible features that those but they are yet to be beaten. Its not all about tech but also the mark they imprinted on community. They are famous enough that the competition on tech which is more advance are disregarded.",

      "body": "I'd say ethereum is as valuable as it is now because it has a large community of investors, one that is far greater than any other altcoin in the market, most of those altcoins that implement new features earlier than Ethereum are relatively unknown, and even if they have made a good implementation to their network, nobody talks about it, and thus if Ethereum makes that same move/implementation, it breaks the news, and thus most people erroneously think Ethereum was the first to make the implementation. But it is what it is, they have the trust of a large community, so these are the advantages they receive in return.",

Thinking about the learning process when you transition to a new kind of chain or project, it will consume time and there's the chance of having a hard time getting used to it. Its value will still reflect in the usage and I think a big amount of investors and developers are not ready for a change yet.",

IOTA used to have that kind of shills too but now they are all gone. I wonder why?  You are right that they bring out PoS like it is the world’s 8th wonder even though it has been around for years.People are looking for any news to pump their bags now. They don’t care if the news is good or bad. Anything will do and PoS is just that. It is just another nothingburger they are hyping up.",

Just look at doge. Yes, Ethereum is the first coin with a smart contract, it's like bitcoin. Bitcoin is regarded to be the creator of the crypto market, while Ethereum is regarded to be the creator of the altcoin market. Ethereum has been deeply imprinted on people's minds, it is the pioneer coin in altcoins, most trusted by many people. Like we compare bitcoin to gold, bitcoin is superior to gold in many ways but gold is a proven older asset so it is safer than bitcoin.",

This is a proof that once you lead the market at the early stage, you will get the respect of many and that's why ETH remains the top altcoins despite of many problems we have encountered especially with slow transactions and a higher fees. Yes, ETH got hyped by merging into POS network maybe because many sees a good update for this one since POW is not working good for ETH anymore. This is a long term plan for ETH that's why many are so optimistic about the possible result of this merge. We all have our own analysis with regards to this, and personally I'm also bullish on this.",

I think the impact will be different when the same thing have been applied to eth.Eth may be one step behind compared to those coins but that was before but now not anymore because eth have finally joined the bandwagon. Eth isn't overpriced yet but its current value is still lower compared to it's last year's price.",

Tech, even if it would be developed first by other chains is irrelevant without developers building with it and user base using it. And most of this tech is easy to adapt to eth anyway. Not everything but most. If there will be a superior chain that's not eth, using cutting edge tech that's hard implement to eth, developers slowly will move to it. But ETH has all the brainiacs and no other chain attracts as much geniuses so i woudn't hold by breath anyone beating eth any time soon.",
