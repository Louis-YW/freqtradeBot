  "content": "By anonymously I mean I don't want Ledger to get some data leak like in the past and have my personal address exposed. I was going to get a PO box and just ship it there, however according to Ledger, they ship by DHL and DHL will not ship to PO box. I can't ship to my work address.So I found some on Amazon. To avoid getting a fake/scam hardware wallet I was going to buy only from \"Sold by Ledger Official and Fulfilled by Amazon\". However how does this work exactly? Does it ship from Ledger directly to me, or does Ledger ship to Amazon and then Amazon ships it to me? Will Ledger know my shipping address? I don't care if Amazon knows because I am not worried about a data leak with Amazon, only Ledger.If anyone has any tips please let me know.",

You can use the destination address that belongs to your trusted colleague (the farther the radius, for example outside the city, the better). HW must be picked up physically, no more logistics delivery.",

      "body": "How about buying from some legit/authorized resellers of hardware wallets?For example on Trezor, Trezor got a resellers page from their website: https://trezor.io/resellersIt is categorized per country with some link to their website or online shop.I am not sure if these resellers will still need to submit the information of buyers to Trezor anymore after they bought the products from Trezor and resell it.Ledger also got a reseller page from their website: https://www.ledger.com/resellerP.S. Still be careful, you still can't guarantee 100% safe hardware wallets to these resellers even if they are listed officially on the website of these hardware wallet companies. As with other suggestions, the best is to buy directly from the company.",

It will be a temporary adress to receive your ledger and not linked to your real adress .I think that's a bit excessive, so a person won't go on holiday just to buy HW - and people usually stay on holiday for 1 or 2 weeks, and with all that you have to take into account the laws of the country you're staying in, customs and the time it takes to deliver the package to the desired address. In addition, if we are already traveling somewhere, why not check if there is an official seller there who has physical stores where HW can be bought for cash.I live in a tourist-oriented country, and HW can be bought in well-known IT equipment stores, as well as in several physical crypto exchanges - it can't be simpler than that.",

Some forum members also posted reviews on the hardware wallet section before, so you can scroll down there for a bit. Most of the time they show the packaging features so you can compare and see how it differed from yours. Some hardware also features a genuine verification program in their app, you can use that to make sure your device is genuine and not fake. For example, you can find the Ledger guide to do it here[2]. I'm pretty sure other wallets have that feature too so just check out their guide before you start using it. You can also reset it first to make sure before making a new wallet.[1] https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ledger-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-review[2] https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389367057-Is-my-Ledger-device-genuine-?docs=true",

Check on the list here: https://www.ledger.com/resellerFor me, I don't care how reputable a store is. You are not just trusting the store, but you are trusting all their supply chains and all the people who work for all the third parties which get the hardware wallet from Ledger to the store in question. Most hardware wallets (Ledger included) have buitl in protections against supply chain attacks, but I still wouldn't take the risk with my coins.
