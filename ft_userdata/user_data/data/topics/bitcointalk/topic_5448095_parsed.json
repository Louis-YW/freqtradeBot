It is used to create 3D graphics for many fields, especially video games and movies. Softimage® Face Robot® allows you to easily rig and animate life-like faces. It lets you quickly set up a face rig by taking you through several defined stages. Once you have a face rig, you can animate the facial controls with either mocap or keyframes, then sculpt and tune the facial tissue using tools that are specific to Face Robot, as well as standard Softimage ones. Because it’s quick to set up the face rig, you are free to spend your time perfecting your character’s emotions and facial expressions, thus delivering unforgettable performances. Life-like facial animation is one of the most difficult problems to solve in 3D, and one of the most important things to get right. Face Robot uses a soft tissue model of the human face that slides and deforms, which lets you work at a higher level of abstraction.Despite its expensive price, it is still the first choice of media businesses and advertising agencies around the globe.I'm selling the complete package including : TEMPLATES SETUP GUIDESAMPLEGUIDE ON HOW TO MAKE DAILY INCOME WITH SOFTIMAGE FACE ROBOTHOW TO SETUIP FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS EASILYAND MORE!!
