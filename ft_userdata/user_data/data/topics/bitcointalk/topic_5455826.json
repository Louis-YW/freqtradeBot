The only action that can be taken here is that if the scammer has a Bitcointalk account and there is clear evidence that he is really scamming then DT members can red tag that account as a scammer. But you only provided a twitter profile link of the person you complained against. There will be no effect here- You have left no clear evidence here- The person you are complaining about does not have a forum profile- You don't post any TxID that can be considered a clear proof- There is no evidence of the accused's wallet here- There is no story mentioned here, how you fell victim to the scam.So I think your report is completely baseless",

You should know that the easiest way to scam these days is to get the money in the form of crowdfunding and then run away with the collected money in the ICO and never look back to the project.Quote from: Z_MBFM on June 09, 2023, 11:10:46 AMThis forum does not judge scammers.

But you only provided a twitter profile link of the person you complained against. There will be no effect hereWell, i think that another reason to post this scam accusation is that the other people who wants or thinking to invest in this project can read this and are saved from this scam. Although nothing much would change, the scammers won't quit or become honest, the only thing is to give awareness of the people and remind them to be vigilant with these types of scams.",
