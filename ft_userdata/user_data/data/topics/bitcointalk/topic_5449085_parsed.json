  "content": "I'm selling 15£ Playstation Store gift cards. I have two of them, you can buy either one 15£ gift card or both of them. I bought them on Amazon.co.uk, so you have nothing to worry about, we can verify it.I will accept payments from Bitcoin and some altcoins, we can negotiate about that.We can deal this way: You pay me, then I deliver codes. Before that, if necessary, I can show you that codes are legit, transactions are legit, etc.If you want to use escrow, you have to pay the fees to the escrow. If you have gained trust on this forum, I may risk and send gift card first, it depends on the situation.If you want to deal with me, post here or PM me.",
