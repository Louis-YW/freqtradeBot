  "content": "I always love to discuss the economic status of our country, and since we don't have one, I just created this so we can discuss anything related to our Indian economy and how we are doing and everything else.SourceIn 2023, we cracked the top 5 countries in terms of overall GDP surpassing France and UK, now we are estimated to reach in the top 2023 list by 2023 if the GDP growth remains 8â€“9%, and likely we will be there as per the economic expert all over the world. SO how do you see this growth especially GDP growth is 7%, and we are the only country to have such high growth rate in all the list, and it shows that we are emerging economically in the world's arena.",

The way the ruling party which I feel will again be ruling for another 5 years has been treating crypto makes me wonder how illeterates these guys can be. Take a look at US, they have a SEC that is working as legal entity to run an extortion racket only against crypto exchanges. Have you ever thought why? Because they want to get their hands on untraceable money through the ETFs. This is why they are constantly after exchanges. In India you cannot do such a thing as we are true democracy that doesn't have a deep state as per my knowledge. What they can do is to come up with some regulations to control the market and make good money to boost the economy. Recently I came accross an article where they discussed how much TDS the Indian government lost because of their 1percent policy.",

To an extent the Indian exchange were largely to be blamed on thier own atrocious fees. As of now they are offering zero fees on trading, which for me is very late. The ruling party has made the situation more difficult when they realized cryptocurrency could become a game changer for them.

She said it in the Parliament while replying to a question asked by the opposition. Now, my question is do you guys think in the last 5 years India has made so much progress that a big number of Indians have been rooted in the middle class? My next question to you guys is, do you see changes happening around you in the last 5 years? My answer to both my questions starts with the first one. Yes, I have seen my housemaid asking me for more money for a few chores in the last five years. BTW, I have increased her monthly pay and I have seen her husband who is a small transport lorry driver buying a new one for his business. Her younger son is now studying in a private school and her elder one is studying engineering. Second question and my answer.There is a big change in infrastructure happening everywhere I go but the roads are still the same. Corruption has increased as I can see roads building today and after three months there would be digging done for pipes, cables, etc. What do guys have to say?",

Even if India reaches at the fifth position in the global economy list, you can easily see the GDP per capita is quite low. But at the same time, India houses the richest man in Asia. So the main problem for India is the wealth distribution. This huge amount of inquality needs to be solved first. With the current social structure and bureaucratic systems, it is never going to happen. Also India's population is very young compared to many other countries. The average age of the population is only 28. Can you understand what kind of social unrest will happen if this huge amount of population is not able to find a mean of living!

Do not always trust what the government says. India is still an under developed country and we have a long way to go. After reading your reply about GDP per capita being low I remembered an article that I came across some time back. Today, I had to search for that article once again to get the data provided by the government of India recently. The article that I am talking about was published in the month of October this year and talked in depth about the Indian economy and its projection. QuoteThe Indian economy is currently the world's fifth largest, with a size of $3.75 trillion. The per-capita income, as per the government data, stood at â‚¹98,374 in 2022-23. This is equivalent to around $1,183.According to the government of India, the per capita income has risen significantly. My question here is that they are coming up with data from the organized sector, whereas a big chunk of the working force in India is part of the unorganized sector. The division can be clearly seen if you see the laborers working on a construction site, why is the government not coming up with those figures?Â  There is big parity within the middle class in India which is of course the biggest class across the globe. The upper middle class might be earning good but the lower middle class is actually struggling to survive and there is nothing the government wants to do about this issue.",

A person with a family without a spouse working will not be able to make ends meet with 25k. I once asked one of Zomato's delivery guy how much he earns every month and the reason for him becoming a partner of Zomato. His answer made me realize how bad the economic condition is for some, he said he works in a shop for 10 hours as a salesman and at night he does the delivery job to make ends meet. He never disclosed to me the amount, he only said if I did not work at night then it would be bad for his family of 4.Slowly Indians are moving out from a socialist mentality to a capitalist mentality. With more and more people doing odd jobs to live a decent life in India. If it was 10 years back then no one could have imagined that such kind of odd jobs would be available for anyone. I mean you do not need to pass multiple layers of tests and interviews to get this kind of job. You only need a smartphone and a two-wheeler to become a delivery partner.",

Still then their jobs are not easy and often they face a number of problems. With customers who refuse to come out of their house when the delivery person has arrived and keep on wasting their time to random dogs who are owned by the customer who start barking and 1-star givers who blame the delivery person for the food price, these people have their share of stories to make.I never give less than 5stars to any delivery person - I have never yet faced a legitimate problem from their side either.But it is a job that need your daily time to be sacrificed. If you fall sick or your family members do, then its zero earning for the next few days or more. Its a constant hustle and that leads to more mental and physical burden = high burnout.",
