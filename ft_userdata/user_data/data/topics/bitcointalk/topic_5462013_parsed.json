I'm not a member of any other discussion forums anymore, but I believe you (and I do believe you're talking about other types of websites as well).  I guess there's a lot under the hood as far as search engines go, and I only understand enough about them to type in some words and hit enter.  Am I wrong in assuming that it's either difficult or a pain in the ass to create a functional internal search engine?  My further assumption that Theymos isn't a slacker and would have one running that didn't have members going to google instead is a valid one I think.  But then again, we've been waiting on that new forum software for years now.  In fact, the community has been actively joking about it for years, so I don't know which end is up if y'all know what I mean.",

Any change on the forum can potentially be abused, and if a user service (like Ninjastic.Space) can offer a similar service, at least that doesn't create an angle to abuse the forum.",

Creating a functional internal search engine can indeed be a real pain in the ass, especially when you're dealing with a large amount of text data to search, just like in the case of this forum. I bet TryNinja can give you a much better explanation and shed light on the issues he encountered, which eventually led them to implement an Elasticsearch search engine. While ninjastic.space does a great job at searching posts, the catch is that it only works with archived (original) posts, not the real-time forum database.",

The search on the other hand is by default set between 0-9999 days of age (over 27years) and that’s well above how long the forum has been around and that does a lot to the age long information you might be getting based on how popular they are in between other criterion for selection.I think playing around with these functions could help in narrowing things down but still, it’s search results display or presentation could be improved.",
