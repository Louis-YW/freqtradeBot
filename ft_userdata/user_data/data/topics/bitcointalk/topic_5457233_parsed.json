      "body": "First of all welcome to bitcointalk platform. I see you have a nice casino. If truly this you have posted about your min. and max. withdrawal then you have done well as a casino because this would attract more traffic to your casino.OP I would advise you to register a coppa member account so you could upload pictorial excerpts from their website about their casino here so that members would see for themselves what you offer. Do well to furnish us with more information about your casino here as this post is not enough to convince us to getting registered with your casino.Nevertheless, there are lots of casinos out there which would need you to compete with so in that case you would need to do a signature campaign to advertise and promote your casino here and I would recommendÂ  @Royse777 to manage your campaign for you as he has the best expertise, coupled with experience and large followership to doing that in your favor. Do well to contact him as he is open to welcoming you to deal.",

We have an auto instant withdrawal system. It will be sent to your tron â€‹â€‹adress in just 1 minute.",

However, OP welcome to the forum and I hope too you are actively answering those questions that give us interest in your casino. And also, your announcement thread seems to look unprofessional in introducing your casino, buy a copper membership account so that you can able to post images for updates here in your thread.EDIT:You are wondering why you are in the altcoins section because your casino only accepts tron which is an altcoin, choose BTC as another option so that you are eligible to post in the gambling section.",
