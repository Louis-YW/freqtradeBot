IMO it is simply the trader that is being copied. That is meaning that trader that the trade orders is being followed or copied by other traders it is not determined by the liquidity or capital of the trader. However most traders that are followed don't make profit all day , they make losses but in trading if you are having more profit than losses then you are better but not all traders that are followed make higher profit than losses.",

It became popular as it was advertised and promoted to earn profit like how the profiles of those trades can be copied. Being able to do trade without enough knowledge is too risky. I didn't tried it yet but I don't think it is profitable if keep doing maybe there are instances that we can win through this method but if we don’t know anything about that coon it may lead more into loses. It’s already hard to trust signalsthat were given by paid so called professionals what more if we will just copy their trade without studying. I guess it will depend on who we will follow and if we trust him that much to risk our money without studying.",

If you are, what is the best crypto exchange you can be a lead trader and what is the maximum profit in percentage?I used to copy trade back in my forex trading days. There were actually a couple of brokers like Etoro, Nforex etc. Who offers such kind of service where you can follow a lead trader and his trades will be automatically copied for you proportionate to your investment. To be honest, I have never made money out of copy trade. Because at every profitable trade, the lead trader used to take a commission and unless someone has a huge money invested, the profits are usually miniscule. I have never tried copy trade in crypto though.",

The idea that it’s not sustainable should be implemented, that’s how you managed to start. There are people who think this is the way out of poverty and they will be able to get rich doing this, but the reality is that we are not going to be as rich at all. We are going to follow some people and that’s understandable, but he reality is that we are not going to be rich in the long run by following others and not understanding how it works.This is why it’s better to learn how to do these yourself, so that you would be able to invest and earn your own money without needing anyone. Sure you started that way, but you learned later on, everyone needs to do that.",

It’ll work for a while until it doesn’t pretty much. You can’t make any money long term with such services.",

I have not used it on any crypto exchange before, but on Binance, I saw TraderWagon which you will link your Binance account with to be able to be a lead trader or if you want to copy trade. Even without registering, on Binance, you can see the positions taken by first 50 lead traders. There are other exchanges I also heard about like eToro, Bybit, MEXC, Gate.io and some others. But I do not know how reputed many of the exchanges are.Quote from: mk4 on October 13, 2022, 04:45:20 PMeToro's still the only one decently reputable platform for this as far as I know. But there's a new platform that's getting hyped up called STFX; not saying it's going to be good, but DYOR.Can you let us know more about eToro, I haven't registered on the site yet. What criteria are needed before being a lead trader on the exchange? I mean the minimum amount of money needed by lead traders to open position. Also what is the maximum amount of profit in percentage that is deducted from people that copy lead traders that would be paid to the leader trader? And also what other profit do lead trader gets, like from trading fee and others?Quote from: GelatikKembar on October 13, 2022, 06:32:30 PMI don't like copy trading for several reasons firstly copy trading is very bad for account security on exchange, because we include API where all your data is sent to Copy Trading application, and secondly Copy trading is just a waste of money and it's better to analyze the chart yourself.Never mind me, I also wants to ask this question too, I noticed on Binance that before you can be a lead trader or copy trader, you have to register on another site, link you Binance account to it and Binance indicate that your KYC including your personal documents are also connected and known by the other platform which is TraderWagon. I too think this can result to KYC danger issues.",
