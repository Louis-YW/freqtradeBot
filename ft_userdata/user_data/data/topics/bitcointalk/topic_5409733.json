Not so long ago I sold a few when they were at their peak.I am mainly engaged in a business that is not related to cryptocurrency, but I want to realize this money here.Trading is popular now and I need a person who really understands this. I've tried trading, but I just don't have enough time.I need a personal trader, a partner. 1. We will be able to draw up a contract with passport data2. I will pay a good percentage for the work3. All conditions will be discussed immediately. I will try to make them the most profitable for you, but in return I want a real professional.To see the evidence and communicate with me personally, you can write DM, social networks listed in the profile.The creators of NFT and cryptanalysts, you can also contact me, I will be glad to communicate with every professional in a separate industry in cryptocurrency.",
