I prioritize testability, maintainability, and security in every project. As a security-oriented developer, I implement robust measures to protect your data and systems from potential threats.With my extensive experience and commitment to delivering high-quality solutions, you can trust that your project is in capable hands. I take the time to understand your unique requirements and work closely with you to ensure that the final product exceeds your expectations.PricingTo give you a better sense of my pricing range, here are some representative projects that i've worked on and their associated costs:Ansible script to automate system adminstration tasks on multiple servers: $300Twitter bot with browser automation: $350Truthsocial account creator: $600AI-powered chatbot for Telegram (using GPT-4): $800Cryptocurrency indicator-based trading bot (Binance API): $1500Custom CMS with an intuitive admin panel for managing website content, users, and settings: $2500AI-powered web application: $5000These prices serve as a general guideline, and I'm happy to provide a more accurate estimate once we discuss your project in detail.The final price may vary depending on the complexity, requirements, and features of your specific project. For web applications intended for SaaS or customer-facing purposes, pricing will be determined on a case-by-case basis to account for the ongoing maintenance, support, and enhancements required to ensure the application's long-term success and profitability.Please note that my minimum order price is $300. This ensures that I can dedicate the necessary time and resources to deliver high-quality results for each project.ContactTelegram: @mald0r0r_devEmail: maldoror.dev@proton.meRefund PolicyWhile I do not offer refunds, I am committed to your satisfaction.If you are not completely satisfied with the end product, I will work with you to address any concerns and make necessary adjustments until you are happy with the result.How to PurchaseReach out to me via Telegram (preferred) or Email. Contact details are listed above in the Contact section.Provide a detailed description of your project requirements, including features and any specific needs. This will help me give you the most accurate quote and ETA.I will begin work on your project and keep you updated on the progress. I will also ask any questions if needed to ensure the project meets your expectations.Once the project is ready (or if we are working on a milestone basis, when a milestone is ready), I will issue the due invoice. After the payment is confirmed, I will deliver the completed project (or milestone).F.A.QWhat is your average response time?I understand that timely communication is essential for a successful project. That's why I strive to respond to all inquiries as quickly as possible, usually within 1 working day. To ensure transparency, I've listed my business hours in my Telegram User Info. During these hours, you can expect prompt responses to your messages. If you reach out outside of my business hours, I'll get back to you as soon as I'm available on the next working day.What payment methods do you accept?Cryptocurrency and PayPal. Bank transfers can also be arranged for exceptional cases.What is your payment policy?I require an upfront payment for all projects before I begin work. The percentage of the total project cost required upfront is typically 50%, but this can vary based on the size and scope of the project. For larger projects, I'm open to structuring payments based on milestones, where the total cost is broken down into smaller increments tied to the completion of specific project phases.Do I need to provide a design template for my web app?In most cases, yes. To ensure high-quality results, I require a complete design template for your web app. This can be in the form of detailed mockups, wireframes or design files (e.g., Figma templates). However, if your web app is intended for internal or private use (e.g., an admin dashboard or an internal tool) and doesn't require a highly polished UI/UX, I can create a clean, functional layout based on your requirements. If your web app requires a significant amount of UI/UX work and/or is customer-facing, I strongly recommend collaborating with a skilled web designer to create a professional, user-friendly design. Once you have the design files ready, I'll be happy to implement them into a fully functional web app.Do you provide the trading strategy for my trading bot?My expertise lies in automating and implementing trading strategies based on your specific requirements. I do not provide trading strategies myself, as I believe it is essential for you to have full control and understanding of your trading approach. If you have a strategy in mind, I'll be more than happy to work with you to automate it efficiently and reliably.How do you ensure the security of my project?Security is a top priority in all of my projects. I follow established cybersecurity methodologies to protect your data and systems from potential threats. This includes secure coding practices, encryption of sensitive data and strict access controls.",
