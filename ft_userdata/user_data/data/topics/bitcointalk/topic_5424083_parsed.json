  "content": "Bitfront, a U.S. cryptocurrency exchange sponsored by the Japanese social media company Line Corp, announced it had ceased new sign-ups and credit card payments. The firm also said it would stop operating within the next few months. This development followed their attempts at addressing difficulties in the rapidly changing sector.The California-based firm stated in a post on its website on Sunday that, despite its best efforts, it's sadly decided that it must close down BitFront to carry on the expansion of the LINE blockchain ecosystem and LINK token economy.If you are user of this exchange, you are advice to take note and get your money out before the deadline.Source: RemitanoFull Announcement: https://www.bitfront.me/notice/20208406",

Well, I guess better to shut it up down like this and allow people getting there money our instead dragging on for months and ending up declaring bankruptcy like we've been seeing lately.",

This development followed their attempts at addressing difficulties in the rapidly changing sector.It's not surprising they had their own ''revolutionary''shit token and centralized blockchain... I never heard about BitFront exchange, but I am checking it out on CoinGecko website and they only had six coins listed and trading pairs for them.CoinGecko listed around 550 exchanges, CoinMarketCap probably has the similar number, and most of the are worthless crap used only for washing money.I would say that 80% to 90% of all exchanges should stop existing and this will probably happen in near future.",

Presumably that would be true for an exchange with a ton of overhead, but like Rikafip and dkbit98 I'd never heard of BitFront before, and they're based in the US where I live.  They couldn't be that big, right?  **edit: I just read dkbit's whole post, including their pathetic trading pairs** And it's either that or their trading volume was absurdly low, kind of like that small exchange that used to list Curecoin.  I think it was shorelinecrypto or something similar, and they also went out of business a while back.This has nothing to do with the other bankruptcies in the news, however.  And I'd point out that there have been a lot of fly-by-night exchanges that have come and gone over the years, because of not being profitable or through exit scams.  Unless the crypto exchange space consolidates and we're left with a handful of big players, I have no doubt we'll be seeing a lot more come and go.And how the hell is it that shitty exchanges like Yobit are still in business?",

Or maybe they also experienced a bank run and their fractional-reserve system that has kept so many exchanges inflated for so long couldn't keep up with it.Guys, it's well known that all banks are fractionally reserved just like these fallen exchanges. Imagine what would happen if they fell like dominoes (not that any government would allow that to happen, anyway).",

      "body": "Quote30 Dec, Suspension of withdrawalsOne disadvantage of not staying updated about a crypto exchange (where you trade) or storing funds there. Many customers funds will get locked out after the deadline and the excuse for that is the quote above. That doesn't make any sense even though the users made the wrong decision I think they should always be a form of redeeming their money. So, in a sense, its a renowned exit scam, because they'll claim a deadline was given before exiting with the remnants. However, not all user are well aware of this news, at least they gave out a warning not too bad.",
