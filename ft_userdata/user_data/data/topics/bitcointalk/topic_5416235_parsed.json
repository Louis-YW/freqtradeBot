You can do that yourself.

Just 91 people reviewed the site yet and that is not high enough to think it is true. Their are fake reviews sometimes until people start to know that it is a scam. It is just a ponzi scheme.Some people are paid for reviews.Some people can be given reward by being paid as promised, in form if ponzi scheme to leave them with good reviews, but later, late investors are scammed and you can be one of them.Avoid.",

If it's ads what keyword? I tried a few keywords that include that site but I can't find any ads.Does it seem you are trying to promote it here?I check the backlinks and it has 200 backlinks according to Ahrefs it was spread to 60 domains with 200 links. So you might be found it there but the exact email you posted above is not listed on Ahrefs so how exactly did you find this site?So that I can report it right away to Google ads if you found it as ads.",

But it's very different now, exchanges are well aware of this kind of trading and so they are not giving any chance for some to trade this way. Besides, it should be very fast that only bots can do it.And so I agree that this could be scam, but I will say that the OP should stir away from any bots if he don't know how to even have a knowledge of basic trade.",

Sites like TrustPilot are utter crap that I don't even consider them when doing research on anything. You're better off looking for reviews on Reddit, some forums, and other social media sites. Of course obviously reviews on the likes of Reddit can also be faked, but the chances of them being fake are far lower. And as always, be skeptical.Also OP, just don't use trading bots unless you can configure one yourself. Use Gekko if you're going to be serious.",

So this is what this all about? But earlier, im expecting something different because your title says trading bots, so what came to my mind first are those common trading bots where it helps you trade automatically like gunbot and similar.I don't know if they are reputable as this is my first time to hear them. They may look reputable according on trust pilot but that is not enough to say that they are truly reputable because anyone can buy fake reviews or they can just create an account there and put positive comments. Obviously don't try them with higher amounts but you can begin with smaller amounts first if you insist to test them out.",

      "body": "Nope. There’s no company that can do arbitrage trading in different exchange and earn huge due to crypto volatility and less liquidity on orderbook per exchange. They will not need investment if there method is generating profit consecutively. Most of this random ads on google that offering profit using a method that is too good to be true is just a scam. There’s no such thing as trading bot like that and if there is, You will not gonna see it publicly and ask for investment.  Just try exchange bots for trading and do it your own way.",
