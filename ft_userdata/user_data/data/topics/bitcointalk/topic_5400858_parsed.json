Why is Elrond rather unpopular?Did the $ go to Solana?  Yeah all of money have been going to the hyped blockchain like solana. Elron was not a popular blockchain. This blockchain was not so good as solana blockchain. These days people will be moving to the blockchain that was adopting the pretty similar mechanism like ethereum. It doesn't mean elrond was bad but i remember when there were bunch of bad rumour and news about this blockchain. that makes the movement was not so fast like another blockchain like solana. Elron was an alternative blockchain as well.",

      "body": "Elrond is generally better than Solana in terms of utility and would probably maintain its edge well into the future. In addition, Elrond is used relatively more in transactions, despite it being roughly as old as Solana. Given Elrond's utility, its market cap of €1.7b indicates it is most probably undervalued compared to Solana which has a market cap of €13.8b.",

Sol chain has also many partnership and big investor while Elrond not yet. Solona Blockchain NFt Usecase is very high and many top projects using sol Blockchain. Sol have also some drawback like security, congestion issue but hope it will resolve soon.",

      "body": "Elrond EGLD, Solana SOL and other central networks have gained momentum with the transfer of applications (DeFi) to them, as their decentralized platforms are fast and do not need a lot of money in gas, but at the present time there are questions about proving the stake as being feasible, and therefore I think that more people will prefer currencies with proof of work more than proof of stake .Don't forget that Ethereum will move to Proof of Stake in August, and if it succeeds, most altcoins will lose their popularity, so the money may not flow to them.And finally the state of the market and the end of the hybrid that accompanied SOL with stories like what happened with Luna.",

Funny how both the Sun and the Moon crashed and burned. I think it all comes down to this. What partnerships does Elrond have and what problems is it solving? Can it compete with Fantom, HBAR, and ICP on a technical level or is it technically obsolete and doomed to fail, like litecoin and ADA?",

But when Solana started, Solana was the best alternative for Ethereum especially when there was an issue about a clogged network on Ethereum and a lot of people started to find some alternative, and Solana came.But look at now, there are already lof cases happening on Solana especially since the network is started to clogged and there are hours that no transactions are being processed.",

The absence of programs that should be an attraction for crypto adoption to be more active and encourage price increases. If we look at the difference between Elrond and Solana, it will be clear that investors are interested in Solana who is active in building new projects, and the benefits offered. Programs such as Holder, staking, and Pool in snapshot time to get prize allocation and things that certainly make investors have a profitable output.",

There are more projects that are choosing SOL for its adaptability and that's undeniable.I guess the marketing also plays a part that has been done by the SOL team and for EGLD, it didn't clicked that much.",

Elrond's growth is very less compared with solana caused by its ecosystem is slowly doing expansion. Elrond's development speed is not equal to Sol's, possibly due to the different marketing methods of each project, one side is quite noisy and the other is quietly building and developing. I used to put my trust in Solana but with what Sol is showing I really start to suspect, in 2022 alone Solana outage 4 times and I don't think it will stop there number 4, team Sol can't seem to fix the problem. If Solana doesn't solve this problem sooner or later the community will leave it.",

I didn't hear a lot of comparisons between Elrond and solana. I also think both of them are not in the same nature. Maybe there are times where their value are close to each other, that's why someone can compare them but now the value of elrond have drop drastically, it wasn't considered to be a competitor of solana anymore.Elrond is actually pretty popular before. This coin was showing in the trend page of coinmarketcap and they also have done a marketing there but like any other older coins, they can't always be on the trend. Maybe some Elrond investors have sold some of their coins and then invested it in solana because solana is also on the trend last time.",
