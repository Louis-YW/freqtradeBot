  "content": "February 13th, 2022After the security breach at TryRoll, and their teams response (or lack thereof) to the incident, I have decided to separate my creative brand and my social token economy from any controlling central party and manage it of my own volition. The resulting ERC-20 is 'Goose Feathers 2.0'; with the market ticker $DOWN (lol).\"BruceTheGoose 4/2/2021Overview:$DOWN is the newly deployed “social token” of BruceTheGoose, who holds many roles in the Web 3.0 ecosystem; Artist, collector, musician, innovation advisor, founder, daoist and more. $DOWN is an ERC-20 derived from “fractionalizing” an Emblem Vault containing (and continuing to receive deposits of) original artwork by Bruce; with most being first or single editions), various fungible tokens, and a variety of 3rd party NFTs with promising potential or proven value. By HODL’ing $DOWN, you’ll be holding ownership of X% of the total value of the NFTs and tokens contained in the $DOWN Vault. Should the vault be sold, your holding entitles you to a proportional amount of ETH as dividends; as well as various perks and utilities implemented by BruceTheGoose.Tokenomics:Token Address: (ERC-20) - 0xcfe4a93c6b0930bd46a8b375f113c9f398c27375NFT ID: (ERC-721) - 0x82c7a8f707110f5fbb16184a5933e9f78a34c6ab | 7543251Emblem Vault Public Wallet Address:EVM: 0x00Ac3006e20C3B06aE71e897b56b475622601293BTC: 16ZfFoEgAdK2MzXhhtVhpe8XGUh1SPzEY9BCH: bitcoincash:qq7sthumd9l8dvjfq4y0ctf0v38tz5nsxycfkhj0u6TEZ: tz1NEYYALSXuWaYLWUjggDcdvQLPnjLuW3ghInitial Supply: 10,000,000 $DOWN*Curator’s Fee: 1% per yearArtist’s Reserve - 15% (2yr. linear vesting) - 1.500.000IDO/ITO - 15% *(Dates TBA) - 1.500.000DAOwn Treasury 15% ($DOWN HODL’ers DAO) - 1.500.000Community Rewards - 30% - (2yr. distribution) - 3.000.000Vault Holdings - 10% (Held in the underlying NFT) - 1.000.000Marketing / Expenses - 5% (DAO Approval required to unlock) - 500.000Airdrops - 5% (Details Below) - 500.000INO - 5% (Initial NFT Offering; via Charged Particles) - **500**Curation Fee - Fractional implements a ‘curation fee’ on tokenized NFTs; which functionally increases the token supply by X% per year, issued to the creator of the token. In this case, 1% per year, to BruceTheGoose. The inflation rate can be modified; enabling the $DAOwn to propose/enact halvings, or to disable new issuance entirely.*IDO/ITO -** Tokens remaining in the sale contract after the IDO closes will be locked int the contract permanently.***Airdrops -**3% of the total supply (300,000 $DOWN) will be distributed to previous collectors of Bruce’s artworks, supportive community members, and holders of $FTHR and of the OG ₲oose ₲ang membership NFTs in 3 distribution waves, happening 4 months apart from one another.2% (200.000 $DOWN) will be used for marketing via airdrops on various platforms.Utility:$DOWN is designed to function in a manner similar to a rewards/loyalty program; so will steadily gain more utilities over time.Initially, the primary purpose of the token will be to represent shared ownership of the underlying assets.> Governance:After the conclusion of the IDO, a DAO will be summoned to manage various aspects of the token and community. The DAO will be of a hybrid format, in which voting and proposals will take place on multiple platforms. At the time of this writing, the most likely interfaces are Snapshot and DAO Haus.The reason for this separation is to prevent whale-wallet manipulation by solely basing governance on the quantity of a token held. Submitting proposals will only be possible by shareholders in the Moloch DAO; entry to which will require a significant tribute of $DOWN, paid to the DAO treasury.> Exclusive NFTsAlready being developed; $DOWN The Block is a custom NFT marketplace, accessible only by verifying your ownership of at least (TBD quantity) $DOWN tokens in your wallet. Within this marketplace, the community will have the ability to purchase exclusive artworks by BruceTheGoose and curated collaborators.Purchases (and secondary sales) will be available to be made in $ETH and stablecoins ($DAI, $USDT, $USDC) as well as other tokens as decided by the DAO, and of course, $DOWN. Purchases made with $DOWN will carry a 10-30% discount when compared to pricing in other tokens, and collectors will occasionally be given opportunities to purchase/earn/win various redeemable discounts.NFTs offered initially through $DOWN The Block will be exclusive to the platform. (Primary sales will not be offered anywhere else, but secondary sales will be available on $DOWN The Block and other marketplaces)> Payment for ServicesNFT / Web 3.0 related services provided by BruceTheGoose or DappGoose Labs (and its child projects) will be available at discounted rates when paid with $DOWN. Any time Bruce receives payment for services in the form of $DOWN; 10% of the paid amount will be deposited to the DAO treasury, and another 10% will be added to the community rewards pool.> ₲oose ₲angGoose Gang (The OG Era) was launched in July of 2020 as the world’s first NFT “subscription box”. Membership was controlled by owning one of (a possible) 35 ‘Goose Gang Membership’ NFTs, and was planned to provide its owners with the following benefits:A private discord community to have a more direct connection with the artistRandom airdrops of $FTHR (Bruce’s first experiment with social tokens, via Roll)A monthly NFT airdrop of an original artwork, created in as many editions as there are Goose Gang membersShortly after the launch of Goose Gang, the Ethereum Gas Wars began, and it was no longer feasible to mint and distribute free NFTs to multiple people each month (each monthly airdrop would cost more in fees than the memberships were initially sold for). The launch of $DOWN will also mark the start of a new format (and new release) of Goose Gang, as a generative PFP collection with valuable benefits to HODL’ers. Pre-sale discounts and whitelist spots will be offered to hodl’ers of $DOWN, in a 3-tier system. Details will be announced over Discord/Twitter.> Yield Farming$DOWN will utilize the GYSR protocol to launch a variety of DeFi strategies; allowing holders to stake single tokens and tokens representing their positions in various liquidity pairs to earn more tokens. Rewards will come in the form of $DOWN, $FTHR (Bruce’s original social token, which will become a part of the $DOWN ecosystem), and potentially additional NFT fractions or other tokens.> NFT FarmingSome liquidity pairs will allow providers to stake their LP tokens to accumulate points, which can then be redeemed for exclusive NFTs.> PhilanthropyWhenever services, NFTs, or other rewards are purchased using $DOWN, 5% of the purchase price will be used to support various charitable and social good initiatives within the Web 3.0 ecosystem.> Exclusive Access$DOWN hodl’ers will be able to bypass token-gating on a variety of content published by BruceTheGoose, as well as accessing on-chain investment clubs, token/NFT indexes, and other yet-to-be-determined content and projects.> Multi-Chain CompatibilityBy utilizing Chainport, $DOWN will be made available on a cross-chain basis, allowing for gasless (or near-gasless) DeFi, the ability to expand $DOWN The Block into a network of marketplaces across multiple blockchains, and providing various new avenues of adoption and exposure. Currently, $DOWN exists on Ethereum Mainnet and Fuse Network; with Fuse Studio providing a community interface with several benefits (such as a whitelabel wallet and a community dashboard with links to projects integrating $DOWN).> MerchLimited releases of physical merchandise, art prints, and additional products will be made available to hodl’ers of $DOWN. In some cases, products will be available to the general public as well; when this happens, $DOWN hodl’ers will receive early access, exclusive discounts, or both.> Third Party BenefitsBruce is a veteran in the NFT space, and has developed an extensive and highly valuable professional network. As a matter of priority, they will explore and negotiate integrations of $DOWN with projects spanning DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, IRL applications, and more.Additional Addresses$fDOWN (Fuse Mainnet $DOWN) - 0x3b6b2506cf395655DBa4990e2FD75B5Cc523d2e8***DO NOT USE THE FUSE BRIDGE TO MIGRATE TOKENS!
