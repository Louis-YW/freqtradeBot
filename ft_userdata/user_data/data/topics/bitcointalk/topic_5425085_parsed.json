I don't really trust any project because its already existing and we are in bearish days so there is uncertain situation for the shitcoins to pass along these days.",

Yes avax is also one of my huge profit as it gives me 100x since Ive invested on their public ICO last 2019. Also ftm and spirit tokens too. There are others too like shitcoins but not comparable to this projects.Hoping for some new ICOs to invest with while the market isnt booming again.",

But after that not huge but that was also the good profit by holding same coin. It was believed that investing in hype projects will give you an amazing profit for a short-term condition which is different from investing in ETH and BNB as they could give you more and not only just a profit but also investment security. However, in the situation today, x5 is somewhat lucky for you OP. Because it was hard to see which project will give you that, not this bear season, maybe during the bull market. If we are looking at them this time, I will tell you that you just fail. It was not the perfect time to see this kind of market sentiment.",

Made huge profit from MONACO and of course the website is already downFirst launched in 2017 where the ICO of MONACO was a huge success and you could literally make 10 - 30X of your ICO investment when listed on exchanges, it was on Poloniex as far as I remember. Pretty good year I would say for ICO compared to todays standard",

I've held it through 2017 and then never sold during that time and then 2018 has came, I was urged to give up on it when it's just two digits in price but didn't do anything and kept the faith and held it until I've sold a lot of it last year. It was a great experience, I still hold a few of it and all I can say that was really hell of an experience because it's one of the cryptos that I've invested a lot not just with money but also with my feelings.",

But with the time there was financial issues with the project and they had to close it down way early than what roadmap stated. I made whooping profits from it. It was easy to trade with low value. The only thing that kept me going on with this coin is, direct owner contacts through various social accounts. They were prompt and energetic. I think that was keeping the project on track and investors interested. Miss it.",

The average altcoin can increase very much from the purchase price at the project's initial launch or increase very much after its release on the market. Dogecoin is also one of the many altcoins that gave huge profits at that time.And I think it will happen again as soon as market conditions improve and it can increase again. This time, there will be more altcoins that might increase high and we have to analyze altcoins that have the opportunity to increase.",

I don't really trust any project because its already existing and we are in bearish days so there is uncertain situation for the shitcoins to pass along these days.Every coin has a tendency to give such high profit but tendencies won't mean being certain of something. Altcoins are known for high rate of increase in terms of their market value which gives huge returns to i vestors. Problem is, their market value is too volatile which adds risk from investing to such tokens. Usually, tokens which are not yet released, having or creating noise in this industry are the best ones to invest if you are into alts. But as I've said that won't guarantee things.I'd sugget lowering investor's assumption of profit. Diversification could have a bigger tendency to lessen the risk than to go all in with one token alone given that no clear patterns would be seen in the market.",
