I said I don't know and what for he's enquiring. He said name specific person from my region and he's supporting people to invest in that coin and given good profit to the buyers. I said I don't know, I'll look for it and give you the answer. I tried and found nothing. Did any of you heard about it, and in my view it is going to be a scam soon.",

Bittron will be listed the following exchanges soon. The listing process started and will be executed before 31 December 2021.There is no data listed about this token on any exchange and even then it has passed, whereas on they web already listed on many exchanges, that's a joke.",

You cal tell that in terms of design and website itself.Also a project that announcing or even advertising a listing on top market is totally shady and a red flag. Cause project would never tell unless the exchange itself announced that they list it. Otherwise you are dealing with a potential scam project.",

Well, if this is an actual token, I have never heard of it as well and just give a warning to your brother that don't invest to tokens that you don't know.It is one reason why many investors are being f*cked because of their decision of doing investments to the projects that they know.It's better for him to listen to you and just don't invest to sort of tokens like that.",

Now the person whom made him invest isn't picking the call. I came to know through him that many known people of mine have got trapped. The person have convinced them saying that the software is under development and once things get solved you'll get your profits. Here I see lack of education making people loss hard earned money.",

Here I see lack of education making people loss hard earned money.this is the dilemma of investing in a never-heard coin. it is always better to search for the project and not rely on someone else's endorsements. because they can promise all they want, but if they can't produce anything, that's useless. most people are taking the bait because of the promise of the high turn around of their investments. but that just it, only promises. it will be their expensive lesson here. so hopefully, next time around they will do their due diligence before investing in the next coin.",

It is always good to stay away from these kind of cryptocurrencies. Proper education is a must to make people don't fall for such scam projects. The latest information I got through him, that the person who introduced said he'll buy it back for 2x of what he spend.",
