  "content": "I would like to take into consideration four levels of contribution in a match by a star player, and hope to see from everyone's opinion how their contribution would go to affect the outcome, odds of a game and the bet after the game is concluded. These four levels include:*playing part of a match, *playing a full match, *being substituted out and *being substituted in.No star player is agreeably just a placebo effect on any team, and unlike Ronaldo and Messi who have influenced their new teams to attain new feats, they are expected to perform excellent service in the positions they are signed for and nothing less of that.My question is simple, do star players really affect the odds of a bet, or wager or stake on a match, putting into consideration the four levels of contribution in a match, as I mentioned earlier?",

      "body": "If you are asking if the involvement of star players affects how much odds bookies place on a club, then it definitely does cause all factors like: who is playing at home, current form, any related match news etc affects the outcome of the match.So the answer is yes, important players affect the odds of a match.- Jay -",

Assuming the odd was very small for a strong team, if it is noticed that the club will bench like two or three players because the club is having a tougher match coming, the bookies may increase the odd of the strong club. This can happen if the strong club wants to play champions league quarter final or higher but playing with a small club in their league, the strong club manager can rest or bench some of the best players.Before a club is given an odd, there are some things to consider. How strong the club players are is one of the things that will determine the odd.",

There is other indicators that you should consider on betting. The odds changes due to many reason and having a star player can totally affect the odds, you can just notice this on a team with the star players.",

If the performances of any player at all is superfluous, then the club could eventually be Valued at more bet/spin points (depending on the leauge in question though)..I don't think it's something that's done like a major speculation thus, affecting the results of the game at the end...no, I don't.

      "body": "Yes, star players can have a significant impact on the odds of a bet or wager on a match, considering the four levels of contribution you mentioned. The level of contribution a star player provides in a match can influence the outcome and subsequently affect the odds. As prominent players have a significant impact on the final result of the game, bookmakers and betting markets consider their presence and performance when setting odds. It's crucial to remember that other factors, outside only the participation of the star player, such as team dynamics, recent performance, injuries, and other elements, affect the odds.",

Recently in esports, there was a team who are always one of the big favorites in their league, and suddenly, they became mediocre, losing most of their series (from 6-2 to 9-9) after their star player injured his wrist. Thankfully, he recovered in time and got to play during the playoffs to push the team back to their top form.",

      "body": "It does, and it depends on who the star player is with and who they are against. An example I can think of is GSW vs Cavs championship games. During games when the whole Cavs team is present, they are at even odds against GSW. But in games when one key person is missing from the team (Kevin Love), the odds shift towards GSW even with Lebron and Kyrie on board. While star players have the capability to carry a team on their backs, it isn't enough especially on a team-based game.",

I was looking for parlays and I find it hard to get a decent odd with Nikola Jokic and Murray on sepecific stats 'coz they're both expected to perform well by other bettors, also with other players such as Gordon. Odds are simply the reflection of how majority of bettors percieve a player or fighter within a specific match. So basically, star players are more popular than bench players which makes sense for audiences to expect more from them to perform well within a game.¬† You'd be able to bet under their names for a better outcome but never expect high returns all the time.",

This is common, because the team winning is much connected with the players, and the predictions will also be based on them. Always they carry the expectation of the audience.

      "body": "Star players contribute to 70-80% of match winnings in a particular team especially when the player is not injured and when the player is in good form. Taking Real Madrid as an example, the performance of Real Madrid dropped automatically when Benzema was injured last season because he was always the star man in every of their match irrespective of the fact that there are so many good players there but he's absence was felt when Madrid was dropping point in every match. For a star player to play from the bench is really not possible unless they player is affected by fatigue or the coach decided to play him from the bench because he just came back from an injury but then his presence will still be felt on the pitch whenever he's introduced because he is a prolific player and a game changer for his club.",

Sudden injury half of the game could also change the odds but it will depend on the score and how much time is left. Load management may also affect the odds if the player suddenly feels like he had enough playtime and will just let his teammates finish the game. Star players gave a plus/minus and we should always check those out. If a star can greatly affect the game on both ends of the floor then his absence will also change the spreads and the winning chance of his team.",

But don't get blinded by these odds because sometimes they're full of surprises when it comes to the actual matches. It's more of speculations before the games and that's why teams that have star players, don't expect them to show that much of odds.",

I mean some star players wouldn't increase much in terms of strength if the core of the team was already established in the first place, heck they might become weaker in the short term in fact.In comparison, adding a good player on a relatively bad team could help build up a foundation, specifically around that star player. While this leads to the the limiting themselves, it's faster in comparison to trying to build the entire team up to match the star player.Okay I ranted a bit off topic, to answer, ¬†yes.

In this sense, I think bookmakers also take this into account and adjust the ODDS more or less according to these movements.My opinion then: Technically, the stars don't make much difference, but when we talk about betting then this has a relevant impact.",
