This morning as i wakeup i say make do small post i come see the new development way come out and like this anybody wey no fit pass am dey suspected as spammer. my question now be say wetin this AI fit consider as spammer, is it because you no fit pass am or your writeups no dey organized or in words with wetin people dey discuss go make them take your post as spammer?make i even tell you the truth, everybody for the forum dey suspected as spammer does this means that no is qualify enough to be a good quality poster? And about those people wey no post better thing and they pass CAPTCHA na dem the forum go now take as quality poster?wetin you think say go dey possible to implement than just giving us a game to play while e dey delay our posting speed.Quote from: theymos on April 01, 2023, 12:03:47 AM Right now the CAPTCHA is in beta testing, so it only shows a warning banner for likely spammers, but in 2 weeks everyone who fails the CAPTCHA will be immediately banned, so you'd better get used to it!Above na our punishment if we fails to pass it for 2 weeks, una like am like this or na just April fool post be this.make we yan here",
