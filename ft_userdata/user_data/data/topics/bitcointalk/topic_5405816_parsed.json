Being a whole coiner doesn’t make anyone special, and believe me when I say that you don’t become a whole coiner by throwing BTC at angel investments, so it’s unlikely they would suddenly go that route. Chances are, if you’re a whole coiner in 10 years, it’s because you are a saver, not a spender. The only value in those folks is that they remove BTC from circulation to help make number go up.",

That moment when there is no turning back from terms like \"Store of value\" and many products are then denominated in Bitcoin?It could mean one of two things, • A regular person identified the potential in Bitcoin early and invested wisely over a period of year, gradually building their stash up to the value of 1BTC, or• Late institutional investors are struggling to join the Bitcoin party and grab as many coins as they can from the market.In the first scenario, you could be said to be a financial genius by many and you would have acquired many financial lessons along the way to building your stash. The second scenario wouldn't mean much.Quote from: hypersonic1 on July 10, 2022, 05:51:27 PMFor me I imagine a world where someone wants to start a project and as a whole coiner, you walk in and have the ability to angel invest on a dime, or by simply  being in the room you are collateral for innovation.My objective of being in Bitcoin would be to not be identified to hold any when I walk into whatever room.",

It's like capping the price of bitcoin which is not really ideal. It could happen once all bitcoins are mined and the price is shown immense stability. But right now, people wouldn't like to cap bitcoin's price against some damn products. The entire point of HODLing will fail if it happens!",

It is harder to manipulate on chain transactions and with a very long time to create effects but it is not impossible.Supply shock is one of on chain data and it does not trigger instant effect. Sometimes you will see dramatic effect after a few months of first signal of supply shock. Because the market is also affected with emotion, psychology of investors, speculators, gamblers and news. Even they see signals, they still hesitate to do what they should do.",

The angel investor are at risk and what if project fails so your whole 10 years patience and holding for all these years is waste? And did the project will kick start with one bitcoin only? So for me best is to enjoy your profits with yourself only and find some other ways if you want to be an angel investor.",
