      "body": "TBH i see nothing difference compared with opensea. The only thing that makes it a bit different was on UI. Once i used blur and i kinda feel that the interface looks like centralized exchange site as it's much easier to adapt. It's caused by using blur help you so much to track the activities that happened in the NFT market compared with opensea that you need to visit the official page of NFT to know activities behind it. All of the data that already shown by blur is also pretty much the same as opensea. Let's see this when you wanna sell your NFT and you do need to wait until someone is interested in your NFT and make a bid for it. A bit surprised to see that with only making an NFT market with a different UI could make a big hype like that. Blur airdrop has been officially ended since january. No chance for people to get it anymore. People who has been using, listing and bidding NFT on blur market will be ligible. I got a few thousands of blur and i have dumped it. https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/marketplacesBlur has been surpassing opensea's in term of volume.",
