NGN is fiat which is available on both spot trading and p2p trading account on Binance.Quote from: Susano on January 24, 2023, 06:48:09 AMAs NGN done enter binance, anybody join the campaign, abi em be nor get campaign / project. Never mind. This is a stale news, not new anymore.Quote from: Susano on January 24, 2023, 06:48:09 AMAs a stable coin way I sure say em go be, em go affect positively to the growth/development of Nigeria currency or.....?Nigerians prefer going for coins like Bitcoin or buying stable coins backed by USD, or if there are options to buy the ones backed by Euro and Pounds too, Nigerians likely going for such strong currencies instead of Naira which depreciates more.",
