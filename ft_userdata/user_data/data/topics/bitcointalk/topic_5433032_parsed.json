But two things are unclear to me:Since this is not an address type, what exactly is it?And how exactly can I generate one with any wallet?",

Something to do with Coinjoin?I like the idea behind PayNyms but for some reason they never got very popular with Bitcoin community. This is like created identity with random profile image and you can even create contact list, similar like in messenger apps. I think it's good way to transact coins privately and using Sparrow wallet you can mix this with coinjoin when you pay with paynym.Check out more about PayNyms in Sparrow wallet on this page:https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/spending-privately.html#paying-to-paynym",

But maybe someone will find it useful.I haven't; to be honest, I also never felt the need to look more into PayNym either. But often times when I use Sparrow to spend BTC, I get tempted to try the 'collaborative 2-person-CoinJoin' feature (link) for better privacy. This requires a PayNym and I think for being able to quickly find a mix partner and join transactions easily, it seems pretty useful. As long as it has no obvious drawbacks of course (like privacy issues or something.. I know CoinJoin is supposed to improve privacy, but you never know in this space.. looking at you, Wasabi).Need to look into it more before trying it out, for sure.",

So, won't I be able to view the address where I sent the sats ? I 'd like to test it, but if anyone knows, let me know and I will believe you.Yes.

Because every modern wallet with coin control can do that by default.It ensures no address reuse, but it also means the receiver does not need to generate a new address for every transaction they want to receive and there is no difficulty in communicating that address privately. I could post a paynym publicly, and everyone who wants can use that paynym to send me coins to a fresh address each time, and no one can use that paynym to spy on the addresses it creates for anyone else.Paynyms also serve another purpose in Samourai and Sparrow wallets in that they allow you to coordinate with other users to create StonewallX2 and Stowaway transactions for improved privacy.",

Although some people considered it a failure, it would have been a success if Silent Payments + layering that with Lightning, and CoinJoin were used? 🤔",
