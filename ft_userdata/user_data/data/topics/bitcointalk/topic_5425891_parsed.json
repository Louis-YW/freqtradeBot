  "content": "Lower company taxes higher salary.Only one way to boost economy Are higher minimum salary it Will make the total economy better becouse people Will spend more money consume more products it.Second point no matter what work you do you should have right for decent life If you work everyday.Only way Are this- goverment should make minimum wages according to life expenses.But companies should pay less taxes.And health care and all other public services should run by private sector insurance based scheme off course goverment controlled. If it's not like that dont ask why society is sad and everywhere is depression and doom.For example: in UK the minimum salary should be 3500 GBP For example: in finland the minimum salary should be 4000 EUR. Off course we can denie that facts but then dont complain about that we have some super rich and many people don't have nothing be happy dont complain then.Lastly your economic situation is the results of your goverment action and your leaders are mirror of your own toughts you get goverment and country what you deserve.Im not talking about socialism or capitalism Im talking about logic pure logic how is the proper way to run economy Also the higher salary dont mean prices can go up without reason there should be rules over Property valuation specially Property rent becouse high rent will eat the good salary so it's not Even question goverment should make Free Market but with some added extensions.The better wages means better productivity better health and better safety and wealth for everybody.That's only way If it's not like this then dont complain about your country poverty of people.",

If the salaries get increased 10 times, the prices will increase 10 times as well.Salaries are a major part of the production costs and increasing them increases the prices of all products.More consumption isn't necessarily better for the economy, because a big part of the products on the national consumer market are imported.Lowering the taxes for the companies would simply increase the budget deficits, which means more government debt. The countries in the EU already have big budget deficits.If it was so easy to make the minimum salary 10K euro/dollars/British pounds, the governments would have done it decades ago.",

      "body": "It appears that the current crisis is giving many an opportunity to learn more about economics and finance than they ever could have received in school.Many of the ideas offered by experts who never researched real world application of their theories, seem to be losing popularity as a growing segment of the public are beginning to see some of their negative implications. It has been years since I have seen an american praise the benefits of universal healthcare. I wonder if a subtle shift could be occurring, which many are not taking note of. The ideas people have and the way they think about the world could be changing as new evidence is presented. Not certain whether or not it will make a difference. But I think that if someone made an effort to read internet content published only 2 to 5 years ago. They would notice some extreme shifts in public opinion, which are quite unexpected.",

I can understand the argument behind minimum wages and it makes sense for some jobs. You are right that everybody deserves a certain living quality to have a happy and fulfilling life. There are two problems I have with minimum wages. First, some jobs involve money that is being paid outside of the tax scope, for example tips or builders on the construction site working Saturdays. All the money that can be hidden from the government makes a big difference. And the second factor that makes minimum wage unfair is the different living expenses. For example in the UK, it makes a huge difference if you life on London or in Wales/Scotland. Rent and food prices are depending on your location, so paying everybody the same minimum wage is unfair. The same in Finland, people in Helsinki need to pay much more than people who life in the countryside. Maybe a more dynamic approach to minimum wage, based on where you live would be better.Â  It's sad that the economic model doesn't work and the government needs to intervene.",
