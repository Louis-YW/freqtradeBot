Since you said you have experience on bounty management it will also be a added advantage if you add up some of your previous works so that your new clients can go through your portfolio. I doubt anyone will actually send you a DM on telegram or even email without any convincing information here, since the forum already have lots of experience managers, you need something that will also make you stand out.",
