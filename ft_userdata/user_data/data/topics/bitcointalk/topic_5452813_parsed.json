If i smell a moonshot coming for any reason, i will dca to some point but the amount of money i am willing to risk with microcaps is really low so it doesn't really matter to me anyway. Hardest question is when to cash out. I see no future in 2 of the microcaps i am in but they have already made me lots of profits so i am cashing out. I managed to sell some near ath and even i am 70% down from there i am still on the plus. But as i see them going nowhere i am currently cashing out.Too bad, they could have easily made me 1000x and more with a right management.",

Volatility so high that 30-50% up or down push is nothing extraordinary. Liquidity so low, that wrongly places stoploss will dump price to zero (flash crash). I agree with o48o. the only option with such investments is to allocate a very small part of the portfolio and forget. Kind of like sending a lottery ticket.",

Unless you have more funds to buy another dip. Plus if you do it, make sure that the project is worth bought up cause if not you are just catching some falling knives instead to take advantage of the low dip youll just get toast more.",

And the story then to the present is the loss?I see the problem of placing your trust in low quality environments where the risk and return can be seen from the outset and in case you are unlucky 50% still a low loss rate. Accept the fact that your capital can be completely lost, just as it can give you a big and very fast profit. But let's be more honest about such projects, looking at how they are run and the quick pump/dump processes do you really have control of that game or are you just one of the victims or just like that? tool for the creators to use.",

Even someone who has made a lot of profit with these microcap coins, may not be applicable to you. This is like having a big shot of luck.Just think of any purchase you do with microcap coins as something too risky and you have no control over its short future. Like you'll never what shall happen within the next few minutes and it's a gamble that you're okay to lose.",

I'll monitor the project to know why it's dumping before taking a decision. If the dump is caused by the general market then I won't sell or set a stop lose but if the project is dumping because of other reason, I sell.If the whole market is dumping because Bitcoin is dumping then there's nothing you can do as no project can stand against the movement of Bitcoin because Bitcoin control the whole market. If you decide to sell in this instances, you would miss the future gains you should have gotten.Always observe your investment, know the reason behind why anything is happening so you don't regret the decision you take. Also keep spare money so you can buy more tokens if the price reduces after you have invested. Don't invest in a project if you don't believe it to be successful.",

And in my opinion there is no threshold for this, as I am not a regular price watcher so the fact that some coins have a high level of risk makes me not bother to check daily profits or losses. daily losses. I used to spend a small amount of capital to buy some shitcoins that have been battered since 2017, and it wasn't until the market was really active in 2022 that I checked that account again, and indeed some shitcoins were worthless but there were some that gave me a lot of money.",

Stop Losses are for traders, not investors. Don't forget that the shorter the timeframe, the higher the volatility. The shorter the timeframe, the more likely your stop loss will trigger. Microcaps are good over the distance, that's when you get the maximum profit, I don't see the point in buying a microcap with a time frame of, say, 3 months, especially not in a bull market.",

As far as i know they are looking at websites like dexscreener for example and there they are looking for trading pairs that were added recently. That way you see project that were listed just now and you have the chance to invest into them extremely early.Of course it is lalso part of the truth, that probably 99% of all those tokens that are listed with a very low market cap on Dexes are meme-coins that are dead again within a few days or scams. So you have to be very careful here and you have to be aware that the chance of a total loss of your funds is very high.",
