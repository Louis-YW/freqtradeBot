Bitcointalk is the largest crypto community, it's oldest too. Many casinos built their name from this community. With a good and consistent budget you can achieve it too. It needs a lot of discussion though.If you want I can help you in bitcointalk promotions. Currently I am helping few projects to build their brand and I will gladly take your project in hand if you like too.",

      "body": "It's always nice to see a new player on the market. Still, I think the layout leaves a lot to be desired. The site looks way too easy, it looks more like a layout from the 90s. Maybe a project that was built completely from scratch, but users are used to luxury, modern and advanced platforms nowadays. I hope it will be a success, but at first glance I think few players will deposit here. The selection is also fairly limited. It comes as no surprise to me that this gambling site does not have a gambling license. The advantage is that many crypto coins are accepted as a deposit.",

I don't think it's a smart idea to require players to register, players also want to be able to view the content on the site without having to register. A gambling license should not be a problem, but the layout of the gambling site may be a bit old-fashioned. That could also work, but the offer is too limited and players can't see anything at all now. I wonder if this has been well thought through. Perhaps an inexperienced owner of the site.",

      "body": "Welcome to the forum,  I tried to register to the site and upon clicking registration, instead of email the site needs the name of the player, it is somehow a turn-off and frown upon by the crypto community to ask for the name during the registration.  Most casino ask for email, and then the player can then later provide the personal detail if he feels comfortable to the site.Another thing, after registration you are giving out the username to use for login, many users aren't familiar with this kind of registration and might skip or forget this step making them reregister because they forgot to save the given username. I think it is better to let the player register their username or email for login, I have navigated some parts of the hidden page, and I can say, your description is somehow misleading when you are saying that there are thousands of games available when in truth there is only a few.I also wanted to point out the image (icon), they are somehow blurry or pixilated, I think you need to enhance the ICON and use high-resolution images.  I know you are just starting out but I think you can present the site better.",

If you put an arrow on the menu, there should be a sub-menu while the mouse hovers over the menu. Just a piece of friendly free advice I suppose you are associated with the site, so for all the advice you get from the thread, make sure your team implements them.",

However, welcome to the forum, just follow what is suggested above and do promotion, let feel the community the importance of your casino that the other casino here did not have.

My advice is to change the settings of your gambling site where players can see the odds displayed on sports betting without having to register first, by setting having to register to see many things will reduce the interest of new players because usually before registering they will check many things until finally they are sure to do it.",
