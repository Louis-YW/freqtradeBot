  "content": "Hello guys, how are you!!?So, a few months ago, me and others users @TryNinja, @alegotardo,@joker_josue, @lcharles123 we was discussing about an interesting theme, \"How can we improve the proficiency of an ASIC MINER!? - As mudanças no ETH estão quase a chegar. Mas quando?I have very little knowledge in this area of electronics and I am creating this topic to talk to someone with more experience in this subject to create an asic and how can I could improve it?Unfortunately I have limited knowledge in this area, as I only took a course on electronics, but my main question is... how can i improve some Asic?Can I make any changes \"via software\"? Can I make any physical changes to it? increasing capacitors? performing some kind of resizing? How does it work?What is necessary?Thank you very much!best,gagux123",
