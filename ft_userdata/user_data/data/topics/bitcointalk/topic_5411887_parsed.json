Why are you interested in bitcoin? The technical aspects, the fact that it's a method of sending and receiving funds, or are you looking to invest?If it's the technical aspects, i'd probably tell you to read the whitepaper, or one of the many technical books... And if you have questions afterwards, you can come to this forum to ask them.If you're not interested in the technical aspects, i'd still urge you to watch a couple introductory movies, afterwards you can download a (testnet) wallet, exchange some funds and start right away... Just make sure that you always remember that crypto transactions are irreversible, and there are many scammers (there are scams outside of the crypto community aswell, but since crypto is relatively new, the scammers seem to get away with more than in an offline environment). The fact that crypto is irreversible and you don't need to meet up IRL to send funds makes the scammers even more bold... If you're suspecting something is fishy, it never hurts to come to this forum and ask advice before sending money.",

So i suggest you id you didn’t do any of that yet to open a wallet then search for an exchange platform that allows your region so you can buy some bitcoin and it’s a perfect time to do if you want to invest on that, i also suggest that you keep surfing this great forum and learn much things",

That's true but it's easy for you to say who knows what a bitcoin wallet is, how to download/verify/install a wallet and keep it secure. Beginners have to start by learning about wallets, keys, ... pretty much basic stuff before they begin to buy bitcoin.",

And then they create a topic with such a banal question, without reading anything around at all. I'm pretty sure it was a random post that won't answer again in this thread.A man found a forum, sat down at a desk, and decided that three hundred other people would teach him here. How it became popular. Buddy, start with motivational books like \"Think and Grow Rich.\" If you can't achieve much while your ass is on the couch, get up and start working yourself.",

Sure, in theory you can, but the hashrate is SOOOOOOO low compared to the difficulty, odds are you won't be able to solve a single share in a reasonable timeframe (if you're pool mining).",
