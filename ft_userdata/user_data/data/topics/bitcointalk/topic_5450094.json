  "content": "After searching for a good way to gift bitcoin I stumbled on card wallet. Since it does have some unique features I thought I would share it with the community. Basically it is a fancy paper wallet that is printed by the official Austrian State Printing House (they usually print the official ID Cards, Driving Licenses, etc.). This means that you basically get a passport that simply holds wallet data instead of your personal information. It is possible, because the Austrian State Printhouse was privatized some years ago and can now also do non-governmental printing on the same security level as they usually print passports.The downsides with (paper-)wallets like this (for example also the legendary casascius coins and others) are  obvious however.  You trust a third party with the creation of your wallet. This means in general that you can for one not be shure that the private key is not known to anyone and secondly any mistakes that are made will only be visible once you want to spend the coins. After some research I found out that they have a special device that creates and prints the private keys and instantly seals them. This way avoids that (mostly) anyone can track the private key during the creation process. How much you however want to trust this process is your own choice. For me it is good enough to use card wallet to give medium amounts of Bitcoin away to family and friends. The card looks very beautiful and the Austrian State Printing House is probably the most professional and trustworthy company in this moment that does  offer a service like this. Especially if you consider that all the people that work there are carefully selected and monitored since they print official state documents.For long time storage on this wallet I’m to paranoid however. This is especially since I can not do a backup of the card wallet. This means in case of fire ore any other desaster the coins would be lost. For this reason my wish would be that you could buy two wallets that do hold the same private keys, so you could store them in different locations. This should however be clearly marked on the wallet so people don’t get scammed if somebody sells them just one of the copies.In any case I found the perfect wallet to gift to somebody, so that they can read all the documents that come with it and spark their interest in bitcoin.Link: https://www.cardwallet.com/en/home/",

The whole idea that it was designed by the Austrian state printing house makes it security assured.  The only issue I could think of right now, is how trust worthy are the workers selected in creating such cards. What if this third party has access to this cards and trys something stupid. Also, keeping the card safe would be another challenge for it's users. if for instance a user lost his card or cards according to your suggestionsQuoteFor this reason my wish would be that you could buy two wallets that do hold the same private keys, so you could store them in different locations. This should however be clearly marked on the wallet so people don’t get scammed if somebody sells them just one of the copies. is there anyway, that the creators of this card could help create a new acess to the lost funds? Or is the fund really lost and nothing could be done?",

Or to be used to store small amounts of btc \"as gift\". the fact that it is not possible to make a backup is not a small problem. you must always expose the private key to be sure that the public address is the corresponding one....",

      "body": "You should never use such tools for generating a wallet. A paper wallet should be generated using a secure open-source tool on a secure device and you should be the only one who has access to the private key. With using a centralized service like the one you mentioned, you would defeat the purpose of a paper wallet. Also note that it's better to generate a HD wallet with a seed phrase instead of generating a single private key and address. In this way, you can have numerous addresses all derived from a seed phrase.",

      "body": "Hey,I you are looking for a reliable AND secure solution to gift #Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency), that is also portable and easy to use (with a mobile phone for exemple), I suggest you to take a look at Satodime: https://satodime.ioSatodime is a chipcard (dual interface so you can use it on your computer but also on your mobile phone with the NFC) that allow you to:- create up to 3 keyslots (called \"vault\").- Seal a new keyslot -> the chip will generate a pair of keys (public/private) and hide the private key within the chip memory.- Send funds to the provided public address (QR code flashing etc...).- Unseal a keyslot -> the chip will reveal the private key to the user.- Reset a keyslot -> the chip will erase any information regarding a specific vault.Desktop app to manage the card available on MacOS, Linux and Windows - also tested on TailOS for example.Mobile app available on Android - Google Play Store - and iPhone (currently on the Testflight but will be released very soon).Use cases:- Gift - no need to trust someone. You are able to check by yourself if a vault is seal or not and its balance.- Do transaction \"off-chain\" - if you exchange Satodime hand-to-hand, there is no record in the blockchain.- Use it as a tip jar: create a Bitcoin keyslot, print the corresponding QR code address and accept crypto-tips directly on your card.-...Advanced features:- It supports several crypto-currencies and non fungible tokens (segwit fir BTC is also supported).- You can provide part of the entropy used to generate the private key so you are sure that nobody has pregenerate the keys before (when you unseal a keyslot and get the private key, the entrepy used for its generation is shown to the user).- There is a \"ownership\" protection to avoid people scanning the card  on street. Only the owner of the card can perform sensitive action (Seal, Unseal, Reset).Last but not least, the project is open source - yeah baby.",

What I however think is that it there is the best chance that this company is more trustworthy than many others. Still I would not trust it with more than a small to medium amount for short time storage like I said in my first post. The issues that are present with pre fabricated paper wallets can never be overcome. Maybe there can be some kind of split key generation for paper wallets or they can print encrypted private keys, even if those can again be brute forced…Long story short, everybody needs to asses his individual situation and think if it is a good option for him to use such a wallet or not.",
