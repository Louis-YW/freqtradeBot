That fiction piece is the irony of how people perceive others. From their own angle and the way they see things they think they are better than others. Mist tines they are wrong. Those we think we are better than because they are not proud may actually be better than we are. This is a moral lesson for all to learn from.",

Wow I love this topic and it's fictional aspect, because this topic has really made me remember how the rich and the proud think too widely of themselves and feel everyone below their class, aren't living but surviving, this topic has made me remember my high school principal, who always taught us about contentment with a slogan that says \"WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE, YOU DON'T NEED\" this very phrase alone has thought me great contentment techniques back then in the boarding school.The world has made everything so classified that even we humans think so less of people we assume we're higher than and at the end forget everything is vanity and even the holy bible stated that, on the last day both the rich and the poor will be as one and we all will be buried below the earth and after death comes judgement. I hope we humans learn  to love ourselves and treat each other with love in our hearts and always be selfless Peace and love is the greatest.",

The Zoo kind of represents artificial areas created by humans irrespective of where it's located. But, I wonder if you still have traditional villages for example, in Western countries today. It seems Japanese and the Chinese still try to preserve such natural existence or way of living .",

Those we think we are better than because they are not proud may actually be better than we are. This is a moral lesson for all to learn from.Of course. In the fake world, those who live in it are programmed to make those who are in the natural look weak, poor, dumb, inferior etc . For example I often observe alot of low iq, foolishness and other vices (the natural ones are often accused of) in the fake world... But somehow the ones in the fake, manage to successfully exchange this attributes with the better/natural ones... That is, the better start believing what the other say they are and eventually becoming what others really are but say they are ... It's witchcraft, soccery and spell casting. That's is why it's important we don't feed from the system nor should we ever believe it.Quote from: Obari on October 13, 2022, 02:03:08 PMQuote from: Ucy on October 13, 2022, 12:00:33 PMThe leaders of the zoo say: \"let's us send grass to cows, bisons, antelopes etc in the forest and savannas for we heard the are starving, no green thing to eat.

I hope we humans learn  to love ourselves and treat each other with love in our hearts and always be selfless Peace and love is the greatest. Ofcourse, the classification is part of the divide and conquer. This is why it's important to create a culture that humbles the rich and honors the lowly and poor who are as important in societies.",
