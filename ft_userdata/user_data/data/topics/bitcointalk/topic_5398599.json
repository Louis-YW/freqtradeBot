And  they may be able to get them  from you too as it states in that document. QuoteMoreover, because custodially held crypto assets may be considered to be the property of a bankruptcy estate, in the event of a bankruptcy, the crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors. This may result in customers finding our custodial services more risky and less attractive and any failure to increase our customer base,discontinuation or reduction in use of our platform and products by existing customers as a result could adversely impact our business, operatingresults, and financial condition.What is interesting though is that Cathie Woods who is very much bullish in BTC bought Coinbase stocks when it dropped recently.",

Not seeing though that they will just immediately go bankrupt. They have been in the exchange niche already and had ventures outside if I'm not mistaken. So there is still some money coming in but due to the bear cycle is it expected that it might go down a bit as well. But come bull runs, like last year, Coinbase will make a lot of money again.",

They are simply spending more than the revenue they are generating, rather than facing any sort of security risk. They probably overdid it with advertising and staffing as they tried to capture market share. They'll now have to rein in the spending, which should be simple in comparison. It is rather shocking to see the price decline in their share since listing and naturally the latest price drops in crypto might put off new buyers in future. I'd be wary of storing any coins there based on the terms that they set.",

Only work if they loss isn't higher than their reserved insurance, if they loss more than their insurance... I doubt they can at least maintain their services and not abandon it like Mt.Gox.

Likely too many don't have a clue what \"Not your keys, not your coins!\" means. On the other hand, you have to keep in mind that people need to keep their computers and smartphones safe and clean to store and use their own wallets safely, unless they use hardware wallets properly. I have some doubts regarding the ability of safe computing of the \"average Joe/Jane\" even when they are in crypto.Quote from: pawanjain on May 14, 2022, 12:36:56 PMI think Coinbase rolled out this announcement at a wrong time since the market is currently in a down trend.People are in a panic already and this statement by Coinbase would have made people kind of paranoid.I have no words how poorly Coinbase communicated it, especially in present heated times.Quote from: pawanjain on May 14, 2022, 12:36:56 PMThe best thing for people to do is hold the coins on a non-custodial wallet but before doing that make sure you have enough knowledge about wallets and private keys.It has advantages and disadvantages to hold your funds in self-custody. You're in charge to have enough knowledge and ability to store your wallet(s) and keys safely. Sure, it's not rocket science. There's an obvious disadvantage when you have your funds in your own wallet(s): if market movement requires a timely reaction, e.g. to sell some amount of your coins you'll likely face mempool congestion and high fees required if many users have the same urge as you do. Probably it's good to keep some healthy balance how much you have in self-custody and how much you leave on the exchange. I have the majority in my own self-custody wallets and only a minor part on an exchange.",

YEARS LATER (EG see mtgox saga)with that said. although the stable coin drama caused some drama about liquidity of coinbase and other things. what seems to be happening here is certain people want to cause a bank run on bitcoin by trying to coax a withdrawal rush. thinking that the withdrawal rush would then leave the market order books lacking 'supply' to then cause their highschool dumb economic thoughts of a demand rise,.sorry but it is not that simple to think that less coin on an exchanges mysqyl BALANCE sheet, correlates to a orderbook, or vice versa.(alot of people store coin in coinbase, but never put it on orderbooks)but with all that said.if you are not a day trader that needs funds in an exchange each day. take it out. keep it on your own private key. if you are a day trader, well keep on trading, just be aware of the risks that if an exchange had to close, it could be years before you see any reimbursement. and that reimbursement wont be 100%",
