  "content": "I follow shark tank a lot and enjoy the creativity the show portrays. It got me thinking of a hypothetical situation which led to this thread.Imagine the year is 2010, you are a Shark Whale tank contestant using the pseudonym 'We are all satoshi'. At the time relatively no one has heard about Bitcoin and do not understand how it works. You are trying to convince some whales and institutional investors that putting their money into bitcoin is a wise financial decision and would bring more returns on their investment than all other ventures out there in value and utility.I think they would have 2 major questions:1. The Technology.2. Their stake.On the technology, one would talk about how efficient and effective the bitcoin network is and how it seamlessly allows financial transactions between one party and another. A demonstration there to create a wallet easily for one of the judges and send them some sats (showing it is divisible) would show how easy it is to use. You can also talk about the bitcoin whitepaper. Keeping it short and ending with the famous phrase would give lots of dramatic effect Â :Quoteâ€œ...If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.\"On their stake in it, being a decentralized technology, they do not get any whale privilege, you only own as much of bitcoin as you possess. No one can give you a contract or some paper work for it, not even satoshi.If you buy 10,000BTC you own 0.05% of the total supply,If you run a node or build a rig, you own a bit of consensus privilege or a bit of the total hashrate.Do you think any of them would have been convinced to invest back then?What reply would you give to their expected questions,why do we need an alternative to banks, or how can money work without regulationMaybe we can pick up one or two phrases to pitch Bitcoin to others, not particularly whales.- Jay -",

So, whoever doesn't understand the technology satoshi invented, ask questions only if they are interested. Right now, this forum is full of shit posters and bounty hunters. We write here to get paid for signature campaigns. But it wasn't like this back then. The forum was full of tech geek people. Those people had an interest, and they understood the technology. I don't think satoshi had to convenience anyone, as he said. Right now, How many of us know how bitcoin works? It becomes too easy to download wallet software and do transactions within a few minutes. We don't have to understand how it works. Most people consider Bitcoin as a way to become rich. The thought wasn't same back then. People gave more priority on Privacy and be their own bank.",

      "body": "If you already imagined the year 2010 as some kind of example, then we should know that back then it was not necessary to buy Bitcoin, considering that everyone could mine it with their personal computer and only 20 mined blocks a day would bring you as much as 1000 BTC. In other words, you only needed a little knowledge and curiosity if you wanted to invest in Bitcoin back then.However, I am not aware that at that early stage some famous people recognized Bitcoin as something worth investing in, although I know of some stories about how some \"famous\" people lost their BTC when Mt.Gox collapsed. Therefore, I conclude that there are few who know how to recognize the right opportunity in time, and it is not something that should be associated exclusively with Bitcoin.In addition to all of the above, I don't think it would be good if the rich understood in time what it was all about, because Bitcoin was not designed to be bought by rich individuals or companies, but to be something completely different. The later they realized, the better for everyone else - because it is better for 100 000 people to have 1 BTC each, than for one person to own everything.",

      "body": "Imagine if in early stages some real philanthropist got to bitcoin already. Indeed this will be controlled badly. Maynr there are some who realize it and still believe but would you think riches care if they arent gonna benefit a lot of money in that during the time definitely no. So I think these whales on bitcoin has deserved their position since they care on what Satoshi builds and understand how it works differently on the whales that playing the market now.",

Their first impression to be to dismiss it, they have already created a hack for the current financial system, why create another that is totally open to anyone. Whatever amount they had bought early on would have also been eventually absorbed by the market and their influence reduced, cause there are surely people who own hundreds and thousands of bitcoin.- Jay -",

Some people have the Bitcoin ban in their country and may have lost interest in the forum; it's not something to lament about; there are still those in the forum who still maintain the old ethos of the forum; that's also why the moderators, DT1 and DT2 members, are there; they can flag some shitposters who might not get a chance of being selected in any signature.

Perhaps Satoshi did not design the technology for everyone or for only one person, but for people who find it good to use.Mr.Strange ðŸ‘º",

Personally, I don't like shark tank, but I agree with you about the point they wouldn't care about the technology. They will ask and look if the project is already making money or not. I really think that they also would not find bitcoin interesting because of the risk involved in it back in 2010.",

What kind of risk are you talking about? In 2010, you could mine Bitcoin with a personal computer and the reward per block was 50 BTC. There wasn't any risk, it's just that most people didn't know about Bitcoin, or thought it was just one of a series of internet scams.",

I even thought that Bitcoin was like a physical asset then, but I am glad to be one of the beneficial users of Satoshi's technology (Bitcoin). Satoshi created Bitcoin in order to give ordinary people (like myself) the chance to be in total control of their financial lives in a decentralized manner. I learned that Bitcoin is an open-source project, and no one has the power to own or be in total control of it entirely. It is design for public, open for anyone to participate, so I don't need to wast a lot of time trying to convince a whale.I agree with you, Lucius. Bitcoin was created to give ordinary people the chance of taking financial control back from financial elites like the banks and other companies, not just one individual owning everything to them self.",
