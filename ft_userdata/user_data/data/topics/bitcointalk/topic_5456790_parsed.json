  "content": "Alik Bahshi «Corrupt wench of Imperialism»     In the days of the USSR, the phrase \"corrupt girl of imperialism\" referred to the new science of genetics, incomprehensible to the Kremlin ideologists of communism. True, cybernetics also fell under this definition, but that's another story. As for the science of heredity, it covers a rather vast area of all living things, including civilization. In the article \"People's fate, or each cricket has its own hearth\" I wrote that heredity is connected not only with the individual, but also with the fate of the people and determines its past and future. In a word, knowing the past, one can explain the present and predict the future. (1)      After Napoleon's Bonaparte, France seems to have forever lost the status of a strong European power. France was unable to resist England in the struggle for the possession of North America, France was squeezed out of Algeria and Morocco, France lost all its colonies in Southeast Asia. If England, having ceased to be an empire, reformatted its connection with the former colonies into the \"Commonwealth of Nations\", then France, clinging to the last, quarreled with all its former colonies. If the British, leaving the colonies, left everything they had created to the peoples there, then the French, on the contrary, even dug up telegraph poles. During the Second World War, after the surrender, France collaborated with Germany, if you remember the Vichy government. By the way, the word \"collaborationism\", which in French means cooperation, has since become a label for traitors, the hero of the First World War, Marshal Philip Peten, became the first collaborator and a symbol of betrayal. In this regard, I will spend an important moment from the events of the Second World War, after France signed an armistice with Germany, in July 1940 the British even had to engage in battle with the French fleet, which included five powerful battleships of the Dunkirk and Richelieu types. \", so that they do not get to the Germans. At that time, Great Britain was left alone in front of Germany and Italy, and Churchill was afraid of a significant replenishment of the already strong German fleet, which has two of the latest battleships, Bismarck and Tirpitz. In that naval battle, 1297 French sailors were killed and the battleship Dunkirk was sunk, the other battleship Richelieu was seriously damaged. The French do not like to remember this shameful episode of World War II. It is interesting to recall the sarcastic phrase of the head of the German delegation, Field Marshal Keitel, in the direction of the French when signing the act of surrender, “how did they defeat us too!?”         It is known that in military development France has always tried to maintain parity with Great Britain. Not infrequently, in matters of politics, the views of France diverged from those generally accepted in the West. The fickleness of France in relation to NATO deserves attention. So in 1966, France withdrew from NATO and returned only in 2009. Such political fluctuations are characteristic of France, and there is a noticeable dislike of the French towards the Anglo-Saxons, which I also had to face. So, when I first arrived at the Charles de Gaulle airport, I asked the local clerk a question in English, the only foreign language I knew, but he grumbled something in French and turned away. True, this was an isolated incident during my stay in France, but for some reason I remember it. Maybe I'm wrong, but I found an explanation for myself in the fact that the airport employee did not want to answer, pretending that he did not know English.      Thus, in the Karabakh conflict, France openly sided with Yerevan, despite the fact that all four UN resolutions clearly indicated the withdrawal of the occupying forces from the occupied regions of Azerbaijan. Today, because of France, Armenia, not deciding on the issue of choosing a patron, looks like Buridan's donkey (2), which is typical for the historical past of Armenians (3). To betray Russia, which created an Armenian state on the lands of Azerbaijan, a state that never existed in those parts of history, is quite in the spirit of the Armenians.       It would be a big mistake for Armenia to stop in choosing a patron instead of Russia on France with its changing political vector, and although France has long lost the status of an empire, counting on it is the same as counting on a corrupt girl of imperialism.      1.
