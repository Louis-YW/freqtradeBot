  "content": "Do you know what the worst part of the Plandemic was? It wasn’t the politicians, who will invent any grievance and exploit any crisis so long as it expands their power and lines their pockets. That kind of behavior is to be expected from politicians – especially those currently infesting the swamp.No. The worst part of the whole ridiculous affair was how a certain subset of people reacted to it. Those spineless cretins weren’t content to submit to inhuman demands made by lunatics who hate them. They wanted to force you to do the same! They enthusiastically volunteered as rats in a medical experiment, but couldn’t stand the thought of you staying safely behind on the other side of the glass.Don’t let the mask-kissers’ demonstration go in vain. Never forget how many people wanted to turn you into a second class citizen just because you aren’t a slave to alarmism. Remember how smugly they would gloat if you died of the kung fu bat flu. Don’t forgive them for begging the tyrants to create a police state.But most of all, ridicule them with the help of the best in the business: the one and only Ben Garrison! America’s last unafraid editorial cartoonist penned “The Masks Speak” so you can show midwit leftist bootlickers that you know what’s really on their minds.Check out The Masks Speak collection on Libertas Bella!",

      "body": "Face Masks are important but not for criminals and slaves. They should be great privacy tools for the innocent to safely navigate through a world movie scene with many watchers, cameras and other surveillance tools monitoring every single move you make. So, one of the best ways to preserve your privacy in such world is to become anonymous or hide your identity.I'm sure certain elite who were against mask were mostly worried about the security implications. It seems they don't trust the people they govern with the masks...They used \"Covid Hoax\" and Herd Immunity as excuse to discourage the masks. I also use them to protect the nose from toxic air and too much dust.",
