Let's see if you can reach your ROI.Honestly, I mine on their pool before but they pay me less than mining on other pools.

When in fact it's just a waste of time, like maintenance rate increase every time that you will no longer get any profit because you will end up paying such fees in the end. Even the withdrawal fees is a bit high too. Well, that was my experience on so called \"legit cloudmining\" before, but lets see how binance will prove this kind of service is different from others.",

Although there are names that have earned more or less a good reputation like ViaBTC or NiceHash, the overall impression is that cloud mining is almost like a scam. I doubt that CZ is clueless of the dirty reputation of cloud mining. He must be aware of it. But he's still pursuing this, and I don't know why. Perhaps he just wants to make more money. He must have assumed that with the Binance name, it could easily attract investors. This doesn't come as surprise to me, though. CZ is an aggressive businessman. He makes the most of every opportunity. This cloud mining business is just another addition to an already long list.",

Or maybe they have very large mining farms with free electricity or so.Upon checking, I could see they only have one product up that investors can buy which is starting from $5.85 and the mining I guess will start in May, 2023 for that product.

In terms of profitability, it's difficult to say whether Binance's cloud mining is more profitable than joining a mining pool. So, it really depends on a number of factors, including the cost of electricity in your area and the current price of Bitcoin. However, it's worth noting that cloud mining typically involves higher fees than mining in a pool, which can eat into your profits. While it's possible to earn decent mining rewards with cloud mining, it's also a high-risk, high-reward proposition that is not suitable for everyone.",
