Unless the name means something in some other language, it's a bit bad imo2. \"Monitok ensures that your crypto assets are always secure with a built-in decentralized wallet that nobody but you can access.\" Is it really decentralized? I doubt it. You probably meant non-custodial?3. DEXs can have price aggregation and friendly UX. Don't unnecessarily skew the CEX/DEX/HEX comparison just for you to be in favor.4. How are you better than Uniswap wallet or Rainbow wallet?",

      "body": "Hi, That's a good question, thanks.While we don't offer complete anonymity or a \"wild west\" approach, we do review transactions when needed to prevent activities like money laundering or terrorism support. However, it's important to highlight that assets are stored in a self-custodial wallet. This means users can interact directly with the blockchain. If suspicious activity is detected, we might restrict access to the app, but unlike many centralized exchanges, we can't freeze or interfere with transactions. There's always some chatter and apprehension regarding centralized exchanges (CEXes), especially following significant fraud events. While decentralized exchanges (DEXes) offer a degree of self-custody, they can be challenging for newcomers and tend to be cautiously approached by regulators. As for \"HEX\", it does seem that the market is leaning in that direction, potentially bridging concerns of both users and regulators.Can you mention some of these projects leaning in the same direction?Quote from: rat03gopoh on October 13, 2023, 04:17:04 PMAllright, another project that wants to combine CEX and DEX together.

I think soon enough, we will revise the content on the page.Recently, we made a thread on Twitter (X) listing current features: https://twitter.com/MonitokHEX/status/1710296940657754496 We don't have access to private keys. We simply offer a backup feature that allows users to save their private key in a digital format, either on their phone or on a private cloud service like iCloud/Google Drive. It's up to the user to decide where to store the key.

As a platform is under the guidance of EU regulations, we must comply by ensuring access is granted only to verified users. However, the true ownership of assets always remains with them.Put it simply, if users steer clear of any suspicious activities, they are free to use the app - hold, send, receive, swap, convert assets and etc. And no matter what, users will always have access to their private keys. At most, we can only request restricted access to our app and report the user to authorities.

Our decentralization part is ownership of the assets; we don't promise anonymity. DEXes has its own flaws, especially if you are starting or ending with FIAT.

The platform’s code is still closed source, meaning that you may be able to access the private key, so why not be like Uniswap and have a smart contract that can be controlled from a wallet instead of generating the user’s private key.Your platform now increases the risks on the user's part without providing additional features.
