Or how is Dangote business affecting Nigeria than he is employing people and increasing the country's gross domestic products?Charles-Tim my man, I must tell you from di way see am, Dangote and di ruling class nai dey suffer Nigerians. I don't know if you are from Northern part of the country. I never read di op Tori sef but your comment just call my attention. Dangote as the richest man in Africa, has a very big influence in Nigeria politics. That means he can tell di president to regular the goods and services in the country but Dangote sell is product higher in Nigeria than the way he is selling them in other countries. If Elephant Cement is still selling in the Nigeria, it would not sell #6,000 per bag but Dangote is selling one bag 6k. Ibito cement is much more better than Dangote cement yet the Nigerian Senate said, Ibito cement should not be sold. Dangote Refinery at the North is exporting fuel to other countries right now but Nigeria fuel price is very high.Tinubu did not remove fuel subsidy, fuel subsidy was removed by Buhari and Tinubu came and implemented it. They know what they are doing. For me in Nigeria Dangote is my biggest problem. Cement is too cost and now he is taking over the fuel industry and fuel price is on the peak. Dangote is the problem.",

Rupert overtook Dangote on Thursday, June 15 and has an estimated net worth of $11.7 billion, according to Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires ranking at 10 a.m. ET on June 21. This marks the first time that Rupert ranks as the richest person in Africa; he's been on Forbes' list of billionaires since at least 1997. Dangote, 66, stands in second place behind Rupert, 73, among African billionaires with a fortune estimated at $10.4 billion. That’s a $3.7 billion drop from the $14.1 billion net worth Dangote had on Wednesday, June 14.But with the look of things, it is possible that Dangote may take over the Africa richest again.Quote from: Mate2237 on June 27, 2023, 10:45:36 PMIf Elephant Cement is still selling in the Nigeria, it would not sell #6,000 per bag but Dangote is selling one bag 6k.Elephant cement was selling at a higher price than Dangote cement, although said to be of better quality too.Quote from: Mate2237 on June 27, 2023, 10:45:36 PMDangote Refinery at the North is exporting fuel to other countries right now but Nigeria fuel price is very high.Did you mean that Dangote refinery is exporting fuel to the North? It sounds like Dangerous refinery is located, or part of his refinery is located in the North. Dangote refinery is located in Lekki Lagos which is southwestern part of the country.

It’s not surprising to find business moguls sponsor and give their financial support to campaign rallies, do you think those monies spent are because the businessmen believe in the ideas of the politician? No! Deals have been made in the background and the unsuspecting public are played for fools. In Nigeria, it’s even worse because Dangote has successfully monopolize various industries in the private sector, how can any government say no to Dangote? He’s more powerful than any politician.",

I don't want to go into deep in economics. The Nigerian State from inception has not been controlled by the ruling class but the bourgeoisies. But who are the bourgeoisies in the state is unknown. Those who control the colonial economy are the same group of people now in Nigeria. Dangote is also inflicting pain to the citizens of Nigeria by inflating the prices of his product in the country.",

See, make I tell you something whether investment come from politicians or not o that wan no concern dangote wetin him dey after na him business and the law no stop am from selling shares to the public and the law as well does not stop Nigerians from investing in businesses or buying shares. Business is business and there is nothing anybody could do about it. So do away with that mentality of who park money go invest or not. To be frank with you dangote has done much more than what some prominent Nigerians could do. His investment are all here in Nigeria. Foreign investors are coming into the country just because of his business prowess. He has created employment in various industries cut across  Nigeria. Still yet, with the currency devaluation and his drop in line of richest man in Africa he never bothered himself about it. Which Nigerian business man would have such gots for that.",
