I can meet user X to do a trade and possibly depending on the location and time grab a beer / dinner.Getting 5 or 6 is a lot more difficult. I see it a lot with personalty clashes. I might like you and this person and that other one. BUT THAT other one, nah I have no desire to meet up with him, I'll pass on this meeting get me next time.Happens all the time with the motorcycle club I ride with. Big meetings are OK, and there are a lot of us that hang out in groups of 2 or 3. But try to get 6 people to do something, very difficult.-Dave",

Why Bitcoin users are afraid of see each other physical?Do you even understand the whole point of Bitcoin before you do such move? Clearly you don’t that Bitcoin main goal is a full privacy for finances. Bitcoin is decentralized and it doesn’t need our full details to process our transaction so government can’t watch us. Why the heck people that advocates privacy will be willing to meetup others while they can do all the conversation anonymously on forum like Bitcointalk.org.Probably you are endorsing the wrong coin if you want to so meetups among anonymous members.",

Well, I will like to put it straight to you that many are here not because they want to gain knowledge or add value to Bitcoin, they are here for the money, and it's not so cool. That could only explain what you experienced with those people. Still, it should still not stop you from propagating Bitcoin in your own little way.Like myself, I've been coaching some people about BTT and BTC, only that I am not such that broadcast it here. You can do it also, it does not necessarily mean it must be done in groups.",

There are people who want to stay privately and hide themselves from the crowd but there are others who want to expose themselves to community. They are influencers, KOLs, it is just you have yet met such people in your community.QuoteGoing to three years now, am trying to see some of the bitcoiners in my area to discuss with them how to join hands together to promote Bitcoin in the society but they said they prefer discussing it online than see each other physical.Are they ashame to be a bitcoiners? or they are among the people that think Bitcoin is a scam? No, if they consider themselves as scam, they did not invest money in Bitcoin.People who don't want to show themselves probably knowing about the rule \"Not your keys not your coins\". If they don't say they are bitcoiners, there are less chances and risk that they will be targets of hackers or bad people who can try to exploit their careless to steal bitcoins.Each person have different reasons but I don't see that it is bad to not reveal ourselves as bitcoiners.",

Just make sure you didn't open up a silly discussion or ask them how they earn their money because for sure some of people will get tired about what traits you have shown to them.",

I completely agree with you on this one. Trusting a project and doing your due diligence (DYOR) is key in the crypto world. If the team behind the project is still active and working on its development, then there's always hope for a rebound. But if the project has stagnated and the team has disappeared, then it might be time to move on and look for better opportunities. The crypto space is always evolving and there are plenty of promising projects out there, so keep an eye out!",

For the those you assume you called to join hands in other to promote bitcoin in your environment if they are crypto minded they will definitely try to form a quorum with you. So in summary i have understand that so many people draft out fake information here to enable them to earn merit through this kind of story, but try not to be one.",

There is also the possibility that these people you have reached out to are not interested in doing anything but stacking up the bitcoins they have in their possession. Because a bitcoiner is not interested in your joint project, or seeing physically does not make them unfriendly. People are in bitcoins for long term purposes, not because they are interested in making new friends.",

Why Bitcoin users are afraid of see each other physical?Everyone is different. Not everyone will get along. That's just life. Asking people to join you in promoting Bitcoin? In most places people will knock back that idea even if they believe in Bitcoin because in a lot of places, promoting or educating average people about Bitcoin is more often than not a hopeless cause. For every 5 or 10 people, maybe one will take in the information you are sharing and become a part of the movement. I don't like those odds, so I don't actively spread the word. Though I don't hide my knowledge about it either. When I am asked, I talk. I believe one day everyone will be forced to use Bitcoin and even these days more people are asking. The best thing you can do is increase your knowledge and learn how to propagate this information in an easy to digest way to a normal person. Then you are asked, convey.",

Why Bitcoin users are afraid of see each other physical?You are asking the wrong questions. I don't think it's appropriate to ask about bitcoiners in shame or call btc a scam, and certainly not about fear of seeing each other.The unwillingness of bitcoiners to advertise their hobbies in the real world is primarily due to their own safety and foresight not to fall under the sight of intruders. The easiest way not to be robbed is to keep the information about the possession of cryptocurrencies secret. Privacy plays a major role here.To discuss the conditions for promoting bitcoin, it is enough to communicate online. Is it possible to do this without a personal meeting? I'm sure yes.",
