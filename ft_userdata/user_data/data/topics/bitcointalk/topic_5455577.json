      "body": "Any version of cgminer compiled with Icarus (autogen.sh --enable-icarus) should be able to run this. But yeah the Block Erupter is ten years old, and about three orders of magnitude slower than current USB miners, which are over two orders of magnitude slower than standard industrial miners, so pools aren't really set up to register work volumes that small anymore. Cgminer stats would show you what's going on, but poolside? Kano's solo pool might be granular enough to handle 333MH/s on stats, maybe?Another SHA coin with a much lower difficulty, you'd be a larger percentage of the network/pool and more likely to see stats. What's the project?",

And is it possible to somehow run this ASIC on Raspberry or Orange, so as not to use Windows?Your miner is working fine.  It is hashing at 335Mhash, which is correct for that miner.  That pool is showing it offline because your miner hasn't found a share meeting the pool's minimum difficulty, yet, and that is because your miner is only hashing at 335Mhash's, that is old GPU speed.It isn't broke so don't fix it.  You have accomplished your mission.  Your old miner is mining.It is not finding blocks, only reporting that blocks are being found.Edit:  You can try mining on Kano.is, it has an 8k minimum difficulty and will adjust down to 442.  Your best share is 128k so that would have submitted a share.  However Kano doesn't allow GPU's so his pool may ban you for being GPU speed.  You can also try solo.ckpool.org it has similar minimum difficulty and adjustments.Edit2: Looking at your screen shot again, with my glasses, I see that it has submitted a share and the pool is showing you an estimated hash rate based on that one share submission.  So the pool says it is working as well.  So don't get wrapped around the axle about the offline thing as that is only because of the slow share submission rate.Your miner is working so just bask it the warm glow of your success.",

And is it possible to somehow run this ASIC on Raspberry or Orange, so as not to use Windows?Yes you can compile cgminer for the ARM CPU units and there might even be some pre-compiled ones out there, never actually checked.BUT you will need a powered USB hub, those units do not put out even close to enough power though the USB to run a stick miner.AND if you are doing this for a class keep in mind it's a lot easier to find a PC running windows then a RPi if you have to or want to recreate it.-Dave",

But you really start to run out of overhead quickly since the stock power supply is only 15 watts.And if you are using a clone, like the orange PI you have to configure the higher power output for the USB (it's just 1 line in the config) You are correct it CAN work, but for a few bucks more why deal with the potential issues. I'm not talking one of the Gekkoscience 8 Port $100 units but any sub $20 one that has a power plug that will give a couple of amps to it.-Dave",
