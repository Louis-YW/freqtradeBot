When I was buying Eth, both Eth and BTC were up, but they are both down. If I waited until Eth was up, it would be more than likely that BTC would also be up since BTC moves first, so at this point, it probably doesnt matter too much to make a huge difference. With Linear thinking, Eth would be back up to $4500-$5000 and BTC would stay the same. lol, not happening.",

If you don't want to sell at a big loss that is happening to the coin that you have then the only option is to keep holding it until Bitcoin is bullish because that will also affect the price of the altcoin that you are currently holding, maybe you can speculate by selling the altcoin and directly buy bitcoin save it for the next 1-2 years to benefit from rising BTC prices but the profit is not large because the losses from selling altcoins are reduced but of course, your initial capital will experience an increase, it's just what percentage of your capital will increase depending on your patience to save btc that you have bought, but your decision should have been by analyzing the market first, also taking into account whether re-staking it will reduce losses while waiting for the altcoin price to rise",

I know many people will advise you to sell ETH and switch to BTC immediately, as most people here are bitcoin maximalists. But I will speak my mind about your situation. ETH is not too bad to hold, and even its returns will be better than bitcoin these days. If you look back at the 2021 bull season, you will see that ETH's returns were much better than BTC's. Second, if you sell ETH and convert to BTC without loss, then that's the right thing to do, but if you have to accept too much loss when converting, it really shouldn't be.",

If I wait till its up, its likely that BTC will be up too.If Bitcoin reclaims its all time high, it will be about x2 from today price. If Ethereum reclaims its all time high, it will be more than x2 from today price. With smaller marketcap, Ethereum will give you bigger profit in its 2024 and 2025 bull run. If Bitcoin rises two times to $120k, Ethereum can rise to $10k in next big bull run. The bull run of Ethereum can not come without Bitcoin halving and Bitcoin bull run.Because you are losing 50% in Ethereum, if you sell now, you should hold it.",

This will probably help us to find a better solution instead of just suggesting you hold on until a new ATH appears. But maybe, if you have extra budget then it's better to accumulate as much as you can afford. ETH will follow the bitcoin trend, but if you have any doubts then invest in bitcoin instead.",

Why not hodl your 2021 altcoins investment down and use another money to invest in bitcoin now, try to buy and hodl the more, the current value or rate we are now is not what will continue to be especially now that we are getting closer to the bullrun, which means there's the confidence that bitcoin will get to the all time high and beyond in due time only if one can hodl while other cryptocurrencies invested too would have same opportunity to rise along with bitcoin soon, so my advice for you is to continue to hodl no matter the dip or what's happening currently, don't loose focus.",

I see from your post you still learning the system and coins. My question is if you unstake and swap to btc are you intending to sell immediately because you talk of 50% loss so why swap to btc when you can unstake your etheruem and sell direct and moreover btc transaction fee is still a little higher than what it is in etheruem. It will be of no investment value if you unstake, swap and sell in bitcoin. The second point is if you want to swap and hodl in btc for longtime well it could be better investment idea because I believe btc has profit potential than etheruem. So by hodling btc on a longtime, you won't talk of 50% loss but maybe profit at the time shortly after halving.",

What's the sense of selling at a loss if you do know that you'll be selling at a loss? You might just want to wait until you get a break-even or buy more with your spare money so that you don't have to convert and take the loss.That's the best thing that you can do right now, buy some BTC using cash. 50% loss is too much and you're not going to sacrifice that for the sake of buying bitcoin. Well, I guess that's the easiest choice you can make, no need for any sacrificial sale at losses only if you've got spare.",
