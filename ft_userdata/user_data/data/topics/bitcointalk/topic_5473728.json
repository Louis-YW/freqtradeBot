  "content": "The forum is mainly concerned about newbies, and a lot of beginners' questions has been tackled by intelligent and worthy top ranked members. As a newbie it feels good deep down our thoughts to craft a difficult looking thread to please the high ranked members. But, that doesn't make us newbies. Though, silly or repeated questions are not welcomed in the forum. Yet, they're some easy questions we would want to ask as newbies, but because it makes us sound as true novice, we'd want to bypass asking them. As we'd want to show the forum members, we're doing enough research and reading about bitcoin and the forum entirely. And, most times such threads, centering on teaching, may not help us as newbies because what we tend to teach we can't relate or follow up in the discussions. Such things, has caused many newbies to fall for plagiarism and as well dumping their threads without participating in the discussions happening under the thread. Being a newbie in the forum is almost a one time experience for every member and we must behave as one. Feel free to ask those questions that sounds and looks too simple to you. That's mainly what other members would entertain and send us reasonable advises and responses to. Thereby, gradually helping your learning process in the forum, with lesser stress. Coining out a thread on what we don't fully understand, just to stand out, and look like a very intelligent newbie may not help our growth in the forum. Because this section is mostly visited by every member to entertain and answer questions from newbies. And because most basic bitcoin knowledge may have skipped our minds we tend to refresh our memories here, by providing those answers to simple questions. Hence, I'd encourage newbies to always come up with those questions, which they think is too basic or simple and need not to be asked. Feel like a newbie as it's a one time experience here, you'd learn faster when you admit and accept being a newbie. I've seen newbies creating long copy and paste threads, which ends up not being attended to because of the plagiarism and the volume of the thread, and as well the OP not following up with what they've said to back up the knowledge shared. And when after investing hours creating those threads, the applauds they expected doesn't appear, they'll feel not being good enough. Enjoy the process.",

These are a lot of factors that's bothering around newbies thread questions. I recall plenty times my threads were batched with different opinions that sucks all because it has been discussed many times why asking again, for the newbie it was just a honest question's waiting to get a an accommodating reply that should be welcoming but no... Old member have to show they are old members  In the forum the newbie ignorance is what every member of the forum had passed through and we all understands the challenges that tag along that circle and one of those challenges is the fear of not making mistakes wanting to impress the older guys in the forum. What I think is no newbie should be scared of making mistakes for it's from them that we learn faster than when anyone drops a random reply in our thread.",

You are right mate, I know how many days, even got to a month that I kept watching and learning about the activities here before I was able to make threads and even reply topics here it really isn't easy at all as everything will look so scanty in the eyes like it feels like someone who is in another part of the world as it isn't what people outside this forum are thinking that you will be thinking, your approach and lifestyle begins to change as soon as one join this life changing forum. Your discussion with people changes and tend to even interact more with people here than outside here.

Its no shame in asking the basic questions, we have all been there at some point.  Forget tryin' to sound smart by copying long posts - keep it real and ask what you really wanna know and  the learning journey goes smoother when you speak your mind.  We have all been at the start before so there is no judgment here.  Just open yourself up to learning and enjoy the ride.  Heres to all you newbies out there - You got this!",

Enjoy the process.  That's part of the mistake they never thought about before making and never tried to go through the process of becoming more knowledgeable on the forum. Most of them probably want to be seen instantly showing their feet at a much higher level and ignore how they should start, maintain and not think quickly about something they want to achieve. When they have relevant knowledge perhaps the community will try to help each other and if they fail to demonstrate knowledge it will end up with inconsistencies that lead to giving up.For me enjoying the process must be done slowly because it will be much better for safety. When we know what to do, it will be easy to achieve the targets we want to achieve. Read more and participate in the discussion process because that is how we will develop much more. After that, just learn where we should be so that the community can help us to rise to a much higher rank.",

A man made this statement and I think it has great application to what you just said here, the man said, never try to speak or show off when your superior is educating you about something, it is a disrespect to him and will hinder him from telling you more.

Especially in this forum, it only gets easier if we follow it consistently. Trying to take the whole learning at once would be hectic and enormous. And I can relate with the way the this forum changes our behaviors and contributes to our interactive stamina with other people, especially when discussing about bitcoin. The wealth of knowledge shared in this forum, helps members to at least contribute to any discussion in the real world. It's quite an interesting place to learn and spend our time.",

So I do more good than harm of reading, answering and asking questions that Is of utmost interest Agueably no doubt about that, one thing you should know is that creating a thread does no mean teaching high ranked members, sometimes might just be a kind of question thread because it not all time you comment on peoples post. Sometimes you create a thread of what you are passing through and need advice. It's only those who feel so porpose that will create a thread of advising people than learning. Truly you are right about many newbie who tend to teach while just coming to this forum newly. What I see is that most of them has experience about crypto currency before coming here so they always think the know everything without knowing that her is the central gravity of crypto currency.Sometimes newbie always find it difficult to ask we question is because of the attitude of most high ranked members, there are certain high ranked members with less knowledge or lack manner of approach. They tend to ubderate you base on your rank and it makes the newbie less or inferior. But even as that one need to concentrate. Because any public organization you must find these certain people of that inmartured so you just pas by such people and move on otherwise you get yourself into trouble by the use of abusive words. I believe this platform is a place for great learning. I am not excluded in what am saying because am also a newbie so no matter what happens we will still improve. Thanks to all those higher ranked knowledgeable, understandable, interactible and communicable members who have devoted there time to educate us without bullieing us, we are forever grateful.",
