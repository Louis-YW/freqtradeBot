      "body": "The way of presenting Bitcoin as an investment may be wrong, especially since the average joe, who working 8 hours per day, works hard to collect cash and rarely or never invests in his life finds that losing money is easy, so if he buys Bitcoin and the price begins to decline, he will most likely sell his investments.If you are in a country with many ways to invest, start with a low-risk investment advice and include the explanation to understand how Bitcoin works, why it is a high-risk investment, and how these high risks can be converted into profits.But if you are in a country where there is rarely investment, I think that inflation may be a sufficient reason to invest in countries and stay away from the local currency, and here Bitcoin may be a good investment if it is long-term.",

There are so many African countries that have had a very deep rooted culture of conservativeness, this simple reason has affected the way Africans are react to new ideas and innovations and so on. Bitcoin is more domicile in the Asia, Europe and American, hence the level of awareness there is on the high side.This has equally given scammers and manipulators the edge to cleverly dupe innocent people in an unscrupulously way as they open their minds to accept the technology. It has also given leeway to fake news and speculations hovering around the space that beclouds the minds of innocent people.To solve the problem problem is to get as many people as possible to enlighten the citizens on the basic knowledge of Bitcoin. Also to significantly have stakeholders within the coffers of thr government that will introduce policies that will open more doors and awareness on the digital currencies and the Fintech industry.",

What pulls them towards fraud and profit loss is their impression of Bitcoin as an investment; easy and instant profit. They're only seeing how huge the profit was earned from the previous pumps but not the risk endured due to sudden price changes and wrong entry and exit points. Investment is simple; invest at the right price and sell it for a higher price. But why do people still lose money not only in this industry? 'coz of lack in planning and right execution of actions. It is easy to tell the good sides or advantages of Bitcoin but it would be difficult doing the right things because of circumstances and different vision towards this technology. Some are expecting instant profit and once they encounter a loss, panic will take place and will eventually push them to sell early. Sometimes the simplest things are the ones we often forgot in this field of investment.",

I believe that your sample is too small and such statistical surveys need to be carried out with a large array of data (respondents) in order to obtain true data. And besides, the respondents should answer honestly, and not for the sake of jokes and fun, or to leave them behind, as often happens, but really honestly.How exactly were they deceived that made them consider bitcoin a scam? If at the market an apple seller deceived me during the sale, this is not a reason for me to refuse the apples and consider them damaged goods, right.But you shouldn’t force people to do anything, especially to understand bitcoin. If people want, they themselves will try to understand the idea of bitcoin. How many of you were attracted to bitcoin here because someone forced you to understand bitcoin correctly or talked about bitcoin with you ? Here's your answer.",

If no what else more can we do easily to make them actually get the idea of Bitcoin.Take note that you don't have to make people understand BTC, for your own safety it is better to keep the discussion only between friends and family and only explain further to whomever shows interest.The only way to avoid being scammed as a bitcoiner is if you understand the BTC network, so that's the way to introduce it to people, make them understand that \"BTC is purely p2p electronic cash\" that is decentralized, censorship resistant and permissionless, they must understand all these and basic things like wallets, addresses, keys and seed phrases, too many people don't know safe wallets to use, but they own BTC, that's because they learnt they can double their money long before they learnt about BTC wallets.",

If no what else more can we do easily to make them actually get the idea of Bitcoin.The demography of the people whom you talk to about Bitcoin should determine the approach to help them understand about it. When you talk to them about Bitcoin I want you to present a balanced view point about Bitcoin in comparison to fiat. Why so is because you want them at the end of the day to make an informed decision based on facts and not on mere sentiments. Introducing them to the Bitcoin talk forum or any other Bitcoin community is not enough. You should go further to introduce them to books, podcasts, courses and interviews about Bitcoin.",

Is introducing them into Bitcoin talk enough ? If no what else more can we do easily to make them actually get the idea of Bitcoin.The first approach matters a lot to people. For those who believed Bitcoin was a get-rich-quick scheme, I believe it was based on what they learned about it the first time.If you want people to view Bitcoin from different perspectives, you need to start by teaching them what you want them to know about it first. For those who already have a wrong idea about it, you need to create awareness of what it truly is. Creating awareness means you will have to teach them about it with illustrations and guidelines on how it should be done, and what Bitcoin really is, not just the name. You also need to teach them about the volatility, security, and other things that it has that one should know before they can invest their money in it.I also believe it's misinformation that makes most people not invest in Bitcoin, as the majority of people look at the volatility and security in the wrong direction, which discourages them from taking a bold step. But one thing I believe is that anyone who is willing to learn something just needs a little guidance, and they will pick up the research themselves. We don't need to teach everyone everything; self-research is also important to quick learning and understanding about something.",

If no what else more can we do easily to make them actually get the idea of Bitcoin.There have been a lot of discussions on this topic before and many people have shared their insightful ideas to start a discussion. I will not mention any of those threads links here but I will share my suggestion. I also make one topic which elaborates totally, well for me it elaborates totally to teach someone about BTC. You should check this thread out. To Understand the Potential of BTC, What we Must Know?You should not only read my post; instead, read the whole thread for better exposure. Besides this suggestion, I would recommend you teach them about BTC and how it is different from banking and traditional finance. The reason they are afraid to get into BTC is that in some countries, it is banned, they also think of it as a rich scheme, which is just a lack of knowledge. I do not want to get into the debate about knowledge.And I really liked the idea of bringing them onto this forum. I mean, they will definitely learn new things here, and after spending some time, they will learn about BTC, and they will understand your words to them.",

Here's your answer.A survey conducted on a small group of people can provide inaccurate information. You are right about bitcoin. dishonest behavior of an individual can not represent the value or utility of a product or concept. People who think Bitcoin is a scam don't know much about Bitcoin or have had any bad experiences with it so they think the whole industry is bad which is wrong. Forcing someone to understand something is not the right approach. We should create a friendly environment where information about Bitcoin will be easily accessible and spread awareness about its benefits in certain scenarios.",

If no what else more can we do easily to make them actually get the idea of Bitcoin.I think it's quite difficult to understand BTC properly, since we still don't know many things about BTC: we don't know who is the mastermind behind blockchain projects, we dont know the main hodlers, we cant predict the ways of blockchain ecosystem development. That's why nearly all the people consider BTC just as a way to earn fiat as quickly as is possible. And that's why adoption level is still low despite affordable transaction speed level (however, in case of elevation of adoption level we will surely need more miners and more internet connection facilities).",

If no what else more can we do easily to make them actually get the idea of Bitcoin.You are right, but first of all, think for a second: why did you want them to invest in BTC? Why do you want them to get into BTC or crypto? Let's say someone near or far from me asks me to invest or spend some time or money in this. I will definitely doubt him first of all. After doubting, I will say, \"No, I cannot spend the money in BTC.Because in the way of learning, you must have said them. Invest only with money that you are not afraid to lose. And by saying that, you just raised another red flag in their hearts, and now they might not trust you or the way you are bringing them into crypto. We should not teach someone about Bitcoin until they show their own interest.But if you are too good and want to help people make some extra money, you also want them to lose some extra money too. Then you must at least tell them about it and clear their doubts by offering them a free consultation. Show them the Explorers, SPV walls, and nodes. And some other little things that could open their minds to new technologies, and after seeing them, they will definitely agree with not saying it's some quick-rich scheme.",

This serves as the initial step for newcomers to safeguard themselves against potential scams, as the landscape of cryptocurrency fraud techniques has grown increasingly diverse. Presently, the primary influence leading someone to fall victim to deception is the allure of substantial profits.As individuals well-versed in Bitcoin, it is incumbent upon us to educate everyone about the importance of not readily trusting investment models that promise significant returns with minimal effort and a brief timeframe.
