(there are many ways to create unfunded units, steal, de-value, de-peg his favoured network units/value on his favoured network)but hey. it will take him years to realise his faulty network he loves has the flaws he initially called out on in this topic. but instead of learning, he just wants to whinge and cry that someone is pointing out the flaws of his favoured network of private partnership agreements of IOU unsettled value that the wider network does not see or associate or agree or account or verifynow thats been said. back to the topic creators ideaan individual creating a \"baker coin\" has no value. it becomes a hardship to try to get acceptance. and the baker needs acceptance for it to gain value and utility beyond his own friends group",

He simply melted bars of gold and silver into his own form of money (coins), and used it within his own local economic system to buy and sell things.Tokens of barter and trade might be legal. It might be possible to develop a system using that as a foundation. Although, I don't know if there are many with the will or resources to tackle that type of challenge.",
