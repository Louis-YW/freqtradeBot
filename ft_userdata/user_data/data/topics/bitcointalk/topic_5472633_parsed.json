Are you already Bitcoin investor before joining this forum? Why I asked the question because with your post history I conclude that you are crypto newbie but not you are given same crypto newbies some Bitcoin tips (wow).However, it's good to have you in the forum, your tips are good, it will help many crypto newbies to be safe if they don't know a shit about Bitcoin.",

Then the case of actually starting off with something you can afford to lose is simply the best option because so many people think that holding Bitcoin for investment is actually easy but the truth is that it's easier said than done because holding your coins requires alot discipline that won't involve you selling off during any dip in the Market.",

For the fact that you are a newbie does not warrant you to be ignorant of some certain ethics that you as a newbie must observe here before engaging. So far you have been flooding the thread without courtesy. As a newbie you are, you are supposed to take out time here to see how things are done sequentially and orderly and not by all these spam posts.I do not know your motive of all these posts you have created on a straight but courtesy demands that you do the right thing and follow instructions of to he platform as it is what keeps a platform going.",

Our people say 1+1 na two, any thing wey u fit add to that one wey you get go count as something added to the system.",

      "body": "I think GiftedMAN created \"Newbies Stop Teaching When You Need to Learn.\" Because of newbies like yourself. It's not bad to create a topic, but creating threads that are less meaningful is really not wise, or even a better way of phishing for merit, because it seems that's what your intentions are. You have been spamming, and the thing you get for spamming is to get on the ignor list of some members who you might have even earned merit from. If you read through your other threads, then you will see my advice; follow it, and you will be a better newbie. Let your enthusiasm be for positivity and not spamming around; be focused on learning.",
