Well, this is bad if left uncontrolled but it's pretty normal in gambling, that's why we have to set a limit always and commit on that. Being responsible is not easy but we should practice this all the time to avoid any financial problem and gambling addiction.",

I guess you can count it as \"going over budget\" since I only usually play 1-2 hours and call it quits. But sometimes, you enjoy so much and win so much that it's just hard to end the session, though there are instances wherein I just max bet and hope for the worst just to get done for the day. Nowadays I try to develop a hobby that will force me to not go over my 1-2 hours session of dice, and hopefully I get the grasp of it.",

Ever from then I never take any game as a professional advise from anyone else, maybe I have to go through it myself and determine if it was worth putting much resources.Lastly everyone should learn how to predict a game by their selves instead taking any games from professional body's.",

I originally had set limits even before since I know how scary it can be if you go past the normal sessions and just go crazy into gambling. It was rather difficult for my wallet at the time so I had no choice but to gradually adjust myself and try to limit it to a level where I can be comfortable, as well as get used to only limiting myself to proper levels. Back then it was rather normal for me to cut my living expenses to add more money to my gambling sessions. I have had some lucky months where I win big, but the losses were still bigger in comparison.",

Generally people who are addicted to gambling, lose their all financial savings, so you should consider yourself lucky OP, that this didn’t happen to you.To get away with this addiction, try to spend time with your loved ones, especially friends and family. This will definitely help to get over the gambling addiction.",

      "body": "Not as an adult, but as a teenager me and my group of friends were allowed to gamble in a slot machine (which was illegal because we were underage). Once I won the jackpot, which at that time would have been 10,000 pesetas, and that got me hooked. In the end, luckily I didn't have much money at the time and if I spent my pocket money, I didn't have any money to go out. I ended up leaving it by force. Then when I grew up I understood the mathematics behind gambling and the bets I have made have been quite rational, so you can never trust and think that you are not going to have problems with gambling, although I see it as extremely unlikely at this point. The stories we see on this forum make us realise that it's not that uncommon what you are telling us.",

And the hardest part is that we continue to lost the game and now we have no money to play and then think at night on how we will get the money so that we will continue to gamble the next day.",

Thankfully I was able to stop, accept my loss, understand that money was gone and that there wasn't anything to do on that moment to recover it. Actually it wasn't easy to think like that, but thinking about the situation on the present moment I feel much better about my decision, because I believe to have made the right or the less harmful one.",

The good thing is that you can get out of anything:Quote from: philipma1957 on August 26, 2022, 03:42:11 AMI am a compulsive gambler.I did two intentional drug overdoses trying to kill myself.I also suffered with acute psychosis along with ptsd for 10 years.  I had a bad life style age 15-28But I quit gambling.stopped using drugsmet a girl married her in 1986.still with her now in 2022.So if my life is like a vinyl record after some shitty songs the rest are much better.So you can help yourself.

Although I am normally successful in controlling myself, there are really moments when I end up betting huge amounts desperately. Sometimes, it ends up good. But most of the time, it simply drains my account. I think it's not only me who is actually very prone to lose control once losses are happening one after another.

It was not a financial problem, but left me wondering how easy is to actually fall into a bad habit and how difficult is to break it.More recently, this happened to me, but I can’t say that I went beyond the limits of finance. Here's the thing: I increased my deposit over the course of several months, it was really hard because some game sessions gave plus, some minus, but in general I gradually increased it. But one day I realized that I was spending too much effort and energy on it compared to the income (I play for insignificant money), so I greatly increased the risks and completely lost my deposit. Since then, I've been on a pause in terms of betting and to be honest, I feel great since I'm free and don't have to constantly think about how which team will play and what should I do if the game doesn't go according to plan.",
