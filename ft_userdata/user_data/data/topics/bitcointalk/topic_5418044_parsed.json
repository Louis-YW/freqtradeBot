Unfortunately, as you can see, the whole thing about selling BTT accounts has been put aside and 99% of members no longer want to spend a few seconds of their time to tag such accounts.Maybe I should have stayed away as well, and if I had, I certainly wouldn't have found myself a target of that mafia, which is probably even now figuring out how to take revenge, because tampering with someone's profit, regardless of what they do, is very dangerous.",

We have scenarios where users who have now turned into scammers received positive feedback in the past from members who are still on DT2 but no longer active. I think this is the one of the reasons for creation of trust flags.I personally won't hesitate to create a flag on any of the accounts if the concerns are legitimate.",

I can only say that I had an unpleasant experience with the same user because he did an exit scam with the faucet he was running at the time, and then offered his Legendary account for sale. I will only repeat that such a member should not have a green trust, because the fact that he has not been active for 2+ years does not mean that he will not show up and try something bad.
