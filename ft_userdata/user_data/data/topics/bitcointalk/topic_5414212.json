I'm trying to figure out where it is located.",

Should be like follows. The error probably stems from the --data or -d parameter being wrong.Code:curl -X POST 'https://localhost:3001/v1/invoice/genInvoice' --insecure -H 'macaroon:[redacted]' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"amount\":\"1000\", \"label\":\"test\", \"description\":\"a new test\"}'Oh, also you don't need to specify the 'Accept' data type (JSON); the API will return you JSON anyway.",
