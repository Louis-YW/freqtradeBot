  "content": "Robosats reviewA few days ago, I've tried Robosats for the first time. Here are my first impressions and thoughts about this service. [Disclaimer: obviously unpaid, unsponsored]It calls itself a 'simple and private LN P2P exchange'; though it's important that this is not a crypto-to-crypto, but a Bitcoin-to-fiat exchange; hence why I call it an 'on-/off-ramp', instead.Here's their own short description from GitHub:Quote from: https://github.com/Reckless-Satoshi/robosatsRoboSats is a simple and private way to exchange bitcoin for national currencies. Robosats simplifies the peer-to-peer user experience and uses lightning hold invoices to minimize custody and trust requirements. The deterministically generated avatars help users stick to best privacy practices.They do have clear-net mirrors, but it's always recommended to just take the .onion URL from their GitHub readme and paste it into a Tor-enabled browser (or simply Tor Browser).I don't think I should explain how it works, because it would be just a copy from their README or video walkthroughs; I'll just leave some impressions and opinions.I did a small trade, selling some BTC for a gift card and it went through in under an hour. The whole process is honestly smoother and quicker than my otherwise favourite on-/off-ramp, Bisq.Especially for newcomers, I believe it's a great way to get started. By paying sellers with gift cards, they could acquire the first small amounts of sats necessary do open larger Bisq trades, for examples, which do need a certain amount of owned funds as security deposit; until now always a big issues to on-ramp people without requiring them to get that amount from a CEX in the first place.What it is: It is peer-to-peer. It is pretty cheap and quick. It is suited for onboarding users. It is anonymous (Tor, no KYC, no account, Lightning). It should be trustless like Bisq, through the use of HODL invoices, instead of Bitcoin SCRIPT smart contracts.What it is not: It is not decentralized.What I continue to recommend Bisq for: Larger sums that you want to receive on-chain or are hard to route on LN. Experienced users that already know how to mix coins after buying them.What I consider using Robosats in the future for: Need to exchange more quickly than what I can do on Bisq. Need smaller amounts of fiat / Bitcoin. Want to sell / buy Lightning funds anyway (so I can skip swapping on-chain funds to off-chain or vice versa).I can see how for many users it can be a big benefit that you don't have to install an application and keep it running for sometimes a few days; however for me it's not a factor. Just want to give this point a 'honorable mention'.Also do keep in mind again, this is a centralized service. It could be censored, shut down, or there could be issues with the escrows. In Bisq, if I'm not mistaken, escrow only kicks in if there's a dispute, otherwise it's all done through Bitcoin smart contracts and multisig transactions through the client software. I am not 100% sure about how escrow / support works on Robosats; maybe someone can help me figure this out 100%.I'd be glad to hear your experiences with this on-/off-ramp!",

I guess I only ever looked at the order book and saw fiat methods, but I see now if you try to create an order you can specify gift cards (or indeed any payment method whatsoever, including Monero).Well, the gift cards are priced in fiat; so I'm not sure if they're fiat or not..

I'm just wondering if you created an order and someone filled it in under an hour, which would suggest it is being used more than the quite sparse order book would suggest.Good question. As a Bitcoin seller, you can apparently get a few % above market on Robosats, but to get it through quicker I created a new order at 0% above market. I do believe that similarly to Bisq, the usage is higher than what the order book suggests and that prices seem so high (for Bitcoin buyers) since cheaper offers are simply bought up quickly. Need more experience with it to say for sure, though.Quote from: dkbit98 on July 09, 2022, 10:02:47 AMAre they offering only gift cards or there are other payment methods available?You can accept / request pretty much any payment method you want. You just select a currency and the payment method within that currency. The list is extremely long and you also have a 'free text field' option.In the left picture, I'm just typing out 'BitcoinTalkCoin' after having selected a few recommended payment methods. In the right picture, that's what it looks like after it's selected. As long as you can find a buyer in the specified trading period, you can choose any payment method you want. When someone accepts your offer, you get a chat window where you agree on one of the payment methods that had been specified and wait for the payment.Quote from: dkbit98 on July 09, 2022, 10:02:47 AMIt's nice to see that Robosats exchange works with Tor browser, but I am not sure what happens if attacks on Tor network continue in future.I think that Robosats will be the least of our worries if Tor gets seriously attacked. A ton of Bitcoin nodes would also stop working, as well as the whole of Bisq and the WikiLeaks upload page.Quote from: dkbit98 on July 09, 2022, 10:02:47 AMOn their github page I see there is clearnet domains but they are marked as unsafe and they are not recommended.Of course; using something like this through clearnet immediately cuts its effectiveness dramatically. Especially with regards to the aspect of being safe in case of a hostile takeover of the platform and / or future data requests by authorities (- remember it's a centralized service as opposed to Bisq where there's no central database with data to extort).Quote from: dkbit98 on July 09, 2022, 10:02:47 AMI am going through their learn page, and those stats look very good with increasing volume in last few months:https://learn.robosats.com/Indeed!",

Probably faster and safer (when it comes to irreversibility) than SEPA bank transfers.By the way; money transfers not being immutable is a very real risk; essentially people would scam each other on P2P exchanges by reversing SEPA transactions.

Essentially the same approach which ChipMixer is now taking as well. If Robosats continues to grow, then you can guarantee that there will be malicious clone sites popping up before long. If everyone knows from the outset that you cannot use the clearnet link to trade, then it is less likely that a new user will type \"robosats\" in to a clearnet search engine and lose their coins on a scam.Quote from: n0nce on July 13, 2022, 11:14:41 PMDamn; especially since they could just do What Sparrow does and use the (so far) better coordinator by Samourai.I'm not sure how that would work.

Otherwise, it's just 1 on-chain transaction away; not a big deal either to be honest.It's not just a matter of one extra transactions but simplifications that is coming with Bisq 2.0, that is one of the biggest obstacle for more people using Bisq.I would much rather use Trezor directly connected with Bisq than sending new transactions each time I want to make a trade.If centralized exchanges are connecting hardware wallets (FTX+ledger) I don't see why decentralized exchanges wouldn't do the same thing.",

For Samourai coinjoin, without running your own server then you lose your privacy to the Samourai servers. If you then put Trezor servers on top of that, that's another entity which can see what you are doing.I mean I'm not saying it's the best thing adding more and more trusted servers, but I don't now why it wouldn't work. It should work just as well as Wasabi 1.x or using Samourai directly.Quote from: dkbit98 on July 14, 2022, 10:21:51 AMQuote from: n0nce on July 13, 2022, 11:14:41 PMThere's nothing to find a solution for; it works already.

I believe both is possible with external wallet as-is.Quote from: https://bisq.wiki/WalletAs many other apps in the Bitcoin space, Bisq has a wallet embedded in it. It is not required in order to use Bisq.This means you can do everything with 'external wallet' and use addresses from your hardware wallet to do so.Quote from: https://bisq.wiki/Frequently_asked_questions#Do_I_have_to_use_the_Bisq_wallet?Do I have to use the Bisq wallet?No, but you may find it convenient to keep a small amount of trading capital there.When entering a new trade on Bisq, you will get the option to transfer funds from your Bisq wallet or send funds from an external wallet.Likewise, when concluding a trade on Bisq, you can withdraw your funds to the Bisq wallet or to an external wallet.",

That's a hard pass from me.As long as he doesn't mean 'use their () tech' as in 'use CoinJoin tech' (with a different coordinator and within Trezor Suite), hard pass from me, too.But I can see other wallets spinning up own coordinators and / or switching to Samourai for now. Long-term something decentralized would be preferred, of course. If that can be added into Trezor Suite and other popular wallet applications, it might get a lot more traction.Regarding this: I just dug up the JoinMarket ANN thread. It's not clear from the original post if it has a centralized coordinator or not.Also funny that it mentions 'tainted coins' and that you get 'clean coins from exchanges' through JoinMarket.. Stats are looking good to me!",

That's a hard pass from me.You are going to get your addresses and transactions scaned by some blockchain analytics company even if you don't use any third party tools and wallets.Coinjoin is not strictly connected with Wasabi, and anyone can fork and tweak their tech because it's open source.Even using coins directly with Wasabi ( I don't suggest doing that) you are not going to lose your coins just denied mixing with their main coordinator.I don't agree with some Wasabi decisions but I am not going to turn myself into witch hunter trying to burned them on stick for this.Who can gurantee that someone is not tracking everything you do on Robosats and Lightning?Just sayin.",
