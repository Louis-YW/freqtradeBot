During this period, I submitted help ticket through their Zenddesk and began to submit kinds of required material/proof, the strange thing is when I satisfy them for the first required proof, they will ask for another proof, again and again, till now I have replied them 13 times and it looks like they enjoy to embarrass me again and again…Then after such a long boring time until I can not bear such a dick customer service person anymore, I complained to their Support on Twitter, then I received reply to let me PM @BittrexSupportl, from there I was told they have a validate tool integrated (https://app.validatorsync.com/) and ask me to follow the validate process then I can withdraw my credit at their exchange immediately. Then I found out on its so called validate site it requested to retrieve Private Key of my crypto wallet! Based on few last piece of trust plus there is very little of balance of this crypto wallet, I provided Private Key of my crypto wallet and it began to sync but it never went through, then after few minutes I receive a private message on Twitter from  @BittrexSupportl, they told me my wallet should be “active”, I got confused, I told them this wallet is active since it can send/receive payment, then they told me IT SHOULD HAVE BALANCE INSIDE! I was scared: why do you need balance (and not small balance) inside my wallet for the validation process after you grap my private key?Afterwards, I clearly rejected to add balance to this wallet, they furthermore told me I can use another crypto wallet even it has no connection with their exchange as long as it has balance (that is what they called “active”) inside!Only then did I react: Get your private key of crypto wallet and ask you put balance in it – ISN’T THIS JUST A SCAM TRICK? And it is from OFFICIAL EXCHANGE SUPPORT? WTF! I would like to share my story because I don’s want more people cheated by this Exchange, I believe they play this trick all the time, that is why I heard they got fined by SEC once and requested to shut down their US business.Feel free to spread this painful story to as many people as possible, this exchange is not worth to register and trade, because they can block your account at anytime without any reason and a lot of tricks waiting for you!  Beside, it has very high commission fee compared with other CEX, extremely low trading volume: if you spend some time to watch there you will see all are bots trading!If you are press, you can contact me to get the chat records on Twitter with @BittrexSupportl, my Twitter is @emman200211",

Every option on it leads you to the same page, and none of the social buttons listed on the bottom page are working. Plus, their GitHub page leads to nowhere. Are you sure this link was provided by their official account? As it stands I have high reasons to believe that you just have been drained from all your funds once you supplied that website with your private keys. There are many scammers scanning exchanges support pages so that they are able to target users that are both angry and desperate to access their account - meaning that they would use any tools that may give them hope to access them.",

They simply retweet other users tweets and nothing more. They even point to a tweet user that doesn't exist (@Bittrex). By buying fake followers they even were able to have more followers than @BittrexSupport (their official twitter support alias - ~ 12k followers vs. ~3.6k followers).",

When I did face the issue with my deposit and withdrawal as usual I dropped a message on their official telegram group and boom after that a spammer responded to me on time and asked for my personal details related to the account and by all means I did provide him because there was nothing in the wallet.After that, he asked me how I did deposit my coins and I said from Metamask, suddenly he said its the problem with your wallet share the key with me and You know what I did provide that key as well because there was also nothing after that, he said for validation and testing I need to deposit 0.5 ETH on the account. I said WTF, for the sake of 20$ I need to deposit now 125$ and I took the exit from there he made so many PMs but haha I just ignored him so accidentally I got saved from a Scam.",

It's like a double kill for us, in case we also get victimized by those fake people pretending to be a part of the company they are having a problem with. There were lots of them not only in Twitter but there are simple signs to look out to detect them.Usually, they are not verified but they use a profile picture with a small blue check just to give an illusion that they are verified but any wise person can detect it immediately. Another one is they are usually the first to private message you. It's only hard if the official account has been hacked although a company can always give a warning about this matter if the issue haven't been resolved yet.",

I'm pretty sure Bittrex's official support twitter account is @BittrexSupport, not @BittrexSupportl. You got duped broski. Watch out for fake Twitter accounts — always remember, fake followers can be bought cheaply.Fake accounts and will be directed to shady steps, phishing sites. Losing identity documents and money too if the scammer can succeessfully wifhdraw from Bittrex.It is very basic mistake that should be avoided by people who join cryptocurrency market. Because many scammers in this market but they don't use very complicated scam methods.Collection of comprehensive guides on identify and avoid scam projectsscammers are good in creating the name as they can imitate the official name but with added letter that you can't notice at first glance. or some will change the l to i or I to l. so yeah, the OP got duped by a fraudster. should copy paste the official channels as i don't think official sites would go to the extent of ruining their image if they still have business to protect with.",

Perhaps the one you spoke with is one of their representatives whom still have access to the platform's services and cheated you out of your money. Or it's possible that they are also fake people trying to imitate the official support of Bittrex for you to gain trust on them blindly. Be wary of these people trying to agin access to your account using unconventional methods like this. Official customer supports from platforms don't ask these information as they probably have access to it and would want you to confirm questions, not you giving every information to them.",
