The chances of wallet get compromised is to lose the security of seed phrase and it really depends on every individual who created that wallet.And if you know your crypto portfolio value is too big to trust the all the wallets available for free then surely getting a right hardware wallet will be a better choice.",

I would never recommend using such a wallet.",

That's your opinion about Trustwallet as I also use the same wallet but not for daily uses much like a carrier before the crypto is sent to another wallet that I always use. Anyway, there are other noncustodial wallets and also open-source wallet which you can say that it is safe and secured compared to close-source wallets though it's your decision which one to use.",

But it doesn't means that you won't get caught tomorrow or next weeks. Same about hacking. Many people think ''oh, it won't happen for me'', but why to risk?Maybė your friend never will get hacked, but I think it's better safe than sorry. IMO, it would be best not to keep big amounts of crypto in hot wallet, only amount that you need for your daily expenses. While saving should be in cold wallet. And hardware wallet isn't neccessary for it. Proper made paper wallet is enough.",

However, what is important to emphasize is the environment in which such a wallet is located/used, so it is not the same if someone uses such a wallet on a computer that is used for surfing various suspicious websites, where pirated software is used or where torrents are downloaded. The possibility that something will go wrong is then significantly higher than if such a wallet is used on a computer that has a good AV/Firewall and is not used for any of the above. If, in addition, the user is aware of the way to download and verify wallet files, then he is quite safe - although it is undoubtedly much safer to have coins in cold storage, or in a hardware wallet.",

It's almost always human error which leads to being compromised. Whether that's your living situation, your browsing habits or simply just ignoring security. There's also the issue of phishing, but I consider that a little different. Ultimately, a hot wallet can be used fairly effectively. It's probably as secure as your other accounts, as long as you're not using it on a compromised machine or connection. As long as you follow strict procedures when downloading, installing, and connecting things to your machine, you generally should be okay.However, that doesn't mean you should use them to store large amount of funds, since it's always best to go the most secure route as possible when it comes to that.
