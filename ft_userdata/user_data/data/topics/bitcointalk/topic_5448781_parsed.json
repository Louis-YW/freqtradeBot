      "body": "Currently among the ALT coins I think the most reliable and good coins are BNB, Ethereum, MATIC. You may find other coins more secure. But considering the security aspect I would definitely choose any of these three coins.  I have always chosen BNB and MATIC when I trade futures on ALT coins. And I have had good success trading these coins. Especially when MATIC price was 0.80$ I took MATIC futures trade. And there I got good profit. And BNB is the best among ALT coins for spot training.",

What do you keep following or watching these days? and why?I'm seeing a lot of bullish altcoins, but my watchlist doesn't have much, I'm just holding BTC, ETH and a small amount with dogecoin The simple reason is that I feel safe with these, moreover this period also has many positive signals for the market and the top coins are also having their own bullish momentum. For me, whether short-term or long-term, the increase of BTC, ETH is always necessary. Some hype altcoins that come with periods can be referenced, but I won't spend too much time with them.",

What do you keep following or watching these days? and why?At the moment pretty much every crypto project is making some gains, so it is pretty hard to pick a favorite simply based on the rising prices. In the last few weeks i bought a little bit of Cosmos (Atom) and NEAR. I simply wanted to have some pretty big and already established projects in my portfolio too, because before i only had pretty small and new projects and obviously with such projects you are always in danger of losing all of your investment.I chose Cosmos and NEAR because in my opinion they have still big potential to grow and at the same time they are giving me passive income through staking and that was important to me.Radix could also be a good pick. It  already pumped like 30% in the last few days but it seems to just have started to gain some traction.",

I find that optimistic for the progress of the project thus, I still hold ETH and very optimistic towards it.Then BNB.I'm stuck here negatively because I've bought the peak and when it was $30, I have never thought of buying it and that's a naive decision that I've made over the past years but then, I hope to recover from this loss.

And among other ALT coins I consider this coin relatively less risky. But after Bitcoin if I do choose any coin to trade then that coin is BNB. But there are a few ALT coins that I have invested in sparingly. Because I believe anything can happen anytime in crypto currency. So I didn't want to miss that opportunity.  Some of my small investments are in Ethereum ARB and SOL coins. Hopefully any of these coins will leave in much better condition.",

In the case of Litecoin, it is because it helps to transfer value when the Bitcoin mempool is too busy to push through relatively cheap transactions, still a reliable project for those who just want a simple PoW OG alt.",

I also waited for it to drop below 1$ to buy, but it seems I failed, and I decided to ignore it instead of buying it at a high price. ARB is a potential project worth keeping an eye on in the next bull season along with APT, but it is being overvalued, so investing in it is quite risky. Investing in altcoins, ETH is probably the only reliable altcoin to hold for the long term, the rest I really don't trust anyone. I will choose new projects over old ones, for me, altcoins should only be a one-time and short-term investment, don't trust them in the long-term.",

Altcoins do make important changes that could result in profits or losses. My favorite coins are BNB and ETH; they have provided me with enormous profits in the past because I have held them for such a long time. A simple strategy will see you through the bear season, bagged enough solid altcoins during the bear and triggered sell when the bull comes. I continue to hold them because a strong bull market is on the horizon; when it does, those who made investments in sound projects will benefit.",
