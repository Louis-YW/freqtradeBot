  "content": "[Next Question →] I decided to start these forum quiz-series, where I'll be asking questions of educational character, to improve the average user's knowledge around Bitcoin. The questions will mostly be technical and historical. To create an incentive, I will generously merit the first person who replies with the correct answer. If that is not good enough incentive, I'll create a leaderboard!Your answer needs to be explanatory. Not just a yes-no or a single number.If nobody finds the answer until the cut-off date, I will submit it.Have fun! It's a game.  Question: The dominant mining pool, at the time of writing this, turns evil and uses its hash-power to reorg the chain. A customer of yours sends you a transaction. If you wait for 10 confirmations, what is the chance that the dominant mining pool successfully double-spends / reverses your transaction?Cut-off date: 23/03/2024.",

Additionally, factors such as network security measures (e.g., checkpoints, alert systems etc etc....) and the response of other miners and nodes to a reorg attempt can also affect the outcome.",

If you wait for 10 confirmations, what is the chance that the dominant mining pool successfully double-spends / reverses your transaction?The chance depends on the fee rate used by your customer. Since the mining pool is dominating, if the fee is nice enough for them to add a single confirmation, others will have almost no choice than to confirm the transactions also as they proceed mining the block. The chance of being able to double spend the transaction reduces as the number of confirmation increases until it eventually becomes  zero at exactly 6 confirmations when the transaction has been validated successfully.",

Therefore, when Foundry will have built from 834,750 to 835,010, the rest will be higher than that. (The exact block number they're likely to be is a great future question, though!)",

It is the proportion of the total hashrate the attacker owns that is used as a parameter in both the whitepaper and the tools by G. Maxwell and J. Lopp above. However, the distribution of the hashrate is not relevant, which is what I was responding to. Quote from: seoincorporation on March 17, 2024, 08:04:43 PMSince the dominant pool (foundrydigital.com) only has 28.4% of the network, they can't do the 50% attackThink of it this way: Anyone can attempt to execute a 51% attack. However, if you own less than half the hashrate, then it becomes exponentially less probable the more the blocks. However, you might stand lucky with 30% of the hashrate and reorg, say, the past 2 blocks. That is quite probable to happen in fact, you have 44.6% chance. What is exponentially improbable, as time goes by, is to maintain a chain with more work than the rest of the network, therefore to continue launching the attack forever.By the time you will have started reorging the 5th to last block, the rest of the network will be way ahead of you, so you will have to work even more to keep up with the new blocks, and it goes on and on. The honest miners will build faster than the attacker, and outpace him. That was the first quiz, and you all did pretty well. Class passed! More Bitcoin questions will come in the next days.

You are totally right BlackHatCoiner but those are 2 different things, one thing is the 51% attack, where the miners can modify confirmed blocks, and the second thing is the double spend where the user modifies the unconfirmed transaction. In the past, when games used to be on-chain, people used to abuse double spends, recovering their money if the bet lost. And for that, they weren't even miners.
