Gambling relieves depression but when a person loses several bets in a row, a kind of hatred is created in his mind and then from that hatred he commits various types of criminal activities. Moreover, gambling is also socially termed as a highly criminalized social addiction. After the harmful effects of gambling on the children of a gambling family, the children of the family are psychologically broken and fear for their careers in the future.",

Maybe just a couple of hours playing and then you lose money? Same with it improves your mood, when you gamble it might release some chemicals like Dopamine so you really feel good about yourself. But then again, the same question, how long will you feel that good mood?So not really sure if we can call this as health benefits because the effects is for a limited of time only.",

Quote from: HelliumZ on October 31, 2023, 11:47:49 PMGambling relieves depression but when a person loses several bets in a row, a kind of hatred is created in his mind and then from that hatred he commits various types of criminal activities. If someone is losing, it can lead to depression. Gambling can result to depression for those that are newbies to gambling and for those that are addicted. Later, other negative things can begin just as you have said.",

In contrast, if we gamble irresponsibly, gamble with hope to get rich, to become millionaire, billionaire made by gambling, I am sure we will not have happy ending. Let greed controls us and affects our gambling activity, we will over gamble and will lose more than win. At the end, we will lose most of our money used in gambling and our life can be destroyed by gambling.",

Gambling for so many is a form of entertainment or game that they play when they need to boost up their mood. Some others gamble to earn a little while some rather choose to use gamble for other wrong activities(illegal). The possibility of been affected by gambling falls on the gambler, how he chooses to play and what motive is behind it.As for risk as stated by op, I think gambling puts us in more risk rather than helping us.When we gamble, we stake our funds and hope on getting something back if we are lucky enough.",

And casino games are especially exciting because they offer the chance to win a lot of money. This adrenaline is very good for our health.I think the main benefit of gambling, especially in a casino, is socializing with other people.The gaming industry is not only a place where people can make or lose money, but it is also a social hub. People come together to play and interact with each other, whether it's table games or slot machines. This social interaction can have benefits for both individual players and the wider community.Another benefit is using gaming as an escape into the real world, as many people use gaming as a way to escape the stress of their everyday lives. Is there anything better than walking into a casino or sitting at a poker table and then forgetting your worries and just focusing on the game? This relaxes our mind and allows us to recharge our energy for the next day, as long as you don't lose more than you were willing to.",

Well I guess the minority can take it as such, but really, most games that involve win/loss in them are never the types you'd consider for \"stress relief\", especially if you take them rather seriously. It can be one if you don't mind it but if you can do that, I'm pretty sure you don't need to gamble, you'd be able to handle stress itself rather well without any assistance.I guess the only good idea here was the risk-taking idea, I mean I learned how to manage myself when taking risks. I was a mess before whenever I had to make a big decision to the point where I just wanted to run. Gambling kind of handled that by, well, making me think more in a less stressful environment.",

A responsible gambler to me is someone who takes risk as far as he can afford and that already is a benefit because your mind is at peace whether you lose or not, you already taking the right step to be cool with yourself afterwards and that can help you relief stress instead of adding to it because of high staking risk that will increase your blood pressure when lose or even while the bet is going on.I see the health benefit as what is imbedded in us to do as right thing first before that can come to us. For example an addict is not going to have such benefit because he is always restive with betting but a responsible gambler sees it as a game and games are made to help us relax.",

However, talking about health benefits of gambling is an overstatement and I don't think gambling should be approached this way. You don't have to ascribe benefits to gambling to make it attractive. Leave that up to medicine... Gambling has enough positive properties to make people want to try it and be marketable on it's own.",

Responsible gamblers can control themselves without being too obsessed with taking back the money they have spent, they will leave the casino when the money is gone and will come back again at a different time. Winning is an unexpected bonus, they will try to focus on the game even though the main goal is just to relieve stress.This article only discusses the benefits for gamblers who are looking for entertainment with the various types of games available there, but the risks still cannot be avoided. Responsible gamblers only affect themselves without causing harm to others, they are just having fun there and will leave when their money is gone.",

When gambling is done responsibly, it can be seen as a way to challenge your mind and have fun and engaging in strategic games can stimulate your brain and improve decision making skills. It's like any other recreational activity like it becomes healthy when you have control over your actions and don't let it negatively impact your life. Just like enjoying a hobby, setting limits and being mindful can make the experience more positive.",

Everything we do has advantages and disadvantages depending on how we apply it. If well applied gambling can help one to increase critical thinking skills and improve attention to detail. Gambling builds our level of focus which can be applied to other activities. But when gambling is wrongly done, it could increase stress, anxiety, and anger. I have seen people become depressed due to the wrongful application of gambling activities. In some extreme cases, gambling loss can lead to health issues and even suicide.",

This tropic is must read for those who only consider gambling in a negative light. A person is more likely to become addicted to gambling, it is the fault of the gambler, we cannot blame gambling. As every human being is not equal, their thinking and behavior are also different. Some people are emotionally disturbed who can keep that stress away for a while through gambling. And there are many who do not know how to take risks, they can gradually master how to take risks through gambling. Moreover, only a gambler can understand the joy of spending free time and sometimes getting big rewards.",

It's natural that the loss of money will have a negative effect on one's emotions and ones health.I didn't find any gambler who after the lose in gambling seems to be happy. You see the gamblers when they lost money they will try to recover the losses and this extra burden will put more stress on their mind and health, it will be more dangerous for health.",
