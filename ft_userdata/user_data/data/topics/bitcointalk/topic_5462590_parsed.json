  "content": "Hi guys I'm Marcos I'm from Argentina, I don't know if I can do this here but I've been thinking this for almost two weeks and I'm  done I cannot keep myself in this situation I'm at my lowest and I feel that I can't progress in my country with almost 150% anual inflation prices going up every day and our currency going down. Well I'm gonna be direct I need $2000  to leave my country I'm not asking to give me that money straight up but any help is accepted. I work every day here but that sum of money is impossible to achieve for me because I'm earning less that $10 per day I'm working as a painter for the moment but I'm a electro mechanic technician is also difficult to get a job in my city I'm also studying programming. I'm planning to leave to new Zealand I'm going there with a working holiday visa once I get there I will be able to repay the loan.  I know that loans for newbies and without collateral is extremely difficult to get but as I previous said I don't know what to do and the situation here is so bad, I'm being serious and I'm doing this because I  have nothing to lose, well that's it I'm sorry if I cannot do this here and if my English is not that good thanks for reading and have good day!.If you want to contact me to get more information/proof that I'm a person that really needs it :Email: marcosleiva717@gmail.comDiscord: m4rcusbtw#1540Btc wallet: bc1qlsl6tgqk58n87dkcddn27wnvxa7kadwp2kktj0",

Then what makes you think an online stranger who does not even know your face is just going to happily forward you behind a brand new account the $2,000 without any valid collateral offered to assure him that you will repay back the loan.",

Then what makes you think an online stranger who does not even know your face is just going to happily forward you behind a brand new account the $2,000 without any valid collateral offered to assure him that you will repay back the loan.I understand you point and is not a novel that's what I'm living right now, all I have to put as collateral is almost 150usdt that I've been saving. I know that sounds like a joke but for that I put my email and discord to prove that I really need it. Thanks for taking time to read my post bro have a nice one",

It's a business and his concern is if he can get his money back in time.You provide no guarantee at all, so yes, you got it right now, you don't really have a chance to get a loan here.Plus, if you are in such a bad situation, I kinda doubt you afford to invest into crypto.Advices? Sell what you can sell, or try your luck with real life friends, bank, or pawn shop.",

Better still, you are not alone. Some people are probably in a worse situation than yours but still live through.Have a positive mind to tackle challenges. You might think I am just a motivational speaker, but i have been in very bad situations in the past. I even had no friends to bail me out, but here I am.",
