      "body": "SOLDThis was an interesting way to do it, I sold the artwork to a Bitcoin community member who also won the 'Bitcoin Pizza Day 2022' lottery. He got the ticket from MoparMining, the one who made this whole thing possible, including the lucky number  . It's crazy how sometimes things just fall into place. Congratulations to the collector!I still have some 1 of 1 artworks available, although they aren't that large in size. However, a new one is on the way and will be unveiled at the next private exhibition in London on August 19-21. This particular artwork holds a certain power, and I can't wait to share it with you.As a fun twist, we have an International Chess Master as a guest at the summit(https://www.domainsummit.com/e/2138615980) The person who wins against this master will receive the original artwork. If nobody beats him, the artwork will be gifted to the master, and, of course, I'll make also an open edition for those who try to beat him. I don't want anyone to leave empty handed. It takes a lot of effort, but these kinds of art exhibitions should be fun, right?",
