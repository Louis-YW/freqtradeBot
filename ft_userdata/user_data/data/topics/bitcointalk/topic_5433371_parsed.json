To understand how the CREATOR actually Rules you need to watch the paths followed by rivers. Imagine the rivers are humans(or destinies) while the paths they follow were made for people who deserve the paths.   So, a human leader who leads others through a path would think he is in control while in fact he is only following the path made for those who choose such path. And you can only be on the Right or Wrong Path.Those who control the world are only controlling what they are allowed by the CREATOR to control. You won't be wrong if you call it a false sense of control",

These organizations make world rules about what we can and cannot do. This was built in during the covid pandemic because at any time they choose our lives can be changed. For example, if they decide we need another \"lock down.\" They also have the power to decide if certain businesses are allowed to stay open or not. There are those who choose not to live by the rules and that is another subject itself. Just that controls the food chain, the population and spreading a virus that somehow will eliminate the human population.",
