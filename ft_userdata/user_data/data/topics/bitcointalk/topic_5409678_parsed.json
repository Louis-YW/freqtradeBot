And all those messages are intended to lure you into a tempting trap and scam you.When I receive a message and know that it is intended to scam me, I continue the conversation with them to find out their main motive. Because if I get the link of that website and expose that website then gamblers can stay away from this kind of scam. If you receive such messages, it is safe to mark them as spam and block them.",

Unfortunately, statistics have proven that there are always people who are gullible enough to fall for it. All we can do is warn people of these scams, to prevent them from losing their money.The truth is that there is no such thing as a stable income in gambling! It's either you win or lose. If you want to make money, then do something else.",

And how does $100 a day make you $1500 a month?
