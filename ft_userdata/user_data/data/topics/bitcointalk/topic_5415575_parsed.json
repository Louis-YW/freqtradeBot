Truely I'm very happy to witness today, but something is happening which don't give me comfort, normally if a person is +1 today he/she normally improves his/her behaviour, that is they will like to behave maturely to show that he/she is old enough. But in Nigeria the story changes why? All what we are all enjoying today are all what our heros laid down for us. Let all say change begins with me. Forward ever backward never.",

Although I have heard some Nigerian say that it would have been better to still remain under British rule because their expectations after independence have not come to pass. The founding fathers of the country wanted a united and strong nation that would be a force in the committee of nations. But currently, the reverse is the case because the nation is higher divided and is suffering from multi-dimensional problems that no government has been able to tackle squarely.  But there are still some good things to celebrate. The Nigerian music industry, film industry, and athletes are doing the nation proud.QuoteI'm so disappointed in a lot of Nigerians there is nothing to celebrate about but a new monthYou all are really scared to fight for your rights but you celebrate this year after year. Sock puppets!What do you expect Nigerians to do? The government has no respect for the fundamental human right of the people. The courts are filled with corrupt judges that the common man cannot get justice. If you protest, they kill and nothing would happen. You don't have to blame anybody because the Nigerian society is not just and egalitarian and people have to live to fight another day. Currently, Nigerians are doing their best because many young voters have decided to kick the old and corrupt politicians out of power and they can achieve it together.",

      "body": "Nigeria is really blessed, with alot of good things which include climate, food, vegetation, resource to mention but a few. but the way things are going in the country aren't giving joy at all. Things are getting tougher everyday, no good road, no electricity (even though oil and coal are part of our resources), no freedom of speech, human right not protected, insecurity everywhere, each new day comes with a sad story and our leader do not care about the welfare of the people they are elected to rule. The leaders make live a living hell for poor masses. Even the system of government which is said to be democracy is no more one as the vote of the mass do not count again. The people in the government prefer to do selection and retain their seat and position even as they grow old while children in nursery, primary and secondary school are busy singing that they are leaders of tomorrow, yet the old men can give room for the young leaders to rule. Look at Educational system in Nigeria, they say \"education is the key\" yet the government changed the padlock and took the key turning education to scam for younger minds in the country. Election is fast approaching the aspiring leaders will become saints and posses humanitarian qualities just to get the mind and vote of people but immediately the aspiring position is gotten, influence of the Godfatherism in polities will overtake the personality. Infact what is the joy celebrating independence when we are still in captivity. The independence isn't wroth celebrating because there is no joy.",

Let all say change begins with me.I like the way you ended it that the change begins with you, there are lots of countries whereby you see the people showing mass solidarity against the rule of the government in their own regions and this is jot nee anymore, take a look at the rate they use many means to fight against a government, just because they wanted a change but if they were to be there, thiers could be more worse because those in position today don't actually comes from another planet, they were our fellow brothers, uncles and fathers abusing the system of government with politics.
