      "body": "I personally do not believe in all these infographics or manifesto if you may like. We have been hearing of them and listening to manifestos long ago from different contenders in past electoral seasons and after election, when they get the power, they dump everything about the manifestos as they had told us earlier and start doing or playing to the power that be, the power that brought them to power and they pay obeisance to them all forgetting the masses that voted them in. I prefer past records than manifestos, if you have been there before or you have held a public office by virtue of electoral votes or appointment, you should have track records of your achievement then. This will tell us what you are capable of doing. These three front runners were once public office holders and their records should decide for them who Nigerians should vote come presidential election. Some of them are aged which I would not mention names and I think Nigerians now know what is best for them.I read in one of the dailies yesterday that one of the presidential aspirants from another party stepped down for one of the three front runners of the presidential aspirants. This is democracy taken too far and indirect way of vote buying and rigging of election ahead of time because he has already instructed his followers to do same thing. This same thing happened in the primaries of one of the major political party during their presidential primaries.",

Yeah, I think you are right from what you said, we have been hearing of them and listening to manifestos long ago from different contenders in previous elections season and after people vote for them they dumped, that act dey with all the Nigeria politicians and they no fit ever change even if people decide to trust them, promise and fail has become a small thing to them but they do not know the crime of promise and fail, person no fit know the serious ones among them but God will surely looks into people prayer and gives us a better candidate to change our country.",
