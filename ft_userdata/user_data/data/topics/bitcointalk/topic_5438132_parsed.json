  "content": "I made my betcoin.ag account on march 2nd 2022 (almost a year ago). Deposited $1000 at first. I've been betting on sports (football or basketball) ever since, on and off for about a year. The limits on this website were not very high, and I found playbetr.com (sister website to betcoin.ag) with higher limits. Made my Playbetr.com account end of last year, 31st december 2022. My first deposit on playbetr was $4k. Then later on I deposited another $1000-2000 not sure exactly. Same with betcoin.ag, I deposited another $1000 ish. So in total, I had deposited around $7000-8000 somewhere total on betcoin.ag/ playbetr, all in BTC. Never had any issues. I had only been betting on NBA at playbetr, was losing at first. Then I win some bets (NBA basketball) on both sites. Did not bet same selections on both sides, was completely different bets (if that has any relevance). I had been previously losing and that was apparently fine for them.Anyway, after winning - I tried to withdraw my balances from both websites realizing I had been limited down to less than $10 stakes on NBA etc. The total withdrawals were 0.65 BTC from playbetr and almost 0.21 BTC from betcoin. I got emails from both sites asking me for KYC. Uploaded full KYC to both sites, including pictures of my driving license + selfies, and address proof etc. My account was fully verified and I was waiting for my withdrawals. Next day, I try to log in and see it doesn't let me. On neither website I was able to log in, or when I could, I had no access to any features of the account. Basically they blocked my playbetr and betcoin accounts both at once for no reason. I get an email from both sites saying this: gyazo.com/2cce2f6e291bab297c8dbf9e2940b321Basically they claim I have been guilty of fraudulent actions and they had the right to terminate my account and suspend payouts. What's most funny, is they offered to return my deposit. (FYI, I don't give a F*** about getting my deposit back). This is literally laughable. I'm seeing this happen to more people. They just close my accounts for no reason, not providing any form of explanation or evidence and then ignoring me for weeks. I have been emailing them ever since I got these emails (3rd january 2023), and there has now been over a month since without getting a reply. I try to speak to them through live chat and get the same reply everytime (\"email for more information sir\").I have seen them (playbetr specifically) reply to many threads on this forum and most of the times they claim to be very transparent and fair. It actually amazes me how well-knowledged they are and the fact they always reply to complaints is kind of surprising. Now I would really love to know why I have been scammed out of 0.85 btc, which at the moment is almost $20k. These are the types of fraudulent actions they listed (they have not explained how I broke any of them - I OBVIOUSLY HAVE NOT):These actions include, but are not limited to:Syndicate play or participating in any type of collusion with otherplayersMatch fixingLate bettingDevelopment of strategies aimed at unfaithful winnings or advantageplay, which is detrimental to our businessArbitrage/corridor betting, use of forking services, use of surebet orvaluebet services or steam chasingFraudulent actions against other online casinos or payment providersChargeback procedures with a credit card or denial of some payments madeOther types of cheatingProviding incorrect information about personal data during registrationIs known to have gone bankrupt in the country of his residenceSuspicion of money laundering or funds having been obtained by illegalactivityUse of a device, bot or software to place bets or interfere with anytransactions occurring at Betcoin.agThey have not explained how I have done any of this. I am 100% sure I have not. All I have been betting on is NBA bets (one of the biggest markets in the world) and it would be impossible to cheat on these markets. NBA is the #1 league of a top 3 sport in the world, which has huge limits on every known sportsbook. It is a false claim that \"I cheated\" and they are fully ignoring me and many others. I refuse to let this be ignored and will do anything in my power to take it the next step. What's laughable is the fact they claimed they would repay my deposits, I wouldn't accept them, but still ignored me when I mention it. I have seen other users contact Curacao courts and lawyers. I am willing to pay any amount of money or do anything to get this sorted straight. Not letting these scumbags get away with scamming innocent fair players for absolutely no reason.Here are some links proving my claims:- Proof of my withdrawal requests -> (proves me having 0.85 BTC total in both accounts): gyazo.com/f533fc1c7d0aeba74d3d3712af182607    ,    gyazo.com/926be95773b34264446e8b34c3e5fec1- Screenshots of bets I won on playbetr (FAIR, NORMAL NBA BETS) -> gyazo.com/4b63d3944ac2d84db543a2525d4d0b0c    ,     gyazo.com/67e5543813e5880dfb159204511e06dc- Video of me trying to access my playbetr account after getting the emails (now I can't even log in) -> https://youtu.be/GJzYonxiCYc- Video of me showing conversation with friend -> \"proof\" I did not use playbetr until before 30 dec 2022: https://youtu.be/uR_jA9dxfiQLong story short:- total amount 0.85 BTC (deposits + profits)- accounts were randomly blocked 3rd jan 2023 after requesting withdrawals (over a month ago)- did not break any rules- no reply on live chat or email (getting ignored)- no explanation or evidence to back anything upLooking forward to a reply from Betcoin.ag and / or Playbetr.com. Thank you in advance.",

Why the F*** would I do that when I know I am fully innocent and you guys are scumbags who do this to everyone. I read new threads about people getting locked and scammed every day with betcoin, it's nothing new. I gave you a month to reply and you didn't give a shit and ignored me. And you expect me to ask for my deposits back which would leave close to 15k profit missing? For no reason? Come out and say what I have done wrong, how about we start with that. Not asking for your evidence, tell me what rule I broke. I will contact 3rd party immediately since talking to ignorant scammers won't lead to anything. Does anyone have recommendation for who to contact that will actually have an effect on these blatant scamming scum.",
