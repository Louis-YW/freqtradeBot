  "content": "I just read that investing about $200 000 in real estate in Dubai, qualifies people for citizenship.My crypto portfolio is not worth $200 000 yet but I believe it will definitely get there one day in the next 10 years.Tax rules in my country are not clear but our IRS has a bad reputation and I do not intend to ever cash out my crypto holdings to any regular bank in Europe.I prefer that my government has no idea that I even hold crypto. Cashing out here will immediately flag the IRS to check out all my earnings, also the work related ones. The IRS never leaves anyones home without a serious tax bill. In my neighboring country Holland, citizens already have to declare crypto holdings (even unrealized gains) so that the government can tax people just for holding BTC. This is theft. I only intend to cash out crypto profits in countries that have 0% crypto tax and a proven track record of this. They also have to have a reputation of not sharing financial information (property, account balances..) with other countries. For now I think that only Dubai has this, but I believe that Donald Trump is capable of doing this in the USA as well.If anyone has experience in Dubai, please share this.If other countries are good for this, please share. I also want to know what it takes to stop being a resident for tax purposes in your own country.Maybe I have to give up my nationality for this? One of my ideas is to rent out my property in Europe, move to a low cost nation (I like South America) and live from the rental income there. I can invest in crypto on the side. But if I remain a tax resident in my country, I am still obligated to declare all assets and properties in other countries too.",

For some this is a problem, for others it's not. Keep in mind that living in a country is significantly different than doing one week of holiday there.Quote from: WeThePe0ple on March 02, 2025, 01:14:40 PMIf anyone has experience in Dubai, please share this.I feared to even visit Dubai, knowing that human rights are a bad topic there and knowing that normal things in Europe can be an issue in the Islamic states. And while there is a tad of understanding for tourists, there may not be the same for citizens.So it's quite a step and I advise you think it through very good.",

      "body": "For individuals, crypto is tax-free, but if you're running a business dealing with crypto, taxes apply once you hit the threshold. So, if your goal is to avoid paying taxes on crypto, moving could be a smart decision especially since capital gains tax can go as high as 15% or even more depending on what country you are living. If your portfolio is large enough that taxes feel like a constant drain on your earnings, then it makes sense to go with whatever helps you maximize your income.For now, there’s no tax, but there’s no guarantee it will stay that way in the future. That’s something worth considering as well.",

How are you going to make a living?  Another thing you're not considering, apart from what NeuroticFish has already mentioned, is that although Dubai is crypto-friendly, it’s not a free-for-all. A couple of months ago, I watched a video on the topic, and Dubai’s banks want you to clearly prove that your funds have a legal origin. So, if your Bitcoin has gone through mixers, for example, you can forget about it.",

If you are unsure about anything, find experts on this field especially with things like laws and tax. There are professional lawyers in each field and they are knowledgeable and experienced, so that they are able to provide you best services in laws and most valuabe services on case law/ legal precedents previously.You can not know about all these by reading and learning by yourself. Because it's serious thing, so don't make mistake, and if you are rich, it does not worth to take risk that if fails, will cost you much more than hiring a lawyer.",

I guess the op must have taken all this into consideration before now, and another question to Op is, How much percentage of tax do your country charge for crypto earnings? this is another angle he should be taking into consideration before thinking of a move to Dubai, secondly for him to think of going to invest $200k into real estate in Dubai to try to evade tax he must have had enough money to do so and seem the tax in their countryside is such a huge one if he calculates how much he will be spending annually on tax.",
