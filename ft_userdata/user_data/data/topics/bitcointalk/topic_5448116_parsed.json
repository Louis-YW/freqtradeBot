As you know, I’ve been passionate about the Nxt blockchain for a very long time, and I really like Ardor and people from our community.As you probably remember, I want to create the Unicorn.art project as a platform for collective creativity. I really wanted to integrate it with other blockchain projects so that I can use BTC Lightning Network to create NFTs on IGNIS.But after doing a lot of research, I realized that in order to build a really valuable important and strong project, you need more than I collected using crowdfunding last time. A strong project needs a legal structure, more powerful servers, advertising, airdrops to attract users, and an audit from security experts.I really didn’t want to do a new crowdfunding, but unfortunately I have to.I increased the number of UARTs to 10 000 000 UARTs and want to distribute 2 050 000 more UART tokens.Therefore, I am announcing a new crowdfunding, this time the goal is to raise 5 000 000 IGNIS and 50 000–350 000 ARDR.For every 5 IGNIS you will receive 1 UART tokens.For every 1 ARDR you will receive 3 UART tokens.What can UART be used for when Unicorn.art is launched?- Buying paid ads on the marketplace- Paying the marketplace fees- Purchasing of exclusive NFT collectionsLearn more and get involved in a new projecthttps://medium.com/@ardor-world/uart-crowdfunding-2023-uart-token-how-to-get-uart-4ab607cfedf8New UART CROWDFUNDING 2023",
