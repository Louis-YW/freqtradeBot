ThanksYou're saying that a non-US account got locked. What do you mean by that? You haven't used the account since Binance enforced KYC on everyone, or are they asking you re-submit your documents?Anyway, I haven't tested this myself but since Binance.com doesn't accept US citizens, your application will probably get denied.",

ThanksOnce they discover that you are a US citizen, you will never be able to use their platform again. From what I know, your account will be blocked but will be on only withdrawal mode. You won't be able to trade, covert, stake, deposits, etcTerms can easily change. Who knows, that these days they could be completely blocking your account. I suggest you don't risk doing anything on Binance.com if you are a US Citizen.",

It sounds like yes?After reading the post above, I checked the terms of service but I think it's difficult to say whether they'll just put your account in withdrawal mode only, or lock it completely since the U.S doesn't fall under the category of sanctioned countries:Quote from: https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/my-account-is-locked-what-do-i-do-31292504004314866053. Sanctions:If you live in a comprehensively sanctioned country or territory, we will have to lock your account and initiate off-boarding. Most of the time, you simply won’t be able to sign up, or pass KYC. But new rules do come up, especially given the ever changing geopolitical environment.Please understand, we don’t make sanction laws, but we must follow them. There isn’t any choice here. In most instances, your account will be put into withdrawal only mode, and you must withdraw your assets. For users that are affected by these restrictions, we will give notice in advance to allow them to take any necessary action. 4. Restricted Countries-snip-For example, if you traveled to the US and accessed your account, our system will lock your account and ask you to verify that you are not an US citizen and do not live in the US. This is to ensure no US citizens or residences are using Binance.com (they may instead use Binance.US).-snip-Have you tried to reach out to the support team and ask them directly?",

It's not as easy as it was when the policy on US residents using the platform was implemented. Correct me if I'm wrong but US residents were banned from using Binance.com in 2019. That's several years ago. Where was the owner of this account all these years? To the platform, this is probably a suspicious activity and might trigger some security alarms. I second OmegaStarScream's suggestion to contact Binance directly and provide justification not just as to why the delayed move from Binance.com to Binance.us but also the delayed compulsory KYC.",
