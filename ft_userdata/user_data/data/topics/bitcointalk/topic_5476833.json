Bitcoin can be of a use not just now but also in the future that is why it has a five star ranking in the crypto world.Do you know that makes Bitcoin one of the best so that it can place itself as one of the most valuable. Bitcoin does not follow steps like other coins and that's why Bitcoin is considered quite fundamental and Bitcoin has strength when inflation involves maintaining value against the Fiat currency that is always devastated. You can prove it when Covid-19 occurs and also today you can see how Bitcoin is in the same condition.Technology has a role for the growth of crypto in general and bitcoin specifically because the presence of both can be useful to foster people's interest. And vice versa with Fiat who loses value so that people look for a new system that can guarantee the value of money being placed and thus the solution is in Bitcoin as we have seen today.Quote from: Tuclikk on December 06, 2023, 11:43:03 PMThe way things are moving around the nation, which has not yet had an impact on cryptocurrencies, will soon do so in light of the promising future that lies ahead.The whole world has a positive impact on the presence of Bitcoin even if the country has fully prohibited the use of Bitcoin. Why I say like that because the growth of bitcoin can run quite well when there is a process of selling and buying and if referring to economic law, the level of growth of bitcoin has been running quite rapidly at this time.",

However, you have to think that not every nation in the world is pro-bitcoin, there could still be some of them who see the negative, hence they totally ban it.But for us who have been a crypto enthusiast, it's a game changer, other become crypto millionaire specially those early adopters.And then there's the financial freedom that we are enjoying right because of how some of us become financially knowledgeable and we have our bitcoin investment and make money specially in the next bull run.",

But look at this statistics made by this website for having the most market capitalization in the world. Bitcoin sits currently on #9 and IIRC, it was more than 10 a few months ago and look how quick it is moving and expect that it'll move faster during this bull run.--> https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/",
