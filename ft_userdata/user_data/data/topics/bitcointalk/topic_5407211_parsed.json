  "content": "Greetings,India is doing great in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space[ at least better than what it did last year ]. To shed more light, India has a money-making mindset when it comes to crypto and more than 60% of the Indian population who are in BTC are unaware of how a basic transaction works in Bitcoin.Looking back, India did not have any Bitcoin conferences as well. These conferences are a good source of knowledge and understanding of the psychology of Indian traders and investors in Bitcoin. I would like to propose hosting a Bitcoin conference in India. This conference will be very helpful as people will try to understand bitcoin more from a technological aspect than just as a store of value. Also, this conference will help the Indian Blockchain and crypto startups in India. It will be a great opportunity for you to understand the psychology of Indian investors as a crypto startup founder in India.The collected data can be used to understand the basic behavioral psychology of an Indian investor towards crypto and money. Researchers can use this collected data to train their own AI models & predictions.It will also boost knowledge about Bitcoin in the Indian crypto community.Interested people to join in, please email me at numerchauhan at gmail.com",

      "body": "There are plenty of resources on the internet for anyone to under or spread awareness about Bitcoin. I still feel arranging such meets won't help. Our government is still not clear with what it will do about crypto. They have already implemented a heft tax on it and few days back the RBI governor had recommended to the government a complete ban on Bitcoin. With such uncertainty it is better to stay where you are and avoid such meet ups.",

      "body": "There should be some motive or agenda behind the conference. It can't just be a conference to learn how to make transactions.Any can find that information within a few clicks. Youtube has so many videos already.But the idea of a conference is good but something more should be added to it.For instance, an idea, on how bitcoin can be used to collect donations for a natural disaster occured.Using a multi sig wallet to hold the funds with one of the top reputable and trusted people for the disaster relief fund.Just an example, it can be anything else but should be more than just learning how to make transactions.",
