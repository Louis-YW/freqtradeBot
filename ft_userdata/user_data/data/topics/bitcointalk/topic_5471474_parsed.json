Share your experience in this matter.What experiences? If you want to buy, then buy; if you don't want to buy more, then don't! How come you're interested in \"how to buy\" if you don't want to buy? Make up your mind!But if the point of your question is that you don't want to buy because it is currently \"growing\", then wait for it to stop growing. Or better yet, buy when the price drops. But I guess you're not interested then because it's not growing, right?",

Now that we're at the gates of the initial rally, I know you're afraid of a significant price drop after you buy it. So the answer is don't invest in altcoins for now, invest in Bitcoin, because the main event coming up will be about Bitcoin, not altcoins. Understand?",

If it is Bitcoin, then you can basically buy it at anytime, it has an actual utility and it would not go extinct, if what you don't want to buy is Altcoins, then maybe you are actually doing yourself a favor without even realizing it.",

Share your experience in this matter.You wanna buy then you say that you don't wanna buy? Try to clear first yourself what you like in this world because we're no magicians to tell you how to buy when you don't even want to buy. That's confusing and yes, the market is growing and we're likely to hit the bull run again soon. So if you don't like buying now, then what you are up to is to keep that to yourself. The experiences that we've got are just the same as each other.We bought at a low price and then we're just waiting for a better price to come. Despite that we've seen the market has been up a bit, this is giving us the firm decision that we're still gonna be patient for the bull run because we're not yet there at the peak of it. It's hard to determine the peak but selling close to it is already a good thing and successful trade off.And if you have that thought that you are buying because you see the growth, that's like an okay strategy but usually, it's best to buy when the market doesn't move at all or when it's at its lowest.",

When something is rising, the hamster has the feeling that it might be missing out on something valuable and important right now, so it buys along with everyone else. Smart money never does this, it only buys during a big drop or during a market lull when volatility is at a fairly low level.",

Share your experience in this matter.Sounds like dollar cost averaging would be something you might want to look into.  Basically you buy (or sell) a set amount for a specified period (day, week, month, etc).  So that it limits your downside risk if it goes down but keeps you involved in case it takes off.  Good way to continually add to your stack of crypto as well.",

The price chasing thing has been on for as long as buying and selling have been in existence. Perhaps, that attitude fulfills something in economics; though I wonder what that can specifically be, anyway. Why wait until price begins to pick to show a project isn't dead before buying in? Why not utilize the Warren Buffet philosophy of buying when others are scared and then selling off when there's a scramble in the market for more buy? For a while now, there has been a call to buy and hodl Bitcoin here but I'm not sure many took that call as something serious. Now that price has rallied up for a few days, I await the so many who will flood here to ask – should I buy now? It's really sad that some of us here still allow ourselves to be caught in that.",

That's just the simplest way of solving what to do in instances of x or instances of y in any type of situation. The only reason you'd ask others is if you weren't decided yet but the way you said things are, you're pretty much set in stone ain't ya? Buying during the growth phase though isn't something I'd really go for. Maybe a small bit here and there, but I'd rather buy when it's going down instead. A lot more opportunities for profit in the long term. You're more likely to lose when you keep buying when it's going up since a correction is most likely on it's way.",

This time it's more on the post accumulation period and I think it's about to explode more in this current prices.

If there would be one working way to make profitable trades, everyone would be doing it and because of that, it wouldn't work.Obviously you can learn trading to level of rocket science, but honestly, it might not help you.

If you had purchased Bitcoin at a price of about $28k a few days ago, you would currently be at profits. You can wait for a lower price of $28k if you think you can't afford to buy bitcoin at the high price it is fluctuating at right now. You can decide to buy now, if wish to, and hodl it as it grows in price during the bull run",

So you have missed that opportunity already. Not a financial advise, but I think it is still good time to buy as the price is still as a discount price. If you look at bitcoin, it has a big surge lately, but it is still below it's last ATH.And assuming that we will have a new ATH next year, then you can still make a lot of profits. Same case with a lot of solid altcoins that we have right now. At least in the top 10, it will be a good buy and then just HODL, or just continue to accumulate like doing DCA or any other strategy that fits you.",

When the market is going up but you dont want to buy, its usually because you're afraid of following the trend too late or thinking that it will go down again.Now, ask yourself: Do you make choices based on fear or on facts? If you see steady growth, strong principles, and have done your research, then you may not be acting because you are overthinking it or having doubts about your research. Do something about your doubts. Why not make a purchase? Is it based on market signs or on your gut?
