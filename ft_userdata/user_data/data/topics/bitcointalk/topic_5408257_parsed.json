(price wise compared to other popular crypto)It is quite uncertain to know what is the next price of cryptocurrency, let alone Theta that is quite moderate in terms of popularity.  But there are some speculators thinks that THETA will be good in the long-term investment.  One of which stated taht Theta investors have a possibility to gain 500% of their investment in 5 years, which is kinda conservative IMO, since cryptocurrency especially an altcoin  explosion can get big as high as 10k% in a single month.This might be an interesting prediction coming from https://currency.com/theta-coin-price-predictionQuoteTHETA coin price predictionsLooking to the future, WalletInvestor has a THETA price prediction that looks pretty gloomy, with it dropping to trade at $0.115 by July 2023. CryptoGround suggests a THETA value of a little under $3.46 in one year and a shade under $17.47 in five years’ time. TradingBeasts says that the THETA price in 2022 could be around $1.32 at the end of the year, before it closes 2023 at a little under $1.52. A year from then, it could be back down to trade at just below $1.36 while at the end of 2025 it could have recovered to approach $1.57.Finally, PricePrediction.net suggests that THETA could hit $1.81 in 2022, before rising to $5.61 in 2025 and $39.23 in 2030. The year after that, the THETA price prediction sees it trade at $56.44.Any good THETA coin review will tell you that price predictions are often wrong, as they are not representative of all market conditions. Remember that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile. The value of investments can go down as well as up, and you should never invest more than you can afford to lose.",

      "body": "As far as I remember, it is a decentralized video streaming project. Last year it showed a very good yield for its ivnestors. The ICO was 12 cents in January. The project made x100 profit. I haven't heard of Sony, but I know they are in partnership with SamsungNext. What confuses me about this project, as a long-term investment, is the offer of a billion tokens. When the project came out, there were only 20,000,000 coins available. Now the offer is maxed out, which is why the price has dropped so much. I don't expect this project to give many X's to its investors in the future. Everything it could give to the maximum, it has already given.",

Im thinking about there's no good progress that has been made from this project. It's better for you to stick into the another project rather than tried to take this as an investment. Sandbox is having a better price performance.",

(price wise compared to other popular crypto)Like you, I too didn't know much about this project other than seeing them in top charts so by there I can just assume that the project is good and a must to have so you can try to add this coin in your portfolio if you want to and you said that there are upcoming partnerships which are huge because man that was sony so I supposed that this can lift this coins value more evenly but do you know if when is the exact date of the partnership?You didn't leave extra information other than saying the project will improve in a couple of year so I guess the partnership can happen next year or so but during those times I think that other top projects are going to do well so don't disregard them.",

(price wise compared to other popular crypto)no doubt about Theta, although Theta price is undergoing a deep correction but Theta is still supported by big companies, Sony and samsung, no doubt about it, Theta I'm sure will reach new ATH again in a bullish time!",

The prospect of this coin is not so good as it was before. So many new projects have been surpassing it.

(price wise compared to other popular crypto)If you want to know more about Theta you can go to the official website and you will find a lot of information that might be of use to you.I think Theta is quite potential for the future, In the 4th quarter of this year Theta will release Metachain Mainnet 4.0. So far Theta also has a good performance in the market. So I think Theta is worth buying and making a long term investment.",
