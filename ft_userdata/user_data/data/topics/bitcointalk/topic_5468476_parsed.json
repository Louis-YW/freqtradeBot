Everything will depend on the trading skills, if you have perfect trading skills then it is possible to make good money by trading in ALT coins.  I have always preferred Bitcoin for long term investment, and I believe that no coin can beat Bitcoin for long term investment, but in some cases I have noticed that trading ALT coins is relatively more profitable than Bitcoin.  It is possible to invest the same amount of capital only the risk is slightly higher. If we can accept the risk then surely we can make profit by trading ALT coins as well.",

Bitcoin is the most. Suitable in that regard and at that we all will look into that to be able to prove how safe it is to trade only assets that have less volatility like bitcoin.",

Many people trade altcoins because of their high volatility, they follow market movements, particularly those altcoins with poor returns and reputations in the crypto market. They can readily multiply by ten or more due to minor market changes induced by their developers or market trends. They consider it as a get rich quick coin while trading it and ignore the danger involved, which is negligible when they invest in bitcoin instead.",

I have a friend which I told to invest in bitcoin and he told me that he prefers to invest in other coins than bitcoin, he said bitcoin is too expensive that the money he got to invest will only purchase small bitcoin but if its alt coin he will have many of the coin. I try to convinced him that what point will it make by having large quantity of coin without value than having just little with high value. People practicing alt are those that thing cryptocurrency is also gambling because the don't invest in bitcoin. Bitcoin is the reliable and trustworthy coin that never force anyone to commit suicide. It's a relief investment.",

Smart traders know that trading bitcoin is the best choice, but they sometimes trade other cryptocurrencies because they can, and they make profit from it. You will not be a smart trader to know that you can trade other cryptocurrency and make profit from it, but decide to just limit yourself to bitcoins alone. Sincerely trade according to your expertise. If you know you can do it, go for it! If you still have doubts, then play it safe and focus mainly on bitcoins.",

Trading simply Bitcoin would be preferable if you wanted to trade more safely, but the potential gain would be lesser than with altcoins. Trading alternative coins is the only way to increase your chances of receiving a significant reward, but since alternative coins are very volatile, you must be careful with your trades and it is wise to increase the size of your stop loss because volatile coins are more vulnerable to manipulation. Before you trade, you must screen a coin and backtest it.",

But, yes, I do agree that bitcoin is less volatile when compared to altcoin, specially coins that are not well known. When trading bitcoin, there is less risk associated. Chances of you losing everything is low. But it doesn't mean that you won't lose anything. When trading altcoins , you will be taking more risk, but the profit is also higher when if you can take advantage of the volatility.
