It's true the women go through the whole pains that must time are life threatening, but the men also go through stress trying to fend and place food on the table, my opinion is that, our parents be celebrated equally, aside God, both are our Messiahs",

I sincerely thank all of you for the pains you have taken for me and for the support you have all given me.I do not get it, is you Mother-in-law and sister on this forum, there is no need posting about them and thanking them here when they will not be able to read your heartfelt appreciation. The days has passed and I hope that you were able to express this love to them in gifts. I love gifts, all women do. A gift is a good way to show appreciation. If you could not gift them, there are many Mother's Day and Women's day in a year, begin to save up and plan for gifts for them the next one.",

Though death took someone so special to me which is my mum but I believe anyone who has a mother should endeavor to celebrate her and let her know how beautiful she is and how she has helped to build the home peacefully. It's nice celebrating mother's day and I hope the world will celebrate the women and appreciate them for all they have been doing in the society.",
