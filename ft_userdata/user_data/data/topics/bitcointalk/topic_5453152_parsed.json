  "content": "This tutorial is only for beginners who don't know how to save bitcoins. Because as far as I know, many beginners and newbies save their bitcoin on exchange and online wallets which it is very dangerous and not recommended as a future or long time investment.my method does not need capital or buy a new hardware wallet, the beginners just need to download Electrum wallet, which recommended way has often been explained here many times.After downloading, just shut down the internet, and make sure no internet connection. Or better to copy Electrum to a flash disk and go to a PC or Laptop which broken wifi and internetAfter that step, open Electrum wallet and create a standard wallet with seed and Passphrase, write down the detail on paper (laminated it) or carve on steel, and keep it in the safest place. You have to make sure that place is very safe from fire, flood, people, moisture, and any kind of destroyers. (because this is your future investment and life, so treat the same as gold and money, or other investments)So what next step is just to look at the Electrum address tab and copied it. And, make sure the address you have copied is correct, look it twice, make sure these addresses are the same, do it several times until you are sure nothing different with your copied and paste. (I did recheck twice and triple, I closed Electrum and restart the pc and do it again to write the seed and passphrase just to make sure the address is correct and the same as what I write and copied)After you got the address, permanently delete all data (AppData in Rooming) and electrum, shut down the PC (air-gapped) and you can move to a regular pc with the Internet. Because you only have the Bitcoin address, you can send Bitcoin you get from a buy-in exchange or any service there.The address you have you can bookmark it on the browser and put it in Explorer, or create  watch-only wallet in Electrum Android.you can track your save in any time and anywhere, you do not have to worry, because this is Bitcoin where only you own the key, you do need to worry if the bank or exchange going to bankrupt, only you are in control of the assets and life.",

You need to know if vulnerability isn't only happen because of internet connection, but it also depends on your PC or Laptop security.Below are the better steps:1. Perform a malware check in your online device that you use to download Electrum.2. Format your flash disk and use this to copy your Electrum from your online device to offline device.3. Format your offline device and install new OS, better to use Linux since it's open source and has a less risk to compared to windows. Disable or remove anything that related to connection e.g. internet, bluetooth etc.4. Transfer your electrum from your flash disk to your offline device, install it and check the signature.",

You need to know if vulnerability isn't only happen because of internet connection, but it also depends on your PC or Laptop security.I don't know where the virus came from if my laptop never connected to the internet? I just make sure both my laptop is very clean, I am the type of insecure person who never believes before all safe, and because I'm very careful, I am very brave to run the wallet offline and online.

I know how lazy the beginner come here, they are lazy to read and search old thread about safety and security. because of that I begin with this. And, I hear that ledger has a problem also, I see on social media a lot of users throw away and ruin their ledger wallet. maybe this thread could be a solution even is not so perfect, I hope after they read this looking for a way to make it perfect, especially for long investments. If want to use it regularly, better to buy Trezor or an open-source wallet.Quote from: m2017 on May 18, 2023, 01:38:21 PMThis Live Flash Drive can be booted from any PC.

If want to use it regularly, better to buy Trezor or an open-source wallet.The problem is that Trezor is not reliable either, as it has long had a bug whereby someone with access to the USB stick could extract the seeds. There are other options, but they don't have as much of a track record, with Passport being a good option, but it's a lot more expensive than a Trezor One or a Ledger Nano, although these should be ruled out,",
