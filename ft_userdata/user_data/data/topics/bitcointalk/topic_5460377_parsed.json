It is really that very commonabout gambling addiction and on the time that you are been bust up or wrecked that bad with gambling then this is the time that you would really be stopping since you dont have the money that you could use with your gambling activity.If you were sensible enough and been wary with your action then you wouldn't really be doing these things in the first place on which you would be able to stop midway if you wanted to.But if you are that kind of individual on whose arent really that good on handling your emotions and having that control on your mind then most likely you would reallybe ending up with this path.",

It is halfway correct because it is true that if one is about to stop gambling then there will be no next time for him to win and recover his losses.  While it is true, most cases often result to more losses and only a few individuals tends to win and recover their losses in such action.I believe this statement is a marketing ploy in order for the players continue.  I believe the statement is only truthfully applicable to life challenges since quitters never beceom victorious in their endeavors in life.  But to use it in a gambling platfrom, it is obvious that it is just a marketing strategy.QuoteAnd is there any similar statement like that in your home-country that's popularly used among gamblers to encourage themselves from quiting gambling because they're losing?I have not heard anything but gambling respinsibly.QuoteOr would you allow your decision to quit gambling to be affected by any popular statement among your fellow gamblers or it's a no no thing for you?Nope, my life my decision, I won't let any other people influenced my decision especially when it does not align with my moral.",

A gambler must not lose huge amount of stakes before he'll be qualified to win a bet. When one isn't seeing any possibility of winning a particular bet then quiting is surely the best thing in other not to incur more loses",

I mean I could walk in to a Casino tomorrow with $10,000 dollars and play a few slots, maybe some blackjack, or some roulette, maybe bet a few sports games and then walk out of the casino with $110,000 and decide to quit gambling forever.  Well then technically I'm still up.I kind of joke and understand what you mean, but as always, just only ever gamble with funds you're willing to lose.",

It is important to recognize the potentially addictive nature of gambling and the negative consequences it can have on individuals and their relationships. Responsible gambling involves setting limits, knowing when to walk away, and seeking help if gambling becomes problematic.I am thinking that gambling cultures and traditions differ across regions, and there may be localized sayings or expressions used among gamblers. These statements can range from superstitions to motivational phrases aimed at urging gamblers to stop when they are losing based on what I see them.",

I reckon the idea came because people can't know the future, so until you try you'd never know what may actually happen. The thing is, this directly invalidates a person's capability of making their own judgment, especially in this case where you've already tried, but you won't quit cause well, you never know, it \"may\" actually just work. Decide for yourself, use your own judgment. You're losing? That's fine, but again, decide for yourself. You're winning? The same thing, decide for yourself. Just don't let dumb sayings sway your decision-making (and greed), especially in gambling. It's for entertainment, treat it like one.",
