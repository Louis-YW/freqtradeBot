      "body": "Will this become the end for the lending platform in the crypto? They are always running out of liquidity. I thought that the lending platforms must be done through the revenue from the company to make sure the users are safe. That proves that if genesis has no enough liquidity to handle that. Genesis has no choice other than waiting for more and more money to come from those people who took loan from genesis. lol it seems like this bad news will be affecting the whole of lending platform ecosystem in the crypto. you may see more and more lending platform halting their withdrawal caused by they didn't have enough liquidity to handle that. This gonna be even worst. I hope that people are taking their money from another lending platform as soon as possible.",
