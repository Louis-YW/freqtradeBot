You must be very excited about purchasing your first bitcoin, Congratulations OP. From the essay you wrote I trust that you fully understand what you’re investing in. Hopefully you didn’t break the bank on this purchase. Read more on threads that discuss types of wallet, how to secure one’s seed phrase. If you bought a significant amount of bitcoin, you should consider buying a hardware wallet.",

Of course profit-wise, we all wish we could have bought bitcoin from when it was first released but alas we already are living in the present and no need in thinking about what if’s. What we should do is to think about now how to maximize the bitcoin we hold.Especially now that we are approaching what seems to be the peak of the current bull run and everyone’s attention is toward bitcoin at the moment.",

It is money, the only money in existence (everything else including fiat is currency). As money it should also be used as a medium of exchange which means you should try to pay for stuff with your bitcoins and most importantly be paid in bitcoin if you can (as opposed to just buying it with fiat).",

When Bitcoin first started, mining it was very easy and the reward was high and as of that time, I head that there was faucet and some airdrops that you can earn quite a lot of Bitcoin from but today, Bitcoin has become a very preferred asset by millions of people from all over the world.",

You should also inform your friends about bitcoin, now that it is 16 years old, more new users will trust it and try investing some amount in it.  there's no indication to suggest that OP is part of the earlier Bitcoin investor. OP created his account on the forum this year and isn't yet all too knowledgeable on Bitcoin so it's unlikely that he's been an active investor prio to this year. Again, holding Bitcoin for the next 10 years doesn't guarantee 10X returns and for that to even happen, it means that Bitcoin must have gotten to $700k which is a figure I wouldn't outrightly assume is too easy to get to.Bitcoin is still profitable and has a lot of benefit in holding it with potential returns that's still good but it's still good not to be too ambitious on what we expect from it. For those that knows it worth, it's an asset that's worth holding and even if you're not fortunate to be part of those that have been involved in it for even up to 5 or 10 years, the few moments spent in the Bitcoin ecosystem is always fieled with a lot of positives.",
