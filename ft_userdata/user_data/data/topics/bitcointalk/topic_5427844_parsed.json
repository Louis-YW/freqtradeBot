However, it basically means that if you are supporting BTC, you would be developing a tool that \"enables money laundering, terrorism, etc\" and challenges the CBDC monopoly.How realistic is it that public figures would be facing charges in the future?

I can see how they'll look on github and try to hunt contributors. We are facing a scary future. It's better to say steps ahead and plan accordingly. Someone with resources probably could move jurisdictions before it's too late but what about the rest. And even if you could move you could see yourself in an Assange situation trapped in some embassy. I would like to know if developers here think about this at all and what is your escape route if shit hits the fan.",

As far as the bank is concerned, you just bought or sold something from / to someone.They won't refuse a regular sized transaction from a regular other random person. The funds will not come from a centralized exchange's bank account.",

Peer-to-peer electronic cash.I believe he is talking about the fact banks and traditional financial institutions still play a role when comes to provide liquidity to the Bitcoin market, mostly in the form of people trying to buy Bitcoin and other alternative cryptocurrencies with FIAT on exchanges which allow to do so, like Binance or Coinbase. It does not sound impossible banks would block such purchases in the future, in my opinion (debit and credit card). On Binance P2P it is already advised not to tag or add any crypto-related description to the transactions to avoid flagging by banks.",

Do you have any reference to support this being in the \"agenda\"?QuoteHowever, it basically means that if you are supporting BTC, you would be developing a tool that \"enables money laundering, terrorism, etc\" and challenges the CBDC monopoly.This FUD is nothing new. They have been spreading it from early days that bitcoin was created and challenged the centralized banking system that was corrupt. CBDC is part of that corrupt system.QuoteHow realistic is it that public figures would be facing charges in the future? As a developer, should you remain anonymous?A good question. It depends on how spread the developers are in the world. For example if the top devs are all living in one jurisdiction then we are facing a real risk (similar to if all hashpower were from the same jurisdiction), but the more spread they are the lower the risk. After all one government deciding to crack down on developers in their own country would not halt bitcoin development in other countries.QuoteSomeone with resources probably could move jurisdictions before it's too late but what about the rest. And even if you could move you could see yourself in an Assange situation trapped in some embassy.They don't have to move, they have to already be elsewhere. As I said like mining. For example when China banned mining, none of the miners in other countries cared about it and the Chinese miners also moved their equipment abroad.Assange situation is different though since they attached \"national security\" to that, it is going to be pretty hard to do the same with the globally recognized Bitcoin.",

As for as digital euro or other currency is developing and that it could be a major problem too. And also there will be some famous developers might get charges and for those who are anonymous and wants to be decentralized than they can be saved from this types of scandals. As still there are some governments think that Btc and other crypto are source of money laundering and it could be a true too.
