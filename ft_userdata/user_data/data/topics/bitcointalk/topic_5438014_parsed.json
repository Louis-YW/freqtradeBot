They believe they have a moral obligation to present some suggestions for responsible gambling to the general population. It is also logical to believe that if they could assess visitors for gambling addiction, those who failed the test would be banned from signing up. Because they can't, they've created a section of their website with guidelines for responsible gambling. So, even if the house always wins, which is good for their business, it is your responsibility to bet responsibly.The following are some of the responsible gambling guidelines I found on Livecasino.io, Duelbits, TrustDice, and others. They all have the same idea.Quote- Treat your betting and gaming as a form of entertainment and only use money that you have set aside for your entertainment.- Do not bet or wager amounts larger than you are comfortable with.- Do not bet or wager with money you cannot afford to lose.- Do not chase your losses.- Do not let your betting and/or gaming take up time that you would usually spend on other activities. Any thoughts?",

The loss of gamblers is the process of gambling sites.But if gamblers are winning, there would be no casino or other gambling sites, but I like the fact that gambling sites still make it clear for gamblers to use little amount of money that they can afford to lose.Quote from: Davidvictorson on February 04, 2023, 09:47:12 AMIt is also logical to believe that if they could assess visitors for gambling addiction, those who failed the test would be banned from signing up. Signing up is the easiest thing to do, even the questions about gambling addiction is only suggested by some gambling sites and not in a way it is compulsory. They are what that even a 15 year old person can know about.Quote from: Davidvictorson on February 04, 2023, 09:47:12 AMAny thoughts?Who is going to be addicted will be but it is good that gambling sites do advice their users to visit the recommended page to know the do not for not to become addicted.",

I'm not saying gambling is bad, because gambling is good for kill boredom and enjoy to play like online games. Most people see gambling is harm and bad, that's why they're convince anyone if they're care with the gambler and make sure the gambler not become an addict.Similar like cigarette where it's always an advertisement about smoking is bad, after all they're want to promote their brand.",

But for sure all of them want to keep you betting because its a profit for them and it will not be a good business to them if their costumers will just spend a chunk. They want whales to come in and bet since this is how they can get revenue to their casino, but what good thing about those casino is atleast they post that notice because there are still time for other to think clearly before starting to spend their money on casino.",

The reason for that is they don't want to be responsible of every gambler's fault that's why they have a guidelines or disclaimer if it's different platforms. Just like in investment, they will always put it in their platform \"Invest at your own risk\" and in a crypto platform I know is they put \"price may increase or decrease so invest at your own risk\". That explains why they put up a guideline and casino is also a business after all.",
