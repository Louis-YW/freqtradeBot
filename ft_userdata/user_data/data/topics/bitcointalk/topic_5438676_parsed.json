A wallet needs to try different derivation paths in order to find where coins are located. Users, on the other hand, are risking to never find their coins if wallets suddenly stop supporting certain derivation paths. The other reason is that BIP39 has a fixed wordlist which is being used in a very inconsistent way: you don't use wordlist for key and addresses derivation, but you use it to calculate a checksum. Moreover, BIP39 standard suggest to use one wordlist per language, which is terrible for portability.Quoteso What the difference and how to differentiate between them? for example:Just check the documentation I linked.",

      "body": "It's worth noting that Electrum's seed phrase system pre-dates BIP39 by several years. Also, Electrum does not use a fixed wordlist like BIP39 does. BIP39 seed phrases will only work with the BIP39 wordlist. Electrum seed phrases will work with any wordlist you want. It uses the BIP39 one simply out of convenience, but you can replace the wordlist in the Electrum directory and use any wordlist you like.There is no way you can tell if a seed is BIP39 or Electrum simply by looking at it, if they are both using the same wordlist. You simply have to try to import the seed phrase and see if it has an valid/invalid BIP39 checksum or a valid/invalid Electrum version number.",

Security of both algorithms are pretty much the same.Read the link in first reply by @witcher_sense, in simple terms it is about the fact that BIP39 lacks certain features such as telling the software what type of address it should derive and at what derivation path (fixed by including a version number). That makes recovery using seed phrase a lot easier for users which is what Electrum aims for (ie user friendliness). BTW Electrum seed algorithm existed before BIP39.",

For example if you were using a passphrase or if you were using a different word-list like the default French list since the normalization method is different (in this case removes diacritics or accents) your BIP32 seed will be different and you'll end up with a different wallet.(BIP39 only performs a very simple KD normalization.)",

It happens, and we have seen such stories. It's usually old seeds to empty wallets the owners no longer plan to use. Unfortunately, they give their counterparties an address that belong to such a wallet and receive BTC in an address whose seed they threw away. Or someone sends them money to an address they used in the past by mistake.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on February 11, 2023, 09:13:55 AMDoes Sparrow wallet not already support importing Electrum wallets?

A very quick test shows that a passphrase of lower case letters and numbers will generate the same wallet between Electrum and an edited version of Ian Coleman, but upper case letters or symbols lead to different wallets.The method is called \"normalize_text\"[1] and the behavior you found here is because for some reason Electrum calls the normalize_text method on both the mnemonic and its passphrase which treats them both the same. And although this method makes sense for the mnemonic, it makes no sense for the passphrase.This means it will not only lower case all letters in your passphrase but also it will remove extra spaces from it (ie. pass=\"aB....cd\" is the same as \"ab.cd\", I used dots instead of space to visualize it better).The code looks pretty straight forward but last time I tried to reproduce it in c# I failed the part that affects CJK character:[1] https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/df842af0b6b48074a510155fbfd28df295c200d4/electrum/mnemonic.py#L40-L90",

I did not know that Electrum applied this normalization to passphrases, which as you say, doesn't really make sense.So a bit more testing on the standard Latin alphabet plus diacritics, Electrum will also use NFKD normalization, but it will also do the following: Make everything lowercase, remove all accents and turn the accented letter back to the \"base\" letter, reduce all white spaces of any length to one space only. This means that the following two passphrases produce the exact same wallet:Code:HÈLLÖ     thérê     $!?hello there $!?At least knowing this you could then apply the same rules to non-English letters and words to regenerate your wallet elsewhere, if you needed to.",

What you did was create a simple \"brain wallet\" with a very weak password which will take a couple of seconds to crack and steal all your money.
