  "content": "With the old nano ledger s, the cable that came with it, you connect it to a usb a port on your laptop. With the nano ledger s plus, is that the same cable that comes a long with it?  So the cable would connect to a usb a port on your laptop? Or is that cable connect to a usb c port?  Heard more devices are connecting via usb c as oppose to usb a so wanted to know what the other end of the cable for the nano ledger s is connected to.",
