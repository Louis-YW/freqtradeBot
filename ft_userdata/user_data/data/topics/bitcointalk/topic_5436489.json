Other investment schemes may give you stability in the long run, but the amount of money you should have to enter their market is extremely high, thus not making it as viable and as affordable as it should be. Also, in crypto, profits can easily be realized not unlike stocks, gold, or any other investments out there that movement takes months or even years to happen.",

I made a lot of profits and started all trades well so far. I also expand on ICO, IEO, staking and other projects.",

I mean no person in the world likes their government 100%, even if you voted for your president, you think they could have done a better job at certain things and because of that not everyone trusts them and yet for some reason people still use their money.I, on the other hand, use crypto which is a lot better because it is not tied to any government, and even though the price can change because of governments, bitcoin itself won't change and that's why it's a lot harder for anyone to ruin it. Fiat could be ruined overnight with a decision from the government, but crypto doesn't have that because nobody controls it.",

Altcoins and its sub-divisions can be profitable opportunities to grow your portfolio, but due to the risk and the lack of potential on long run, I prefer to be careful with them, letting them where they belong: in second plan.About those people who came in 2020 moved by the hype of NFTs, staking and DeFi, I would tell them to be more realistic regards what they expect from this market. Crypto isn't shining all the time, and those looking for unrealistic opportunities of gains are under severe risk of completely losing their investments. So, don't be greedy and don't let altcoins obfuscate your focus that should be in BTC, the most precious and valuable crypto asset among all!Images created using Midjourney AI, see more at: Bitcoin AI Generated Images",

It has been a wild ride with ups and downs but i've never made as much money as in my life with anything then i made with trading altcoins and nfts. I am not even telling my friends. Sure now i have lost everything but i've risen from $200 to $20k many times. It's laughable how volatile markets are and how you can strike gold when you know what to look for and obviously you need some luck with it.",

Let's be honest, Most of them just want to ride the bull market and earn monetary value and just don't care what is the real happening behind the bull market at that time. This is why there are many people who are getting traumatized after experiencing a bear market after the bull market because they only expect the market to go up and up for a short period of time. We can expect another surge of people flocking into crypto when we are nearing or during bull market again given that everyone wants to milk it and make money from it.",

It's like saying UI designer is really easy job and the salary is really high, but I want to become front end developer When Bitcoin price is really high, it mean the other altcoin's price is really high too because most of altcoin will follow Bitcoin price. It's really risky to buy altcoin during Bitcoin bull run because when Bitcoin price is drop, the altcoin price will drop more lower.",

It should also be underlined that investing is taking risks. so if you want to invest in crypto you also need to consider every coin you want to invest, make sure that the coin is listed on a big market, say BTC or some other top altcoin ETH/BNB. do not forget to use cold money and monitor the coins you invest so as not to miss the opportunity to sell.",
