Some campaign managers pair the pay while some don't.Not that it is too important to me, but I would personally make a difference in the pay rates for Hero and Legendary members, because the difference in activity required for these two ranks is significant (480 compared to the minimum of 775 activity points), and now that we have merits no one can say that it is equally easy (difficult) to earn 500 or 1000 merits.My opinion is therefore that each rank has its own \"value\" in terms of the time and effort someone invested to achieve it. However, as you say, it is the decision of each manager.",

The answer lies on his self worth assessment because he has the free will to join the campaign which he likes the pay rate.The problem now was the competition is very tough for an average member to become choosy on the rank. Even some Legendary wants to take a low rank pay grade just to be enrolled on a campaign. Asking for the worth of our signature space is indeed based on the manager budget allocations per campaigns. Some campaign value Hero/Legendary as equal since they have same signature code but others value them separately.Answering the main OP, You knew exactly what’s it worth since you will not join a campaign that you knew that is underpaid based on your work.As per average of all active campaigns right now. Hero pay grade is ranging from 65$ to 100$ except some campaigns with extra pay since average Hero Member can’t enter that spot.",

Quality posters earn more because campaign managers feel that their reputation will give them more brand attention. Recently many campaign managers were scrambling for former Chipmixer campaign participants because it is generally believed that they are quality posters. Some campaigns pay higher than others. This might be a result of the company's budget or plan for the campaign. The have to pay based on thier budget regardless of the average level of payment.I recently observed that the fall of Chipmixer gave rise to more mixer firms. And some news gambling and exchange companies recently started their campaign. So it seems there is competition between these firms to attract quality posters. This has led some campaign management to increase their pay to make it more competitive.",

On campaigns, the price of the average hero-rank poster is from $50 to $100 but if it's all about you, you should be the one to set the price, and it depends on how confident you are in delivering visibility for your potential clients' platform.Your reputation and other services that you have like if you have a Twitter account with over 5000 followers you can include that, you offer the price and the client will take it based on their needs and what they are looking for a promoter.",

      "body": "In terms of signature it is the managers that decides that for their campaigns based on what agreement they must have had or reached with their clients to promote their various projects. So far, based on my experience onboard this platform with respect to signature campaigns, hero ranks mostly share same pay rate as legendary rank which means that they are likely of the same payment schedule. Most managers pay rate varies from $70 to $100. While for private rentage, it depends on your reputation and influence onboard the platform. Your ability to communicate here and potentials as well. This is exclusively  for members who have proven themselves worth the services and have been up and doing onboard the bitcointalk platform. Most of their payments are someworth private depending on the terms of agreement between both parties involved so far.  I am curious as to why you have asked such a question when in the real sense you are a hero rank and as such must have had several signature campaign experience compared to myself based on your rank on this platform.",

If you got selected for a campaign you may be offered something between 70 to 80$ or maybe more depending upon the campaign.Some campaigns may pay you even less like 50$ per week or so. Even you may get a lot of worthless tokens in you join bounties for signature space.Quote from: stadus on May 14, 2023, 12:08:17 PMI think you should know your price. By the way, what's the purpose of this?If he wants to rent his signature space, then there is no need to find the price of the signature space as no one will hire him. Only people give offers for signature spaces to people who are highly reputed on bitcointalk. Majority of the posters need to be hired in the campaign first in order to get paid for their signature space.",

So, according to you, hero member that earns less than $70 from a signature campaign is not good, or exceptional. I know what you were trying to say here, but the wording could've been better. OP, get what you are offered and be happy that you're getting it, as this is an additional reward that you're given for being here. A reward 99% of Internet forums doesn't provide at all and probably 50% of posters here don't qualify to receive. Don't fish for additional $10 like many people do when they join a campaign and after a week or two get accepted somewhere else, where they can get the same payment for 5 posts less, so they move. I find such behavior to be rude and pitiful.",

Stake is the campaign that offers the $160 per week but you would have to post alot(125 posts) to get it. If you're asking what kind of custom deal you could command, I would say nothing. You're not on DT, you don't have any trusted feedbacks, and you don't really earn a ton of merit(38 in last 120 days).",
