  "content": "Seems AI-assisted posting is becoming more rampant, and we should work together to brainstorm some concrete criteria for identification of AI-written posts.For me, the best indicator if a post is AI-generated is if it is written in flawless English. Even the best posters who are native English speakers don't necessarily write every post using the precision in punctuation, spelling & grammar executed by ChatGPT. If a user's native language isn't English (as can be evidenced by their posting history), and they suddenly start posting in flawless English, it means one of two things:1. The text is plagiarized, or2. The text is AI-generated.Its worth noting that not all plagiarized texts are written with the same mastery of English as ChatGPT. In fact, they seldom are.The second best indicator is taking an average of separate AI text identification systems; the more, the better. This is the one created by the makers of ChatGPT and is thus probably the best for identifying such text:https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifierHere are 6 other ones. https://writer.com/ai-content-detector/ (max. 1500 chars)https://gptzero.me/ (min. 250 chars)https://contentatscale.ai/ai-content-detector/ (min. 25 words)https://x.writefull.com/gpt-detector (50-2000 words)https://hivemoderation.com/ai-generated-content-detection (max. 8192 chars)https://paraphrasingtool.ai/ai-content-detector/ (max. 4900 chars)Seems like too much work to run a text through all 7, and some probably use extremely similar methods.Of course, they are not always accurate, but if the majority of them say \"likely\" or \"over 50% likely\", then I'd say its compelling evidence the text is AI generated.For example, this post - which I'm almost certain is AI-generated - comes back as \"unlikely\" to be AI-generated according to OpenAI's Text Classifier, yet it is \"99% likely\" AI generated according to the Hive Moderation checker.Here is how you ask ChatGPT to generate such a list:Prompt:QuoteCan you write me a list of bullet points about Bitcoin, with each one starting with a letter of the alphabet? For example:\"A- All your crypto journey could begin here and set you on the right path if you ask questions and follow up question and threads of your interestB- Bitcoin should be your first coin of choice when you're mentally ready to enter into the market because it's one of the best coins and generally accepted one.C- consistency is the easiest if not the only way to achieve everything you desire in everything you do and it's very evident over here in the forum.\"etc.It generated an extremely similar list which comes back as \"unclear\" according to the OpenAI Text Classifier and \"99% likely to contain AI generated text\" according to the Hive Moderation site. The problem is people can now be lazier than ever on the forum and get paid for it, which actually hurts them in the long run. Instead of thinking or learning anything for themselves, they just plug in a prompt, and prompt-plugging is the only actual skill they are gathering. Has nothing to do with Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, the blockchain, etc.TL;DR - What are the rock-solid criteria for detection & definition of AI-generated text?I suggest we put examples of what are believed to be AI-written posts in this thread to help evaluate them and come up with a refined consensus on how to detect them.",

There's simply no plausible explanation for such a drastic decrease of his English.Quote from: Maxre on April 09, 2023, 05:38:19 AMAs you are saying that increasing number winning prizes will for sure increase number for your chances to increase your winning chances but I will say that this gambling algorithm don't work that way. As when there will be more winners than there might be more traffic and it would be more difficult for us win prize and probability of winning could increase of decrease by a lot of factors. And also I think that we should predict on each side if you know that probability of your winning I'd more than 50% and it will increase your chances of winning too. I don't like those games that offer only 50% ratio as that's not good for us.",

Lembro-me de ter lido recentemente que o LoyceV fez um teste do seu próprio texto e esses detetores dizerem que era texto de IA. Por isso, esses sistemas dizerem que o texto tem 50% ou mais de probabilidade ter sido escrito por um IA, pode estar 100% enganado.Outro ponto, é que nem todos são fluentes em Inglês ou tem capacidade de escrever em inglês, e podem por isso usar sistemas de tradução e de ajuda na escrita. Eu por exemplo, para escrever aqui no fórum em Inglês, uso o Google Tradutor e as vezes uso a ferramenta Grammarly para tentar melhor o meu texto. A probabilidade de ser considerado um texto escrito por IA é alta.Por isso escrevi esse post, usando 4 métodos: escrever apenas usando o Google Tradutor; escrever com o ChatGPT a fazer a tradução; escrever apenas usando o Google Tradutor com ajuda Grammarly; escrever com a tradução do ChatGPT e ajuda do Grammarly.

That's also true. What I have so far is:1) sudden shift to perfect English is the #1 indicator2) detection tools can provide additional evidence if the majority of them indicate \"probable AI,\" or >50% likelihood.Of course running them through all 7 is too time consuming.

While in the last option (Written with the help of: ChatGPT & Grammarly) it identified as 100% written by human.That is, if the person uses the right tools, with half a dozen clicks and one or another adjustment, the detectors are no longer effective.Using an automatic system to detect text written by AI will only be effective if that AI uses a standard element. Thing, that doesn't happen. Now, you can use terms or expressions that normally a human, in a written conversation, is not used. And this can be an element that draws attention, but even so, you have to be careful about classifying it as done by AI or not.",

This raises the likelihood of being perceived as AI-generated text. To demonstrate this point, I wrote this post using four methods: Google Translate only, ChatGPT translation, Google Translate with Grammarly, and ChatGPT with Grammarly.

Here is the snippet he analyzed that came back 97% likely to be AI according to detector.dng.ai:QuoteFreedom!Welcome to Bitcointalk! I'll give you a very short introduction of what makes Bitcointalk unique. First: note that scams are not moderated! If something looks too good to be true, you are going to get scammed. Use common sense, and don't trust random strangers on the internet with your money.Bitcointalk offers more freedom than any other forum I know. You can choose to be an asshole or you can be a nice person. It's entirely up to you how you want to come across. If you're a snowflake, you might get offended. That's okay.You're allowed to earn money or do business here. Your freedom is mainly limited by the forum rules.Warning: unlike most websites, Bitcointalk does not allow plagiarism. This will get you banned! It's very easy to prevent: if you quote someone, give them the credit they deserve.1. OpenAI Text Classifier: (doesn't meet minimum character count)2. Writer.com: 98% human-generated content3. GPTZero.me: Your text may include parts written by AI4. Contentscale.ai: 89% - Highly likely to be Human!5. Writefull.com: 4% likely this comes from GPT-3, GPT-4 or ChatGPT.6. Hivemoderation.com: 0% - not likely to contain AI Generated Text7. Paraphrasingtool.ai: Text may contain AI-written sentencesSo based on this singular sample, I would say detectors 2, 4, 5 and 6 are the most accurate, while the one used by LoyceV seems to be terribly wrong. All the ones that offer percentages (except for detector.dng.ai) returned pretty accurate results. Now let's take a look at a post that we already believe is likely to be written by AI, assuming you agree with rat03gopoh's logic about posts with the phrase \"It's important to note...\" in them:QuoteThere are many reasons why traders may prefer to trade in the Bitcoin market over Forex.First, the bitcoin market is not regulated, which means that its prices and trading opportunities can change much faster than in regulated markets. This may provide more opportunities for profit, but it may also involve more risk.Secondly, the bitcoin market is still relatively young and rapidly developing, which may attract traders looking for new opportunities and risks.Third, the bitcoin market is more decentralized than the forex market, which may appeal to those looking for a freer, more independent market.Finally, it's important to note that not all bitcoin exchanges are \"shady\" or \"unsafe\", and many of them provide a high quality service to their clients. However, as with any market, there are risks associated with Bitcoin trading and traders should be prepared for this risk and have a risk management plan in place.1. OpenAI Text Classifier: (doesn't meet minimum character count)2. Writer.com: 53% human-generated content3. GPTZero.me: Your text is likely to be written entirely by AI4. Contentscale.ai: 26% - Highly likely to be AI generated!5. Writefull.com: 54% likely this comes from GPT-3, GPT-4 or ChatGPT.6. Hivemoderation.com: 99.9% - The input is likely to contain AI Generated Text7. Paraphrasingtool.ai: It's likely that AI wrote this textSo this time around, detectors 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 all gave the expected answer (though #5 at 54% isn't exactly \"convincing\"). So based on a sample size of 2, detectors 4, 5 and 6 are thus far the most accurate, with Hivemoderation.com being the most accurate. Will need to do more such tests before coming to any conclusions.One thing for certain is detector.dng.ai shouldn't be used. It didn't even make the cut in this article which is where I found these.",

Reason being that search engines are not very fond of these texts which translates into less visibility.There are ways to enhance good posts. I know of a forum who gives 1 cent for each sensitive post.He uses USDT for that.",

Isnt it through practicing daily and based on personal experience? Also what you mean by gives 1cent per each post? Isnt it a normal way to have discussion on normal ways? Plus AI generated topics copied are probably noticeable than self improve posting of someone.",

But usually those ones who've been caught on highly likely using AI for posting are not so thorough, the texts they post look unnatural, written in common words and having not much sense. Of course some real users write text the same way by themselves... but should we really care of the texts which have low quality and look like made by AI?",
