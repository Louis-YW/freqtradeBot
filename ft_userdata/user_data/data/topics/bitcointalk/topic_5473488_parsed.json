      "body": "Let me set the stage with the most recent upcoming matches for the 14th of November:I think an obvious favorite for a win would be Benfica here as they have been performing better in their recent matches than Galatasaray.Another interesting match is Promitheas vs Dijon:Odds favor a Dijon win, but Promitheas is actually doing surprisingly very well in their national league so far, so let's see... Being Greek I'm hoping for an upset here   Let's see if we can get some buzz discussing how our favorite teams our doing. Maybe more odds providers will appreciate this tournament and start featuring it.",
