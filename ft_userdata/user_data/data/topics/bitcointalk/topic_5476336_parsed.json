In my experience, it's really different when you use the exchanges that are in the top 20 listed in the market than the exchanges you mentioned, which are worthless in my opinion.",

I've heard of latoken years ago but I've no idea how it's doing now... The other two? never heard of them. If it's a CEx, much better to go with the long established exchanges like kucoin, bybit, kraken, etc.I don't think there is a verified list which you speak of but you could always look up what people are saying about a particular exchange. For instance I typically look for posts in bitcointalk.org, reddit.com or sometimes twitter.",

The rest of the services are unknown, and if you search online, you will not find them. Something about them so it's best to avoid them.What exactly are you trying to find that we may be able to help you with?",

All of the above are either small, niche and known for shady behavior, or small, niche and unknown to anyone. All of them additionally have fake volume, fake order book, huge spreads and, as a result, huge transaction costs. They do not have a large active user base nor are they regulated entities nor even tries to be regulated. you have to trust them not to cheat you and the economy drives them to cheat. They have nothing to lose (brand, customer trust, reputation), they do not generate large profits, and customers' wallets have funds that are tempting. I would avoid any of these.The only exchanges that can be trusted are Binance and Coinbase. Maybe kucoin, but the list is slowly ending. But I have a good news for you. All you need is 1 good exchange. You don't have to have the whole list.",

The other 2 is completely unknown for me which is a red flag. If you are really tired on scam exchanges then why stick on popular brand such as Binance, Kucoin, Bybit and more instead of trying to use unknown exchange.There’s a lot of DEX too that will save you from hassle of thinking whether exchange is scam since everything is transparent including the available liquidity. But I knew bestchange.com provides a collection of exchange which they trust. I’m not affiliated with them but they are on this business for a long term and established already good reputation so it’s worthy checking their service offer.",

Many people would be willing to provide exchange recommendations based on your goals. As long as the exchange you choose is not so popular at the moment and not familiar to many, it seems like a significant risk to transact or store big assets there.I think this isn't a matter of rank, where I often use my local exchange, which is tokocrypto. Until now, I haven't seen any signs of suspicion that this exchange is fraudulent. Moreover, this exchange is regulated and officially monitored by government agencies in my country, so I'm confident that the rank doesn't have a significant impact here.",

Hitbtc do only have a different approach.Maybe they didn't accept much shitcoin but they only try to earn more via the expensive fees that they set. We don't know the other exchanges listed by the OP, so I wouldn't judge them yet. And when I check the CMC top exchange list, I'm surprised that there is a Coinw there. So maybe that exchange truly has a potential? And the other one might still be starting. Well, let's just see their performance later on if there is an improvement.",
