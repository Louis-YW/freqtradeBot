I personally have never been a big fan of Fanatics (to those who aren’t aware of who they are, they are an online sports apparel website. They’ve expanded in to other sectors such as baseball cards, where they purchased Topps, a legendary baseball card company).   I won’t be using their services , but admittedly very curious how well they’ll do.",
