You are welcome!asus b250 mining expert is also a good motherboard. But with a gigabyte, it’s easier to start mining. For example, if I took an asus, then I would have to study the documentation for this board.And I do not use more than 8 video cards in one mining farm.https://www.asus.com/Motherboards-Components/Motherboards/Others/B250-MINING-EXPERT/",

Why do you need these problems with BIOS settings and forums?Mining motherboards work out of the box and have a convenient USB interface for connecting raisers, which helps beginners avoid mistakes when connecting a PCI-e adapter.https://aliexpress.ru/popular/b75-motherboard-mining.html And most importantly, these motherboards are cheap.",

If you use windows, then one video card will use 100-200 megabytes of memory and this can affect the hashrate, as was the case with ethereum mining on 4 GB video cards.",

Dust in a smaller degree isn't a problem, but little dust + high humidity can seriously hurt the boards very quickly.",
