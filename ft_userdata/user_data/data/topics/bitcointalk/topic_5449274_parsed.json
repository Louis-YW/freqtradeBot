A lot of dex resurface just to scam others with the liquidity and thats not gonna be easy for everyone.l leaving their fund easily stolen by these greedy developers.Do you have any proof that it has potential and has legit team?",

You can not say CEX is safer than DEX or DEX is safer than CEX.Decentralized exchanges give scammers a more easily way to add their tokens, add liquidity and scam more people.

That's mean, the problem it's on \"User\" side not form the platform. No matter how good security, if the problem is from the user then there is nothing we can do. Yes, it's easily to trade on \"dex\" but it's hard to be recognize on the dex so they actually need to put a contract rather than a name of project.---Anyway, DEX & CEX are have their own advantage. So, nothing wrong in these both platform from my perspecrtive.",

It is the fusion of all the emerging systems like Dex and arbitrum in crypto to produce better results.At the moment Arbitrum is definitely the hottest ethereum layer 2 solution out there. They are still having a lot of attention at the moment because of that huge airdrop that they did that brought tens of thousands users tokens worth 1000$ or more. Then a few days ago i have read a statement somewhere that the TVL on the Arbitrum chain was higher than the TVL of Ethereum itself. This is absolutely makes sense to me, because now that the market is making stronger movements again the fees on the native ethereum chain are already up at 60 gwei again, which is just way to high. A uniswap trade costs 25$ at the moment.",

Since there are many new to crypto currency, People want to use a platform that can easily be used at the same time doesn't cost that much fee on using it. As we progress and CEX are being attacked with issues and scandals such as hacking and integrity, People are now considering DEX and all we need to have now is an efficient to use DEX that can go toe to toe with CEX capabilities.",

It has a pretty good margin, but at the same time there is a certain level of trust (high liquidity, low liquidity) at it that it has some advantages and disadvantages. There are two possibilities here, either one could gain more benefits from an exchange or an exchange would provide better customer base. Either way, it is clear why it is a good choice and why we should not panic but be careful.",

Once the regulators sued the dev behind the dex and it will be the end for the dex. The dex will comply with the regulation. Remember that so many dex were also getting hacked by the hackers. That proves that if dex is not even safe at this time. The only safe place to keep your money in your hand. Think about that. Having so many dex didn't mean crypto become even stronger.",
