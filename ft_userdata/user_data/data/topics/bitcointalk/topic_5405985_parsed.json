  "content": "Hi, I would like to start copytrading with Bitget and I have a couple of questions.I was thinking of making a deposit of 50 euros to do copytrading. What is the best strategy to avoid liquidations?My idea was to start copytrading with 20 euros of those 50 euros (and the other 30 I would leave in the account in case the market goes against me...to avoid being liquidated).With those 20 euros I would make a x10 so I would be doing copytrading with 200 euros and I would have 30 in the account to avoid liquidations.Do you think this is the best option? or would it be better to just make a leverage of x10 with 10 euros and leave 40 euros for possible losses and avoid liquidations?Where should I leave those 30 or 40 euros in the account? in the futures account, in the main account or where?I have also seen that many traders that can be followed in copy trading make leverage of x50 but that is very risky isn't it? if I want to make a leverage of x50 What is the best strategy to avoid liquidations?I guess I should set the stop loss at 1% below the entry price.and also to leave money in the account in case the market goes against meand how much would be needed?And finally what is the minimum amount to do copytrading?I thought the minimum was 10$ (I had about 4 in the account and I made a leverage of x10 so it was equivalent to have 40$) and bitget sends me the following notificationThe total equity in your futures account is below the security (100 USDT). In order to keep the copy trades with your trader, please top them up on time.Do you think a deposit of 50 euros will be enough or will I have to make a deposit of 100 euros to start doing copytrading?",

You either learn to trade for yourself, or you don't altogether.But to answer your question, the trick to not get liquidated is to simply either:1. Deposit more money2. Don't use leverage3. Git gud (or tell the \"trader\" you're copying)",

The decision there is not in our hands, because the trader whom we copied can be liquidated so we’re at risk. Futures trading is much more riskier than ever, as I have seen a lot of traders there who lots tons of money there because of being liquidated big amounts that they don’t have the control over their own decisions.Manual spot trading is still the best trading method for us to go in my opinion. At least our risk there is a little bit lesser than copy or futures trading.",

Back then in 2021 when everything was going up, high-risk traders on eToro that are up like 1000-2000% per month (for only 2 months lmao) are like celebrities with copy-traders piling into them to hopefully gain the same results. Ended up badly, obviously. You can keep flipping coins with huge bets and winning a few times but we all know that it wouldn't be sustainable.",

For instance look at how your asking from your thread, What is the best strategy to avoid liquidations?, this is the kind of challenges you gonna face and become confused at a certain point.",

It’s a gamble to choose the best trader that will give you a good return since most the trader on copy trading is not a stable trader or rather just placing position for a short term return.You should learn to trade on your own so that you can manage properly your margin to avoid liquidation.For those mindset who do love to earn without exerting much effort and time then the primary thing that they would be having on mind is to copy trade because its simple and minding that theycould make profits without much effort but frankly speaking it would be more better if you do learn while you do follow because as mentioned that not all would really be having that kind of idea on mind that it would be lasting forever or having always that precise trades for long term.Nothing beats out if you do make out learning on your own or simply trade with your own because you arent really that depending on someone but rather only depending on your own skills.",

I don't recommend it as you don't know who trader you want to copy and how good their skills in trading are. Their stats seem tempting you to join with his trade but once again, you have a risk that you don't know it.I suggest you learn about trading and use that money for spot trading. There is no need to hurry to trade, but doing with carefully will help you understand how to trade better. While you also learn more about trading, you will get more experience in trading, and after you familiarize yourself with trading, you can try future trading. That will give you more profit if you understand how to analyze the market.",

LolI think the OP should also consider not using all his capital in the early stages, maybe it would be better to suggest he starts at 25% - 50% of his capital and he still has some spare to go on when he really knows how to work. The truth is, if we can build from small capital then of course we don't need to be too greedy to do it with big capital. This is the best advice I've ever heard.",
