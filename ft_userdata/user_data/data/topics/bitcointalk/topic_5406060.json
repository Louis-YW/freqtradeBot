Although I am not exactly sure what the airdrop is, I do know that they still buy a lot of it. Of course, the price is very cheap because it is an empty and almost unused item.Cryptocurrency industry is magical, there are ways we can make money that other people can't think of.",

If what I suspect is true, then it is a scam not magic. I would suggest the OP to not deal in such things unless they are sure of the buyer's motives.",

The above scamming methods seems a better investment, logically. After all, which airdrop made its receivers a millionaire? None.Some people do buy things like an old address that contains transactions, a GitHub account, and an aged active Twitter account to qualify for an airdrop. I never tried it out since I don't see any of it is worth it(the airdropped amount is just so minuscule), even though I do have those mentioned things. But I think it's only a matter of information, if some people have valuable airdrop information that few people know it, they surely will buy any requirement for the airdrop, even if they only profit a small margin or just simply bet the token/coin will profitable.",

      "body": "The answer is very clear, they want to buy it to qualify for an airdrop program, do you remember Uniswap Airdrop? Or recently happened like Optimism (OP) airdrop event. The more transactions you have made, the less likely you are to never make a transaction on the platform that is a requirement for the airdrop event.FYI, usually they are not only looking for Ethereum addresses with lots of transactions, but they are also usually looking for old Github and Twitter accounts. My advice, if you have something they want to look for, it's better you don't sell it because we don't know what future events will be, who knows you will get a lot of money from there later, LOL.",

I am also thinking if it is still safe after the seller will give the private keys because for sure the seller can still access it if ever they decided not to forget it totally.I didn’t know airdrop requires huge number of transactions now with regards to the address that they are going to provide, this is quiet suspicious honestly since we don’t really know the exact reason of those buyer. With regards to the safety of the seller, maybe if the wallet used in fraud and the seller exposed his real identity before using that address, most probably he will be the one to suffer the consequences if the authority finds him. The seller can still have that key and monitor the wallet, so its not safe as well for the buyer which makes no sense on buying a wallet.",

Is there value in our old addresses that we don't know about? Lol.Very highly likely to gain airdrops. There are some airdrops that are given to addresses that are old and was active during certain period of time. The buyer probably hopes that the seller hasn't redeems/claimed those rewards. If the value of the rewards is more than what he is paying for the address, he doesn't lose anything. Just some quick bucks for him. I don't see any other reason. I am sure he wouldn't use it to store his coins since the original owner will also have access to the wallet.",

(I do have some of these addresses which had been long time not been used but does havethose no. transactions had been mentioned.) hehe.My nearest presumption will really be speaking about airdrops just like on what been said above.There might be already some qualifications for that one?

I got a buying order, and he stated he isn't willing to buy and just to know some information he have started the trade. It isn't possible to have conversation without a trade. He requested is there anyone who have got an account that have made 1000+, 5000+, 10k+ trades. Based on this I can provide payment just for providing trustworthy feedbacks. I started to brief him, just do the trade with an user and he'll give you trustworthy feedback depending on the transaction made. He isn't ready to accept, but looking for a way to trap others with fake trustworthy feedbacks. Same is here planned with the increased number of transactions.",
