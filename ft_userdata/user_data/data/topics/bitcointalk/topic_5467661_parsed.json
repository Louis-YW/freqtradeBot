Yes you can use an external hard drive to store the data directory but you might have to manually specify it since bitcoin core will not know it is on the hard drive. So when you start the client just specify that the dir is on the external drive not the system hard drive where it is installed on. Here is what I saw on how to specify itCode:bitcoind --datadir=<your_external_drive_location>This YouTube video might help  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mLCOW6KkbQM Note the external hard drive might always be connected when using the bitcoin core",

Thank you in advance to everyone who responds to this question.Yes, it is not only possible but highly recommended setup as it makes a bit faster the sync and, at the same time,  ease the burden of the drive that holds OS.I would advocate for external SSD instead of HDD  to not wait too long time for the  initial synchronization  completion .Put down into bitcoin.conf the following entriesdbcache=<M># where   M equals to 1/4 RAM, for instance if you RAM = 8Gb then dbcache=2048blocksonly=1 # this will increase the sync  speed as it  disables node listening and \"stop requesting and relaying transactions unless they are part of the block\". After full initial sync you may remove this  entry.datadir=<path to directory on external drive where Bitcoin Core will keep its data># For instance my path looks like this datadir=F:/ BitcoinData. Instead of BitcoinDta you can use any set of permissible characters you want",

Is it possible to use an external hard drive as the data directory (datadir)? How does this setup work, and would I need to pay attention to? Thank you in advance to everyone who responds to this question.All what you said is possible, you can run it with a low storage capacity and you can use an external hard drive to have more capacity.If you use your first option, then you need to prune your BitcoinCore, that means that you will only store a certain amount of blocks according the configuration that you specified.In order to prune it, you just have to add the following line on bitcoin.conf file:Code:prune=10000This would allow to store all blocks possible in 10Gb if you have 5Gb then use 5000, etc.For the second option, using an external hard drive, you just have to add the parameter -datadir=$pathToStorage when running the Btc Core:Code:bitcoind --datadir=/mnt/dataYou can also add that parameter on the bitcoin.conf file so you'll not have to specify it every time. (Use your own /data path)This article does it with a rapsberry:  https://ishaana-misra.medium.com/using-raspberry-pi-to-run-a-full-bitcoin-node-a30c6339b06eThe setup is the same so you can follow the part where she uses the parameter datadir: - Setting Up The External Hard Drive - Installing & Running The Bitcoin CoreHope this helps SS",

Yes as it has been said you can always use external drives to a save all your blockchain  datas which will serve as you directory to be precise. It now depends on you find a suitable drive for it,you could use hard drives as you've asked.Quote from: DifDrama on September 22, 2023, 02:09:33 AM How does this setup work,I did some research for you and I found out a quote with a detailed explanation on how to go about itIt's a post made by HI-TEC99 on January 08 2017Quote from:  HI-TEC99There is a way to to that if you create a shortcut to your Bitcoin-qt inside a folder you installed it to.Right click your blackcoin qt Bitcoin-qt and select \"create shortcut\". Right click the shortcut and select properties. A popup should open containing a text box with the word target written to the left of it. Add the line of text below to the end of whatever is already written in it. Make sure there is a space between the text that was already in the text box and the text below. -datadir=.Press the apply button, then the OK button.Double click the shortcut to start the blackcoin Bitcoin-qt wallet and it should store its largest files (the blockchain) and also its wallet.dat inside the folder containing the shortcut.You can install the blackcoin qt Bitcoin-qt to a folder on a thumbdrive, use that shortcut technique, and when you double click the shortcut the blockchain and wallet.dat will get stored on your thumbdrive, not in appdata.If you use that technique, and accidentally double click the qt instead of the shortcut a new wallet dat and blockchain will get created on your C drive inside appdata. Make sure you always start your wallet using the shortcut.You can go through and follow the directions if there's seems to be no change in the aspect. It should help.",

Is it possible to use an external hard drive as the data directory (datadir)? How does this setup work, and would I need to pay attention to? It is feasible to run Bitcoin Core on a laptop with limited storage, but you will need to make certain tweaks to effectively manage the storage needs. Here are suggestion.Pruning: which limits the amount of data retained on your disc, is a feature of Bitcoin Core that you may enable. Pruning keeps the most current blocks while removing old block data. Add the following line to your bitcoin.conf configuration file (found in the bitcoin data directory) to enable pruning.amount of megabytes prunedSubstitute the appropriate size of the blockchain data you wish to save for \"number of megabytes.\" The latest 2 GB of blockchain data will be kept by Bitcoin Core for instance if you set it to 2048.",

Bitcoin Core is very slow at cleaning up its state, so if you just disconnect the drive without ejecting it safely first, it's not going to have enough time to dump its memory database of transactions onto the disk.Also it would be much simpler to buy a big enough internal storage disk and a SATA connector assuming your laptop has room for an extra cable/device inside.",

When I purchased it I could barely see any signs of usage, lucky me. The battery that came with the laptop is still quite OK. To preserve battery life and when I don't need the battery when I can run the laptop on a power cord, I usually disconnect the battery when it is charged around 40%. On a Latitude you could also configure the battery management to only charge the battery to 50% max. when you're always plugged to the power cord. Such low charging levels are beneficial for battery life and endurance.

I've had new laptops break within a few years, sometimes mechanical (the hinges), sometimes the mainboard just giving up. I also have laptops 8-12 years old, and they get useless because of old age, not because they're breaking.
