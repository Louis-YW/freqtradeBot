It's a rat race to get in and get a share while the hype exists, this surge in demand increases the perceived value and results in the sky rocketing prices.Hype can last for a short time, or a much longer one as we can see with meme coins like doge and Shiba. I can't particularly explain why they have lasted this long.Note, I'm not saying all who invest in hype are naive investors as there is potential for ROI in there, and with a calculated risk one can profit from them.",

Their only continuation lies in the loyalty of the community, but basically you are competing with each other. When you buy it, it's just like you bet against a lot of people with the same hope that you won't be the last person to get stuck in the dump.",

      "body": "Since Elon Musk   began promoting Dogecoin, meme-coins have surged in popularity, particularly the cryptocurrencies Shibu Inu and Safemoon. Some see investing in memecoins as madness, while others see them as an opportunity to get rich quickly, earning up to 1000% of the investment. For example, in May 2021, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, posted a photo of his pet goats with the caption \"My Goats: Max and Bitcoin. And just hours after that post was published on the social network, the value of the meme-token Aqua Goat (\"water goat\") went up about 300%. According to price aggregator CoinMarketCap, the three most popular meme-coins are Dogecoin, Shibu Inu and Safemoon (as of June 2021).Are they worth investing?    Don`t think so.",

The correct thing is if it meme token was only getting its value from the speculation by traders and the whales. The real value of meme token is not even exist. This token being created as a joke token that has no value. People are so dumb by consider the meme token as long term investment which is a very bad thing for sure. Im sure that if you will be seeing so many meme tokens dead in the market. This proves that meme token was only for a speculation only",

Of course you can ride on them, but nevertheless, the price will not go on a parabolic rise. And sooner or later it will go down hard.",

You sound mature! Memecoins and NFTs are both two sides of a coin which doesn't have any value. That's why you will see thousands of memecoins are getting added in Pancakeswap every month but disappears after a short while. The creator of those coins launch it and let it get traded, once the price is at ATH, they sell of their holdings and exit the market. So stay away from NFTs and memecoins at all costs!",

Meme coins are good tokens, they have their separate use case, some have auto staking, some share token or busd rewards while some are just there surviving on just hypes.

People are following FOMO and they were buying the shit token massively.

These days there are bunch of people wanna get instant profit and they were following the pump that happened with the meme token to get some money instantly. that's why we have called that as a shit token that has no usability.",

The moment memecoins gets attached to the blockchain it'll have a value and investors will see more reasons to hold them but, this means nothing to a fresh investors who joined the cryptocurrency market because of memecoins. An investor that got introduced to cryptocurrency by a dogecoin hodler will definitely buy Doge. You see why the price is rising? The market that attracts more investors will definitely grow. Currently Doge is trading at over $100million daily and the 13 largest cryptocurrency according to coinmarketcap. Everyone accuse memecoin to be a joke coin and jokes don't stay forever, but, through entertainers potential investors can be brought into cryptocurrency. Most people knew cryptocurrency because of memecoins. Regardless of their failure to make profits using memecoins, they now have a platform to start their cryptocurrency journey and move it forward. Experience they say is the best teacher. So, memecoins rise in price because their jokes attracts more investors into cryptocurrency.",

Same memecoins are hyped assets that have gained value from excessive buying that some shill groups have done. Hence if you own any of such coins, just sell them at an inflated price and cash out, dont hold from for too long. In case you never got any, refrain from making a new investment in your portfolio.Truely, they have no value, but if someone keeps buying at higher price and someone keeps selling at higher prices, it seems as though the trading base is active, while in reality it is not much in development or long term value.",

They don't really have a real use-case and they don't offer any functionality for their users. That is also a reason why a lot of people call them shit-coins. The reason why a lot of those shit-coins showed such a good price performance was pretty simple and also pretty ridiculous to be honest. Elon Musk made a tweet about Dogecoin a few months ago and that was enough to make the price of Dogecoin itself rise significantly it also was the reason why the wave of second generation meme-coins started a few months ago. During the peak of the meme-coin craze there were like hundreds of new meme-coins appearing every week and 99% percent of them were dead again after a few days.Thank god the meme-coin hype is over.",
