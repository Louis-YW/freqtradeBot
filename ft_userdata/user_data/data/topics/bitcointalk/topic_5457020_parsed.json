  "content": "It seems that he has tons and tons of bots and almost on every pair from time to time there is a sandwich attack by him.Basically if you see a token at 10 cents, you send an order but he buys it first at 10 cents, and you are forced to buy it at 11 cents and in the same second he sells it for 11 cents, so you basically overpay.Only way I can see is making small orders at a time instead of a large order at once but with the V3 uniswap fees its going to cut into the profits especially when gas fees are high.Wondering if anyone here has any tips ?",
