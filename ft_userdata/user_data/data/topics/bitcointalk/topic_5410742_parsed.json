  "content": "It appears FTX is beginning to protect itself from being sanctioned if they allow deposits and withdrawals to any privacy enhancing networks or services. According to Wu Blockchain, FTX identified this privacy roll up for Ethereum called Aztec Network as a mixing service.This might also only be the beginning. I predict within 10 years, we will have a world where much of the exchanges would begin blocking you if you use privacy enhancing services, networks and protocols.Recently, FTX froze a user account who sent coins to @aztecnetwork's zkmoney. According to FTX, Aztec Connect - Aztec network / zk money has been identified as a mixing service, which is a high-risk activity prohibited by FTX.Source https://mobile.twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1560417501053616131",

According to FTX, Aztec Connect - Aztec network / zk money has been identified as a mixing service, which is a high-risk activity prohibited by FTX.If Aztec Network seem more to be like a mixing service, people using it should expect that their exchange account can be frozen if a mixed coin is sent to or received from the mixing service. People that are using exchanges should always know that they do not have privacy on exchanges and also that they do not have full control over their own coins and tokens. To have full control, noncustodial wallets are the only option.",

      "body": "If the majority of people use a mixing method (whatever it is service, network, or protocol), according to their standard they will block each account. That won't happen.With all the profits to make, from a company's point of view, they will suddenly find a way. FTX's CEO is an entrepreneur, and so here to make money. All the stuff about privacy is an \"I don't care\" thing@bbc.reporterIf you predict 10 years to see such a situation generalized, I give it 5 years at max. All the companies like FTX want to be compliant and are ready to do anything needed. Blocking a couple of users here and there won't be a big loose as long it makes governments happy.Remember the case with Binance a couple of months ago?I say it, CEXs are a threat to the Bitcoin principles. And guess why they don't really want to add LN?",

However, if they're argument against mixers, anonymous coins and privacy rollups is many criminals use it, have they also considered that also many people who are not criminals use them also? Should we also ban everything the criminals use like cars and cellular phones?",

What happens if Bitcoin becomes the currency of choice and OFAC will be helpless in the face of its adoption? There's no founder or CEO to negotiate with. There's no server to shut down. Addresses could be banned, yes, but it is very easy to generate a new one. How will they proceed? This isn't the beginning of control simply because state authorities cannot impose total control. If at all, this is the beginning of supporters starting to get enlightened and eventually leaving centralized platforms such as FTX because it is obviously a censorship point. As I've said, things are going to get messy. The more stern state regulators become the more difficult the situation they're bringing themselves into grows.",

I can see where they may freeze your account if incoming coins originated from someplace that they have on their 'no' list but going out.
