  "content": "Today, after seeing the news that the OKX platform requires KYC, I logged into my account, and from there a small notice appeared to me that there are limits of $ 1000 (lifetime) for deposits and withdrawals, so I decided to deposit $50 to try it for the last time. After deposits, they directly frozen my account and asked to verify ID/selfie before doing anything.Therefore, if you see a $1,000 limit notice, avoid depositing if you do not intend to complete KYC.Unfortunately, after all this time, this was the end of my experience with OKX.Currently, I do not have a way to withdraw that 50 dollars. I thought of withdrawing it via internal exchange. I do not know if it will succeed, but if there is someone who has a verified account, please PM me with his sub-account and I will try to send it to him.EDIT: here is the answer from technical support:QuotePlease note that previous withdrawals and deposits made prior to the recent rule update also affect the current limit. In other words, for example, if you had 500 USD left within the lifetime limit before the rules update, then after the update you will also have 500 USD left, not 1000 USD.Â I hope I was able to clarify this issue for you.If you have any additional questions, we are always happy to support you. I wish you all the best!",

I wrote about this in my notes on using centralized exchanges:No, I log into the account from time to time, I haven't made a deposit for about two months, but everything is done through a dedicated IP, saving cookies, a clean operating system and a browser that I only use to access that account, so it's not a security problem.",

It could be what that caused it. For anyone that do not want KYC exchange and they do not want an exchange to force them to get verified, such people should avoid OKX is what I think. OKX has gotten strict with KYC requirements. Identity documents are getting needed.Edit: I mean you should try and remember if you have deposited and withdrawn more than $1000. That amount is too small and you may not remember you have deposited and withdrawn more than that amount after you have deposited and withdrawn more.",

No, the rate of withdrawal from the account is approximately 600 to 800 per month, and sometimes a month or two may pass without withdrawal.Quote from: BitMaxz on July 05, 2023, 08:07:16 AMAre you Basic level 1 verified?Yes, the problem is that the word 1000 dollars is misleading. I did not deposit or withdraw 1000 dollars after I got that notification, maybe during the last 6 months or within a year.For reference and future purposes, when you deposit, you will get this error.And when you want to withdraw, you will get this error, and you cannot withdraw to an internal address.Knowing that I did not deposit or withdraw $1,000 after I got this notification, but I deposited $50 and was not able to withdraw it.In short, there is no way without KYC after you get the $1000 restrictions.I will lock this topic because its purpose is to verify the possibility of withdrawing to an internal address, and you can discuss about OKX's KYC here ---> OKX enforcing KYC.and for updated list ----> Current list of exchanges without KYC",

From this we can conclude that if someone wants to use OKX now in the most secure way, he should create a new account 9while there is such a possibility), or use old accounts that have not had any operations before (as in my case above).I agree, I don't know why they didn't mention that, meaning they should have said, the deposit limit is $1000, you have $400 left.Quote from: BitMaxz on July 05, 2023, 08:21:38 AMWhat country you are living?

They don't even have an announcement or inform their customers that they are going to update their terms.I do not think so. For example, I remember that I submitted my data (without sending documents) some time ago (I do not remember the date, but sometime between March and June) and I was allowed to withdraw up to $5,000. If there was a ban, the UK would not have been shown to me as an option and I would not have been asked to send data.In addition, the data that is required is a copy of the passport and a selfie, which is not related to the country because they did not ask me to prove the address. For example, a British citizen can use the platform if he was in a country that does not have restrictions.Quote from: https://www.okx.com/help-center/3600218136912.2 Note that we may not make all of the Services available in all markets and jurisdictions, and may restrict or prohibit use of all or a portion of the Services from Restricted LocationsNote regions/Locations, not nationalities.Quote from: Ratimov on July 05, 2023, 09:46:57 AMAnd here is the answer from technical support:Can you ask them about the period in which they imposed a $1,000 limit, is it the last 3 months, 6 months, a year, or the total deposits since the date the account was created?Why they didn't show the remaining amount? for example, you withdrew 700 dollars, you have 300 dollars left, please complete KYC L2 to increase the withdrawal limits.",

Back then the lifetime KYC 1 withdrawal limit is $5,000, not $1,000.Quote@okx has frozen withdrawals for users without KYC 2 verification. The platform has implemented $5k lifetime deposit/withdrawal limit for KYC 1 users without prior notification. KYC 1 users can not withdraw their funds without KYC 2 verification.They did not admit any change on their platform in two replies for that tweet, it is vague.If they continued to shady change their Terms of service, change lifetime withdrawal limit for KYC1 from $5,000 to $1,000 and hide information that limit applied for past withdrawals too, they are very shady.Avoid OKX exchange when you have other centralized exchanges too use. This OKX drama reminds the Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsThey rebranded from OKEX but did not change their shady operations. Wash trading accusationQuoteIt faced several accusations of shady practices in 2018. One is that 90% of the trade volume is fake â boosted by actions like wash trading.",
