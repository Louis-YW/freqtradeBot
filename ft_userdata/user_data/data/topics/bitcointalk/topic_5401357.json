For the bulk of my time here, I worked as a bounty hunter, merely tapping on bounty links from Telegram groups to participate in campaigns; it was all I was taught to do. After a few weeks of boredom, I decided to investigate the forum. That day, I came across a lot of intriguing subjects and posts, and I realized there's a lot to learn here, and the site isn't just about bounties.I take it back to start a new life in this forum, hoping to get proper guide on where to start from so that I can learn and contribute to the forum too as others.",

It's good that you take your time to investigate what the Bitcointalk really is. Bitcointalk forum is not all about bounties but all about sharing, learning and helping other people. Some business owners use the Bitcointalk platform to promote their projects with a reward and that's where the campaign comes.",

I'm just getting to find out the meaning of bounty and bounty hunters, I didn't know of the existence of such here in this forum. Truthfully we have been drawn to this forum for various reasons, but I think the most important thing and what should be the aim of everyone here should be to learn. Since you have realised that you have started on the wrong foot, it is the first step in making amends, change your objective here and in no time certainly there will be better opportunities for you in the crypto space that you will discover from learning.",

Being a bounty hunter isnt a crime, but we must uphold the very mission here on forum, to provide discussion and meaningful topics. I am the same initial as yours when I landed here, my purpose is for bounty and Ive changed that, and realized it far more longer than you actually but I glad Ive did, so its not really too late for you, I understand you and hoping yoi could transform than into a contributor here.

You can binge watch his videos if you have some free time to spare  - https://youtube.com/c/aantonopAnother great resource you can start reading is Jameson Lopp's website. The articles he made contains a lot of tools and resources that you can use in experimenting and learning the fundamental behind bitcoin. Just make sure to read them on a habitual basis to learn more effectively.- https://www.lopp.net/",

You can start by deleting your bounty reports and posts if you've claimed your rewards from them. That will tidy up your post history. I don't think most of the community members like going through profiles that are taken up by bounty reports. For me, I don't. Even when I want to merit a user's other posts and I discover it has a lot of bounty reports and posts it pisses me off. Look at how easily you've received 4 merits for the short OP you've made and that's the highest you've got since you registered here in 2021. It goes to show how the community is ready to reward genuine users. So, buckle up and keep soaring henceforth.",

I came to the forum in March by accident, and also accidentally found out about the bounty. But my patience was enough for five months. I desperately believed in these scam projects that promised great prospects for investors and also for those who advertised them. Realizing that I was wasting my time, I began to expose these scams.But indeed, a lot of people came to the forum, as the OP puts it, from the wrong step, and we had to \"sober up\" for a while.The OP spent about nine months, which can also be said, he got good experience so that he would no longer return to the bounty advertising classes.I'm happy for you, OP.
