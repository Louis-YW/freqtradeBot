  "content": "Market is a place of buying and selling with defrauding agreement. People trust and deal with people who can deliver in their terms of agreement. Most client lack trust issues from market people, so the only proves that they're dealing with the right markets is the tale of redeeming of image to others, making sure priorities are place before money, traders should value people interest. Don't comprise original for fake or bridge your agreement terms, or failed to deliver whatever service.Like in cryptosystem where we deal with invisible assets, most sellers are not sincere and most buyers are not genuine, the feeling who will send first has corrupt original intention of what should be. Eg I want to buy bitcoin worth $3000, I got a trader who is will to sell and he or she said send me your money first and I will like no! I don't know you in person, we meet online! You send BTC to me first through wallet eadrefgdvbgjjhhbcjvnhhbbvgnc. Here our trust has been collapse looking for how sincerity will come again becomes a barrier.Market people are interest people, buyers are satisfaction people. Interest and satisfaction makes human insatiable. We should be plain our dealing and the world will trust their money, wealth and resources into your hands.As a trader or bitcoin dealer always stand for the truth, don't steal from people, don't take their money and refused to send bitcoins to the buyer and do verify the buyers profile well enough for a fair transaction.Buyers don't buy what you're not willing to pay. Don't scam people crypto's because fake trust and don't buy on credit to avoid further explanation of losses. Buy what you can afford easy payment. Let's keep dignity, fairness, sincerity and trust for the real business deal.",

For instance, If you don't have a reputable standing, it makes sense for the other end to be wary of sending first as well. That's why the middle ground approach is to have a reputable middleman/escrow to oversee the trade.",

That's why if you are going to buy bitcoin from a dealer there should be an esrow intermediary, this is one of the best ways to know how to make your transaction go smoothly.Or if you know how to buy bitcoin at your local location, it is also better or it can also be done at centralized exchanges known in this industry, it's just that simple to do.",

So whether you want to buy Bitcoin or sell yours, the chances of getting scammed by sending first have been reduced largely by this system.I agree with you that service providers or clients should not compromise quality and assess the trust of their customers and deal with transparency. Though some businesses do that, but we will always have both good and bad traders as long as the world exists.",

I can't deny that the scammers in this era are naturally good and smart, they only attack once but they act badly and they don't just victimize one person.      Then the sad thing is that people who have been victimized by scammers even though they know the feeling, they are still not taken away although they don't want it to happen again, but the problem is that they are not careful, alert and sensitive to the actions of a scammer.",

The quality of services or products that are given to the customers also plays a vital role in making a business successful. Those dealers or traders that lack any of these qualities will eventually lose their customers one by one to other vendors within the same business.Sometimes dealers and traders reduce the quality of products and services only to cut the cost of production and save money, without realizing that this will eventually ruin their business and give an edge to the competitors.",

These people rarely invest, but rather focus all their attention on putting money in the bank, buying a house and a car, and then suddenly they realize that they are over forty.

It is necessary for dealer/trader to fulfill his commitment whether he is dealing kind of trading activities he is conducting including Bitcoin or other crypto currencies. In the world of crypto currencies, trust can be significant issue, as this is relatively new but rapidly growing industry, and due to inherent anonymity of transactions can be challenging when it comes to trust and verification.",
