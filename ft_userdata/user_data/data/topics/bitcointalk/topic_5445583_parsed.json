      "body": "WWE used to be my most loved sports ever since I grew up to start watching sports that involved opponents fighting each other, I loved and was so addicted to watching this game for several years until a couple of years ago, when I finally discovered that almost everything that happens in WWE is fixed/predetermined, this was when I started to hate WWE, watching the games no longer interest me anymore, and I also would never bet on such games.WWE fights to me now is like watching a movie, it is all acting, nothing is for real, and i personally would assume that those who still buy tickets to watch this fights and also bet on it, probably have not realized that WWE matches are fixed, or they know but just don't care.",

      "body": "I used to love watching WWE as it was one of my best childhood entertainment series every Sundays and Wednesdays, the performance, the stage walk in, the rants and boos, the match challenge and lots more features they show for viewers and lovers of WWE  but as time went on I discovered that all the fight I had watch right from childhood was scripted and stunts performance already scripted for the performance. I was diassapointed with the show and I felt this guys have been playing with our emotions thinking the fights were real not knowing that everything I was watching were all fake and scripted. Ever since I discovered that tricks, I lost interest in watching WWE although I watch it but not as before when I am eager to watch it then. When such discovery is made how do expect someone to bet in that course. It is just like you pouring water into a basket.",

As a gambler will you bet on such fight,when you know that the fight is fixed and the outcome of the fight is not for real,or will you go ahead to bet for fun?I think people who are betting on WWE are doing it for pure gambling.  Although matches are fixed, the result or the plot of the matches is unknown to the masses.  I think i will go ahead to beat and win since WWE is a one of the fastest-growing niches within sports betting.  Besides, betting on fixed matches does not mean that the person is addicted to gambling, it is that he may found out that it is easier to win in the game setting like WWE where results are fixed.QuoteThis may shock a large amount of you, but the majority of online betting sites and brick-and-mortar sportsbooks offer betting lines for the WWE. Yes, WWE betting sites actually exist. Now, I can hear a lot of the cynics out there gasping at the thought of betting on pro wrestling and its predetermined outcomes.However, you should know that WWE betting is one of the fastest-growing niches within the sports betting industry. Furthermore, it can provide bettors with some great opportunities to increase their bankrollWWE is even applying for the legality of betting on their high profile matches.[1][1] https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/wwe-betting-scripted-match-results.html",

There is a massive conflict of interest at the heart of this sort of gambling, because like you say - they define who wins every single match. You could argue it's like betting on a stage show which could have multiple endings, you're not betting on a random outcome or any type of player skill. It will be very misleading and could potentially be penalized in certain countries because they're taking rigging to a whole other level. If you're a true sports gambler then it would not interest you at all and you should simply warn people away from it.",

This doesn't mean that I am an addict, am doing it for fun because even though the match is fixed,nobody knows who will win. You might be lucky and bet on the chosen winner. Moreover wrestling mania is gaining more ground when it comes to sport because it is like a show and people do have fun gambling on the fights. Down here in my country, there are local wrestlers who only wrestle during festive periods and so many people will come from far and near to watch and gamble on the fight. It is one of the fun I do enjoy most times.",

You are right, that gambling for wwe betting is not a good choice because they are entertainment fights aimed at getting the attention of the audience, but I have watched PPV several times that roman always wins the fight from every belt bet, he is lucky to have become the chief because he is always helped by his friends to cheat in a fight, he will win the fight at any cost, so he is the best option to choose in the gamble.",

Those that want to watch it live are there for entertainment despite they all knew it that everything is scripted.While for those bettors, they're simply bettors and are also aware of what's with WWE which all of them are fixed and scripted.
