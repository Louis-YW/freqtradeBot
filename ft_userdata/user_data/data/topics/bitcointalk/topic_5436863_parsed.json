I would say the owners chip in first as part of initial capital just like how a regular business is operated. They can later use loser's money to pay for the winners.It would be nice if they could sign from a wallet showing their reserves but that's not enough to say they are solvent since you'll never know if they had some large debts that they need to pay also.This reminds me again of the proof of funds that some centralized exchanges tried to show after the FTX debacle.",

The problem is that some casinos don't pay the winners even if the winners provide proof that they weren't cheating. And it is casinos like this that we should avoid and not think that they will become famous one day. Indeed, there is no evidence to say that they have the money to pay the winners, but if they can really pay the winners and so far, they have not made false promises, it means that we can make the casino a place to play gambling.",

It should be a red flag if they are just using players fund just to operate because if someone makes a huge win, they'll surely scam their users since they can't be able to pay them.",

For a start, they must have a reserve, capital or otherwise so as to meet up with the running cost first which involves payment of winners, workers and every other aspect of payments involved.  I know there MUST be losses from players which will come in as profit to the casino likewise the casino too would pay winner's for their Victory so everything can go well for them. Of lately, there have been series of of complaints from gamblers and bettors with respect to account banning, suspension etc all these point out to the fact that casinos are really running short of funds which makes then to start acting this funny. With this unfolding events, I am of the opinion that casinos starts showing their backup funds before getting license to operate. The casinos also should as a matter of fact, show their monthly balance sheet for further verification which is required.",

Was I wrong about this? Come to think of this, there is no prove that they have some money to pay winners. Casino doesn’t work like that because they are gambling too with their bankroll. There’s no way to operate using users only fund because they have fixed operating expenses and also the chance that a user will win a jackpot. They just have fixed profit  coming from the house edge but it doesn’t mean they can have sure profit. Some casino becomes bankrupt by having small bankroll while they have high jackpot prize which their bankroll is not sufficient.Also players usually withdraw their funds. They can’t guarantee that they will have users fund all the time to cover some player win when the casino has a bad luck. Checking on the high roller winning history is the best proof that they have money to pay the winners because all those roller will surely make a complain here or in trial court if they are not allowing those huge withdrawals. Casino has a gambling license too which means they have money for operating the casino. We are not on the old era which casino has low bankroll and always running away when some players hit huge jackpot.",

The reputable ones the ones who already know that they are going to be people favorites usually have already a minimum of 1000-10000 Bitcoins in order to pay the whales as no one guarantees them that the house edge will start benefiting them right away,that is not the case,the house edge needs a lot of spins before starts to kick in usually in slot machines between 1-100 million spins in that specific slot.Based on this the big reputable casinos that we see today and are our favorites have started out already \"maxed\" out to handle even whales which are really big winners,all other casinos who haven't done so you will see most probably some sort of scam accusation for them when someone made a huge win.",

You have already been given some answers, I will simply add that you seem to have little knowledge of the subject. Someone who starts a casino with no bankroll of their own has an extremely high chance of going bankrupt. I don't know if you have ever seen a chart of a winning poker player, it is similar to the stock market charts, trending upwards but with ups and downs, with deep dips and some daily volatility. Casino winnings are similar but you have to have bankroll to withstand the dips and set betting limits to what you can't afford to pay if the customer wins. It is not uncommon for a casino to have sustained weeks of profits and then a whale comes along in one session and causes a big dip. If you don't have bankroll to withstand that, and more starting, you go bankrupt.",

This doesn't mean they can launch their business without any bankroll. They must have some money for paying the winners unless they want to scam the players. I do not understand at all how you can start such a business without a decent amount of money for the potential earnings of the players. If a casino can indeed have a fair mechanism for all games, which any decent casino should have, it is always possible that the influx of money lost to the players is at some point less than the money gained. Of course, in the long term, since the various commissions have yet to create such a \"safety cushion\", this problem must surely be solved.  But in the early stage of the work, the casino cannot do without a lot of money, so to speak, of course.",
