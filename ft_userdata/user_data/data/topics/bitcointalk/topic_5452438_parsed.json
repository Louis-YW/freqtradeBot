We united the best of the classic - filtering the good parts - to security, interactivity, transparency, technology, and usability. It is a cryptocurrency that also powers and acts as a settlement mechanism for various DApps that are created on the Doric blockchain.Smart contracts, in particular, facilitate the process of exchanging assets more fluidly and free of tampering for the real estate, automotive, and shipping markets, thus making the transaction process more intuitive, less complicated, and cost-effective.We are introducing Doric to this market: a proprietary blockchain-based platform with a global community format. The Doric cryptocurrency (DRC) will be used for payments on a proprietary, high-tech platform.Through this process, buyers and sellers of real estate, for example, will be able to negotiate without the usual layers of intermediaries and at the same time receive their payment anywhere in the world via their unique platform.Doric will promote valuable integration with organizations and notary offices, with the goal of having Doric's smart contract accepted as a fullylegal and official purchase and sale document. It is a blockchain network where the buying and selling processes are assisted and supported by various programs, such as our Ambassador program,in which participants will offer all legal solutions in all countries of operation. Each and every change, partnership, innovation and creation of new products on our platform will be voted by the network members, because we know that we will only create something substantial and memorable with the support and participation of our Doric network.Be an ambassador by participating in our Ambassador program, and represent Doric in your country!https://doric.network/https://doric.exchange/community@doric.network",
