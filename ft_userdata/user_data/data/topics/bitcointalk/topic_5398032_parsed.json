Okay let's say his friends make a donation via Bitcoin, do you think the fundraising can be completed in just a day? I don't think so, it's need a time and you said it's an urgent moment. Now I don't understand the part why the patient's bank account can be frozen, but the another bank account used to receive Bitcoin sources doesn't get banned. Bank is more strict about Bitcoin activities rather than normal fiat activities.",

Despite this, however, one fact is true: unlike your bank account, crypto funds cannot be frozen or seized if they are kept in a private wallet, and no one else has access to your private keys. If you hold crypto, no one, not even the police or any government agency, can freeze your assets.",

Which due to this ill health, couldnt get it fixed, unlike Bitcoin which is beyond control by a central authority",

And I wonder in what country do you live that a hospital accepts Bitcoin as payment? 2. This seems like a global problem that someone should pay at first the money for the hospital before getting treatment. 3. If this story is true, it is good enough if Bitcoin can be more global, many more people can accept this as payment. For, in my country, this story will never happen because TC is not legal as a payment method. 4. This story may be true and happen in the future due to the global progress and development of Bitcoin acceptance in each country. And yes excatlyBitcoin will really help us.",

Yes bitcoin can't be frozen on a Dapp. One thing with centralized system of financial storage is that it comes with lots of procedures and the strongly hold to it not minding if lives are at risk or endangered. Resolving to using decentralized means of transaction for bulky needs in cases of urgency is somehow the best maybe the process of frozen account and limitations of fund access will be reduced",

Considering the fact that we are rapidly moving toward becoming a cashless society based on CBDCs, unpleasant situations like this will occur more and more often. People won't be able to transfer money without a bank's permission: therefore, it is banks that will decide what you can spend \"your\" money on. In particular, you can be denied medical treatment because of your misbehavior, disobedience, misdeeds, wrongthink, or not supporting the current narrative; in short, you will be punished or even doomed to die just because banks consider some of your actions \"wrong.\" Can bitcoin \"fix\" this? If you find a \"canceled-like-you\" doctor who would accept bitcoin for their services, then you probably will get your desirable treatment, but it unlikely will be of the same quality as you would have gotten in hospitals that play by the rules imposed by banks.",

Probably his account was frozen before he went to hospital for whatever reasons.From this story, you can say \"Not your keys, not your coins\". Even if you have Bitcoin, but you buy and store it on centralized exchanges with custodial wallet, it is not actually your coin.Why?Because centralized exchanges can free your account (same as bank can do) and you might (or might) not successfully to get your account back.To be safe, you must use non custodial wallet to store your coin.",
