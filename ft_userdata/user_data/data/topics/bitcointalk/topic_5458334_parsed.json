Because if we look at the price of bitcoin late last year which was around $16k, then with the current price around $30k now rising to around 2x the price, we could say the year has been quite good because the year before the bitcoin halving is always faced with dumpsQuotebut I notice that bitcoin always breakout into a new price after interval of five years, the last massive explosion of price was between 2017-2018 and since then, bitcoin has not record major price increase.

I would say the kind of high price pump you are talking of actually happens due to halving every four years and not five years and this time it is expected to happen in 2025 since the halving is next year",

Of course, there isn't nearly enough Bitcoin history for it to count more than anecdotal evidence, but it makes sense to me that 2023 will still be in the red, but at least at some point in 2024 we'll see strong signs of recovery.2024 will be there pretty soon, so I guess we'll see. But also, I don't think it will determine Bitcoin's fate. After another bull market, we can easily see another bear market, Bitcoin losing up to 75% of its value and all that.",

I don't know what expectations you mean but if you wanted to become rich immediately because you bought BTC, i'm sure you have learned a hard lesson. The only guarantee you have when you buy BTC is that it is a censorship resistant currency and you can use it freely without anybody's permission, as for the price, it is volatile and you cannot predict or be sure that it will give you revenue when you hope for it.",

And I think you are doing the same by making false statements which I had bolded in your post above.1.Â  First one is BTC does not start its bullish trend after every five years it starts its bullish trend after every 4 years when the halving starts and I do agree sometimes a bullish run does not start even after the halving it like takes some time and fall into 5th year but this happens merely. 2. Last surge in BTC price was not in b/w 2017-2018, it was in 2021 which was the last Bull run of BTC. 3. The last one is, BTC would reach 40k to $50k top in 2024 which probability is very less because it is being predicted by analysts and institutional investors that the incoming 12 months will not give BTC that much value which means the next surge might fall into 2025's first quarter.Well, I am also not saying the same will happen as I mentioned above because it is just my speculation so please DYOR too.",

I witnessed the 2017 and 2021 ATHs and how they played out and later went into bear rally a year after ATH. I've come to conclude (as it were now) that the bullish run begins to manifest a year before Bitcoin halving and then gets to its crescendo a year after halving. We're in 2023 (pre-halving year) and Bitcoin isn't showing any sign of weakness. It goes to show how prepared investors are gearing towards getting in before the halving year itself. Of course, the expected rally that will take Bitcoin to an unprecedented height in 2025 will be without comparison. I want to believe that newbies to this industry are already preparing themselves for 2025 to enjoy the momentum by making investment a priority.",
