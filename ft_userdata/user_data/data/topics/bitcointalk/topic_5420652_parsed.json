  "content": "A quick update about FTX exchange.There is an hack going on with FTX apps right now, pls do not update.Hackers are moving out funds using eth domain names.People's fund are now showing zero.What do you think is happening? Here is my thought.This looks like an inside job, Sam might be the culprit here, trying to take what he still can and run away. I already heard he is on the run with his private jet. Centralised Finance have failed horribly, it's time to get used with DeFi, do danger ðŸš¸ still lurks in DeFi world too, always DYOR. I feel so sad for everyone that got caught in this mess, and we that never used FTX for trading shouldn't consider ourselves as smart ass, this can happen to anyone, stay strong and build, I mean it's crypto, you can still get your money back in other ways.",

I'm surprised to see he has a private jet, but in the video, when he was asked why he drives a small car, he claimed that he preferred owning a Toyota corrolla car to buying a Ferrari. On the whole, he created the video to deceive people and lured them to see him as an accountable man. Therefore, gaining trust. There is more to this Scam! It'll unravel soon.",

I already heard he is on the run with his private jet. I doubt that he will be in jail or crucify by the government. As far as I know Sam is also one of the donor on Bidens campaign fund during before time. As much as we wanted it, there could be some hindrance for it. They will definitely not touch their cow right?With ftx hacked. You could say this is a plan motive as well. We dont know what would happened. But the victims here are the users of FTX got trapped.",

You're not the fastest user who give update about FTX, this user is more faster 3 hours than your post and he's always giving update from the early news where CZ want to liquidate FTT tokens. Also this forum actually doesn't allow user who create same discussion that has been posted before, the other thread except the first one should be locked.You can bump the other thread that discuss about FTX issue, there's no problem with it rather than create a new thread.",

You can use the forum search option, or just look in the Bitcoin discussion board/Exchanges board or any other board - what do you think if everyone acted exactly the way you do? Don't get me wrong, your intention is good, but considering that we already have dozens of discussions on the same topic, this one was not necessary.",

But you just repeated what was already known while adding some unconfirmed details (for example, according to currently available information SBF is reported to be under house arrest; and not considered a fugitive). Please don't consider this comment mean-spirited; it is intended as sincere advice and as encouragement to make the most of your participation in this community.",
