If this is your account, poor bankroll management would be the main culprit because, as you are aware, gambling dice has consistently shown that the house wins in the long term.I've previously had the same experience as you, where playing dice caused me to lose my hard-earned two-week signature payment instantly. And guess what who's to blame? Of course, it's me who unknowingly bankroll management exist  But yeah! Moving on with this loss could take you days.",

It depends on luck no matter how much money you have. There are others who only have small amount of money but still able to win a huge prize or even hit the jackpot.Quote from: KennyR on July 03, 2022, 07:41:41 AMMartingale once again a failed strategy when you don't have big bag of money.Did you expect that using that strategy is a sure profit? If I have a huge amount of money, that is the strategy I will never use. It's like burying yourself into your own grave everytime you lose.",

Because as soon as you want to withdraw your relatively large winnings, the casinos start sweating and try anything, whether legal or not to stop you. Basically the most of them are crooks who cannot handle a large loss because every large enough loss can put them out of business forever.But as long as you are losing money, they are completely happy to leave your account alone. They even encourage you to put more money into your gamblings funds with cheap incentives.So basically, gambling is a fun thing to do with small amounts of money.",

We already know that Martingale doesn't work often but it was poor management (like what @Maus said) that emptied your account pretty quickly. With that kind betting style, you would probably bet higher amounts per roll if you know you had more money to splurge.",

You just had a bad run that made it to the point of continuous losses.

You should find other method, butplease avoid this one because it requires giant money sum. Also, if algorithmic find that you've playing with martingale, they will let fail every your bet.

You lost about $380 and that's not a lot of money no matter what country you're from (since the signature campaign pays you a comparable amount per month). If you had a really significant amount to play with and you lost it, it would be much worse. The martingale has never worked.",
