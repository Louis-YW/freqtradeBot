If he/she would have been doing this (very) early, may have been receiving a \"finder's fee\" or at least a \"thank you\". Now the lawsuit is pretty much normal.",

Don't they have something like balance sheet or audit section that review that account for any irregularities! I think this huge oversight shows they don't pay more attention to details and I bet the customer didn't immediately start spending the money until after waited for several weeks for the banks response and nothing happened.",

Since the money is no longer there, she (I believe it's a female) will have to sell her house or find some other way of repaying what she used. All civilized countries have laws against misusing money that doesn't belong to you. She can consider herself lucky if she avoids going to prison.",
