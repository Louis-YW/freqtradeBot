  "content": "We are building a project to help traders of all kinds to improve their work flow and efficiency. We are currently looking for a graphic designer who will turn our \"almost-design-less\" GUI we have now into a beautiful user interface.All our project communication happens on Telegram. If you are interested to offer your service, please write to this thread or write PM and I will provide you with a link to a Telegram group that we will create for you.The software we are working on is not trivial, but not enormous in terms of the number of different screens it offers. So this is a medium sized job that can take many months, but not years. The tasks include designing almost every bit of the interface including all pictures and icons and visual controls and their visual effects (such as hover state, pressed state, disabled state, etc). The goal is to create a beautiful UX friendly interface that is at the same time very compact and allows for all the interesting information to be available to the user without hassle.Â  All our payments are strictly in BTC with no-address-reuse policy (i.e. you have to provide fresh address every time you get paid). BTC amounts will be calculated on the payment date from USD price point.Every candidate is expected to perform a test design work of a small component in our software, the result of which we will only use if we hire you for the job. Based on the results of this test work we will decide whose design we like the most and who we want to work with. If you are not willing to do the unpaid test work, please do not reply.Do send relevant parts of your portfolio for our review as well as your per hour rates (in USD).",
