I saw something similar on the Solana blockchain. This is the very application of NFT, just many people overlooked such properties and spoke only about the price, because the whole NFT industry is mired in trivial speculation and manipulation.",

This is actually a fixed identification on binance for you. So yeah, it's a basic thing. But the hype it gets from the users is insane. As a holder of BAB, the users will get so many benefits. And this is actually a blessing for airdrop hunters because lots of projects are interested in giving rewards to bab holders. I think it's a good idea. Furthermore, this is how the company can encourage verified users to share and connect. Because we know about airdrop hunting cheaters and scammers now because of binance verification, it will be tough to cheat with those projects. So basically, it's really a great initiative by Binance, I personally think. Thank you. It's my opinion. Your opinion might be different.",

I just don't get the purpose of this token though if the reason is not to transact without the consent of the owner, I think can work better but if it's just a utility token for what purpose? I wonder if this token has a real value since I read some NFTs like this before but I don't know if they are able to market their technology or they just remain as an NFT itself. Maybe I spend some time reading more details about this update, I'm sure BNB knows the importance of this and it will serve its purpose eventually.",
