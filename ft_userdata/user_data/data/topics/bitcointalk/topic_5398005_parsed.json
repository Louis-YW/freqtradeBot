If one Chinese store runs out of video cards, then it is difficult to draw conclusions from this. If in the next 2 months there will be such low prices for ethereum, then miners will not buy video cards, and then mining will end.",

I don't see this happening just yet, will take few months for that to happen yet and with it eth will crash around 500 usd or below, gpus will also crash below msrp, second market will be insane, 3080 for 400 usd? very possible, seeing 4xxx series will be coming this year and 4080 will likely be around 700 usd, a 3080 for 400 will be expensive, I say 400 but a 3080 could crash below 300 usd, i know this might be insane at this moment but will be the normal in few months.",

For example, a miner from Russia said that his ASICs of 80-90 terahash will be mined at a loss, with a bitcoin price below 15,000. His electricity costs $0.045/KW and he does not pay taxes.",

If the complexity of bitcoin mining continues to grow at the same rate, then the cost of bitcoin mining will increase.

Is Solana and Cardano just like Luna or.BUSD is binance on the line, i dont trust exchanges like i used to, my last mistake was trusting mtgox and i lost millions of usd because of that, I have been waiting since 2013 to get part of my money from mtgox and to this day, nothing yet. So BUSD is binance, do you believe in binance? i dont, so reason i dont have any busd. Solana, cardano and any pos coin will have the same fate as luna, in the end any pos coin is scam itself.",
