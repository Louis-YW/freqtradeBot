You have to trust the company which launch their collectible coins but is trusting any third-party is a good idea to start with?Bitcoin with its technology, private keys, mnemonic seeds give us a perfect chance to have our own bank and we don't have to trust any third-party to secure our coins. Now, you want to take risk and bet that your trust will not be betrayed by any third-party company or any middle man.Trust no one in Bitcoin (Coldkey story).If you trust, you can end like people who trust Yogg and his works.Another important point is \"Keep your mouth shut off as much as possible\". It's to keep your secret that nobody or limited people can know that you are a bitcoin investor\".If you are always talkative and tell everyone around you that you have bitcoins and how you store your bitcoins, like I bring my coins around with my phone, tablets, usb, hardware wallet, you can be robbed on road or similar.",

When more than one person knows that you are holding Bitcoin or any other coin, it will attract the attention of thief's to attack your home. In this crypto industry, we are always advised to remain anonymous, irrespective of who you are.I have read a story either on this forum or on the internet where a crypto whale—I don't actually know the exact number he was holding—was attacked by people who discarded themselves in the form of an official, and one of his mistakes was having his entire crypto wallet and its access on his mobile device, which the criminals forced him to open, and the entire funds were stolen. I don't know the entire story, but it's a case of someone who made his holding open, which attracted the attention of many who targeted him.On the other hand, there are a lot of ways to save our private keys and phrases, even if they are written down on a piece of paper or an entire handbook. There are also possible ways of hiding them, and if it's not someone who you have told or shown that something like that is hidden in a place of such importance, no one will ever think of that.We are our top security officer for our holding, and we should always be cautious, from being private to physical protection.",

There are more than 100 cases of such robbery, harassment or by any force meant at the time. These were literally done at someone's home, at coffee shop, public places or even with gang forces. You wouldn't belive the ways people have used to rob someone for their bitcoins. 1. By drugging 2. Fake workers3. Seducing4. Gang forces5. Beating 6. Knifepoint7. Kidnapping and ransom 8. .........there are literally N-number of ways people have done these acts. The stories are terrifying. Most of them were also shot dead, hammered to death, tied and tortured. Yes, these things are happening and bitcoin can be stolen in physical ways. So be safe, do not reveal much in the public. It's better that way. If you are interested in reading more stories then you can refer to the following article which has been published on the GitHub. Physical Bitcoin AttacksWant safety?I think it's better to keep oneself from talking much about the bitcoin in the nearby vicinity and trading bitcoin too openly. It is entirely fine if you are just doing small trades and not exposing how much you have in bitcoin (for example, millions!)I think in similar way we protect the fiats, same goes for the Bitcoin as well.",

There is no such thing!After all Bitcoin or in this case the access to the coins, be it a wallet, a seed phrase, or an encrypted file is still a property that they can get to it or force you to give up, It's a thing of determination and what kind of thieves are you dealing with!Are you getting mugged in the street and the thief runs with your phone? Simple encryption would help, then you rush home and use your back-up to move the coins to a safe new address! You have 1000BTC, a gang has found that out, and they are ready to kidnap and torture you? Then, just like any other of your possessions, there is no way of keeping them safe. They will torture you till you give them the keys or they will lose patience and shoot you!Basically, it's almost the same as other valuables, it's easier to hide from a casual burglar, and you can hide the keys far easier than a 10 square feet painting or a 1 ton of sculpture but if we talk about ransom, that's it.Probably the best method is to keep your holdings secret, avoid KYC on shady websites so a database leak won't show the whole world your balance and home address, avoid talking and bragging about Bitcoin on social media, and so on, in short, use common sense!",

By the way, you can't just marry today and begin to tell your wife you have some Bitcoins, or your children when they are not really up to the age they should know some things.The truth is that no one can tell the future, but that doesn't mean that when you are very healthy, you should begin to tell your friends or relatives about all your assets or holdings. There are ways of writing a crypto will without even mentioning it to your family until the right time, say when you are 65 years old and above. You can then tell your family a few things about your holdings, and you can also keep some trace so they can easily recover your assets when you are no more.",

      "body": "Pretty common question. Robbing of bitcoins are sensationalized by the media, and well of course because it's a billion dollar industry. Most of the time, robbing only happens when you provide the perpetrator with access to your stuff. Something along the lines of private keys, seed phrases. Once the hacker/thief gets this, it's over for your coins. In the case of centralized exchanges, they are usually stored in a concentrated place, so once the hacker gets access to this, millions of bitcoins will be up for grabs to them. Just like what always happens to Binance, at least annually (lmao). So how do you protect yourself from getting hacked and getting your bitcoin stolen from you?Not your keys, not your coins: If you depend the safekeeping of your bitcoin to someone else, say a centralized exchange, be ready to say goodbye to it anytime as  hackers could steal it from you, but the most detrimental thing that could happen is a bank run, which is what happened to FTX last year.Invest in your own security: Don't cheap out on securing your crypto, especially if it's a substantial amount. Buy a cold wallet, secure it, and only transact exact amounts whenever you're purchasing something using your bitcoin",

A smart idea is to avoid flaunting your wealth and means of making money online, since this can be harmful.Thieves will go to any length to achieve their goals. I learned about a kidnapping that occurred to a close relative who was kidnapped and plundered of his wealth.  He was often bragging about his wealth online, so the kidnappers took advantage of that and took him to a hidden location where he was forced to sell his assets and transfer the money as fiat to them through another victim's bank account.

People will go to any length to secure what they value the most. If you have a significant amount of bitcoin that can entice robbers to steal from you, you must have taken the greatest security measures to keep your bitcoins safe and out of reach of anyone. Allowing your family members to know about your seed phrase is a good idea; after all, the riches belongs to all of you. And you may tell who to trust and who not to trust with your seed phrase when it comes to keeping it safe and accessible only after your death.",

I knew casascius is the oldest physical bitcoin in the market right now with loaded Bitcoin on it. I think it’s the top contender for the safest physical bitcoin due to its age but still we never know if the key copy of the owner is deleted. It requires time to guarantee the safety.So why we need to undergo with this trust issue for so long if we can be safe owning physical Bitcoin by doing a DIY.Quote from: cafter on May 02, 2023, 03:10:36 PMwhat type of safety a individual should take to protect bitcoins physically like cascusious coins.

And for more security purposes, you can hide those phrase key in a secure place where the robbers won't be able to find it..  Also, a smart move is to you create another wallet and keep that in places where the robbers won't be able to find it easily and take it. In most of the cases, they are not going to check that wallet right away. Even if they do so, for extra safety measurement, you can always keep a little amount of Bitcoin in it. This is just to make them confuse.  And yes, people can only know you own Bitcoin only if you tell them.  Or in some situations, find it by chance or by searching for it.  So yeah, never tell anyone that you own Bitcoin.",
