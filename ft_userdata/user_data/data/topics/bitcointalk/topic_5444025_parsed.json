I never used any VPN software. I played at home with my local internet service provider SIA BITE. The use of a VPN is not prohibited in METASPINS, as they suggest that players use the best VPNs to play on their platform for extra security and for gaming activities to be even more safely hidden, which led to the suspension and termination of your account is their discovery of multiple accounts that you used on their platform by you or by someone of your family through one IP address or from one computer or phone. I think there is a possibility if you contact them that they will leave you only one account and transfer your remaining deposits to it, if any, so I hope that the METASPINS officials will come to solve this dispute, clarify the matter and make a fair decision regarding your deposit and your winnings, because $9500 is a significant amount, and if they do not come here, try to contact them and send them this topic so that we can listen to the other side.",

You feel like they should detect multiple accounts at the beginning of registration. Whether I agree with you or not isn't relevant, but the fact that you say that leads me to believe that you do in fact have multiple accounts on their platform and feel that since they said nothing in the beginning, you should be paid. Basically, you have violated their ToS and you should not be paid!!! I as a casino would possibly agree to give you your deposit back(best case scenario), but I feel like abusers should be penalized for their actions also. So I would say talk to their reps and see if a  compromise can happen. Nowhere in this compromise will you get any of the winnings, so don't even try to bring that in.Casinos have some shady terms and I do not agree with all of them, but when you sign up you agree to these terms. So this is 100% on you.",

I just see you keep hammering the point that they did not ask you up on registration if you had more than 1 account. It's your word against theirs at this point. Should they have to prove you have multiple accounts? Yes, I think they should. Will they? I don't know. . You should make a complaint on askgamblers or casino guru and see if that produces any results.",

Let's hypothetically say there was an account ring and each account deposited $400 to the platform, we're talking about thousands of dollars that Metaspins has usurped. That's very convenient for the casino.",
