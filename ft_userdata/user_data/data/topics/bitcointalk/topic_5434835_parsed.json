  "content": "Bitcointalk is a bitcoin and crypto community that has been around for several years. During this time, the forum made history on many occasions, and we all had the chance to witness it.No matter how or when you get here, Bitcointalk always offers a wide range of possibilities. I am sure that some have found friends and like-minded people on these boards. People have created partnerships that are respected to this day.Bitcointalk members have used the forum to trade coins and collectibles and arranged face-to-face meetings. Some of you have attended bitcoin conferences and similar meetups with your forum buddies.That makes me wonder: how many people from Bitcointalk do you know in real life? How many do you know by name because of your forum dealings and relationships? Have you ever wished you could meet someone from the forum, but it never happened? Can you call anyone from this community a friend, and why?I know three users by real names. Unfortunately, they are inactive now and have disappeared from the forum. How about you?",

I answered 2 and now I keep remembering people's names  (I've found another two since - at least).I saw a meme a few weeks ago from Americans saying it's very hard to find a British person's name because they forget to bring it up (even in long interactions - and don't mention it when they're introduced), so maybe I'd know more.",

We all good with our privacy protected fake names.I voted over 10 and it's surprising I'm still the only one. I guess people that know people don't want to participate in the survey. I know a lot of forum members in real life so I know their real names. There are people who I met here (both local and global) and there are a lot of people I personally invited here. Also there are people who I never meet but I know their real names. Although many of these users have stopped posting, some are still here.Forum used to be so small, everyone knew each other in local board. Since there was no other platform to talk about Bitcoin, everyone who is a pioneer in the industry was here in the first place. While there were those who wanted to remain completely anonymous, the majority were eager to meet like-minded people. In the past, there wasn't big anonymity concern. There was even some debates about using our real names instead of nicknames. If you look at very old threads you can find discussions about it. Quote from: Mahirap on January 15, 2023, 11:06:16 PM Like bitcoin, bitcointalk is anonymous too.Bitcointalk is not anonymous. Bitcointalk respect your privacy. If you don't want to reveal your personal info you can stay anonymous (with exceptions*).*You may want to read privacy page: https://bitcointalk.org/privacy.php",
