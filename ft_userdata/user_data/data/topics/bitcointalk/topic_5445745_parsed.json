Nah you're wrong, there's a lot new project giving away free coins by just posting your address or done their small task. Some of them legit for distributing their coins, but coins are worthless. But to prevent from this, just avoid all shitcoins who want to distribute an airdrop.",

Arbitrum will airdrop ARB tokens to their users but the airdrop claims have not yet started, and scammers are taking advantage of this opportunity to target crypto users who will do anything in search of free money. So it can be assumed that some crypto users will connect their wallets to this website for free money and lose their money.",

Twitter has now become a club for scammers so that scammers can even buy a blue mark, so If a person does not have time to review the airdrops that he will participate in and the links that he will open, he will undoubtedly lose his funds due to the large number of fake accounts that impersonate the name and domains of official projects.",
