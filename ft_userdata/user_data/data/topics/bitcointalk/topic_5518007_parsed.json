  "content": "Hi, I've setup a multi sig wallet (2 out of 3) and everything looks fine. In my test setup I have just one Jade and 3 seeds (QR codes), I can easily swap, but lets assume I have 3 jades for now! On my desktop I have Spectre.Now I would like to verify the receiving address, but when I scan the address and verify it with one of my jades I getRegister wallet record before attempting to verify address.My understanding here is that I need to scan the multi sig config. In Spectre I can go to the wallet -> Settings -> Export -> Go to export detailsNow I see a QR code which can be animated (it contains 3 qr codes when animating). When I try to scan this I get:Unhandled QR payload.So my question is, how can I register a wallet given the above case?",
