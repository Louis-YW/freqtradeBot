Only few of them post actual fact and real review.I would advice you to stay away from it, and keep your 1BTC ( as you have claimed to have) or probably stick around the forum and ask members on other ways you could utilise your BTC for a better profit rather than really on an article and an investment site with some fake reviews underneath the page.Edit;If the domain was created on 2023-05-17, then how the heck were they able to serve this customer that gave a feedback on 2022.12.06. The site is basically built on lies.",

      "body": "Avoid such sites. Even if you have a bunch of people testifying how good and profitable the platform is, don't send your Bitcoin to anyone to stake for you. Sending your coins to a third party is one of the worst mistakes anyone can make. A high percentage is what is usually used to attract people to put in their money where their chances of losing it are very high.I have not used any form of Bitcoin staking before. This is because Bitcoin is not an altcoin that supports staking in their respective wallets. So staking Bitcoin is just like me telling you to give me your Bitcoin and let me hold it for you, and at the end of the period I will give back the Bitcoin together with a few rewards.If I should advise you based on what I know and as highly recommended by privacy protection advocate o_e_l_e_o, for security reasons and the safety of your assets, avoid getting involved with a centralized system; it doesn't just endanger your funds alone; your privacy and that of your identity are at stake. Not being truly secured is why we use a centralized system.",

They might pay for some time to build trust, however the whole operation/scheme is a ticking time bomb before the site closes and the investors are left with nothing more than their balls in their hands. As the other said, do not entrust your cryptocurrency/money with such websites/platforms. You will only find yourself regretting it later..........and if you created this thread just to get people to click and hopefully get some referrals or users, shame on you. anyone who is reading this thread should not try spencer-invest.com under any circumstance, and if you do, expect losses",

Do you ever used it? I am thinking to put 1 btc on their platform, but not before I get some advice from someone who used it already.Thank you.One thing I learned is staking is not really great when it comes to profit, most of it is just some kind of pyramid scheme since they just circulate the money on the platform and it would need a certain amount of money to enter every time to take profit on your staking. I mean it does work since they offer a great percentage in staking but it wasn't worth it in the long term you could easily be the one that is losing money in the end it is just like lending them money to continue running their business.It's always better not to put your cryptocurrency into something that you don't have control over, especially on a centralized platform, it's a big risk because they can easily freeze your account and easily you could lose all of your money. Also, it wasn't a popular website, and still don't believe or rely on other people's reviews since it can easily be manipulated.",

Maybe they will initially pay you regular interest to earn your trust. But then one day, it will disappear without a trace. There were a lot of lending platforms that collapsed last year, I hope we don't forget so quickly. For bitcoin, there is nothing better than buying and holding long in a non-custodial wallet.",

I'd definitely not put my money in this \"staking\" site of yours. Much of these is just too good to be true. High yields with no profit coming back for the company to sustain itself? It's either you're Elon Musk for being this rich, or you're just stirring up some scam by promising stuff that we most definitely know wouldn't be true.",
