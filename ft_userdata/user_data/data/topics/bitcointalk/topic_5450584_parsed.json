  "content": "I've had another enquiry from a potential domain name buyer this morning. I've decided that I am only going to accept Bitcoin in payment for domain names, and I appreciate that most potential buyers will be cautious or naive about Bitcoin. I own the domain name Bitcoin Uncovered.com, and I always intended to create an information site on the name. Unfortunately, personal circumstance have denied me the time to doi this, but I hope to rectify this later this year. In the mean time I thought that I would refer potential buyers to this forum to gain information. Rather than directing them to the home page, I wondered if it would be better to link to the discussion board, or maybe the beginner's board. I have a slight preference for the beginner's board, do you agree that this would be the best introduction?",

The B&H is less bad in that sense, I would say. I was also thinking of the technical boards, which are much more serious, but perhaps too technical for someone approaching the subject for the first time. So if I had to choose one, it would be the B&H, or perhaps better the threads explaining what bitcoin is and how to use it.",

      "body": "Since you said potential buyers of the domain name that means you are the seller, I don’t think it’s a bad idea or off topic from the forum since it involves bitcoin domain buying.But what i think is that the beginners and help board is to help out newbies and less experienced members out on issues they can handle or try to solve their problems, so it may not be the appropriate place.On the other hand since it involves buying and selling then the market place board, and it’s child boards like services is an appropriate place for this.For the purpose of the potential buyers to learn about it and get information you can direct them to the service discussion in particular.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=85.0",

      "body": "Yes, I deal in domain names, and almost exclusively .com names. The market place is really only of use for selling crypto names imho, and the current enquiry is for a vehicle related name, and nothing to do with Bitcoin or crypto. It is a personal choice  of mine to accept Bitcoin, and only Bitcoin, as a payment medium. I decided to pick up selected domain names as a means to increase my Bitcoin savings. I had another look at the B&H board, and I agree it is a bit of a mess. I don't think questions about merit should be on it for example. Maybe the best option would be to refer the buyer to the forum home page, and suggest he looks at the discussion board first. The main difficulty if he is a naive user will be to convince him that it is worth the effort to buy the Satoshi to send to me. I'll also need to see which exchanges will transfer Bitcoin directly to my address, as that would avoid him having to set up a wallet to make the transfer.",

Most web hosting providers has one-click Wordpress installs as well.",

Please if using a centralized exchange they should bear in mind of undergoing through KYC if this could be hard for them then you may ref them p2p service operate from this forum, for easier and smooth deal.",

I have a slight preference for the beginner's board, do you agree that this would be the best introduction?If I was you, I would direct them to either one of two topics. The first one for Satoshi's lesson is my more favorite than the story from Hal Finney. I believe it is nothing better than learning from lesson of Bitcoin creator and the forum founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. No matter you are a newbie or experienced bitcoiner or Bitcointalk user.Satoshi's lessonBitcoin and me (Hal Finney)",
