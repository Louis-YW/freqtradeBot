      "body": "Popular crypto gambling platforms may not be KYC-verified themselves for a few reasons. One reason could be that they want to provide a higher level of anonymity for their users. Another reason could be that the regulations around cryptocurrency gambling can vary depending on the jurisdiction, and some countries may have stricter laws that make it difficult for the platforms to obtain KYC verification.Whether or not a gambling platform would be more attractive to users if the team were 100% doxxed is a matter of perspective. Some users may prefer a platform where the team is transparent and can be held accountable for their actions, while others may prefer a platform that offers a higher level of anonymity.Ultimately, the success of a gambling platform will depend on a variety of factors, including the user experience, the available games and features, and the platform's reputation.It's important to consider the legal and regulatory aspects when it comes to a gambling platform, as it can have severe consequences if the platform is not compliant with the laws and regulations. It's also important to note that, regardless of the level of transparency, the platform should always ensure the security of the user's personal information and the platform's operations.Hope, I answered well.",

I mean the team behind the online casino why are they not KYC verified and they ask for KYC instead? It's the question you need to ask who are providing license to them. May be they are KYC verified. There is also the fact of trust too. Normally popular Casinos have already built their trust in the industry, they are paying gamblers for years so no one question the team behind them.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on January 22, 2023, 08:17:49 AMAnyway fast forward to my second question, will a gambling platform be more attractive for users if the team are 100% doxxed? It surely will be but when you are in crypto it's not always a good idea to public your identity. Crypto is not still officially legal to many country. Law will change and it will effect you. That's the risk.",

First, identity verification is usually required when indications of fraud or casino policy violations are foundAs a user, the identity of the actor behind the online casino is not too important. On the other hand, the user's identity is important enough for them (the team) to help verify violations commit by usersSo I conclude need a reason to request identity verification action or kyc. And what is the reason for the team verifying its identity to the user.",

But this violates all permissible norms, they must be open to licensing and supervision authorities if they want to act legally and in accordance with the law, so they also carry out a kind of KYC procedure, if you can call the documents for obtaining a license that way.",

It may inspire a certain degree of security (it allows you to know the track record) it is not a guarantee for players e.g. in collectibles section an user already doxxed has made a scam some days ago but it's really hard sue him on court and even if was doxxed this doesn't changed pretty anything... money are gone the same",

Every casino definitely has a plan behind it for the running of a casino and what developments will be carried out.Maybe there are some things that the team did but not published to the gamblers or casino users.It would be better and better if we believed in and obeyed the policies or regulations that have been made by the casino even though we did not know the intent and purpose of these policies, it was clear that the casino made them to guarantee the comfort and goodness of every user in it, even though it had to ask for a KYC.",

I think that all casinos that have a license when they are going to ask for a license are obliged to do KYC in curacao, but the problem with that is that it is possible that the person who does the kyc in curacao is a representative of the casino or even an unimportant person who can be used by the casino, so it's not something that 100% sure the casino owners are going through KYC when dealing with license in curacao, I could be wrong in my thinking because I don't know about all procedure to get license in curacaoQuote from: Crypt0Gore on January 22, 2023, 08:17:49 AMAnyway fast forward to my second question, will a gambling platform be more attractive for users if the team are 100% doxxed? with all certainty yes, all people feel more secure when they know the owners of the companies in which they use their services, this is something indisputable. but unfortunately this should not be expected to happen to all online casinos",

Like what others have said, teams/owners of licensed casinos are verified.When we're talking about unlicensed casinos, this could be significant to some. I just find it ironic for them to reveal their identities to the public when they do not ask KYC from customers. For new casinos, provably fair verified + RNG certificate (or test it yourself) could be enough to start building their reputation and be among the most trusted.",

If they are scared of the law/regulations it makes sense the are verified too, doxxed or something .Because casinos are typically under a business company that is mainly involved in the casino industry. You can track the details of the owner if you check the owner listed under their gambling license which is available to the public. License is what matter the most to trust the casino since license company does the KYC themselves to the casino owner when they apply for their license.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on January 22, 2023, 08:17:49 AMAnyway fast forward to my second question, will a gambling platform be more attractive for users if the team are 100% doxxed? It will be a disadvantage but it's not really necessary due to the existence of casino licenses. In fact, nothing will change if we knew the owner or not since people can't contact them directly in case a problem occurred because the support will be the one that will handle all the casino issues. Also casinos with licenses rarely turn into complete scams based on my long experienced in gambling.",

They are scared, trust me, and that's why they do KYC. Otherwise they would've just let them fuck off and not do KYC since they for sure know that their users hate KYC themselves.",

Perhaps the team behind the online casino has done KYC to the regulators by sending them the documents and has stated that they have not committed any criminal acts or anything against the law. Perhaps, that's one of the reasons why casinos ask their users to do KYC so they can report to the regulators that their users are really not doing illegal activities.But the truth is we won't know whether the team from the casino is also doing KYC or if they are behind the veil with their anonymity and not disclosing it to the public. We only play gambling like other people and can also choose to play at any casino we want because there must be casinos that allow us not to do KYC.",

KYC is for company's interest not by force to do it but if a casino company is not yet license also they don't have the right to ask for KYC from its customers or gamblers. Then coming to your question, frankly speaking, the casino platform will not be attracted to the gamblers if really 100% of doxxed is used because most players or gamblers need to be anonymity. And once a gambler sees his personal information in a public place he will be very much angry and he will inform his friends about the site and they might not like to gamble in that platform. But that is also depend on the kind of games you have in the casino if they attracted to gamblers. Attraction to  casino platform is all about the games found in the site and the behaviors of the casino management team.",

For example, you normally don't get to know who is the owner of your regular supermarket, coffee shop, bar, etc. Meanwhile, these places can KYC you if you buy a can of beer, cigarette, and stuff.Therefore I think a license is more valuable and strong compared to the team's KYC ID. It's like your favorite restaurant has all the required licenses and passed the inspections. You'll have more peace of mind eating in that restaurant compared to Señor Carlos food truck.The problem is, of course, not all license is equal.",

As a matter of fact, you have down well to this extent of making enquiries here and receiving response from high ranked members onboard this platform but that is not enough though because saying it would not be enough. Your friend i believe has a prototype of want he or she wants the casino to look like and the features too. It would be nice the team starts doing their work and making it presence known here by creating an announcement thread formally introducing the casino so that participants can do a review then you and your friend can proceed with updating or upgrading the casino to the required level it ought to be based on the review results.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on January 22, 2023, 08:17:49 AMThe question of the day is about KYC verification, why are popular crypto gambling platforms are not KYC verified themselves?

Wether the team is kyc verified or not it does not really matter though but service delivery is what matters most. If you drive satisfaction from their services without any complaint, why need  wanting to know who they are.  Do not forget that casinos do obtain license and before such would be done, the team is already known so I believe the government issuing license to the casino already know who they are so that should not be what customers should be bothered about because if anything goes wrong, they would be fished out.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on January 22, 2023, 08:17:49 AMAnyway fast forward to my second question, will a gambling platform be more attractive for users if the team are 100% doxxed? That should not be an issue though but it will also be an advantage to the casino because if they do that they may likely get more participants as people see that as a sign of transparency and accountability and another is, if any of the team member has been involved in a successful project before which is well known, that person would stand the chance of getting more participants to the casino.",
