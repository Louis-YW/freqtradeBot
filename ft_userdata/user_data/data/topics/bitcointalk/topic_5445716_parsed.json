  "content": "here a small opinion by my thinking ,it is obvious we will lose 90% of the time in gambling,so, think an influencer referred anyone, who is very new to gambling and deposited some money in greed of the welcome bonus provided by casino, then he knew, to claim this welcome bonus he need to wager the required amount to claim the bonus, while wagering he won in starting and he was feeling very happy first day of gambling, and now comes, second day he logged into the site to wager more to claim bonus and after playing some time he lost some money and he started doubling the bet amount to recover his losses, and by doubling bets many times he busted his whole account and made balance=0, and if he is smart enough(many of new are very smart they deposit second time to claim bonus and recover their losses but, not that much smart there eyes become blind by seeing quick profits and losses they do not able to revise that 90% of the time i will lose at this gambling game) and he is smart and deposited second time by deciding that, i will wager the left required amount and claim the bonus then never ever will gamble, but this time also he losed all, then he is depressed and thinking in different way (thinking that i will deposit one more time, when i first tried i doubled my account so this time i will deposit something big amount then previous amount) then this cycle repeats many times , and after all he fall into depression may sometimes many people sell their house and cars and live very bad life and their family also suffer for his/their mistake, so why many people promote gambling sites by telling the new people that, you will get bonuses (without telling them the terms and conditions) and this is very easy to make money out of gambling, some youtuber tell that, see how i make 3x 4x you can also make profits like i did, just go down their is link in description from there you can get bonuses and you also able to 2x 3x 4x your money) I am not telling every promoter do like this(some people are very good they tell their followers to not gamble ever, it is very risky for your life, just watch me gambling for entertainment purpose and if you also gamble already, then you can try this site, link in description, make an account)I am not telling the gambling website run evil business by 'not' telling terms and conditions (it's new people's mistake to not reading the T&C, he also need to think twice why would anyone will pay me my money doubling)it's their business. and, they clearly say many times that gambling is a 'branch' of entertainment named 'tree'.(means gambling comes in entertainment category)i am telling about influencers, who are very blind for their referral commission that they influence new beginner people to gamble, and make money (which is not possible many times) even after knowing that, no one is going to never ever make money in gambling.i don't know people think about this in that way or not, may i am a dumb, or not seen the world yet,And also please give an opinion about \"what type of many people are, like greedy, only thinking themselves and their family, egoistic, thinking in a bad way, just trying to keep everyone down, or people are good\" because whenever i try to help people they think in opposite way, they tell me, why would you help, without thinking about yourself, i just try to share my little knowledge,",

They'll show you big wins about jackpots, and huge payouts to their customers shall be flaunted by them, but it's your own choice, your personal decision to go and gamble with your money. If we endorse these sites, does not mean that we are personally asking you or luring you to go and gamble, it's you who see and click the ad. We get paid because we are helping them market their product (here: gambling) and please limit us till that only.If we talk about those doing this out of this forum, once again, they get paid to advertise these gambling sites in the end and have nothing to do with the sites but just to earn some money. They even add a disclaimer at the end of their content that they're not responsible for any losses that may occur due to your gambling. Gamble responsibly.",

If everyone wins through them the casino will run as lost, so to make the casino running, they have to make some games hard for the player to face difficulty so that you loss out and they will take your deposit as a profit and when more comes the management will use some pay other winners and staff, that is business strategy for you.",

People promote gambling websites for referral comissions in most cases we see on social medias. It's their marketing job to promote those links for extra income. But you are right. They shouldn't promote gambling in a deceptive or misleading way. They should explain the risks involved on this activity and guide their public on how to gamble safely, only using money they can afford to lose.Here in my country a popular youtuber, idolized by the beautiful people, the media and the government, started promoting a local gambling platform recently. On his advertisement he said that by playing at this casino it was a good method for people looking for an extra income on the end of the month. Totally misleading propaganda, luring his blind followers to a big mistake. Unfortunatelly that is how things work...",

Ain't it?    The bitter truth about gambling platforms is they are here to make money just like their customers too, so it is wrong to believe that you should be winning every time you play a game online, the business will bankrupt very soon, its why I like flexing with online casinos just to emanate some fun from the website. You can get lucky any time but be smart when gambling, use money that you can easily take your eye off, the chances of losing the money is high anyway, so always use money that won't pain you if you lose.",

      "body": "Wow, that was a lot of talking and thinking, but you misunderstood the whole point of this matter. Gambling has existed for a long time before casinos and sports betting. People used to bet on simple things and offer bigger rewards amongst themselves without involving a third party, which we now call a casino. Everyone knows that gambling involves taking risks to receive a reward but you always run the risk of losing your money or whatever you put on the table. The downside of gambling is when you become addicted and start betting and risking more than you can afford. It's meant to be a form of entertainment and spending time in a fun way ( personally i enjoy a session or two of BlackJack on online casinos after a long day at work) and once it becomes the opposite then you are doing it wrong IMO.Every casino has warning signs and rules to advise and inform you about the risks of gambling. Therefore if you decide to gamble it's entirely your responsibility. There are no new or old useres since both are aware of what they are getting into.Promoting casinos and gambling sites is just a way to make thos companies appear more legitimate and well known to attract more players. As the casino and gambling industry grows bigger every year, there is huge competition between casinos especially in recent years. Therefore, both parties benefit from promoting their services, just like we do here in Bitcointalk.",

I'm not saying this because I'm promoting a gambling site on my signature, but because gambling platforms create job opportunities and contribute to a country's tax revenue. The only exception I see is in countries that strongly oppose gambling based on religious grounds. If that isn't the case, then I don't think promoting them is wrong, especially if players already understand the risks and consequences of addiction. It all boils down to the player eventually, as it's always a matter of choice to screw up or to not fall prey to gambling addiction.",
