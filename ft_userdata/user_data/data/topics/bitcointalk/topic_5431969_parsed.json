  "content": "As a beginner participating in bounty hunting, some of this campaign's rewards included Nfts; unfortunately, selling these Nfts has proven to be a very challenging process. One may argue that the prize is pointless because you can't convert it to fiat money after three months of distribution.My inquiry! Is it feasible to add a P2P EXPRESS option on an NFTs marketplace where users can sell their NFTs after 30 to 1 hour of listing?",

If your nfts are in 'hidden' section, it won't show up here and you will have to check manually.",

      "body": "Did you mean the NFT getting sold after an hour or can it only be listed after an hour? Essentially, There is no such guarantee option an NFT will be sold within an hour if there isn't any buyer. The main point is a buyer, so, the concept of yours is improbable, it is not how an NFT works.One of a few reasons people bought an NFT besides its uniqueness is its rarity. So, if the NFT itself is merely based on a bounty reward, where it isn't required to be produced with a valuable \"cost\" behind the NFT, I doubt people will consider those kinds of NFTs.",

But just accept the fact that this is what the NFT marketplace is and as well as the bounty marketplaces.It's hard to have that reward where you can liquidate it as much as you can and as quickly as possible as you can. I get the idea on where you're coming from if the bounty is giving the reward through their NFT.",

Someone actually has to be interested in your NFT in order to buy it. If there is no one willing to buy, then you won't be able top sell them offMy advice is you should completely avoid bounties that involve NFTs, the whole thing is completely useless.",

I'm also a bounty participant, so I understand.So, regarding your question, it may be possible to add a P2P EXPRESS option in the NFT market where users can sell their NFTs after a short time.However, it's important to remember that any new feature in the marketplace requires careful consideration of its impact on user experience, security, and legal compliance.",
