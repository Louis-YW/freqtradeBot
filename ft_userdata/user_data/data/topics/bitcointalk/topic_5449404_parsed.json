On the positive side, AI can be used for trading algorithms that can help traders make more informed decisions and increase efficiency. Additionally, AI can help with fraud detection and prevention, which can increase trust in the crypto market. However, on the negative side, AI could also potentially lead to increased market manipulation and further centralization of the crypto market. It's important to monitor and regulate the use of AI in the crypto industry to ensure that it is used in an ethical and responsible manner.",

AI has truly come to stay with new ideas being implemented and released by different companies.However, I'm a bit curious on how AI would affect cryptocurrency in the nearest future.The clearest threat I can think of is AI hazardous threats to support hackers to more easily find bugs, weakness in codes of low quality projects to exploit them.We know that AI can help developers to make their coding progress more easily by finding bugs, writing a theme code from their requirements. An experienced coder can modify given code from AI to match his need.From this, in future I believe AI can contribute to destroy weak cryptocurrency projects but it is responsibility of those project coders. For us, we must know about that threat and avoid spending money in low quality projects.",

It will only be beneficial or advantage in the long run. Here are all the projects which are marked as AI & Big Data on CoinMarketCap which you might want to track and see how they are impacting or getting better with AI: https://coinmarketcap.com/view/ai-big-data/One great example from this list is Render Token. It is a Distributed GPU rendering on the blockchain which is providing GPU power and also using it for the calculations done for the creation of AI models.",

Let's all share our thoughts on this.I'm only thinking of two things which has been already being done as the first thing which is all about automating the trades and we've got bots already doing that.The next one are the projects that are related to AI, nothing that much to do with bitcoin. And if you're not getting my idea, it's about like having those bunch of meme coins being made on this craze and we shall see the next AI projects.",

Let's all share our thoughts on this.The effects will be both positive and negative, one identifiable effect AI will have on cryptocurrency is that it will increase the number of AI tokens and because AI is new it will experience and get the attention of many people interested in cryptocurrency, both the people who are old and the one's who have been attracted by the potential benefits of owning these tokens. The negative side is that many people will get scammed somehow in the process of trying to own some of these AI tokens.",

I don't know, for now the impact I have seen the AI has on our community is being used as a concept or buzzword so scammers can deceive people to throw their money at them, being through a Ponzi or just a shitcoin ICO.  So in my opinion, so far, the impact has been negative, considering the millions of dollars in personal damages that have been and will be done and nothing the victims will be able to do avoid it. If someone wants to invest in AI, go buy stocks of technological companies working on it, why trust the your money to anonymous shitcoiners on the internet who claim to be the makers of the next industrial revolution.  For God's sake.",

Let's all share our thoughts on this.if we look at the forum here, lots of contradictions and negative debates about AI. I see several members used that technology for burst posts and cheating. So in this case, I can argue that AI is a bit negative for cryptocurrency. AI also can create programs and code that can duplicate code to make similar existing cryptocurrencies, so that might be made confusing if really the same and used the same blockchain.",

Good ones is that if you use AI properly then you can build something that would be unheard of anywhere else, and put AI into crypto and when you combine those two things together you can make something that is insanely highly ranked, like at least top 10, maybe even go as high as top 5 if you do a very well rounded one.This will be hard and it will take some time and require some world class developers to build so I do not expect it anytime soon, but when we are talking about this much money in the end, I am sure they will do it eventually. Bad one is that many projects will just put \"gpt\" at the end and act like they are AI when they are not just to steal your money.",

Most of them will be useless because most of people who order AI to write code and create cryptocurrency projects for them, will be likely incapable of making high quality projects with ideas to solve real problems in society. No good use cases, those projects will be useless too.In contrast it can help developers to reduce their time for unimportant tasks and they can focus more on more important tasks. It will  help them to increase their productivity in coding. I believe it is super helpful for developers.",

So we really don't know how far it will go. The industry leaders like Elon Musk, Geoffrey Hinton even Openai CEO Sam Altman has warned us already about it's risks. It has a power beyond our imagination. So it is too early to say if cryptos will be at risk because of AI or not. But it could be. Keep your eyes open and start using AI tools to stay ahead of your competition. It will help you to understand the trend of the market. The answer to your question is still not known.",
