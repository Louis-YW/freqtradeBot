  "content": "I am asking this question because a former CFTC Chair knows how government like to regulate everything pertaining to fiat.Quote from: https://twitter.com/giancarloMKTS/status/1630647464645500932?t=jlMa_vutJ9qbNm0P94EdHA&s=19My report today w/@AEIâ€™s @JimHarper: #CBDC & #stablecoins must preserve privacy & security, economic liberty, free speech & personal autonomy.It is clear and understand that CBDCs are fiat, but the fiat that is using blockchain technology digitally, which might be better than the traditional digital means of making fiat transactions.With CBDCs, we know that we are still using fiat. CBDCs might be secure, but we know that CBDCs have no privacy it can render people, it is just like the old fiat, which means government is in control.With CBDCs, you are not even your own bank, it is still about government control. I am wondering what this man is trying to achieve by saying things he knows it is not possible.",

Now the CBDC is clearly controlled by the government.Besides that, no matter what Giancarlo says, we don't know what he wants to convey.He may be defending the CBDC or he may have been paid because he has that influence. But I'm not sure, I'm just thinking.",

      "body": "It's quite surprising when someone says the function of the CBDC is to maintain privacy. It sounds contradictory, even though it uses CBDC Blockchain technology it is still not crypto or Bitcoin whose function is to maintain privacy & security. Here the government continues to try to convince people who are blind, well blind because they don't know that the way CBDC works is still the same as fiat money in general. Perhaps the difference is that it is digital based so it can easily be labeled as decentralized. In fact, the government cannot hide the truth just to convince people's assets to be transferred to the CBDC.",
