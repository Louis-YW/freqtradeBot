Coinpayments is a big brand and it is great and safe to partner with them for payments. Their security is good but service fee for Coinpayments is not cheap but generally, it is a good choice from that local store.They prioritized security and safety for their business and their customers and it will help to build up their store brand better. A longer they accept Bitcoin payment, a more customers who have bitcoin will use it at the store. With convenience of Bitcoin transactions, they potentially will have some new customers with Coinpayments and Bitcoin.",

This new development in your city demonstrates the value of knowledge and awareness in society. In addition to accepting bitcoin, the store is raising bitcoin awareness among other customers that come to purchase with them. Customers will be curious to learn about the bitcoin payment method; by describing it to them, you've increased their awareness and they may choose to utilise that way for payment in the future.

If they want to spend some of their coins, they may visit this store to exchange it for some goods they may need. Is there any discount on payment using BTC?Some stores will not feel compelled to offer discounts, especially if they are located in an area where bitcoin usage is high. Giving them a discount may cause them to lose more money than they gain. Because of the discount, more customers will prefer to use bitcoin as payment where adoption is high. Although, it can still work in this location, but it shouldn't last long enough in that manner in order to keep the business running. Everything is dependent on advertising and marketing methods.",

The main reason for the invention of Bitcoin is for it to be used as a currency for the payment of goods and services and I am glad this business is accomplishing it. Having alternative means of payment can attract more clients, especially from the Bitcoin community to the business. But the owner of the business should consider payment directly to a decentralized wallet instead of using centralized exchanges.",

Clothing stores or other stores where bank cards are required for payment, this store in your city offers BTC payment facilities. The shop items are also very interesting to look at, the owner of this shop has created a great store with the attractive items along with the benefits of the bitcoin payment system. It would be really nice to buy certain products from that store in your city and transact through bitcoins. Hope you buy some products from that store in your city and pay for your products through BTC.",

Take note that so many businesses that accept payment in BTC would rather use a payment processor than a self custody wallet because they want to convert it immediately to fiat, because they don't have any intention of holding their payments in BTC, especially because of volatility, another reason is that most businesses immediately put back the money they make into the business by buying more goods with it, if they hold their payments in BTC, and the price drops, they may not be able to sell it when they want to and it will affect their business.I don't think the wallet a merchant uses is important, they only want to give people the opportunity to make their payment in BTC, which helps with adoption, while they can decide to either hold the BTC or use a payment processor to convert it immediately to fiat.",

I'm asking as the fee sometimes will be a little high compared to what the person is buying. Which could make it a little expensive for the buyer.Quote from: Z-tight on August 07, 2023, 11:08:40 AMIs there any discount on payment using BTC? I ask because some businesses usually add a discount on payment in BTC for a certain period of time after adopting the payment method, this is to encourage people to make payments in BTC. I guess this discount will definitely be given, but it will be limited, as both parties are going to be charged for the transaction, so maybe the shop can have a discount for anyone who will purchase up to a certain amount and at the same time is also willing to pay with Bitcoin, then the shop can give out a discount maybe up to 5%, which will also be another way of telling people to buy more, pay with Bitcoin, and get yourself some discounts. I see this kind of adoption as something that will help both sides.",

It would be no wonder to see the Bitcoin Accepted logo Or sticker getting pasted almost every other shop out there in let us say within a decade or something.

Definitely a good thing to see despite of the issues present in this industry. Glad to know that there are still businesses who are considering the adoption of this technology regarding mode of payment. But to those who are still not into consideration, it is just fine. Not all people could take the risk of doing so 'coz they believe that the risk would also doubled afterwards. We saw nany stories having the same content but unfortunately not all businesses can manage to do that. Many have shown the same category but eventually ended up with a huge loss. The market price is volatile it imposes additional risk which pushes small businesses to cut their losses and to just continue witj the normal set up",

So I think those who are involved with Bitcoin have different interests because they have their own forums or other communities that can help them in terms of knowledge.And yes, if shops or merchants can accept Bitcoin as payment, it will be a question of buyers about Bitcoin. And the seller must be able to explain it as well as possible so that those who don't know Bitcoin know it, especially the functions and benefits of Bitcoin and who knows might be interested.",

Interestingly, not a single transaction has taken place on that wallet till the time I made this post. Then I can conclude that, shop customers are still very likely not getting the proper interest to use bitcoins as a means of payment, or maybe they are not aware and not well educated that bitcoins are a means of payment.
