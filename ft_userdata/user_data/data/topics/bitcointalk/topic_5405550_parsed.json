  "content": "Introduction To VKAXVkax is an experimental project which is born out of the need to create easy mining algorithm that are user friendly and devoid of asic mining. It uses its own algorithm called ‘Mike’ a variant of ghostrider algorithm. Its a digital experimental currency that enables instant, private payments to anyone at any time of the day with no limitations. Vkax uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Vkax Core is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency. Vkax is a complete fork of Dash coin which uses Masternodes and other technology to secure its blockchainThis project is created to bridge the gap that other crypto have closed. It is born out of the need to create easy mining algorithm that are user friendly and devoid of asic mining. It uses its own algorithm called ‘Mike’ a variant of ghostrider algorithm. Its a digital experimental currency that uses fast, private and secure payments to anyone at any time of the day with no limitations. Vkax uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority like dash etc: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Vkax Core is the best in crypto transactions and it is an open open source software. Vkax is a complete fork of Dash coin which uses Masternodes and other technology to secure its blockchain.Mining Vkax uses the mike’s algorithm which is a variant of the ghostrider algorithm and uses a smooth difficulty processRewardMining of vkax gives out the sum of 10,000 VKAX out of which 2,500 goes to Masternode owners. This 10,000 VKAX would stay until height 1950005 and within that period subsidy at every block height 210240 would take place. After height 1950005 reward would fall back to 500 VKAX and so on.Links:Explorer: https://explorer.vkax.xyz/Site: https://www.vkax.xyz/Wallets: https://github.com/vkaxproject/vkax/releases/tag/v0.17.0.3Discord: https://discord.gg/4gtHMX893n",
