      "body": "Yes, bitcoin faucets are indeed a dying business for several reasons. Firstly, many of these faucets lack a long-term business plan, making it difficult for them to sustain their operations. Additionally, a significant problem is their inability to adapt improvements. What we really need are Lightning Network faucets that provide a more efficient and scalable solution. These faucets should offer engaging games reminiscent of the fun experiences from the early days, while also helping newcomers to enter the bitcoin ecosystem and understand its revolutionary potential. Unfortunately, most existing faucets are nothing more than simple clickbaits destined to disappear within a month or two.",

      "body": "Faucets are dying indeed, and it's happening for few years already. Best indicator of it is activity on this board. Basically, it's dead. There just few posts in whole month,while in prime time first page of board were getting filled every day.In prime time of faucets when there was microwallets like Faucetbox or Faucethub it was possible to earn something significant, now getting few Satoshi requires much more effort and people aren't bothered to do it. For owners faucets never was very profitable business, well maybe only when Adsense was still allowed. But now I imagine that monetizing faucets is even more difficult, especially with low traffic. Faucet era ended few years ago and I doubt that it will ever come back.Quote from: IIrik11 on May 16, 2023, 08:46:40 AMearlier, they would pay peanuts.now they don't even do that..Now they only pay shells of peanuts .",

I gave away about 20 bitcoin to total strangers on my many websites over the years. I even had a part in the creation of faucethub because the owner read an ebook I wrote about how to run your own faucet website, he then went on to create faucethub.  I never \"made it rich\" but I had a blast being part of history.",

A dying business? After more than a decade since the first Bitcoin faucet that's giving 5 Bitcoin per person started by Gavin Andersen, faucet is a dying business, with so many annoying ads and pop-ups that could get your computer infected, and the time frame to reach the payout it loses its appeal to the community. When I started out I was very active on faucets and with over 50 faucets I joined I only cash out on 5 faucets, I cannot keep up recruiting for my referral based which is very necessary if you want to cash out fast.But still glad that I became part of it because I have a story to tell about faucets.",

The only working faucet is freebitco.in, not because it's profitable for them, but because they decided to do a kind of charity to the vast userbase they have gathered along more than a decade running. Giving some satoshis hourly doesn't hurt the sustainability of the platform, anyway, which makes its profit from gambling activity.Faucets aren't viable anymore if we consider they have to earn money from ads and distribute it back to users. And it has been like this since the day Google banned its ads from faucets. Actually, Google killed the faucet industry and consequently the side income of many crypto enthusiasts, especially newbies and young people who were exploring this new universe.",

      "body": "Some great feedback on faucets here already!As someone else has mentioned, faucets have always been looked at by people as a \"Get Rich Quick Scheme\" rather then a business. Faucets can become much more with the right amount of time and effort put into them. But as we have all seen that never happens as they all disappear once the creator realizes that the earning potential is not there. To build a faucet right you need to plan your goals and strive for success and not money. Yes the crypto industry can be rewarding but just like any business you cant go into it with only dollar signs otherwise you will leave with nothing.We have recently acquired an established earning platform and have redesigned it from the ground up, we want to see the faucet industry succeed again while giving new and old crypto enthusiasts a place to start earning again. (Not here to advertise so post can be found by search on here)We have been studying the faucet industry hard; found the only way to make a sustainable faucet is to build a good community of users and have a backing for funding such as mining funds.Another problem with the faucet industry was all of the ready made scripts that made it so easy for someone to acquire a cheap domain and some free hosting and draw you in to scam you. Popup ads and pages filled with useless ads is all it became. Which is what essentially crashed and ruined the industry.While I will mention that there are still many good paying and worth while faucets available but they are hard to find.",

Some hourly, while some are in five or more minutes. If one spent time doing it, one will earn, equitable  amount of crypto at the end of the day. But, these days, one can hardly find any faucet that can give out something reasonable, and one will discover that a lot of time and energy are wasted for something very little at the end of it all.",

At least, if faucets were clean to claim, like in the old days, I think we could still consider them an alternative, especially for newbies, because they could profit by claiming in quantity, instead of relying on the quality of the faucets. But it's just insanity to spend 2-3 minutes in a website to earn 20 satoshis per claim on the best of scenarios...About Google's decision, well it's up to them as a private company to decide to which kind of website they want to relate their ads, but fraud and poor traffic quality remains even without faucets. At least through faucets they were helping the miserables of the world to start their crypto journeys from zero.",

There are apps on playstore where you can play arcade games for few units of satoshis rewards. But as you said, rewards are too little that they just doesn't worth the time you spend on such games.Once upon a time, an interesting and addictive browser game called Farm-Satoshi where we could build our own farm, buy animals, feed them and sell their productions for satoshis, which could be reinvested in the farm, or withdrawn to our personal BTC wallet. I don't remember if there were investment options back then inside the game, but it really didn't look like the intention of the developers were to scam the public. It looked more like a genuine idea, which inevitably failed due to not becoming sustainable anymore.  It would be amazing if such websites still existed until nowadays, even if it was to earn a little income, I think in this case it would worth, because we wouldn't playing the game solely for the money.",

All kind of ads become very aggressive - pop-ups, shortlinks, porn, we also forgot another thing - miner script in background which triggered antivirus. Shortly, claiming become too much time consuming and reward was simply not worth efforts. I remember golden times of faucets when I opened random faucet rotator and everything was as simple as captcha → reward → next. In short time it was possible to claim from so many faucets.Another aspect which was important probably is rising value of Bitcoin. It made faucet rewards to something like 2-5 Satoshi. It's same value as 50 Satoshi few years back, but with such low rewards you had to make crazy number of claims to reach payment treshold. Not many had motivation and time for it.And if I would place of Google, I also wouldn't allow to use Adsense on faucets.",
