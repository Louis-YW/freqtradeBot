For AMD always Teamredminer, by far the best miner for this cards. Nvidia i would go with rigel miner.The rest of your question: don´t be lazy, the internet is full with options.",

Wow... great. I give you merit on your answer. thank you.",

The dagger-hashimoto / (ethash/etcash) algorithm is now filled with asics and video cards are useless there. Old equipment does not always work stably. If my friend asked me what to mine with such a GPU, I would advise you to sell it and buy cryptocurrencies.",

I've got there three msi gaming 1080ti have bad impression on this model/maker overall from polaris msi gaming (these were cool, but consistently slow on memory overclock, and would not allow much undervolt too)these particular cards all performed 3-5% weaker than the refs.--mt option seem to be not working so I'm using the pill for mem timings for now, maybe will run as admin later on and see how it does.",

Claymore's Dual miner2. T-Rex miner - For Ethereum and raven coin3. Phoenix miner - This is for Ethereum mining and it supports  NVIDIA GPUs, including the GTX 10804. EWBF miner - This is for the ZEC and bitcoin gold mining",

I am surprised that cards like the Radeon VII are still mining profitably after all these years and in the current environment, but if you’re willing to search around you can still find some old profitable gear.",

I have video cards that have paid for themselves many times over, but they are still turned off. 1 video card gives a profit of 6-10 dollars per month, and it’s more profitable for me to buy cryptocurrency today if mining is for accumulating shitcoins.I'd love to buy new video cards, but I don't know how to pay for them. In mining, they will pay off more than 3-5 years.",

I think you mine very few coins with a hashrate of 47MH.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5455835.msg62379358#msg62379358And with the growth of the DAG file, the hashrate will decrease or you will have to add a power limit for this video card, but most likely you will get tired of such mining earlier. New ASICs for Ethereum Classic will be released soon.",
