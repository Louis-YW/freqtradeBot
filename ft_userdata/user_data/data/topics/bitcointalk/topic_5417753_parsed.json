  "content": "Welcome to a new Beginning in products and services enabled by the internet!When the first Decentralized Exchange, i.e. Uniswap began, Hayden dezired to test the capability of a network that implemented the third missing feature of bitcoin: Quote from: Vitalik Buterin on January 23, 2014, 11:33:17 AM a sufficiently powerful Turing-complete scripting language.With the launch of Uniswap, he had successfully permissionlessed (not a real word, but you get my point) crypto trading. It ushered a new era in crypto with many other use cases such as permissionless and decentralized derivatives trading, permissionless and decentralized IPOs, liquid staked tokens, etc. While this is good in general, but inclusion of everyone adds some friction due to differnet UX and the requirement of knowing security best practices. Turbine Swap aims to solve this by massively improving the UX to make it feel similar to centralized exchanges without compromising the core principles of decentralization. This is just the tip of the iceberg. We are trying to tap the untapped potential of the third missing feature and in doing so, might create some more. Take insurance for instance. There can be an autonomous oracle (essentially an IoT device or a swarm of those) tied to a blockchain that records activity and on a certain trigger, like a damage to your car, investigates and automatically rejects or approves a claim. The IoT device can claim reward from the Insurance entity for their service. As processing becomes better and optimized small task become cheap to execute, these autonomous IoT devices will vastly improve the quality of our life. We ask for the community to join us as volunteers, developers, investors and evangelists seeking to enable a fundamentally different paradigm for the products and services enabled by the Internet.Our $TURBINE sale is available at https://turbineswap.com/pre-sale/ ; you can also visit the homepage for more info: https://www.turbineswap.com/Socials and other linksWelcome to the Turbine Swap Protocol.Turbine Swap: https://www.turbineswap.com/The Swap: https://turbineswap.com/alpha/ETC Swap: https://etc.turbineswap.com/Whitepaper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NJV-lDA25mSInyxvc_uCr3ucl4DNsnqI/viewTwitter: https://twitter.com/TurbineSwapTelegram: https://t.me/TurbineSwap",
