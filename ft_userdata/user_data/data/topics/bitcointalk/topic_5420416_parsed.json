You have negative trust on your account which drastically devaluates it (nobody wants to own a red-trusted account).A p2E project listing on kucoin, the token owned by NFT. Â It currently does not have a price. I know you can use it in game. The game will be out next month. So for now I don't know its value.Please review those negative reviews.
