  "content": "I think bounties are the biggest problem the forum faces and we are not doing enough about it. Look at this topic by thebeardedbaby: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5440036.0It shows 1 member that has over 5000 posts in the bounty board and they have not contributed outside of that. That is 1 example but I bet there are 1000s of members abusing the forum because they are not just abusing the bounties they are abusing the forums. They are signing up here with the sole goal of earning but they do not do it honestly in that topic the member was found to have been abusing the bounties with multiple alt accounts and I bet the 1000s of other members who are doing the same are abusing it with multiple accounts. The forum activity is much lower then it appears because we have members like this with who knows how many alt accounts abusing bounties probably with auto posting scripts. I propose we put restriction on the bounty board and only allow discussion of the bounty and no proof of authentication posts. If we do this the spam disappears over night.  At the moment we are allowing proof of authentication posts which offer no value to the forum and is legal spam. It goes against every other rule that the forum has. We want quality discussion and we try to do that with every other rule but the bounty board is given a special privilege and we allow very low quality members get away with it. Can we please stop this?",

We are enabling these projects to gain popularity from the lowest quality of posting that is legal and benefit from that while the forum gets nothing.

Besides that PoA is the way of bounty manager to counter those user that cheating using someone else work since there work involves other service like social media. I think it’s really useless to apply it on Bitcointalk service thread since the user post itself is enough to authenticate their work compared to bounties which involves other account outside forum",

Introduction of merit system stopped those spammers from ever reaching higher ranks and I think that theymos is satisfied with that.Quote from: theymos on June 25, 2018, 03:16:59 AMThe things on the forum which encourage spam are allowed mainly because it's part of the forum's mission to be as free as possible. Eg. banning bounties would undoubtedly reduce spam, but that'd be destroying an entire economy/population/culture which has been able to develop due to the forum's freedom. I am willing to take this sort of action, but only as an absolute last resort. It's always preferable to handle these problems by reshaping the environment to make them non-problems, rather than removing some freedom.Quote from: Macadonian on February 19, 2023, 12:58:46 PMI think bounties are the biggest problem the forum faces and we are not doing enough about it.If that's the biggest problem that means bitcointalk doesn't have serious problems at all.",

If not, there is no need to point at it. If you find particular posts as spam posts, you can use report option. If you want to suggest that forum should let go away the bounties part, I do not agree with that also. Bounties are kind of attraction for many users. If they are earning from it while following the forum rules, there is nothing wrong it. It is good for the forum also as the forum gets more exposure this way.",

I say this for the reason that signature campaigns have exposure on the entire forum, while bounty campaigns are mostly limited to one board.Personally, bounty campaigns are more problematic because they enable various scam projects to get a lot of visibility for a very small price, and they often don't pay anything under the pretext that the results didn't satisfy them. Therefore, I would first of all protect beginners who are exposed to what in some cases can be called digital exploitation in such a way that I would prohibit Newbie and Jr.Member ranks from participating in such campaigns at all.In general, I agree that the administration should not encroach on the freedoms that have existed on this forum since its inception, but it should still adjust them a little.",

Can we please stop this? You are only partly right and I don't think that your request has many chances to be successful.Let me tell you my logic for this:* Signature campaigns (1) are beneficial to the forum because they keep many quality posters remain interested in staying and posting here.* The signature campaigns also have posts that can be seen 0-value: the posts of people signing up for the campaigns, the post from the campaign managers informing who got accepted or about the payments being made.* Altcoin signature campaigns are often part of larger bounties (2) so they're .. let's say okay-ish.* Then there are the bounties completely off this forum, with only their \"ledger\" being kept on-forum. These are indeed a stretch from the rest, since they're not useful like their siblings (1 and 2), but, on the other hand they're pretty similar to (2). And I think that this is what may be one of the reasons for keeping them.Another logic may be that they're after all still crypto related services, and crypto services are okay to be discussed and handled here.I hope it makes sense.",

Somehow I don't think it's spam, but I tend to think that they are breaking the bounty rules if you say the right thing [exact same message on 100 different bounty]. I hope you know what the next steps are if you find out someone did something like that, and one thing is to tell the bounty manager and let them know about your finding. Some of them may be alt, but find complete and accurate evidence before you accuse them. If you think it's spam, then try reporting it to the moderators and see how they react to your report.",
