Can you add popular casinos on the list you have on your site so that gamblers can easily identify with your perspective. You can check many threads here so you can add some of the casinos here on your site.If they weren't popular how come they survived over 20 years in this business.

Also, I may add some casinos that are better known here.What that happen is that some crypto casinos that are new like to bring a campaign on this forum, some also just have official threads on this forum. From there, they gain people's trust on this forum and some members start to use the gambling site and the gambling site grow. There are some gamblings sites like that with promotion and better services for months, a year, 2 years and more on this forum. Some gambling sites are on this forum for even over 5 or more.So if people on this forum do not see such gambling site (gambling site that have official threads on this forum) with better promotions, offers and good services for customers satisfaction, they would find your work no totally accurate. It will be good if you add the reputable casinos that have official threads on this forum too. But, there is one you should not add which is 1xbit. If you check their campaign and official thread, you will know what I am talking about. 1xbit is not a trustworthy casino and members on this forum give the gambling site a red tags and also give red tags to anyone that participates in the campaign. Others like https://livecasino.io, Rollbit, Stake, Sportsbet, Cloudbet are all trustworthy.",

You would be surprised how many \"popular casinos\" use that tactic to stuff their pocket. And, the same casinos eventually, start to screw their players by taking their money and if they win, not paying.",

The point is you would like to introduce your website on the forum and the list included on your website are not well-known gambling casinos. Also, there's a high possibility that these gambling platforms listed paid you to be included on your website and be advertised.Even on your reviews on these website, you weren't able to put five stars on any of it and there's a casino listed on your site that has less than 4 stars. Spammed the forum, more like advertise thru signature campaign on a respectable forum where most bitcoin and crypto users visits.",
