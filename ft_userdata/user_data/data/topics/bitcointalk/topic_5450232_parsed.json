Some users have been found promoting scam sites and casinos even if they‚Äôve been advised not to just because of few bucks they earn from there. This will only lead to your account been negatively tagged. A negatively tagged account cannot be trusted in the forum and could easily do anything to their own self-interest to make extra bucks for themselves without minding the aftermath of it.",

But if your concern for the signature campaign then it has a different set of rules constructed by campaign manager. It‚Äôs important to read each rules carefully because different manager has their own personal preferences when it comes to standards.Overall, You just need to read the general forum rules to be properly guided. Signature space is more open and has less restrictions for offenses that can result for your account to ban. One thing you should just lookout is promoting scam project because your reputation might be tainted by doing so.",

If that be the case, every manager has different rules that aids and ease their work. However, there are some obvious general rules that is adopted by every campaigns and that is about cheating.

But let me add that to be able to get a good campaign, you should not have a negative or neutral tag. The selection process is very competitive so having any issues with your account will reduce your chances of being selected. Quality posting is another requirement. Every campaign wants to hire the best posters in the forum so your post must be of a good standard to attract campaign managers. Campaign mangers also have the right to remove you even without notification or clarification from the campaign if they feel that your post standard is low or you violate the rule.",

Besides being a good quality poster, you should also gradually learn from some of the knowledge available in the sub-forum.2. For users in the ranking position: Newbie to Full Member, you can go to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=238.0 to join the Altcoin paid signature campaign. For users in the Sr. Member - Legendary position, you can go to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0 to join the Bitcoin paid signature campaign.3. Make sure you only follow campaigns that you can comply with all the rules, so that payments can run smoothly. 4. Check the reputation of the Bounty manager who handles the campaign first, make sure that they have never experienced any problems as evidenced by the level on their profile.5. Never post something that is off-topic, so that your post will not be deleted by the moderator, causing your post count to not match your expectations.6. It's unwise to force yourself to post about something you don't fully comprehend. Doing so will only degrade the quality of your post and render it trash.",
