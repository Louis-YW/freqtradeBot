      "body": "Your friend is not the first to do that, and he will definitely not be the last to also do that. I have seen a lot of cases where people make plans and budgets for money that they have not even seen or that have not gotten to their hands. What gives them that mind is what I can't truly tell because even if I win a game today in any casino, if the money is not yet in my wallet or bank account where I have full control over it, I don't make plans for it because we have seen so many cases of even winning bets that still turn out to be void at the end or the casino refuses to pay off. If your friend was so much in need of that money and had much preparation for it, why wait for the game to play till the very end, where the last game in the slip has to be cut? Most casinos always give one a chance to cash out their game if the next match has not started, or even if it has started and it has a higher chance of winning, they still give you a reasonable amount available for cash out. He should have gone for it and saved himself this stress that he went through. What led him to that was overconfidence, which he should learn how to reduce in order to survive in this gambling world.",

He should have known better not to build so much confidence in an unsettled bets even if the whole games have won and he have just few minutes before the end of the last game,  this is very important because in some cases most of those that bet in such manners always face a lot of depressed situation due to not meeting up to the expectations on a game,  as of the limit to which some one can take be seriously to the point of building emotion around it is when the gambler is smart enough to have used the cash out features to take profits when he thinks he already have enough balance n the cash out since some of the games already won. This feature of cashing out balance is the reason why I choose Stake over other casinos since its cashout features have helped me to take profits in bets a lot of times.",

Gambling will never guarantee us to keep on winning. And believing that gambling can be a reliable source of income is a very dangerous thing. Instead, gamble to make yourself relax and entertained, and not in a way that it will pressure you especially if what you are getting in the end is a series of losses that put your life’s savings in danger.",

Play gamble and remove your mind from the money that will be gained till it is achieved. Dont make yourself that already anticipating or making out that conclusive approach until the match is over. I could really be able to tell about the feeling about winning a particular parlay on which your last match is really that giving off that kind of thrill and excitement at the same time specially if its a close match on which you cant really be able to determine on whose gonna win. You cant really be making yourself that able to avoid on not to chuckle with every score that would be made in both teams. If you are anticipating for a sure win but ending up on a loss then it would really be greatly affecting your mental state but of course not all would really be that too sensitive when it comes to gambling results or outcomes. There are really just those moments on which you cant really be able to avoid not to think off specially if the said profit is really that high then it would really be a normal reaction but just been said that dont celebrate it yet until its over because as long that timer doesnt comes to zero then it isnt over and there's always those things that could happen which might be resulting into a loss.This is why as a gambler or a bettor then you should really that make yourself getting prepared on whatever circumstances or things that might happen along the way. Gambling does really have that luck factor on which it could be turning upside down on which you do see a one side kind of game but ended up differently.",

Play gamble and remove your mind from the money that will be gained till it is achieved. In my early days in gambling, I use to have this kind of feeling, where after placing my bet, my mind will always be on the game, I will be refreshing my bet app and keeping in touch with the game so to see if there are losses, that stuff use to destroy my mental health, because I will be so focused on it. But with time, I started growing stronger, hence I will place a bet and look at it when the entire game is over, even after my loss, It won't get to me too much, because it's a normal thing now.Gambling should be for the matured minds, you don't need to put all your hope a game you played, knowing fully well that it can go sideways, that's dangerous for your mental health. Using $1 to win $2500,  that's a huge🤗 expectation, have you also wondered what might be going through the betting company's mind if you had won that money too, going by that mindset, the betting company should be seriously going through depression.",

I talk alot about gambling issuesPeople have different status in life, different ways on how we earn, and what we can do to survive. Most people depend on hard work and other normal activity to earn for the living. But some do actually depend on gambling on how they survive. They more of hoping to have the luck or to instantly have a better life through gambling. So, if they happen to lose, people do suffer their mental health as they can't take losing more money. But what is surprising is, this kind of people still hoping to win in gambling.This kind of scenario is not common and mostly happen to the people that hardly find ways to make a living. Due to the difficulty they face on their daily life, the only thing they can hope is to end their current status and have a better life.",

      "body": "This example or question is for sport gamblers. The other kind of gamblers like slot players have no reason to wait for the wins. It plays out immediately and everyone would know their fate. Hoping or planning on some specific amount of money always ruins the day for the person, when the money bounce back as a result of one wrong move or prediction. Talk to him about minimizing how he thinks on his about to win gambling money. Stressing our mental health, with whatever reason, especially a constant thought on the losses is detrimental to the brain.  Disappointments creates a bad memory on the brain. And can endure for a long time. The more the player worries on his money the expressions he makes won't look genuine.  The anger can motivate the player to pursue his losses and end up failing to win again. I'll keep wondering why the game cuts by a single game. Imagine the fantasies on his head, during the successful winning of the other teams he chose. On the other flip, what is to come by losing it with just a single game, can be emotionally annoying and stressful. Thereby affecting the mentality of the gambler. Lecture him, OP, about how lucky he is, that soon he'll win big. Don't blame him or discuss about his mistakes. In such situation, the player, should be attended to with kind words. Discouraging words are not encouraged. Executing such a behavior after losing a game doesn't show the spirit of gambling in Op's friend. Also, greed causes the defaulting of a gambling technique. Placing 1$ to win 2k dollars. He assumed the ownership of the wins, not remembering how much he staked on the match. Explain to him how frugal a gambler he is towards staking money. Whenever we notice an unbearable or unfamiliar behaviors from a close friend. So, that he won't take a bad decision, which can hurt more their emotions.",

When a bet like this is placed, you shouldn’t even have hope that you are going to win because the early matches played  were won, which does not mean you will be luck to win the remaining matches. Just zero your mind that you are going to win till all the matches are being played and you see that all your predictions are correct. When gambling with that little amount and expecting to win a very big amount of money, the person should know that their chances of winning the bet are very low, so you shouldn’t even have high hope to win the bet.",

I have never experienced anything like that, usually I get angry easily and get annoyed easily if I lose a lot of money when gambling.Gambling is a game that uses money, no matter how strong our mentality is, if we spend all our money on gambling it will definitely disturb our mentality and can have more fatal consequences. Because losing money or not having money will be stressful, especially if you already have a wife and children, it will be even worse for you because they will scold you or corner you in the position of the guilty person.",

He put all of his hope with that bet, therefore money is the main concern why he felt bad with the negative outcome. Gambling no doubt is profitable but will never provide a consistent outcome or winnings. Some are indeed making a living in this industry but always consider those who are losing huge amount of money in gambling. Best thing to do is to set the right mindset; knowing when to stop and learning to never bet all in no matter how confident you are with your bet. This would be a preventive measure to not be affected by that much of whatever the outcome is. We cannot control one’s mental health which is why we have to take the initiative to lessen the risk of getting our emotions involved with our bets.If you would be too hopeful of your gambling results or gambling wins, then never expect less of addiction afterwards.",
