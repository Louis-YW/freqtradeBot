  "content": "There is an ETH propaganda topic in this forum with the title “BITCOIN IS DEAD!”. The base argument is that “There is an energy and raw materials crisis all over the world” and BTC needs to move to POS to survive. This is my answer that I don’t want to be moderated by him. So here comes my BITCOIN IS NOT DEAD!If there’s no energy for BTC, there won’t be energy for anything, in which case you won’t need to worry about BTC or ETH. But there is no lack of energy. There is lack of intelligence and abundance of malice: the one the US is using to strangle the EU, governed by servants of the US empire of injustice, who are playing the same cards of the French Bourbons (they lost the head in the game) against UK during the independence of the US. US promoted, first, a coup the tat in 2014 in Ukraine to incite this Russian invasion, plus US never respected the deal not to increase NATO with former Warsaw Pact countries, right after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Second, US is promoting the most insidious campaign against Russians, only comparable to the campaign against Jews started in the Czarist Russia that, later, moved on to Central Europe to finish in the Holocaust. In this case, Russia has the means to defend themselves (it was not the case of the Jews), and the US, which could not win a war against a country of plain sheep herders (Afghanistan), will not win this war either. Once this is clear and massive protests erupt in Europe, their governments will tumble down or Europe will finish in a total war. I really think this is the real purpose of the US, which went from total bankruptcy in the late XIX century to accumulate 75 % of world total capital (it was gold then) at the end of WWII. I don’t think it was done on purpose back then, but I think it is now. US wants to repeat this massive theft. In any case and for the rest of the world (“F the EU” as Victoria Nuland said, and more if they are a bunch of idiots), energy trade will resume to normal. So there will be planty of electricity for BTC mining.  Respecting to BTC, its value resides precisely in the fact that it is a POW technology, and that it has a limit of emission, which ETH lacks (another fiat currency as any other one based in the multiplication of units). It is a proven mathematical and economic theorem that any money based on the unlimited multiplication of its units, its value tends to cero over the time (the pathetic case of ETH). On the contrary, any money based on the subdivision of units which total amount cannot be multiplied (the case of BTC), its value tends to increase with only one limit: wealth over the crust of the Earth. It does not matter any other ETH utility might have. Many things have crucial utility (water, oxygen, etc.), and its abundance invalidates those material substances to be used as money. The ETH defenders lack the understanding of what money is, which is something you do not learn programming computers. They need to study economics profoundly. This is the main difference between BTC and ETH creators. Whoever Satoshi Nakamoto were, they knew about cryptography, programming, computing, and economics. These ETH guys do not understand economics. Even Isaac Newton, in the 1700 knew then more than these guys know now. Maybe they should start with this interview to economist Saifedean Ammous to understand the real value of BTC as money: https://podverse.fm/es/episode/m3jJcVzOl. We’ll see sometime in the future who is right and who is wrong. Good luck, everyone.",

It was already the case in the hard fork tryout in December 2017 when miners and some institutions tried to modify BTC core to increase its data capacity. That data increase would have hampered many to own a node. It would probably have required big machines, big data servers, and big energy consumption not available to most of us. This would have resulted in a real BTC centralization. Then, it was proven that power resides in the nodes and not in the miners. They, as Mr. Ammous explains, are service providers to the nodes (their owners). They invest money and make a return because there are nodes sustaining the network and deciding what BTC core is the right one. Nodes are the real owners of BTC. And anyone can setup a node to become a BTC network co-owner.",

When you check a blockchain explorer site like mempool and you see new blocks are always created, that's enough to make sure that the bitcoins are still alive.The statement that \"bitcoin is a waste of energy\" is endless, because bitcoin with an anonymous founder grew up in its own way without paying \"tributes\" to interested people. It is different with the known industrial owners, they are good at keeping the protestors' mouths shut in order to spend more energy.",

As a fact, as you can hear in this interview, BTC will help us to finish WWI. Yes, it never ended. Global fiat money system was created to start WWI and it kept on going to never end it. War in Ukraine is just another battle. ETH is just another fiat currency under the disguise of a cryptocurrency to divert people from BTC. So, yes, there are plenty of these spooks around everywhere. He just might be one of them. The final purpose of fiat currency is the purpose of warmongering states and their abusive powers. They need to stop BTC. It is BTC or them. And they haven’t found a way to stop it. And their only tool, by now, is misinformation and pure defamation. ETH is just another part of that plan.",

You’re the one insulting and disqualifying with the typical derogatory adjectives. It is evident who cannot keep his manners and discuss as a normal, educated person. Nothing new. Anyway, thanks for “not reading and giving me that Merit”. It seems to me you hold many of your opinions without reading. If my post is going to help you to resolve your issues with reading, I have already done my good deed. And my original post is perfectly centered in the issue. There is no energy problem that will affect BTC mining. My position on the “energy crisis” and all my arguments support my thesis that this is not an energy crisis, but a moral one. The same moral crisis that already affected Europe, Russia, and many other countries when Jews where to blame for anything that went wrong anywhere. Then it was Russia, France, Germany, and many others falsely accusing Jews. Now it is the US, UK, and many others accusing Russia for anything that goes wrong with them: all the corruption in the US, all the money squander, the Pentagon missing spending invoices, the infrastructure crumbling down, the rampant inflation, the voting machines obvious flaws, crazy people shooting others everywhere (nothing to do with guns but more likely with the absolute lack of mental health in the US), and even because US Americans call “football” a sport that is played with the hands… that too is Russia’s fault. It is exactly the same phenomenon that happened with the Jews from the late XIX to the mid XX century. This time, US craziness won’t go as far as exterminating Russians, thank goodness. Here is one interesting link on how antisemitism started: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair. Soon will have links on how “anti-Russian-ism” replaced antisemitism in the Western world as the perfect excuse to send people to the meat mincer.   This new anti-whatever-ism is going to destroy Europe, but if they don’t care, why should we? BTC won’t be affected by anything of this. On the contrary, many Europeans should start thinking about getting out of the EUR and stocking BTC.",

Please, get rid of your TV set and your perspective about the world will immediately change. This link will help many to understand why this is not an energy crisis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrMiSQAGOS4&t=2s. This is US American professor John Mearsheimer. Of course, he is a Russian propagandist and spook, as much as Ron Paul, Tulsi Gabbard and many other authentic US Americans patriots, and everyone who does not bent down to the US warmongers are. With this I do not say that everything Russia does is correct, or I agree with it. No, that’s not what I’m saying. But that’s also quite different from blaming Russia for anything and everything. Russia could have a more friendly approach to BTC. Once they have already been isolated, sanctioned and blocked from the corrupt international financial fiat system, they could have gone full into declaring BTC legal tender. They haven’t done it. Yes, I’m pretty sure, although they are denying it, they are accepting BTC as a means of exchange for their “dirty oil and gas” (when the oil and gas was coming from anywhere else, it was not “dirty” for the EU commissioners… now, it helps them to spread hate against their new “Jews” scapegoats). And yes, for those Russian haters, ETH creator, Vitálik Buterin, is Russian! Oh yes, if you look in Wikipedia in English, he is Canadian…   … this ally of global elitists and BTC haters cannot be Russian! They hate Russians even more than BTC! But if you change that Wikipedia link to Spanish says he’s Russian. In French, Canadian-Russian (how typical of the French that in WWII had a Nazi government who helped Hitler to exterminate Jews, and convinently finished between the winners of the war, and the \"savers of the Jews\"). So, yes, anyone owning a BTC node is helping Russia to evade sanctions. But that was precisely the goal of the cypher punks who created BTC: to have an uncensored, free, decentralized monetary base that absolute nobody could temper with for their dirt political and warmongering purposes. And if you watch John Mearsheimer’s conference link above, you will understand why Russia is not the aggressor in this war. They are just the mean to make believe highly misinformed people we have “an energy crisis”. So, you can breathe with piece of mind if you are a Russian hater while you own a BTC node. The contradiction is not in your BTC node. It is in your hate towards Russians (or anybody else). Stop hating others!ETH does not fulfill this purpose. Once it completely moves to POS, it’s a duplicate of the USD or the EUR. In terms of monetary theory and practice, where is the innovation? Nowhere.",

Her most absurd recent statement is that the “EU cannot allow Russia win this war”. She can’t even come to terms with reality. Russia has already won this war. Every single part of Ukraine already under control of Russia will never be turned back. This is the Ukrainian pathetic “Gibraltar”. But in this case, Spain lost a stupid pebble, with no economic value and, nowadays with satellites and modern communications systems, not even strategic value. It is just a moronic long term pride dispute only in the brain of the less intelligent Spaniards and British. The rest don’t even care about it. Ukraine, on the contrary, has already lost a quarter of their country and it only depends on Russia how much more they’re going to lose. As much they delay a peace agreement with Russia, the more people will suffer and die, and the more parts of their country their giving away. So, concluding my intervention, there’s no such “energy crisis” threatening BTC mining as much as it does not matter what the EU, UK or the US do from now on, Russia has already won this war. The unilateralism US has thriven for since the end of the USSR is gone, as ETH will be as soon as people realize that turning to POS has erased the only good feature ETH had respecting legacy fiat currencies. Hope is the only support for ETH, as it was the case for so many crypto scams. Reality is the cure when hope turns vicious.",
