  "content": "Greetings everyone, I hope you're all doing well! If you missed out on the first prototype auction of this design concept, here is yourchance to try and grab one, as I have up for auction the 2nd and final prototype!I will be releasing a small numbered run of 16x20 canvas prints, this auction is to help fund that.The concept of the piece: \"THE TIMES TRAVELER\"In the future the secret of time travel is discovered. A time traveler goes back in time and convincesThe Times to run an alternate front page article on Jan. 3rd 2009 after revealing to them the bitcoin whitepaper,source code and genesis block code that embeds the famous \"Chancellor on brink of second bailout\" headlinethat had yet to be printed! Replacing the Israel sends troops into Gaza headline with the message from averified time traveler that bitcoin would become the future world currency, right above the bank bailout headline!This changes history forever, as on the same day Satoshi launched the bitcoin blockchain, the entire civilizedworld would now learn of bitcoin's existence and destiny as the future world currency.This #002 prototype is a 1\" frame wrapped 16x20 canvas, with a process done to embolden text.The result is pleasing, but I feel it did not retain the same authenticity of the original design.\"THE TIMES TRAVELER\"PROTOTYPE #002 1\" Wrapped 16\"x20\" CanvasStarting bid: 0.001BTCBid Increments: 0.0001BTCEnd date and time:  Thursday, July 7th. 2022 at 7pm EST.
