  "content": "When you create a seed phrase using make_seed command on electrum console, there are three arguments. The first one determines the number of bits and the third one determines the seed type. The seed type can be either standard, segwit or 2FA.For example, make_seed(256,\"\",\"standard\") creates a 24 word legacy seed phrase or make_seed(128,\"\",\"segwit\") creates a 12 word segwit seed phrase. Whatever I enter as the second argument, it works and it doesn't change anything.For example, make_seed(128, \"ggsd^gsf*\") creates a 12 word segwit seed phrase or make_seed(128,\"qojnfsyr6/7\",\"standard\") creates a 12 word legacy seed phrase. What's the second argument?",

The second argument is used for having a seed phrase from a different wordlist.I was able to generate a seed phrase with spanish words using make_seed(128,\"es\",\"standard\").Thank you pooya87.",
