I even recommended to them in the beginning to split it up into 2x auctions to make it easierAnd reposting every bid every time is definitely not good for either bidders or sellers...my 2 Satoshi from a dude who just ships packages!!",

It is one thing to mess up, but this whole things seems like someone who has not seen an auction and is foreign to the forum versus a long standing member from 2011. I have wondered a little about the pictures of the coins. They never felt like photos someone took pictures of themselves, and now in retrospect, none of of asked for proof of ownership. I think Owlcatz is right, this is probably a hacked account and we were getting played. Fortunately most of us do a good job using escrow and being suspicious. Steeley",
