For every hour that your loan is not repaid,,, you are charged that rate of interest on the loan.As your hours pass, the number on the second screenshot will go up. The more you pay back from the loan,,, naturally the lesser you have to pay back as interest. Which is excluding your principal (so pay back as much as possible the principal!)",

And, is this being charged hourly?Also, how do I add images to posts on this forum? I can't work out how to do it!There is no % with the 0.00007057 numbers, so that's in bitcoins.Definitely, your interest is hourly and is the percentage that's shown on your first image. If you want to still double-check, you can visit Binance margin fee and check the daily interest according to your VIP Level. Once you find your coin and VIP level, then you should divide it by 24 to find your hourly rate. To calculate the interest that you have to return to Binance, you should multiply borrowed money and the hourly rate.But since you trade BTC/USDT pair, why not to use Futures Trading? It comes with less friction, you don't need to borrow and return the money, it does it automatically.",
