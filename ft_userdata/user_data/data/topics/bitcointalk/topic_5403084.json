Bitcoin's decline is not the end of the story.What happens to bitcoin when it falls in value has ramifications in all facets of life. A country might be in recession for a long time and then recover by more than 50%. As a result, never quit up in the event of a bitcoin crash. It will climb above our expectations once more.",

It's appealing that there is so much confidence, yet no one knows what's going to happen. A bounce back was expected at 20k, but unfortunately we have not been able to secure levels. I'll wait to see if the daily closure passes, but if it doesn't, the next target appears to be lower. Let's hope BTC bounces back. A new day brings a new depth. Hopefully, I'll see green days soon after buying it. Stay strong and take advantage of the opportunity! At those convenient psychological levels, stop losses will always be triggered, 18k and 19k seem more appropriate.",

This is not the end so you should stop worrying, this is a period you should take advantage of I wouldn't say bad.",

But obviously, it's not, it will continue to exists despite the massive decreased that we have right now since November. It will be very hard as we are in the first half of the year.
