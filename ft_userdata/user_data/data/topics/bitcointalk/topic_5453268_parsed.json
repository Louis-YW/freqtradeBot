I know I have experienced this before, but it did not take so long before I was able to log in, but it seems today's experience took so long, I was beginning to think if the site was under attack, because nothing seems to be a surprise to me anymore this days.@LoyceV sir,  what could this be? please",

I actually bookmarked a url here that I needed to read early morning when I wake before work, but I tried and the site didn't open.
