Even if it is a lightning wallet, for daily use and seed backup is encrypted, but why more wallets give the possibility of seed sharing to the Cloud? it is confusing.",

Although there's no guide or tutorial, so i wouldn't bother with it for now. But looking at the screenshot, i wonder what does UGX mean? Altcoin?

Unfortunately, building our own apps on iOS is a complete pain in the ass... totally inviable. Most iOS apps that are in Beta use the Testflight app for distributing it to a closed set of users. But yeah that doesn't really change the fact that development is such a PITA if you don't have a Mac, or even if you have an old Mac. Personally I have a hackintosh VM but it takes several minutes for the iOS simulators to even boot in XCode, and the lag between UI state updates as you edit the code is just way too much.",

I think the developer's intention with his early announcement is to look for contributors or testers. Definitely still in a very early phase and not targeted for public usage. Maybe you can wait for a few weeks or so since the developer stated that people can learn more about it further in the following weeks.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on May 20, 2023, 10:11:50 AMWhat caught my attention is the word Cloud Backups. Did we start the era of storing seeds on the cloud? Even if it is a lightning wallet, for daily use and seed backup is encrypted, but why more wallets give the possibility of seed sharing to the Cloud? it is confusing.The design is inspired by this[1], so I guess the developer simply agrees with the explanation that providing a cloud option is useful for its users as long as they don't use it for high-value amounts. It is a wallet data/file upload if I understand it correctly, not a seed backup. I believe the risk is still the same regardless, especially because the added pin protection is limited to 4 digits only.

CMIIW.[1] https://bitcoin.design/guide/daily-spending-wallet/backup-and-recovery/cloud-backup/The increase of such services to the point of making them normal is disgusting, being your bank means that no third party can access your currencies, their argument that the automatic cloud reduces pressure and responsibility on the user is a weak argument, whoever cannot believe 12 words or was lazy let him use HIS BANK account, not a bitcoin wallet.This point stopped me because it indicates indirectly that the wallet recovery data before it is sent to the cloud provider may not be encrypted and therefore it is an additional risk or greater trust in the cloud service provider.QuoteWhile this is an easier way for users to set up a wallet, it brings in the potential threat of malicious third-party access. If a user’s cloud account is hacked, their funds could be compromised. This can be mitigated by encrypting the wallet recovery data before sending it to the cloud provider.",

That being said, the security is still questionable due to the limitation of the password/encryption method. While they don't upload a seed/private key to cloud backup, the time required to crack the wallet backup is definitely short. No one should rely on this backup method if they want security. CMIIW.",
