  "content": "I work for a casino house a couple of years ago - I could make a serial reference since it's been said in most of my post here.Alright,?? Cashiers were assigned to manage the activities and book on desired games for all validated customers, but i normally noticed something very displeasing - sometimes, I felt bad for any gambler that lost in that same way and It looked to me like a kinda \"money heist\" program.Here is it; A gambler could bet on correct scores - mind you, this all happens only in Virtual games - let's say, 3-0 and, since the games are being displayed on screens for them to confirm Thier winnings, it could even happen that the game stops at the 82nd minute, maybe with a 2-0 score,but once it rules out and updates the scores on the score sheets,.what we all see is 2-5...Now the question is, how can 5 goals from the away teams be scored in barely a time to blink?? Could that have supposed to mean something different? Maybe a bug? Or is it some sort of misprogramming?Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

Or is it some sort of misprogramming?There should be at least an available simulation replay or something related to that term to verify how the result happened. It should show the bettors the overall breakdown of what we really on that game. I don't see it as a misprogrammed if we refer to a legit virtual betting site. I don't have experience betting on virtual games but since you work at a casino house, are you aware of how virtual betting results are shown? Does it have a sort of what I mentioned about anything related to viewing the post-match simulation?",

Since when did wrong become right?In a business relationship of any kind, justice must always prevail, what you said sounds ridiculous to me and I hope it's just a joke on your part.Bookmakers already have the house advantage, something that makes you a lot of money and that should be reason enough for them against players.In the same way that I must accept the site's rules when registering, the site must also respect the transparency and fairness of the bets that the player makes.Anyway, I know that there are lots of fraudulent sites out there, so it's good to bet only on those that have a reputation to uphold.",

I don't know how large this casino is, but if it's large enough that hundreds of thousands in USD is at stake, I don't think they will get away with it. So it could indeed be some sort of technical glitch. It's just suspicious that not only did a team score 5 goals in a matter of a few minutes, the score of the other team was also reduced.

Therefore, if this is not happening in any other games or bet but for only the correct score that was about to favour the player, then the gambling house should be able to explain what happened. Unfortunately, one of the disadvantages of virtual soccer is that it lacks comprehensive replay but for 5 goals to be scored within 7/8 minutes to the end of the match by the away team shows a manipulation is possible and also when playing virtual soccer, expect anything from programming.",

Maybe a bug? Or is it some sort of misprogramming?As far as I know, the Away Goal team refers to the system, it's purely based on Hattrick, Brace, Quattrick, or Quintrick, more commonly known as leg or home-away in the system, usually the away team is considered to have more weight than the home/headquarters team, using a system of determining the highest number of away goals, in the event of a draw or 2-0 one match.In the Quintrick system, usually players have to try and be sued or required to score 5 goals in one game, I remember when Bayern players scored 2 goals in 4 minutes, on away goals.Different from the Hattrick system in that away goals players are required to score 6 goals, while Quattrick is demanded 4 goals and Brace 2 goals, as far as I know that is the process of how to determine away goals, more than the assessment of time in one game.",
