Indeed there are ways to earn from this industry in particular with services or projects but there are also limitations in particular with requirements to participate. Maybe if it was 4 years ago, there were so many options and requirements weren’t that hard to comply. I remember the first projects I have worked and participated with which really have helped me to make a start in this industry. With regards tk Bitcoin being an investment, we cannot do anything about it simply ‘coz in such way it became useful still given that its acceptance still is limited to majority of countries however I doubt it would might lower the value of this technology.",

      "body": "In general, poor people tend to prefer low-value assets rather than high-value investment assets as their investments. The simple reason is because bitcoin has an expensive price and it takes time and quite a lot of capital to make it rise 3 to 5 times its current price. This mindset is shared by poor people so they tend to invest in crypto with lower value where there is potential for profit, but I don't say all of them have the same mindset.Some mistakes in selecting investment assets only make their plans fall apart. Some altcoins certainly have a good future, but bitcoin tends to be considered a safer long-term investment regardless of investment budget.",

The poor can also invest if they have the knowledge and discipline to be able to maintain a DCA strategy or trading effectively. The application of the knowledge is what is of uttermost importance, be it for the poor or for the rich.  It has however proven to have been more beneficial to the poor in that they may be more concerned with ranking up in a signature campaign to earn in BTC rather than wait for other means of income to improve before investing in BTC. The rich is merely a classification of those who know how to think outside the box by capitalizing on the BTC idea to accumulate BTC or use it for payment of purchase of goods and services. They may also be involved in other interest as the campaign projects ongoing, but the difference is that the rich wants to learn more while the poor give more excuses and rarely try out future projects.",

IMO poor people don't have money for investments, don't have money to DCA so how they can benefit from Bitcoin?

The fact that a lot of them even came from this site is all the more inspiring, I was one of them after all. Nowadays you could argue that there's still the opportunity to earn money in the industry but truth be told, it's not that much. There's a lot more stability going on and with that comes the less chances of earning a large amount of profit, compared to years ago when bitcoin was dirt cheap and you can buy it with spare gas change. It's nothing bad though, as a stable asset valuation almost always means that the industry it is in is thriving or the product has gained enough fame and reputation, but diversifying your assets has become even more important and relevant nowadays as compared to back then.",

Not to mention that you need to have a deeper understanding before you can stand a chance to make it in stock trading. Not really no. These limits can be seen in some form even in crypto or just regular stock trading. It's just that crypto in general has a greater volatility than stocks, so more opportunities even if you have a lower amount of money invested. Compared to stocks, which are volatile as well, yes, but less than crypto itself. Besides, the same thing about \"knowledge\" can be said about crypto. I mean, Bitcoin is a top choice, yes, only because it's well known, it's shown what it can be, and the forum is literally about Bitcoin. You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't at least have some basic knowledge of Bitcoin. If you were, however, to go to a forum of say real estate owners (if that does exist), given enough time I reckon you'd be able to build up enough knowledge and eye about land to know which is a worthwhile investment or not. While I've never tried fractural shares, the same ideology probably holds the same (just with a bit more restrictions I suppose). Though I guess I do agree with crypto being reasonably easier to enter than stock. I tried both when I was a college student and boy was stocks confusing as hell.",
