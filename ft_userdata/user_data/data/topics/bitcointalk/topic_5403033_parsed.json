Just putting out some feelers. I think they are super cool. Anybody have experience using one? They user friendly? Trustworthy?    Been using one for years and they are very easy to use...very trustworthy I have had BTC on the paper wallets created on them for years with no issue.       Here is a good article on them https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/04/mycelium-announces-entropy-offline-usb-paper-wallet-creator/",
