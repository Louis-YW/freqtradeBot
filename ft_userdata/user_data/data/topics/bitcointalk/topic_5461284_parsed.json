My actual private tool is capable to try to brute force from 1 ~ 128 bits.next days I will release a public version for 1 ~ 66 bits.",

If you are afraid that people might find a puzzle by using your trojan, why are you sharing it anyways? You don't seem to be a generous person.Irony here is, op is not sharing the source code because others might find it sooner, but he is sharing a trojan inside this tool so that other people can find it sooner, FOR HIM.ðŸ˜‰",
