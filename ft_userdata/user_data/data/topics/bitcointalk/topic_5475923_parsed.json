For example, someone with a household income of $70,000 before tax should gamble no more than $58 per month.Recently I decided to risk only 1 percent of my gambling portfolio into each bet. This makes my bet risk free as I know that even if I lose the bet i will lose only 1% of my gambling money.Do you guys also follow a similar strategy like gambling with 1% or 2% on each game? This way not only we are safe from losing big amounts but at the same time, we never find ourselves in a situation where we go all in, in some bet and then have the fear of losing all of our money.You must have heard 1% strategy in trading, the same can be applied in gambling too and believe me, you will feel a lot more comfortable using this 1% of your money in every game. This also gives you a lot of games to play before you end up on your money as on every bet you will use 1% of your money. In case you lose all bets, you will be playing 100 games because your money is exhausted.The Lower-Risk Gambling Guidelines",

But it would be good if someone can go lower like 1%.There are some weekend that I would win more and leave the rest for the following week or use it for something fun like beer. But there are sometimes that I will lose too. There are many times I just did not go more than 2% weekly because I am busy and unable to gamble more.Going for just 1% is good. The lesser you go, the better you will be able to afford the loss.",

That's how I gamble and it feels really new to do it when you have a break and you get some insights especially if you're researching and taking some analysis on the sports you tend to follow specifically for gambling. Yeah, most of the time we are triggered specially if we lost and we tend to get that losses by not following the objective but I for me I take it as lessons.",

I agree with you that it is very unlikely that this can be done, because remembering that people who have not experienced a gambling addiction use the income they get to gamble more than the amount mentioned and if they have experienced a gambling addiction, there may even be more. whose entire income is used for gambling because they cannot control themselves in gambling, but in my opinion if we use around 15% or 20% of the income we get, I think this is still possible.",

      "body": "This can be considered as a safe strategy but the outcome and the potential winnings is low. However, this mostly depends on the equivalent of the one percent to your local money. For instance if you have hundred dollars as your portfolio and that one percent is 1 dollar. If you use that amount to place a bet of 2 odd, your winning will be 2 dollars. So this is why I do not prefer this strategy. Although it won't hurt If you lose the one dollar because it is a small amount. I do prefer to gamble based on the how high or low the odd is. If I have something like 2 odds I could risk 10$ to 20$ from my portfolio to gamble. But if the odds are high, like 20 to 50 odds. I'll rather bet with 2 to 3 dollars. This is how I prefer. In general the higher the odd the lower the percentage while the lower the odd the higher the percentage.",

I understand that a lot of people have already concluded that gambling is entirely luck driven, I differ on this because with good strategy, one will be able to navigate through days the luck may not shine. One thing I have always known is that the longer you stay in the business, the higher your chances of winning. To stay long, risk management is key and all these are what constitute the strategy. Risking 1% is a very good decision that can keep one in the game for a very long time. You cannot be that unlucky not to win in a stretch of hundred bets.",

It's enough for me and if ever it loses early then I stop. It's better that way to avoid addiction and also so that I could do more of my responsibilities in the house. When you go hard in gambling, it's difficult to do housework because the eyes are always looking at what may happen to your capital. I don't like it that way. IMO, just checking the balance every 2 hours should be enough, or whenever the autobet feature stops. You might have a good salary that's why you are using 1 percent. I don't. 1 percent might not be enough to reach the RTP that is set in each gambling site. I might get rekt early and cannot get it back with that balance.",

The 1% won't settle down well with such gambler who will chose to use bigger amount to stake with smaller odds.",

But you are considering it as a side hustle. I can not use my side hustle to gamble. Hustling is hustling for money and not free money. I will join all my earning together and take just little amount not more than 5% from it and use it to gamble.

      "body": "For me betting 1% of your bankroll as base bet is a very high beginning, because you have to take into consideration that long loss streaks will hit often, therefore you have to keep increasing your bets in this case. If you already start with 1% of bankroll on the table, it means you won't have a big margin to increase further bets, if necessary. In my opinion it's much better to start betting only 0,1% of your bankroll. Anyway, it's never going to be risk free, since there is always a risk of losing money in gambling. The positive side of betting a low percentage of your bankroll is that it allows you to maintain it for longer, instead of wasting everything in few minutes of gambling session.",

So for such, there is a need to set a lower leverage that guarantees us a lower risk and higher chances of winning the bets or making profits in trades as the case may be.",
