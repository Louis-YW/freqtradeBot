  "content": "I tried to send my entire wallet contents from mymonero.com to monero core gui wallet. Wallet makes a popup window that says, \"Sending wallet balance. Fetching latest balance. Fetching decoy outputs.\" However, nothing is sent. Funds still in mymonero wallet & core gui  wallet still empty. This mymonero wallet is from 2015. I tried bot the downloaded mymonero wallet on linux mint and the online one. I waited 4 hours. I tried low, medium and high priority. Am I just doing something wrong or was I hacked? Thanks.",

So they froze your funds?Please help me understand. Checking out the website of mymonero.com gives me the vibe that the wallet is noncustodial, and I see somewhere they even talk about mnemonic phrases. Is it a custodial or noncustodial wallet?If it's the former, then this should be the last time you are using it to avoid completely losing your funds in the future.",

Ain't know this but I think this is pretty common for any services that freeze your fund for a longer time didn't open it.It's not uncommon for cryptocurrency services or platforms to have policies in place to freeze funds under certain circumstances.The exact criteria and timeframes for freezing funds can vary from one service to another.  I think it's advisable to carefully review the terms of service or user agreement provided by the wallet or platform to understand their specific policies regarding frozen funds.  I tried to read it now but I didn't find or something I missed it. So there's nothing you can do is to wait by them until they will answer you through your request on their email.I saw on Reddit, the same problem as you have now, try to read and find an alternative way to recover your fund.",

Is this safe? Can funds be stolen with theTop level addreas? Thanks.If by what they mean of top-level Monero address is the \"Main Address\" or the \"Address\" as in the image above, it should be safe to send it to them.As per the MyMonero help page, https://help.mymonero.com/en/articles/5402588-understanding-keys-and-addresses, sharing the main address is safe and won't make them able to spend your funds. Sharing the secret view key, also won't make them able to spend it, but will reduce your privacy. The only way they are able to spend it is if they got the mnemonic seed or secret spend key.",

Or if you have the 13, 14, or 25 mnemonic seed, you can restore it to another wallet like Monero GUI wallet, Ledger, or Trezor. I've never used MyMonero.com wallet, but usually, you can find that mnemonic seed on setting.Source: https://coinguides.org/monero-balance-locked-unlocked/",
