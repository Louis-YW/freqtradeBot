It does look like a great deal because exactly 8 years from now, the price of Bitcoin will look very different just as it is as of today compared to 2011.  Like i always say, you can't blame anyone who didn't invest in bitcoin when it was just worth less than a dollar because how can you convince people that such an asset will experience long term future growth and they just believe you like that? Just like some altcoins are less than a dollar now and someone tries to persuade you to invest in them that they have long term future growth, will you gladly invest in them just because same thing happened to bitcoin? We should be very realistic when we are deliberating on something because most of us like to see the level of success of something before we can get a convincing spirit to invest so i don't blame anyone who got the privilege to invest when the price was less than a dollar. The only people i will blame in the future are those who after seeing the price performance of bitcoin over the years, still remain adamant and didn't invest and then start regretting when the price must have gotten to $1M.",

It does look like a great deal because exactly 8 years from now, the price of Bitcoin will look very different just as it is as of today compared to 2011.  comparing the price of bitcoin eight years ago to its current price and speculating that in eight years' time, we might get to that sort of figure like what happened in the past is something we can't say with a level of certainty because only time will tell what the future holds for bitcoin and for the fact that bitcoin is gradually becoming less volatile we can only wish that it goes up to certain range of value and not make some sort of ambiguous projective of what value it will be in the next eight years.if some of us saw this same post eight years ago, the chances that we might invest in bitcoin will still be uncertain and chances are that we might not even invest in it at the time due to our extent of knowledge and the fact that it is impossible to see into the future and know that bitcoin will have gotten to that height. I don't know his bitcoin stack but one thing that is certain is that if he was certain of the point bitcoin will get to at this point and if he had enough resource that he can put into bitcoin at that time, he would have certainly invested more than he currently holds at the moment. even if investing massively at the present can recreate the kind of profit earlier investors have, you still have to invest with an amount that will allow you to do other things and not tie yourself down till years to come. this is the reason why while investing, you can just stay glued to using the DCA method so you can comfortably stay invested for the long run.",

The current price of Bitcoin may seem high right now but the next bull run may see the price hitting up to 150k to 200k, instead of having to regret in the future people should take advantage of the current price now to purchase and enjoy the next bull run that is to come.",

Imagine it like if there is no opportunities in the present and future, Bitcoin market will be no longer interesting with many people. There will be no new participants, investors into this market in the present and future.Without newbies, no new capital flow in the market, and price won't rise. Adoption of Bitcoin looks to be bullish and it brings new people to this market. They join it obviously because they see opportunities.With time, you are able to stack less satoshis with same dollar.https://charts.bitbo.io/satoshi-per-dollar/",

Yes, My intentions are not to bring back our interest to the past, what will be the possibility of us still holding what we had purchased even if we bought during that time.

After many years of doubt and criticizes, some of them now would sit down and regret knowing about Bitcoin years back and not giving it a try. The fact about cryptocurrency is that you cannot predict it's future completely. There are many factors that some people use personally to make decisions in thing that requires money and risk investment.. I don't think there will still be anyone out there still doubting Bitcoin.

As for the price increase and people actually spreading the fud like the one we see now with bitcoin at $100k, they were many people who had actually spread the FUD of bitcoin never attaining a six figure when the price was $10k I think they are same people now spreading it again that buying at this price is actually FOMO. One thing I tell intending investors is if bitcoin can pull this price movement without mass adoption and coupled with the scrutiny by the government then imagine how far it can go when everyone comes back to embrace this revolution.
