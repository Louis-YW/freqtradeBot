They are very specific to how we perceive time for example.An alien would probably experience time in a different way. Even other animals on earth live vastly different amounts of time, so an alien would probably experience time in a very different way, therefore our consensus rules might not be applicable for them, therefore they would prefer an altcoin basically.On the other hand gold is just a rock, so they might probably not value it a lot.",

So what can we pay them for this information?We have already discovered planets that are possibly suitable for life, but even if we had spaceships that travel at the speed of light, it would take us years to get there, and given that for those who travel at that speed time slows down considerably, while for others it's going quite normally, the crew on the way back wouldn't have found anyone alive from those who were alive in their time.

Sending bitcoins to the first alien   Somehow it seems to me that Bitcoin would not be of much interest to those aliens, because if you watched Star Trek, in the future currencies practically do not exist - so even though it is only SF, it still seems that people should progress in that direction. On the other hand, some aliens may be greedy like the Ferengi, they just need to be explained the concept of digital gold",

      "body": "I do believe that alien life probably exists, including intelligent one, because it simply doesn't make any sense that in the vast universe we'd be the only ones. But I think that, unfortunately, humanity is not ready as a whole for first contact. We still have occasional genocides and systemic racism even among humans. Anything new will be perceived largely as a threat and not as something deserving human rights because of our xenophobia. We have serious hostilities and sometimes wars between countries because apparently not everyone gets that imperialism is over (I'm looking at you, Russia). So if we meet someone now, governments, armies and many others will blow it if not commit a terrible crime.But let's imagine that somehow we do achieve a lot of moral progress within our lifetimes and we meet intelligent aliens. Who's to say they'll have money as a concept? Or an idea of exchanging things for other things? They can be a society that simply takes and gives what it can and needs, without the idea of property or a medium of exchange. And certainly, explaining to an alien race that we're giving them something that they can't touch and it looks just like numbers and other symbols on a screen but it's actually valuable is likely to cause misunderstandings. So it's just not a good start (barter IMO is a good start), but eventually it can be quite good because at least it's money that isn't controlled by any our government.",
