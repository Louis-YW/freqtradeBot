  "content": "The festive period comes with so much expectations from family and friends. Exchange of gifts will keep cycling round among people who share things in common. I just imagined how excited I will feel if I am gifted bitcoin by friends no matter how small. Not every one will value Bitcoin that is worth less especially none holders. Some might glamour for something else but owning Bitcoin now the price is favourable to an extent can be a big preparation for the bull run. As I celebrate the festive period my wallet too will be included in my budget Bitcoin price is getting more attractive by the day a good time to start accumulating.",

Can I ask a question OP, would you prefer a huge amount of cash or a small amount of bitcoins? The two have value to me, and I will appreciate them both, but the only difference will be that if I am gifted in bitcoins, the person who gave me the gift has made the choice for me already about the amount to hold, but if I am gifted in huge cash, I could probably just buy more than what I was gifted and still have money enough to avoid being tempted to change my bitcoins to cash to sort my needs. Receiving cash will give me the option of investing an amount in bitcoin that I can do without.",

      "body": "You are formulating the hypothetical scenario of receiving bitcoin as a xMas gift on a bitcoin forum, so it’s conceptually easy to imagine here, though I’d say very it’s probably going to be a rare thing to be done, at least in terms of statistical significance.The awkward scenario is that of when someone ponders the scenario the other way around – giving bitcoin for xMas to a relative or friend that is novel to it altogether (let’s leave out the savy to savy scenario). Not only do you have to consider how to make the gift available to them, but also what kind of guidance you’ll have to provide, in order for them not to lose it or get scammed at the first chance. Let’s say that it doesn’t quite come with a user’s guide, and for many, understanding and taking custody of it is a real challenge they may not even wish to take on (some are bound to be technically incapable too for sure). I’ve tested the waters of this latter scenario at some point, getting something close to a GTFO for an answer. Just as well …",

It's not easy to get bitcoins if you just wish for a Christmas present from someone else's friends or family.You really have to give an example of bitcoin if your environment isn't familiar with it. If you are rewarded with Fiat money then your chance to buy bitcoin yourself is of course very possible. You can also gift someone else a Bitcoin before you can receive a bitcoin gift. introduce first. Having a bitcoin Christmas present would be a dream for you, but not everyone would think about that gift.",

Bitcoin is not like fiat people just give out  as gift.  It is a great asset people will hodl it to themselves. @op if you really  want bitcoin as a gift you can still get by converting any gift you recieve this season from family and friends.",

In your case, you like bitcoin and you anticipate someone's going to gift it to you. While in the other scenario, there are people receiving bitcoin that they don't even know what it is.They've been just given it because they think that the receiver will like it and for the others, it's a way for them to be introduced to bitcoin. There might be situations that someone is able to give you that, who knows?  If no one did during the holidays, then just buy yourself and DCA.",

I personally would not gift bitcoin to someone who isn’t interested in cryptocurrency because it will be difficult for them to understand and value so I would have to give a lecture about bitcoin wallets, wallet security and so on. This can be cumbersome for both parties. Also I don’t like the idea of gifting money as Christmas presents. Anyways I understand this is your own way of spreading bitcoin love",
