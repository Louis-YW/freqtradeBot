      "body": "Hey, Instead of typing \"BITCOIN\" you have written \"BITCION\" every time in your post so it doesn't seems like a typing mistake. Your uncle's advice is correct and you are at right place to learn about cryptos. Please checkout this post to have some ideas about forum's guidelines to follow: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1689727.0A few additions to your points: 1. Since you are thinking of holding for long term the wallet should be non-custodial because you never know a custodial wallet may discontinue their service of may put some mandatory requirement like KYC with passport only, and your funds will be blocked. SO always use non-custodial wallets. If you are planning to invest and hold big amount its worth to consider hardware wallet. Hardware wallets are the most secure method to store your crypto funds. --> here is the list of hardware wallets2. Bear market is best time to enter in the market. since halving is coming so this period may be the right time to take entry. 3. Trading is risky that correct but some trading strategies are safe. For example you can buy in the bear market and sell in bull market as per targets set by you. Then again take entry in bear market.",

It seems that your uncle is very supportive and you said your uncle pointed out these two then it means that he is already working here and if I am not he may be at the legendary rank or maybe the hero rank. Well, this platform will help you a lot not only by asking but also by looking at the different threads and collecting information according to your interest. When you are new here then I recommend you to take a look at the forum rules which are already mentioned by a user up there just go there and read them carefully so when you have knowledge about the rules it is possible that you can't violate any of them . So best of luck and welcome to this forum. I hope you will get for what you came here.",

Many of us spread misinformation about Bitcoin, saying that we may get rich quickly by investing in it. Bitcoin isn't an investment project or Ponzi scheme from which you can make quick money. It's a highly volatile cryptocurrency, and we can capitalise on the volatility through trading. That's how we may make money. On the other hand, we may lose money as well due to wrong decisions.

Always dyor and follow the simple paths; understanding the basics and triumphing!!",

Bitcoin has a large scope and understanding everything about can be challenging but here in the forum you can learn so much about it and there are different sections and boards where discussions of various parts of it are being done. You should begin by learning the basics then later proceeding to other sections of your choice, it’s not necessary you learn all at the same time. Ps: In the crypto world even after you are being told to invest in a certain coin because it has the potential to reach the moon you are advised to still carry out your own research and make the final decision on which coin to invest in based on the results of your research.",

Don't get me wrong but we've heard too many of this type of stories here. Generally, they make up these stories to get merit. If what you say is true, there is no problem. You can find answers to all your questions about Bitcoin here. Don't be afraid to ask questions, even simple ones. Just remember to do your own research. The questions you ask have probably been answered here many times before. If you are young, consider Bitcoin as part of a long-term investment. Don't invest the money you urgently need in crypto-currencies. Buy coins regularly with the money you set aside for investment. Good luck.",
