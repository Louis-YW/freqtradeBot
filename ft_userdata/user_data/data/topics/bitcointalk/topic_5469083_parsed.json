  "content": "Is it really that challenging for crypto devs to design a user interface or anything else that would make crypto easier/more approachable for people? Even though I have been using cryptocurrency for more than two years, getting around it is still a little challenging for me. Every transaction is thrill. Only more seasoned cryptocurrency users are aware of how to cancel a transaction due to the transaction's long human-unreadable address, risk of errors, need to set up gas fees on your own, poor transaction speed, and potential for errors .It can be difficult to connect one chain of coins or tokens to another.Accepting MetaMask prompts without thinking can lead you to authorize harmful smart contracts that you are unaware of.People don't even know what a wallet is, and because custody wallets are much simpler, a lot of people fall for it and don't practice self-custody.So many individuals don't even comprehend the distinction between coins and tokens.Some users who merely want to send stablecoins to friends and family are unsure about how to send their money due to the existence of tokens on many chains, such as USDT on ETH, TRON, and BSC.cryptic ticker names that are difficult to distinguish Cryptocurrency won't become widely used as long as it doesn't become simpler.Although it used to be \"difficult\" to use the internet, even grandma can now do so. Mass adoption of cryptocurrency will happen once it is simple enough for grandparents to use.I am aware of what you would say about this \"dyor,\" but after giving it some thought, idon't think a very busy person would want to put themselves through the stress of learning cryptocurrency, especially if you would have to use it for your daily transactions once it seeks to gain widespread use.",

Even more, while we can give advises, it's not really OK to complain about free software.I think that a more constructive approach would be to make or fund a wallet that's much more user friendly. But I've never seen anybody trying to go in that direction.",

As for what you are saying, I understand perfectly, my question is how many wallets have you use? There are some interface to love and some to hate, starting from Electrum wallet and the likes of Trust wallet, install them and choose which one comes with interface of your taste. I care less about interface and more into security of the wallet, I will use the most ugly looking interface over shinny once if it has the good security, and if it's full open source, good luck with what you looking for, but mind you, the shining interface doesn't mean a crypto wallet is the best.",

      "body": "the bitcoin core software was made by design to be compatible to offshoot and run altcoins to.. thats what the whole descriptor crap is about so someone can change the descriptor to fit an altcoin and run it as 'altcoin core' (for altcoins that are descriptor compatible)the core devs over the years have not tried presenting themselves as a retail product but an experiment. they then present themselves as the controllers of the protocol not the features at the users end. they treat it like they are the protocol regulators and the wallet function is just a side piece (basic add-on) and not the important element of their rolefor years the community has tried to request core devs do things and got rejected because its not part of their core roadmapan analogy iscore are like microsoft excel its job is to control all the functions, features and rules of math. but has a side piece where people can create custom macro's in VB. but the custom VB is not a full feature version of the visual studio pro package, its just a small add-on for basic customisationmany core defenders have been spewing vile comments that no one should make requests of a core dev because its slavery/tyranny to ask a dev to use their time on communities needs.. the funny part is by allowing core devs to do as they please changing the rules and ignore the community needs, core becomes the tyrantsbut the solution to this they desire is: if you want a feature and dont want to go through the ass kissing vetting process to have an opportunity to code a feature and double ass kiss to get core to like it.. well you have to sponsor(pay) a core dev to add something you want",

I am a newbie here and i can say I have only basic knowledge of the Blockchain tech. Nonetheless, I don't think Bitcoin as a digital currency has a software or application of its own independently talk more of a user interface. OP can elaborate the topic to make us understand on the specific application he's referring to. Like saying, Binance, Etherium or other mobile apps and website.In conclusion, It is okay to say that the various crypto applications should be more simplified fof user experience, particularly those users with little amount of mathematics. The first time I opened the Binance/Etherium application, I was overwhelmed by the graphs, charts and figures I saw, but the developers have been working perpetually to make it simplified.",
