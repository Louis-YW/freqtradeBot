None of these is so straightforward or guaranteed to be done, especially with how the admins are usually reluctant to make too many changes.",

In the end, it is more data that is added, and there are some local boards that were created after Epochtalk discussions.As I mentioned previously, the fact that the Nigerian LB does not have a local mod will limit the possibility of establishing sub-boards. I have been distributing merits to that board over the past two weeks, and the local langauge they use (although it is close to English) but understanding it requires some time. True, you do not need to understand entire post to send merits but you need to it to delete the post.A summary of what I would like to say is that only admins can create sub-boards and when a request comes from a local mod, the probability of it being approved is higher, and it is difficult to create sub-boards for LBs that do not contain mods.",

We're taking things slowly, currently there isn't much need of a child board, when we see a need a request will be brought to the meta baord. Our focus now for the board is getting more merit source and an increase of the current merit source allocation on the board; A good statistics to show Nigeria need more merits source to approved at least 2 after that we might prepare a proper request thread and list of board we need, based on threads on those topics dominating the main page.

At least if there is a pin topic then maybe some common guidelines for the beginners could have been taught in the beginning.There's no need of getting a child board when that child board will become dormant because of lack of interest from the local baord members. The main page of the local thread has to be full of topics on a specific area of discussion before a request for subboard get more merit. Pin topic are important and when we submit the subboard request, pinned post request will also be included for some important threads like the Rules and Regulations thread (mostly likely a translated version) but until then we have other focus which is why those areas you raised concern about aren't at the top of the agenda since most local board users are also main board visitors but it won't be neglected.
