It was always obvious that Fury was looking for the best possible deal and wasn't going to give in to unreasonable demands.I've always believed that Fury would defeat Usyk in dominant fashion and I still stand by that. Fury will use his size to wear Usyk down and stop him in the middle to late rounds. I don't think Usyk is capable of seriously hurting him so Fury might also opt for a more reckless strategy and try to finish the fight early for a more emphatic victory.",

Don't know what is stipulated in the contract, if Fury loses against Ngannou, will the fight still push through?Hopefully, Ngannou will pull an upset. It's probably bigger than Iron Mike's first defeat. But I doubt Ngannou can do anything. If Fury won't give Ngannou a chance then he can easily use his footwork, use his long jabs, and clinch when cornered for the first 4 rounds. Ngannou will be gassed out afterward or even earlier.But finally, Big Belly signed the dot. He is probably convinced that Usyk's weakness is in the body. And I'm glad it is not happening in the UK where Fury insisted before. At least this is in neutral Saudi Arabia. Hopefully, this will happen in December although it is unlikely. Ngannou is a nuisance but Fury does not want to think of Usyk in advance so he may need a minimum of two months of training camp for Usyk after the Ngannou fight. And if Fury does not want to train hard during the Christmas season then this fight might happen from March onwards of next year.",

Even Usyk commented, \"I’m 100% sure that Tyson Fury will be victorious.\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/oleksandr-usyk-fury-ngannou-prediction-31260470I agree with Usyk's assessment of the fight Fury always comes to fight he never holds back It is an understatement to say that Fury will not throw all his strength this is not a wrestling show it is boxing and boxers are trained to throw haymakers, when a boxer is hurt he will not hold back, there's no way Fury will think that I have a fight coming this January and I have to conserve my energy and not to take risk lest I get injured and the fight will be cancel.When boxers are inside the ring they have to protect themselves at all times and they have to engage I expect Fury to give his best shot and knock out Ngannou coming from UsykQuote Tell me how could the guy with no experience in boxing beat a giant who’s been in boxing for 20 years? I also have the same question. It's a big embarrassment for Fury if Ngannou beats him in his game, boxing is his territory he knows everything on it and he knows how to pace himself 20 years is such a long experience for you to have a huge advantage for a guy who is just take up boxing and learning it in a few months",

And him talking about injuries with no exact date or location yet. Something tells me it won't happen. Maybe the Big Belly vs Ngannou fight is scripted? However, even without a script, it is still hard to imagine a 37-year-old who has been inactive for nearly 2 years beating a boxing champion in his debut. So Tyson Fury should be fine. My guess earlier is the fight with Usyk should happen before Christmas and New Year's or the fight will be moved to early March onwards.The expected date is December 23. If Usyk has an injury he rather demand a later date or he will regret losing to Fury with an injury. Just like when his friend Loma lost a close fight to Teofimo Lopez and was only operated after the fight.There's also a statement from Fury's camp that Usyk can file a case if he won't fight on December 23. It seems like the contract is signed but without a date and Big Belly is the one to decide it. I won't be surprised though if he tries to exploit Usyk again like giving a short notice to shorten the regular training camp.",
