If the outcome of the soccer match is accurately predicted hours before the match starts it is to simply place the same bet across many Bookies to avoid getting your account frozen or having issues with the bookie paying your winnings. Placing Millions of Dollars on a single bet can make some bookies suspect the gambler of money laundering or report to legal authorities to start investing the players source of livelihood",

Since the result is 100% percent accurate, you can't bet with such amount without getting your account frozen by the bookies ,if you are a not always gambling in millions of dollars. The only option is for you  to put your bet into many bookies,so that you won't be suspected and your winning will be assured. Apart from this,I don't think there is anyway out. The casinos don't support money laundering and cheating and has the right to seize such funds.",

You can't, even if you have like 10 person going to bet $100k on that separately, the bookies will have that suspicion because of the sudden turn of money specially if that winner is supposedly the underdogs.So it's better not to bet that huge amount, as the saying goes for us, don't be too greedy as it might back fire on you.And if you do the bet and you were able to successful put a bet on it, definitely there will be red flags and yes, you might not withdraw any of your winnings.",

I'd rather play it safe with the money I can afford to lose. That way, if the game turned around, my loss wouldn't be more than I could afford.People who frequently place million dollar bets succeed in convincing the casinos that they have a lot of money and maybe they have also gone through the KYC process to be allowed to use big money. We will not know about it for sure and can only suspect it. What's important, we know how to limit ourselves by not placing bets we can't afford.",

There's no way to do that without arousing suspicion for a big amount I've prefer to be safe win a small amount than be under investigation because of the huge amount I bet at the wrong time, there's an option to use different accounts, or hire people you trust to bet on different bookies, but still expect an investigation because there's a time involved, you can't bet very huge amount at the last minute, because that kind of bet is unusual.",

Bookmakers often limit the amount that a player can bet, particularly if they suspect that the player has inside knowledge or access to information that others do not. To avoid suspicion, one could try placing smaller bets across multiple bookmakers or using a betting exchange. However, it is important to note that engaging in such activities could be considered unethical or even illegal, and caution should always be exercised when it comes to betting or gambling.",

That's what I would do \"normally\".However... if I learned one thing about these bets, they are never 100% sure.   Lots of stuff can go wrong. Even if you win the bet, the bookie may cancel your bet because they also hear the same rumors.So when think about the other issues which can indirectly affect your bet, that 100% (wager everything) may easily fall down to 1%.",

If I would ever come into such a situation we should use all the money we can get our hands on to bet on the match. Step one, sell all stocks and crypto assets I own, Step 2 take out loans if that can be done in a few hours, otherwise just use all credit cards and go into maximum overdraft. Step 3 call friends and family to ask for money. If its really a 100% sure game than we should be betting the maximum. But I would not bet everything at one bookmaker, better to spread it out across all the major platforms.",

If part of your history is you are betting huge amounts of money at the last minute on your favorite bookies, you can pass detection, because you have your history as a reference, but if this is the first time that you are going to bet huge amount at that time, then don't do it, you will be a flag and you will be suspected of game fixing because it's very unusual, especially if the bookie is not used accepting millions of dollars bet, they may even decline it.",

Too good to be true but if that would be the scenario then i would bet all of my money spread all over the bookies on which i have an account as they also limit the bet of a certain match and i would not expect that all of my bets will be accepted.If this is a rigged match, bet only a small amount to avoid suspicions of the bookies, don't be too greedy as they say.
