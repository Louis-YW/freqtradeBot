I am hoping that he can institutionalize the same event and make it an annual one...making his country one of the most important locations for Bitcoin. I am even joking to my friends that in Bukele we have the Bitcoin President.",

You can see how there's no overlap between these 2 lists.The list you gave me is representative of nominal GDP per country, I was talking about GDP per capita.For example, India has a 2.75%, Denmark 0.71% who cares about that, Denmark has a GDP per capita of 68k, India of 2,515.

In addition, El Salvador, despite all the pessimists who insist that the Bitcoin project that failed in that country is still a pioneer who can help others with his experience.",

People are tending to forget that bitcoin's design is great for personal finances, the whole be your bank to the third party and other advantages are simply of no interest for a nation. What would all these poor counties have to gain from adopting, nothing on macro-level other than after a few years begging richer countries to buy their bitcoins at higher prices t make a profit. I find it amusing how the same enthusiasm happened when Salvador adopted it, now that we talk about Salvador facing a default later this year everyone says that Bitcoin or not Bitocin the country was anyhow doomed, then what will change with even poorer countries who's citizen can't afford even a 5sat/b transaction a day?",

No, not really. Bitcoins don't grow on trees and they wont simply become available to the population the day after they adopt it as legal tender. Sure, you can make an airdrop similarly to what was done in El Salvador. But Bitcoin won't land you a job at that auto dealership across the road if there are no jobs available, or no auto dealership at all due to the overall state of the country. One might argue that Bitcoin offers opportunities of remote work. Sure, that's true, but so does PayPal, WU, Skrill, freelancing sites, and many other ways to get paid in fiat. There is potential for Bitcoin in areas where people are unbanked, but not if they sleep in the dirt, use a rock for a pillow, and don't even have drinking water.
