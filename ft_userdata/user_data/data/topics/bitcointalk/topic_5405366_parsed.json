  "content": "Guests are non-registered visitorsI noticed that 1xbit is a gambling site that do not have good reputation among forum members on this forum, if I get it correctly, this is because 1xbit has scammed some members on this forum before in the past. Some people which are new accounts, maybe new account created by old users or maybe by new users, I do not know, but something came up my mind, that are guests safe on this forum? Are they not exposed to scam site like 1xbit?The reason I said that is because I noticed that any negative trust given to anyone, even by the strongest DT members can not be seen by guests that are visiting this forum, but signature and avatar can be seen. I said this because of 1xbit campaign, new accounts continue to post allegation scam post about 1xbit. Because the trust can no be seen by guests, I also think that any flag raised can not also be seen by anonymous users.Why are people that do not register on this forum not seeing the positive, neutral and negative trust of registered users on this forum when they are able to see their signature and avatar?",

But before doing that, I want to see whether these modifications can actually be made to work. If not, then I may go to the force-custom-lists solution, and that's incompatible with guests seeing any trust indicators.Things stand as they were at the time of the above comment, and perhaps it could be reviewed by now. Although people that navegate the forum without being logged-in may not really know how the Trust System works, seeing the Trust indicator values may be good enough to alert the outside reader (DT view). Displaying a visual cue to incentive the reader to create an account / log in could be interesting in addition, pointing to the need to read the feedback in order to properly asses the Trust ratings being viewed.",

It shows a banner on topics started by the flagged user for guests and for users with less than 7 days of login time.",

Not to mention, we don't have only gambling sites running there signatures here, we've got exchanges, mixers and others too. Hence, using a few to rule over the many that are doing it right won't be helping the reputable once.On every platform, there are always privileges enjoyed by registered users as opposed to visitors. This happens to be one of those rights and I think the forum have done the most in ensuring that, they've got a flag up on there thread as denoted in Poker Player's post hereQuote from: Poker Player on July 06, 2022, 09:46:04 AMBut they can see the flags.That aside, bktcointalk isn't the only place they might encounter these sites. There are a variety of other advertisements going on elsewhere and they've go no warnings up like th forum have done. I take Mycelium wallet for an example. I've seen 1xbit up a few times so, we can't write the forum down on the warnings. Curious visitors can still find the Ann thread while others could create an account to fully understand what's going on in the forum.",

Since we know that won't happen, anyone can click on those. After all, if someone is so reckless to click on some link that leads him to unknown betting site and he immediately deposits money without checking whether that site is legit (all you have to find out that is to google \"is 1xbit scam?\"), he will lose the money at some other place, even if he is protected here on bitcointalk.With that being said, I see no harm if trust scores were visible to guests.",

There are internal feuds, and sometimes feedback that's not agreed upon by the majority of the DefaultTrust, the issue with guests is they might not know the dynamics or even how the trust system works. So, they'll take that as bitcointalk itself not trusting the users, which isn't the case. There's too much subjectivity when it comes to trust, to force that on guests, who don't have any knowledge of the system. While, I think it's great to look after as much users as possible, whether they're registered or not, I think at the very least a disclaimer would have to be put in place, due to the mentioned reasons above.",
