And if they are legit how do users contact them to get the verification to their crypto site?",

It appears that online casinos seeking eGaming licenses from various regulators, including Curacao, must contact a company called Certria for assistance. Upon further investigation, it seems that Certria serves as a middleman to help online casinos obtain their licenses from Curacao. This raises a question: does this mean that online casinos are unable to communicate directly with these regulators?Additionally, based on @Hispo's reply, it's possible that Antillephone NV 8048/JAZ included Certria in the footer of their validator site for this reason.Quote from: https://www.whereslots.com/licences/curacao-gambling-regulators/antillephone-nv-8048-jaz/Antillephone NV 8048/JAZ Contact DetailsAddress: E-Commerce Park N.V, E-Zone Vredenberg, Curacao – CaribbeanPhone: +5999 4338808Email: certria@gaminglicenses.com or info@e-commercepark.comWebsite: http://www.e-commercepark.com",

There are many websites and forums dedicated to online gambling that provide information and feedback from other players about their experiences with different online casinos and validators. Legitimate online casinos and validators should have clear terms and conditions, as well as secure payment methods and customer support channels and I think they have this.For further knowledge about Curacao Antillephone (N.V. 8048/JAZ) --read these articles below.

The changes put forward by the Curacao government include:The establishment of the Curacao Gaming Authority to oversee all licensing and gaming operations;The issuance of B2C licenses and B2B licenses for operators;Licensing fees start at EUR 4000 for an application, EUR 12,000 a year once approved, and EUR 250 per month for each URL;At least three employees were hired into key positions and located on the island;Enhanced monitoring and anti-money laundering controls.https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2023/01/26/65856-changes-to-the-curacao-gambling-regime-and-what-it-means-for-youhttps://curacaogaming.info/news.html",

And if they are legit how do users contact them to get the verification to their crypto site?It seems your, have to be really careful and careful to contact a license based in Curacao, if you believe Antillephone is one of the official licenses in Curacao, I'm a little confused whether which one is official and which is not official.I see there are several Fake Curacao license websites, like the quote below.QuoteI've came across what I strongly suspect are fake Curacao licenses, hosted on websites that are meant to provide legitimacy to rogue casinos. For example, validator dot antillephones dot org is one such website, as it seems to only provide licenses to rogue casinos and the actual Antillephone NV website is at antillephone dot com. Another fake website is at validator dot curacao-e-gaming dot com, and validator dot e-gaminglicense dot com is another one, as is validator dot curacaogamings dot com. Validator-antillephone dot com, validator dot curacao-egaming dot eu and validator-curacao-gaming dot com are the incompetent versions of the fakes, as when you go on the three websites (without anything after the URL) they send you to a fake validation page for a casino (which is different for each of them) they're presumably linked to.And elsewhere I also saw some Casinos with fake licenseQuoteI frequently checking your site for new casinos and today I found an casino with fake license https://casino.guru/richprize-casino-review their license lead to https://validator.antillephone.org/validate/richprize.com-939f8429-325f-4ff1-b73e-e8868d12b9e4 while real Curaçao site is on .com domain https://validator.antillephone.com/. I pretty experienced gambler so I noticed it but others might not.Some other gambling related sites states that this casino have real curaçao license. well this is just sad 🙁From some of the information I see, you really have to find a casino that uses the official Antillephone license from curaçao, so you don't get fooled.",

And you cant because you are gonna lose much money in lawyers than the money scameed by them.

So it's basically a service provider that helps businesses get licenses in different jurisdictions to operate their business.Stake, the most famous crypto casino and sportsbook of the present, also used the services of Certria as it seems. You can find two logos in the footer at stake.com which are license validations, one is for Certria and the other one is for Antillephone. They probably are legit, otherwise a casino as big as Stake wouldn't be using them for their licensing needs.",

For example, a license obtained on Man Island can be checked simply by going to the government's website, where all gambling companies and online casino sites are listed in the \"License holders\" section.",

It's not an easy thing to hide such a big thing in times like today where even smaller news gets spread so fast.Even if they don't take people's money by falsifying information or cheating, I wonder what they would do with KYC documents that they collect if they are actually not licensed and since an unlicensed casino doesn't really require verification, they probably will just resell the documents for money to a third-party.",
