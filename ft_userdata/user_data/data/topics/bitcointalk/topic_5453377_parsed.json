So best to avoid investing what you are not willing to gamble with,  in fact, don't take meme coins as investments rather take them as just gamble and stake only what you can afford to do away with, be hard the worst experience with hype and shitcoins and now we are educated enough not to ever take them seriously.",

Many projects have followed this form to give % airdrops to the community, or the easy meme listing on cex does not need many binding criteria, sometimes just money is enough to push any silly project what a fool. And the truth is that memes born as a joke don't have the criteria for long-term development, and anonymous dev can scam and rugpull at any time. So the meme environment I've seen so far from projects big or small, they are all entertaining and not sustainable, short-term fomo but huge profits make many people gradually get into the game or multi-level form hiding under the crypto investment environment, and newcomers are always attracted to greed and will learn from these.",

Shitcoins and memecoins are nothing but pump-and-dump schemes orchestrated by developers looking to scam people and make a quick buck. Never believe their promises or get swayed by FOMO. But not every altcoin is a scam. There are legitimate projects with solid fundamentals and long-term goals. I prefer sticking to reputable cryptos with proven track records.",

Isn't it better to advice people just to stay the hell out of this mess? Since we agree that they are created to scam people for money, they have no utility and only a \"funny\" name, is there any technical or fundamental indicator that can predict when the project developers will get bored and throw away all the coins doing 90% dump?The whole thing is therefore nothing more than a casino which, unlike a roulette, has no known winning probability or house edge. It is therefore much better to go to the casino and bet on 00 all your money. I will say more. by participating in this scam, we are only adding fuel to the fire. We make the attention of the community and investors not focus on new, innovative, groundbreaking projects, but on scams that do not bring anything new to crypto space.

You can definitely make good money on alts but you are far more likely to lose money than if you buy bitcoin or ethereum.I think it’s OK to buy alts & tokens but don’t expect them to be a long term, sophisticated investment. Get in & get out when you make profit if you’re able too. Most alts have no utility & no future, it’s a short term smash & grab. Get in & get out.",

Many know the risk but choose to ignore it since what came out on their mind us to gain profit. They didn't mind those scamming since they are aware that this scenario happens. This is one of few reason why this scam devs became successful since there are atill grady people who want to test out their luck and and try to place a bet to test out if they could able to earn huge money for joining it.There's huge risk investing on altcoin that's why we need to be more vigilant and suspicious on anything what we do especially when dealing some money yo anyone.",

Check on the purpose and utility of the coin. Research on the credibility of the development team and their background, how well do they do know the goal of the project etc. The market demand and potential growth of the coin. Check also the risks involved and your financial situation. We should always remember to do your own research and make informed decision before investing in any kind of crypto currency to avoid such losses.",
