In this version of \"Olympic games\", performance-enhancement drugs that are usually prohibited to be used by the athletes competing in the Olympic Games will be allowed to be used. the president of \"the Enhanced Games\" believes that this competition could unlock the athlete's true potential and will obliterate all the world record that has been set in the Olympic games. from what I have read in an article, they are planning on launching this event next year in December.now, the reason why I post this here is because since a lot of sports bettors here love sports I am curious about what you guys think about it and whether this would be a new sporting event that will be enjoyed by sports betting enthusiasts.personally, as a person who likes sports, I am curious about what this new sporting event that allows the usage of performance-enhancement drugs could lead to.the video I stumbled uponhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h49A-2Zv8dAsome articles about the topichttps://apnews.com/article/australia-olympics-enhanced-games-doping-24462bcf8f1f97125a8234bea5723ff3https://dotesports.com/general/news/the-enhanced-olympics-where-drugs-are-welcome-sounds-like-its-from-a-dystopian-video-gamehttps://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/30/the-enhanced-games-a-drugs-olympics-where-cheaters-can-prosper",

I doubt world record will acknowledge a milestone achievement made by someone under the influence of synthetic strength booster. This kind of games is not healthy and promotes sports that will have a side effect on human body. I’m afraid that in worst case scenario, There might be some casualty here since people will do anything just to win even if they will take more drugs just get more strength without considering the risk to the body.Very intriguing announcement but will they be acknowledge?",

This is an enhanced drug promotion Olympics and most probably the ones who use Meth are gonna be the ones winning. It's not about agility and skills but about what drugs can do for you.Aron Desouza is a funny guy. He has a good point that its anti-science to not allow performance-enhance drugs. I don't see anything wrong with using it but not in sports competitions.If you are a Witcher, I guess you can take as many enhanced drugs and go slay monsters.",

The winner will win based on the influence of drugs and not based on strength,this is bring harm on sport because the young generation will think that it is the right thing to do. I will also say that it is only another means of promoting hard drugs which has negative impact to the society. I will love to watch such games and to also see who will end up being the winner in various games,if he was motivated by any drugs. It will be lovely if Colombia will be the host.",

By doing so, we can ensure that the Olympic Games and other sporting events continue to inspire and bring people together in a positive and healthy way!!!sports ethics should be the fundamental benchmark for all participants in sports. When there is respect for rules and ethical values, a fair and healthy balance in competition is achieved, and the spirit of fairness and mutual respect among athletes is enhanced. Therefore, we all should strive to preserve the integrity of sports and promote sports ethics in all aspects of sporting life.",

Just some weeks ago we read about the Sex Olympics now this? Incredible. Soon we would have the Olympics that is AI assisted, or cyborg. The organizers should be stopped. There is nothing good about using enhancement drugs aside from the fact that it gives an athlete an unfair advantage, there is also the health aspect. Power lifters and body builders who use them have been know to suffer from several health conditions. Besides how do we judge that these athletes actually did give their best. On the other side, we may just be ready to have a proliferation of enhancement drugs in the market. They should be stopped.",

From what I know about GWR all the records I have heard or seen has been based on the performer natural ability and that's what's will make Olympic games top this new one.The only thing I expect from this new drug enhanced games is fun, due to the fact that participants will no longer be working based on their sheer natural strengths then we should expect more activities from them.",

And so the organisers of this are doing the opposite and permitting it?When seen a lot of sports though, supposedly to topple another one and yet no one has succeeded. So I think this will be the same, there is hype in the beginning, and then it will jus die naturally as no one will support this cheaters.",

The essence of sports lies in the display of ability, talent, and the relentless pursuit of excellence, rather than relying solely on extraordinary physical capabilities obtained through doping. The dedication and efforts of countless athletes and coaches could be undermined, causing the sport to lose its inherent beauty and values. But on my own I think doping poses serious health risks and can lead to addiction, further compromising the well-being of individuals involved. It is risky to prioritize fair competition and uphold the integrity of sports to maintain their true essence and promote a healthy environment for athletes.",

Cause from all indications the use of drugs can only make anyone not to believe himself to achieve something great without the use of drugs to achieve it. This is immoral and could create a drug addictive mindset to teenagers that would be using these kind of games, this just another indirect way of promoting drugs and it should be fiercely condemned.",

I just wonder if this will give rise to some companies trying to develop better-performing drugs or something, I'm not really familiar with what they use to dope though so things may have already been what I imagine it to be, but hey, the sky's the limit. I highly doubt this would be allowed in the global stage, or released to it imo. It may only be a tournament that allows doped users, but in the chances that they may feat a world record made by people who trained for their entire lives, just because of a few tablets, it kind of leaves a bad taste, both to the one who made the record and those who watched him/her.",

Help might be a term worth debating here. Powered is different from helped. If I'm asked, I won't favor such league. Matches under such rules might end up a battle of pharmaceutical or supplement companies. Athletes might not anymore compete out of their human abilities honed and perfected more or less naturally and with factors such as discipline, wisdom, training strategies, and so on. There must be an ethical side of this as matches might end up simply battles of new experiments or new drug concoctions, and the bodies of the athletes become mere tools for these.
