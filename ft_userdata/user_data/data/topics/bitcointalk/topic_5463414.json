So I am fairly comfortable dealing with people here.On this site if I trust the person I send up front. The purchase I made 2 days ago was for two 5 oz bars and one 10 oz bar. I sent up front as I trust the seller.If the person is newer I tell them send to me first. As I have done over $100,000 in sales buys and escrows here. I do not know reddit that well.",
