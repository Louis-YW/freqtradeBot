With Bitcoin, proof you need is a private key to sign a message, sign a transaction, sweep a wallet, that's all you need as proof of ownership.

You don't know when you will pass away and when your children will inherit it from you. Meanwhile, that exchange can be seized by government, can be hacked and file a bankruptcy or can make a scam exit.If those fiascos happen, no way for your children to get those bitcoins.",

If you leave your children bitcoin, you could just leave the information with your lawyer, and they are bound by law to protect it, and find some super rich lawyer which would not care about stealing your money, and they could just give it to your children when they die, and then your children could cash it out if they want to.However, \"most\" of the time when parents die their children are already 30-40-50 years old, sure there are unfortunate cases where parents die when their children is just a child, but aside from those, it would be smarter to give your kids your wealth when they are younger so they could have a good life.",

We can prepare a legacy about the existence of bitcoin that we prepare for our children and explain in more detail what we have not explained to our children. I think that's enough because we have taught them basic lessons about using bitcoin.",

It is very bad though. I would advise as a father, do well to tell that child of yours dear to you of the whereabouts of your assets so they could keep track of it based on your written instructions.",

Blood is thicker than water no matter what kind of trust you gave to anyone reputable as long its involve huge amount of money, you cant trust them. At least with our family members they can be trusted enough not to double cross us especially if we are talking about big inheritance and a skeptical and sensitive case like cryptocurrencies.",

I heard you mentioning lawyers, I do not take such sensitive situations as regards my financial standing with respect to my Crypto assets to Lawyers as they have  ways to get at you. I am always very alert of one requesting for my financial details when you are not in any way related to me or my heir. I find that too sensitive to disclose to anyone not to talk of revealing my passphrase or private keys to anyone.",

Who knows, maybe by the time someone is able to access the funds, Bitcoin is made worthless by quantum computing. Or maybe something major happens that disrupts the connections of people all over the world to each other. Or, simpler, there's a family emergency and money could really help to solve it, if only it wasn't locked at that point and unavailable to everyone who might want to use it.So IMO, it's better to trust people that they won't use the money unless they have to or not give them access at all if you can't trust them with that.",
