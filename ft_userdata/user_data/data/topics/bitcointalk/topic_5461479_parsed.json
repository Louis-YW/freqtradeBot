So when sending was there a transaction ID if there is then you can post it here for members to look into it for you. Also if the wallet/app has a private key then you can import them on any multi currency wallet supported by the wallet or app, maybe you should try trustwallet",

      "body": "If it is the following provider for the Lunu wallet (https://wallet.lunu.io/) then in one of the listed features the Lunu wallet doesn't appear to be custodial as it seems to provide mnemonic words for wallet backup and recovery. No first hand experience though herewith!I would assume that Lunu didn't reinvent the wheel and used BIP-39 recovery words for their wallet. Do you have those recovery words of your Lunu wallet? If yes, there's some chances to restore the Lunu wallet in another more decent and better known software wallet like Electrum or Sparrow.Some more details would be nice, too. From which wallet or exchange did you send the coins to a receive address of your Lunu wallet? Can you describe in more detail how you got your receive address for your Lunu wallet? When you created the transaction to your Lunu wallet, did you thoroughly check that the transfer destination address is actually correct and unaltered?Did you check with some blockchain explorer like https://bitcoinexplorer.org or https://mempool.space that your transaction still exists? Maybe it's stuck in mempools due to too low transfer fee?I don't want to encourage you to disclose private details of your transaction, but if you feel overwhelmed or have no clue what we're talking about, you might consider to make your destination address and/or the transaction id of your transfer public. Think twice before you do that, it's fine if you don't want to. Such a disclosure can harm your financial privacy.Never make your recovery words public or enter them on an online site or handle private keys and recovery words on an online computer with questionable security status.",

The only one that does not require our participation (as we don't have access to your private data) is to find a wallet that allows you to import a private key in raw format, import the wallet key there and then transfer wherever you want. Here are some of them:Bitcoin Core (formerly known as Bitcoin-QT): The official Bitcoin wallet. You can import the private key in raw format using the importprivkey command in the wallet console.Electrum: This is a popular lightweight bitcoin wallet. You can import a private key in raw format by selecting the \"Import private key\" option from the \"Find\" menu or using the importprivkey command in the wallet console. Kind regardsSo i have to export my wallet in raw format but i can't find that raw format key anywhere only the 24 word recovery seed, and when i go to bitcoin core or electrum i can import my account bit its emptyHope someone has any idea on this issue, the 2 emails below tells me it is possible to get my btc restored:Dear Customer,Once you follow the instructions mentioned above you will be able to send the amount back to your wallet.Kindly note that we do not possess the amount you transferred.Kind Regards.Dear Customer,The problem is that you have used a decommissioned app, as you mentioned in the beginning of our conversation.We never got the amount you have transferred.We would like to advise you to export the raw key with your Lunu wallet konfigurations to get a possibility to forward your amount back to your personal wallet.Kind regards",

      "body": "Did you transfer and type \"d492948c19e7f34eddf7382a37f958bff0fdcgaedc3e556effd8b6920ff98600\" manually by hand? The 'g' is rather a '9' instead.For recovery or experiments with \"naked\" private keys you need a secure and expendable/wipeable environment. If you're not experienced with that, I don't want to be responsible that your keys might leak into wrong hands.You can boot TAILS from a thumbdrive or similar (TAILS has Electrum in an older version installed and you can use that version for a wallet recovery with ease).Be careful to cut internet connectivity when appropriate (easy with TAILS). Your recovery words should not be used/entered on a digital device that is online. Don't \"massage\" your private keys while online. Period!I assume Lunu wallet used BIP-39 compatible recovery words and nothing in addition fancy that's not documented. Let's hope for the best.Your receive address in Lunu was a native segwit address, thus I assume a standard native segwit derivation path of m/84'/0'/0' Boot TAILS, don't open a connection with Tor network, TAILS should stay offline for now (until later). Start Electrum and create new wallet, give it some name, doesn't matter, default is OK. Click Next. \"What kind of wallet do you want to create?\" --> choose \"Standard wallet\", click Next. Choose \"I already have a seed\", click Next. Click on \"Options\" and select \"BIP39 seed\", click OK to close \"Options\" dialog. Enter your 24 recovery words in the box where they belong in, with the last word it should be displayed: BIP39 (checksum: ok)If not ok, then check for any errors. If ok, click Next. On screen \"Script type and Derivation path\" native segwit (p2wpkh) should be selected by default and at the bottom line it should read m/84h/0h/0h or m/84'/0'/0' (both are equivalent, my more current Electrum suggests m/84h/0h/0h), click Next.[If you don't get your wallet addresses, you can repeat above steps with a new wallet file and click on the button on this screen \"Detect Existing Accounts\" and Electrum will try hard to find reasonable derivation paths and different account indexes while searching for addresses with transactions. For this to work you need to establish a Tor connection and internet access via Tor before you click on that detection button, otherwise it won't work to detect anything)] if you were offline until here, now is the time to establish a Tor connection in TAILS, you will need it for Electrum to sync your address balances. set a wallet password and document it on paper or leave it blank (only temporarily), click Next.If Lunu was all standard, your wallet should now be restored in Electrum. There are some edge cases possible for this to fail, but I'm not going to discuss them unless an empty wallet emerges.If above doesn't work and you need to import raw (hex?) private keys, they would need to be in compressed WIF format for a native segwit wallet. You can convert raw hex private keys into WIF format e.g. with offline version of bitaddress.org downloaded and verified from the Github page https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org.(Beware of malicious copycat sites and typo-domains of https://bitaddress.org, the \"original\" is safe to my knowledge and audit.)Go offline before you handle private keys! On page \"Wallet Details\" you can enter hex raw private keys and have compressed WIF representation displayed below on the right side (left is the uncompressed WIF private key representation).E.g. the private key in hex 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 converts to WIF KwDiBf89QgGbjEhKnhXJuH7LrciVrZi3qYjgd9M7rFU73sVHnoWn (compressed) -- the native segwit public address of this key has 26 transactions in the past; the uncompressed key's p2pkh address more than 1400! Some people are crazy, indeed.You can import that private key in Electrum as p2wpkh:KwDiBf89QgGbjEhKnhXJuH7LrciVrZi3qYjgd9M7rFU73sVHnoWn(quick steps: create new wallet, import private keys, enter with p2wpkh: prefix for native segwit addresses)If you're unsure or don't understand a step, better ask than do something less smart.",

Do you mind to describe a little more in details what finally helped you?I assume you were able to export your private key in WIF format and not in raw HEX format which would require an additional conversion step to import the key into Electrum.The Electrum private key import dialog actually explains the required key prefixes for specific address types:Code:WIF keys are typed in Electrum, based on script type.A few examples:p2pkh:KxZcY47uGp9a...        -> 1DckmggQM...p2wpkh-p2sh:KxZcY47uGp9a...  -> 3NhNeZQXF...p2wpkh:KxZcY47uGp9a...       -> bc1q3fjfk...And p2pkh:5HpHagT65TZ... is possible for uncompressed private keys in WIF format giving you uncompressed legacy public address.",
