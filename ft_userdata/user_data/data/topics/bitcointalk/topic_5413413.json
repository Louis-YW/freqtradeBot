Could it be that it's taking a REALLY long time to process blocks and until there is a long amount of time between blocks it just can't keep up?Same with bandwidth, blocks are only a couple of megs but if you are on a slow connection with another PC on the network streaming netflix & youtube....The clock being off should not matter, unless it's REALLY off. I have seen some odd behavior when that happens.-Dave",
