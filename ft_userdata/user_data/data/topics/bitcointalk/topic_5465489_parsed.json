What is the procedure for purchasing and selling Bitcoin, and are there any crucial elements to take into account before beginning?You can buy Bitcoin through centralized or decentralized platforms. You have to study how these platforms operate to check the one that suits you. If you don't care much about your privacy and you can risk keeping your funds in the custody of a third party, you can choose exchanges. But it is risky since they are unreliable. But if you are not comfortable with KYCs and you want to have total control of your funds, the best option will be decentralized platforms that promote P2P such as bisq.Quote3. Why is using Bitcoin better than using conventional currencies?Bitcoin is better because it is Decentralized: It is not issued or controlled by the government or organization. So it cannot be easily manipulated by any government.Promotes privacy: It can hide the identity of an individual because it is pseudonymous. Transactions can only be traced to wallets or addresses but your identity cannot be known if you use a non-custodian wallet or use exchanges that don't require KYC. Using Mixers can also promote your privacy.Serves as a hedge against inflation: Bitcoin has proved that it can help individuals protect their finances from the loss of value of local currency during inflation. Grants unlimited access to funds: Money kept in banks can be seized by banks or government. However, using Bitcoin through a non-custodian wallet will give you unlimited access to your money.Competitive transaction fees: Bitcoin transaction fees can be cheaper and more reliable than fiat transactions. Cannot be counterfeited: Although we have some altcoins that want to duplicate bitcoin such effort ended in futility. Fiat can be faked easily but it is not easy to counterfeit bitcoin. QuoteMany thanks to all of you for your explanation.You need to do your research before engaging in trading for the reason that there are other important things you need to learn. You need to learn how to secure your wallet against hacks or scams. Just make sure you do your research.",

Electerum and BlueWallet, among many others, are recommended to us as they are open source and self-custodial wallets (meaning you have full control over whatever you send in your wallet).Thirdly, you have to make a choice of how you will want to acquire the bitcoin: DEX P2P, as they are highly recommended; DEX like Bisq, HodlHodl, and Agoradex. On this exchange, you will now discuss how you want to make payment to the seller and reach an agreement. Fourthly, you need to learn how to secure your wallet, keep your wallet key safe, don't share it, and don't lose it, because if they are misplaced, you lose your coins.",

Then after that, OP can immediately buy bitcoins on the spot wallet. Maybe in short like that. And for the rules, every exchange always has different rules, of course, so the Op only needs to read the rules first so he can understand better.> At the moment I also don't understand about bitcoin mining, because I only focus on trading and investing. But for security matters, if the OP leads to asset security, the OP only needs to save the bitcoin assets that the OP has purchased from the exchange, into a non-custodial wallet. Because if the OP stores his assets in a Custodian wallet like on an exchange, it is very risky.> For a comparison of bitcoin and fiat currency. I think both currencies have their respective advantages. And the advantages of bitcoin lie in its limited supply, and having a decentralized system.",

After purchasing bitcoin don't keep funds on the exchange, if you do, it means they have control of the coin. Transfer your bitcoin to a wallet that issues private keys, which authorizes you ownership of the coin. Mining security is maintained in different ways, such as digital signatures that uses ECDSA for validating transactions, chain work the difficulty or hashes required to mine a block, consensus rules that guides what rule miners should follow to mine a block etc. These factors help to keep the mining process secure from attacks. A good reason why using bitcoin over other conventional currencies is that, maintaining the bitcoin network doesn't require any external help, every update happens within the bitcoin developers, miners and users. No other charges aside transaction fees.",

What is the procedure for purchasing and selling Bitcoin, and are there any crucial elements to take into account before beginning?You use use Cex to buy your bitcoin, since it is very easy and since it is your first time. Create an account with Binance or Kucoin. Make sure you pass through the KYC verification and after that,you use go to buy bitcoin through P2P. You will see some p2p merchants, look for the one that has higher transaction than the others because it means that he is to be trusted but not 100%. There will be a payment option,the amount of bitcoin that you want  in your local currency and send the money to the merchants account. When done, you will have to call the merchant to release your coins. Same with when you want to sell,instead of buying this time you use p2p to sell. When you are selling,don't release the crypto,until you have confirmed the money in your account so that you don't get scam because it is an exchange doesn't mean that there are no scammers. If you care about your privacy that much, you should use DEx p2p.Quote from: BoiCrypto on September 03, 2023, 10:12:54 AM3.

Why is using Bitcoin better than using conventional currencies?Many thanks to all of you for your explanation.Good to see people like you who want to learn about Bitcoin. 1. You can buy or sell Bitcoin on both centralized and decentralized exchanges but for beginners the preferred way to buy or sell Bitcoin is via a centralized exchange. Buying and selling your coins on centralized exchange like Binance is much easier and safe and if you are a type of person who want to buy Bitcoin and hold it for long term then the best option for you is to withdraw your coins from that centralized exchange to your own personal wallet. You need a separate pc or laptop to create that personal wallet and once you receive your Bitcoin in that wallet you should disconnect that pc or laptop from internet so that your wallet will become a cold wallet and your coins will be safe from hackers. I recommend you to download an open-source wallet like Electrum and try to make a wallet with 24 word seed phrase and save your seed phrase and private key on a USB drive as well on an external SSD drive. You should never connect that SSD drive or USB flash drive on a pc or laptop that's connected to internet and also don't allow anyone else to access your USB flash drive or SSD drive.2. Bitcoin mining functions when a miner tries to solve a very complex mathematical problems by using a specialized ASIC mining hardware like Antminer S19 Pro or other ASIC mining equipment that's entirely created to solve those complex mathematical problems which is required for Bitcoin mining. The miner then run that mining hardware in cluster form and allow their hardware to work 24/7 and after days to weeks the miner will find Bitcoin rewards when he/she validates a block . A block currently contain 6.25 Bitcoin and the miners with more hash power can mine those blocks easily depending on the amount of hash power they have. Most of the time the miners don't follow the traditional route of solo mining and in that case they join mining pools where the hash power of the whole pool is used to solve those mathematical problems together. In simple words Bitcoin mining is the PoW (Proof of Work) process to find free Bitcoin by utilizing your electricity energy resources that mining equipment require in order to run and once the mathematical problem is solved the miners get incentivized with Bitcoin.3. Bitcoin is better than conventional currencies because it's totally virtual in nature and no one has any control over it. The Bitcoin is totally decentralized and that makes it a unique currency in the world because no government or centralized authority is controlling it and it's total volume is limited to just 21 million Bitcoin. The number is fixed and no one in the world is able to change that number. Although, you aren't running away from centralized authorities when purchasing Bitcoin through a centralized exchange but if you can purchase Bitcoin from a decentralized exchange then you're truly using it's decentralization power.",

The two currencies have their utility and value, BTC is decentralized money that is censorship resistant and also permissionless, but the reason why a lot of people choose it over fiat is that it is also a volatile asset that they can get revenue from. Fiat is centralized and issued by the government, it is also the currency that is mostly used all over the world, too many people don't actually want to spend their BTC because of future profit.",

Why is using Bitcoin better than using conventional currencies?It depends on why you want to use Bitcoin in the first place. If you want to use it for making payments there are other better options as well but they will not match the volume, security, and decentralization of bitcoin. If you want to hold it as a store of wealth then I want you to look at the historical chat of Bitcoin. A shorter timeframe can frighten you but a longer time will put a smile on your face. Since its launch, it only raised in value.",

Of course, there are many factors you need to know before starting, such as Bitcoin's complete chart history, Bitcoin halving and price fluctuations, bull seasons and bear seasons, all of which are very important to know.

Why is using Bitcoin better than using conventional currencies?Many thanks to all of you for your explanation.In my opinion, Bitcoin is better than traditional currencies because it is not controlled by anyone, whereas traditional currencies are controlled by central banks. Traditional currency you have to keep in your bank account, while Bitcoin you can store in your digital wallet. The advantage of Bitcoin is that no one can check your wallet, its location and the Bitcoins in it. Whereas in conventional currency, the  bank has your complete record  . Traditional currency is a physical currency for which you need a bank to transact, while Bitcoin is a digital currency that you can transact anytime anywhere with your password.",

It's better in the sense that you know the transaction will finalize, no matter what, that the cost is pretty transparent (it isn't determined by a bank monopoly), that it can't be confiscated without your permission, that it's always accessible as long as you're Internet connected, and that it can't be devaluated by arbitrarily printing more.",
