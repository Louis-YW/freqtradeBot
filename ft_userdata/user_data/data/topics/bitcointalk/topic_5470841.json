It's not necessarily Halving is expecting to bull market afterward, because market condition today is different from previous halving. The world is in a condition of war, where we never met it before. All big country like the US and Europe just focus their economies on war, they prepare to cash just to meet what they need into the war. The world is not in good condition, the economy is in a state of chaos, and some observers say That the big country's economy will experience many problems. the big country will run out of cash for war costs. they prefer to cash than bitcoin.So, you have to add a link to how to manage your psychology on the crash market.",

Anyway, OP, shouldn't newbies be concerned first about the whats and the whys and the hows of Bitcoin rather than about \"maximiz[ing] their opportunity in next bull run\"? For me, a newbie is one who is still learning the basics of Bitcoin. Making money out of Bitcoin is probably best for those who have gone past the newbie stage.",

That's not possible if you ask that information for free since there's a lot of time needed to take before people will get all information you wanted. But if you can pay someone to do the job for you then provably you can get those compilation of threads of all bitcoin discussion. But if you can't afford to do it then settle up some little information shared by some generous users and also you can search it on this forum since all of that they is available if you try to seek information about that.I don't want to be rude for saying that but I want those newbie to seek and be resourceful since doing this can help them in future since if they rely on the information feed by people then you or they might get few knowledge and that is not really helpful to anyone.",

Thanks for sharing this Ratimov thread, it's really an encyclopedia, and merits the name. Just a glance into it and I've seen a lot of interesting bitcoin related topics that are worth looking into, to gain more knowledge. Aside from this encyclopedia, another fast and easy way for a newbie to Learn and increase knowledge of any bitcoin related issues, including halving and ATH is just to start a topic on the specific area where they need help. They'd be surprised at how fast more experienced members are willing to answer their question from different perspectives, and they will have enough knowledge and information to make their decisions. I'm talking from experience, because the only thing I knew about bitcoin before joining this forum was that the coin is traded like forex, nothing more. This bitcointalk forum is like an interactive institution where you learn about bitcoin and other related topics for free, so a newbie only need to search and ask questions about any bitcoin information, and answers will be pouring in.",
