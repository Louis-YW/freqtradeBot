You are selling your identity for 50$ yet you are not thinking on how to secure first the payment before you will do the job.I really believe that there is something wrong on this transaction since a user will not delete the service offer thread if he didn't do anything wrong. He should just lock it if he is not interested anymore while deleting it only shows that he is deleting evidence. OP shoild cooperate to help other user to avoid this kind of transactions.Yoya's trust history is also not that good maybe they shouldn't have removed the negative trust when he payed what he owed. Also he can sell those verified accounts to shady people since its not tied to his identity. I dont know why OP agreed to this deal he can face possible legal prosecution in the future.",

Now that you know what is prohibited in your country, then you yourself will refrain from taking that service. By doing this, you will not have to face major problems in the future. Because what is prohibited in your country, maybe legal in another country. And it's important to use escrow while doing any kind of transaction so you can avoid getting scammed.",
