  "content": "Hey all! I'm rather new to cryptocurrency after going down a little rabbit hole while I was in summer vacation from teaching  . Now I've started getting obsessed with it and the opportunities it can provide for financial freedom for so many people around the world. As someone in the US who has always felt pretty victimized by the financial system, I think there are so many ways Bitcoin can help people right here in the US as well as abroad. I'm looking for some good resources to learn about crypto, different laws and regulations, and trading. What would you all suggest tk begin with? Preferably something related to US specifically.Thanks so much!!",

      "body": "Hi, welcome to the forum and in the Bitcoin world too. I'm glad that there are still people who want to learn about Bitcoin despite what happened in the prices recently.I think what you need to know for now is the regulation of the United States of America on cryptocurrency, I found some articles on google.Try to look at this: Virtual currency law in the United StatesCryptocurrency Regulations in the United StatesIs Bitcoin Legal in the United States?Another thing is you can use this forum to learn too or ask some questions. Use the search box of the forum before asking because maybe there's already a thread about your concern else you can create a thread or ask for existing threads.",

However, when it comes to anything regarding legal advice, I'd recommend either speaking to a professional or going directly to your governments website which will document that legalities of cryptocurrencies in your country. Simply because there's a varying level of laws depending on the country you're from. Obviously, being in the US simplifies that a little bit as they have extensive coverage of cryptocurrencies, but also because they dominate the news, so almost every search you do on Google will apply to you. However, still states also differ I believe, and you should probably consider taking a look at your state government website also.",

      "body": "Thanks for your responses everyone! I am really looking forward to what I can learn from everyone here and becoming more of a global citizen. The cost of living where I live is nuts and I think as a small fish, crypto can give me an opportunity to have a piece of the pie so to speak.  Despite the crash in prices lately, I actually think now is one of the better times to get into BTC. I think the crash is a response to the global economy (despite how much we want crypto to be separate from centralized finance I don't think it ever will be) and that it will boom even higher than it was eventually. I also have a free consult with a lawyer tomorrow to discuss state laws and regulations. It seems that the US federal government has kind of left it up to the states for now with regulations. I think I am rather lucky though because I believe Colorado where I live has some rather progressive laws compared to other US states",

The cost of living is high is virtually every place in the world right now, and bitcoin cannot help with that, you may want to trade with bitcoin to make profit but it is not that easy, you might be screwed and be in a worse financial state prior to when you started trading, especially for you that is just a beginner. You are correct that bitcoin will boom eventually, but bitcoin is money, it is a currency, so to have it, you either buy it, or work for it.If you want to speculate with bitcoin, then you can use dca method to buy slowly, do not buy more than what you can afford to lose, and do not also think that bitcoin can solve this global economic crisis, so the fomo wouldn't lead you to bad choices.",

I do agree that the cost of living is high pretty much everywhere around the world. The conflict in Eastern Europe didn't really help with that among many other global problems like the pandemic. In the U.S., comparatively where I live the average cost of a single family home is around 500-600k USD whereas where my parents live the cost of a single family home is like 200-400K USD. It's more complex than that obviously but I live in a resort area so it just makes things worse. I already have a full-time career, and am not trying to \"get rich quick\" so to speak. I really think tokens will be used as currency in the future worldwide and want to step into the space now as opposed to being forced to later in my life anyways. I think they are also a reflection of unhappiness people have with broken financial institutions. Will they fix the broken financial system? Not at all, they will probably just develop to become something that looks similar to our current system but may function differently.As far as the global economic crisis, it will eventually swing back around. I guess it's just more of a question of when and how. In the meantime, I feel like I should learn about tokens, what they can do for people, and how they have successfully inserted themselves into the global economy so far. They're clearly not going to be going away anytime soon.",

Also not having a get quick rich mentality is key to becoming a loyal Bitcoiner. Everybody is cutting their cost of living hence you should device means to ensure you are not under financial pressure. This is important because you might not start earning from Bitcoin immediately and if you are not patient enough you might be attracted to venture into shitcoins. Some of them are Ponzi schemes clothing in crypto and their operations are sometimes fraudulent. All you need now is Bitcoin education and information and if you patiently still around this forum, you would get the best information about Bitcoin.",

Yeah, if you are doing something that is not guaranteed, then it would be wise to ask to a lawyer about it directly. People here wouldn't be able to give you a legal advice because it is a very small chance that one of us would be from the same nation as you and also be a lawyer and also expert on crypto laws all at the same time. So find one, and ask any question you want. That way it would be a lot better for you.It means that you would be able to get direct information on the latest laws, because one of the biggest jobs of a lawyer is to keep up with changing laws in your nation and they will know everything about crypto for sure.",
