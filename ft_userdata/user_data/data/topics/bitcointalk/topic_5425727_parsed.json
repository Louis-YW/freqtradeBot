Edit:i find now \"Swap Your Cryptocurrency into TRX\"but \"Approval rejected, please \"try again\"\"    i dont know wny not successIt is simply that you must have a fee of TRX coins in order to be able to transfer your USDT (TRC-20) and activate your account on the wallet e.g Tronlink, for this you can use Binance or any exchange platform to buy Tron coins and send them to your wallet address that contains USDT on the Tron Mainnet, I think you need 1-2 dollars fee to successfully transfer your stablecoins or any coins out of this wallet, or to make a swap of your USDT.And if you do not have an account on the exchange platforms, you can post a topic about your desire to exchange one of your currencies for TRX coins in the [Currency exchange] section of this forum, and you will find someone to help you. If you need more questions, do not hesitate to post them here.",

And on this case that you have USDT (TRC20) then that means that you need to hold TRX on that the same wallet where your USDT is deposited.Buy in exchanges or get into swap exchanges like fixedfloat and changelly, you just need to convert little amount just to have trx. Maybe like $1 or $2 worth of it.",

It will be converted into the energy that will be needed to send your USDT. It's already in main net but the problem is if you seem new in the blockchain and you may fell a bit complicated with the mechanism. If you wanna try to change your USDT to the trx and you can swap it. Quote from: Anonymusx on December 04, 2022, 04:31:27 PMEdit:i find now \"Swap Your Cryptocurrency into TRX\"but \"Approval rejected, please \"try again\"\"    i dont know wny not successHave you filled your wallet with some tron before? the swap needs tron as a way to pay the transaction fees. Your approval will never be approved caused by the network will be rejecting your transaction due to the zero trx in your wallet. Ask someone to send you small amounts of trx and it can be used to pay the fees and swap your USDT to the TRX",

When you are making a transaction, you also need fees[2] in order to do it. It is stated clearly on OP, that your account is not activated. That is the thing you should do first, to activate the account.Send some TRX into the account to activate it and in order to get Energy, which is required as a fee, make sure the deposit you will send is enough that you are able to stake TRX in order to gain Energy. A thorough explanation is available of the two referred links. It does not suck, it's just how it works. If you still think it sucks, simply choose another coin.

      "body": "So, it seems like you're having some trouble with transferring your Tether USD (USDT) on the Tron mainnet.  From what I understand, you're getting an error message saying that your account is not activated and you need to deposit TRX to activate it before you can make transfers, is that correct?If that's the case, then it seems like you need to deposit some TRX into your account in order to activate it and be able to make transfers.  According to the Tron website, you can deposit TRX into your account by using an exchange or wallet that supports Tron, such as Binance, Bitfinex, or Trust Wallet. Once you have some TRX in your account, you should be able to make transfers without any issues.As for your second question about swapping your cryptocurrency into TRX, it's possible that your approval was rejected because of a variety of reasons, such as insufficient funds, network congestion, or incorrect transaction details. I suggest double-checking your transaction details using your TRON address and ensuring that you have enough funds to make the swap. If that doesn't work, you could try contacting the support team for the platform you're using to make the swap to see if they can help you troubleshoot the issue.",
