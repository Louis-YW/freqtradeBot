If that's the case, then the small volume of black-market merit trades don't themselves bother me much, and I think that it does more harm than good to get too witch-hunty about it.",

There are no vouches on his profile.Merit can't help someone to scam because it's meaningless for reputation, anyone will look on his feedback to know if the account is trustworthy or not. Based on this case the account only have 4 activity which is he can't rank up since he need to post more and he can only rank up to Member rank. Since signature campaign mostly accept full member rank, I think this matter isn't really that matter. It's a different case if he haven't earn any single merit and someone give them 5 merit since the campaign requirement need at least 5 merit in 120 days to apply the campaign.",

On the other hand, it's very possible for a random user to wake up and decide to spread his smerits as he pleases to random accounts, and I've seen a case or two like that in the past where a user woke up and started spreading merits to reputable and non-reputable members in order to have some merits activities.. Merits are personal, and how they are distributed is up to the user; I see many shit meme posts in the WO thread get many merits for being so shit! I saw you give a post 50 merits instantly, and TBH , I wouldn't give such a post even one merit. It's a matter of personal preference.There could be connections to these accounts, but we don't have proof. Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on October 13, 2022, 11:12:44 AM2.

While, these are suspicious circumstances there's just not quite enough evidence to link the two. However, anything that these two users do in the future, could potentially link them, and confirm the suspicious here. Plus, if they start offering services or try to join a signature campaign a good signature manager will do their research, and likely find this thread, and take it into consideration. So, I don't consider posting the thread detrimental to catching them if they're alts or bought merit. However, I don't think there's enough compelling evidence to link the two accounts either.",
