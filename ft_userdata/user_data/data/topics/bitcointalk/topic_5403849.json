      "body": "The mempool holds unconfirmed transactions until they get confirmed. It can sometimes take days for a transaction to get confirmed if the mempool is very crowded, since one block can only hold a maximum amount of transaction.

But that works best if you have a lot of hashrate so that you can find a block on regular basis instead of once a month for example.But when you join a mining pool you will get paid for the work you perform regardless of whether you find the block yourself or another participant of the pool does.It is also more convenient since you don't have to run your own full node but that also means you are giving up some control over what you mine.",

(1.5mill asics at this time)so do the maththere are only 52560 blocks a year but 1.5m asics all the time fighting to solve a blockmeaning 1.5m asics are fighting for a block over 10minutesmeaning 250k asics are fighting for a block over an hourmeaning ~11k asics are fighting for a block over a daymeaning ~29 asics are fighting for a block over a yearmeaning 1 asic might get a block every 29.5 years(if the difficulty/hashrate didnt change for 30 years to keep the competition/luck the same throughout)but your costs of mining 24/7 waiting for that time you manage to get a block is costing you money upfront, and so you might prefer regular smaller income rather then lengthy wait for lumpsumsby joining a mining pool(a syndicate of people helping each other to share the reward), managed by a pool operator. the pool manager calculates that X blocks a day will be mined by their pool. and so they look at how many asics are under their management and offer out shares for the workload effort being put into their mining pool. so when the pool gets a solved blocks more regularly because of the shared effort, and the reward is confirmed when its block is added to the blockchain that everyone accepts as valid. the pool then divide that reward up to give to their users that joined the pool. meaning all that large amount of hashrate(asics) all helping together means more regular blocks for that pool. meaning more to share for the users of the mining pool, more regularly.so if you are solo mining with 1 asic you might get 1 block of 6.25btc every 3 decades (if lucky)however if in a mining pool(syndicate) you might get like a few sats per block time on averagewhich soon add up over the year/decadedifferent pools have different fee's/reward share policies.and different pools manage a different amount of asics which dictate different amount of blocks the pool solves and a different amount of reward to then share. so do your research on the expected returns and expectations of earnings",
