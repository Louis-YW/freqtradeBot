No doubt Western education and culture have led to technological, social, and economic advancement in my country, but we fail to understand that traditional education shouldn't be neglected. The news of how four Colombian  Indigenous children survived the Amazon jungle for 40 days is a clear example of the importance of indigenous education. Their plane crash into the jungle killing their mother and other adults. The eldest was thirteen and the youngest was just eleven months. According to the report, the children were able to survive because of their indigenous education. They have learned through traditional education from their community how to survive on fruits, seeds, and rainwater. The oldest was able to take care of her siblings, build shelter and protect them from wild animals using local methods. Today most children from my tribe can't even speak the local dialect because they think that speaking fluent English is education while speaking local languages is illiteracy. I remember those days as children when we can climb trees invested with ants without suffering a single bite with local techniques. When we can find our way home without a guide paddling our local canoes or wandering jungles using local navigation patterns. I also recall those times when we set traps in bushes for animals and go home later to celebrate our catch. I now understand that those skills are vital and that acquiring them was not a waste of time.Today I look at my children and I see a clear difference between the past and the present. Their generation has been disconnected from their root and connected to a strange culture.

We are not expected to remain the way we are yesterday or 30 years ago. Yes acculturation has taken place and some cultures have melted into others and producing modified version of it. This is the effect of modernity, it brings the good, the bad and the ugly but we need to follow what is right. In Africa in the past, you hardly see ladies dressing almost nude on the streets but today women find pleasure in wearing inner wears they are suppose to feed the husband's eyes with in the house, they expose them all to the public. The men too are not left unblamed, they have portion of their behaviour that have also changed.The financial system have also witnessed quite a number of changes. As we know, the world financial system is fast moving from a fiat dominated financial system to an optional type with different levels of payment, investment, assets including cryptocurrency.The aspect of local language that is fast disappearing, to me it is the fault of the government. The government has not made the language a priority rather like you said, foreign language is now an mirror to intelligence, brilliance and standard for achievement, because it is made primary language for the anglophones and francophone countries, this is unfortunate. Some continent however have kept their language and dialect intact like the Asian countries. They use their language as primary language and any other is regarded as secondary.",

And at that very side of a society, they ignorantly losses values of it's own by itself adapting to dump it's cultures and trace of origin while they adopts a socalled foreign cultures they have no trace about.A oneness society of different diverse and ethnicities supposed to be of a high profile competitive moral exercises and fun being now seems irritating and abolishing to the so modality offsprings of their ancestors.If they could dormant their cultures and traditions as much as this I wonder why they did not forbid it's traditional foodies. I guess they understand what life savings it is worth to them by nature.Yes, upgrade and advancement to technologies is welcoming development but not letting go yours off your origin just to go catch up with an already made foreign.Is it as any envy of you are only captured and attracted by the things that glitters?Hell no. You can also be emulated from and your origin and cultures can also been pasted in the international and the foreign boards of notices for no cultures and traditions is inferior to me underrated.",

I don't understand first of all what is western education. If you see the overall education system around the world, it's really coming from all the parts of world right now. A lot of new discoveries in Science has been made in the East as well. Also a lot of mathematics has actually come from India as well so I don't understand why people say it's Western better world could be modern. Now talking about language, one should know English primarily because it's generally a world wide known language you'll often find a lot of people speaking it and will help you to adapt there. Talking about indigenous education, the problem is not a lot of cultures distinguish actual knowledge from blind faith, so it makes no sense teaching people Blind faith, but yes Local language is always better to learn.",

You said it yourself that you can't even give your own kids tradition education because you are not in a village but rather in a city. Traditional education still exists in our local villages,where our grand parents are,they are the right people to impact those knowledge on our kids because we the youths are carried away with technology and civilization.How can you live in a city and teach your child tradition education when you want your child to be used to western education because you have plans that someday s/he will travel abroad. I believe that those people in the local villages are being thought tradition education. During holidays,you should allow your children to go spend their holidays in the village.",

Their generation has been disconnected from their root and connected to a strange culture. I am also guilty of spreading the misconception that indigenous education is not important because I have failed to expose my children to them. I can see this too, especially by comparing the childhood of my parents to my own and young kids that grow up now.For clarity, my parents were children of the 50s and I was a child of the late 80s. People who were growing up in the 20th century spent a lot of time with others. You'd do everything in a group and play outside all day. The main difference between my parents and me was that they had to do a lot more chores, so they'd work around the house and outside, while I had no such responsibilities and would spend time outside playing, while all my chores were inside. Nowadays kids play and work inside. They go from a TV to a computer, from a book to a phone and they don't learn anything on their own, they're taught everything at school. My parents would learn by experiencing, walking around, touching things and observing nature. They'd learn to drive cars by sitting on their father's lap, but now it's not allowed. They'd be allowed to go to the forest on their own, go fishing, now parents are worried that somebody would attack and abduct them, so it's not allowed. As a little kid I'd know how to start a fire, how to cook a simple meal, like baked potatoes, I'd know how to find my way with a compass, how to follow the sun. My parents also knew how to shoot live ammo, because they were taught that at school. They'd know how to operate a radio, build a shelter in the forest, bandage a wound... Now a 5 year old kid knows how to install an app on a smartphone, but doesn't know how to boil an egg.",

Of course, our world is fast-evolving and we need to keep pace with it, and western education allows us to attain this by being globally competitive.

But I think we can still resolve this issue if the educational sector would provide a curriculum where they include indigenous education, with this we can still preserve and flourish our cultural heritage and at the same time, developed as a country and be competitive globally.",

Education encompasses even manners, formal or informal way of learning, acculturation etc. Remember education is the process fashioned out from people's way of life too of which language, arts and socio cultural tenets are Integra part of it. So if you have education from someone, you are good as going to also learn all the integra part of it. Manners didn't come different from what is learnt in school, if you have a discipline parents from another educational background like expatriate, they can only do as much that they can when you are at home with them and what about when you are not at home and you are in school, church or mosque and other social gathering outlets?.",

We have to agree with the notion that we are in the jet age,  and the computer era has exposed kids to a lot of external cultures and this has created a seamless cultural diffusion among the young kids of this era and the best possible way to go is not to disassociate them with the reality of the time but to always try out means and ways to create cultural awareness for the kids so that while they're exposed to westernization,  they also at the same time learn the culture of their parent no matter the location. That is why,  we must abide traditional methods of training and communication within the home and allow the school to teach the kids whatever that has to do we Western education and culture.",

No doubt Western education and culture have led to technological, social, and economic advancement in my country, but we fail to understand that traditional education shouldn't be neglected. One major reason indigenous education is almost now completely neglected is because of colonization and a well packaged exported culture that has been facilitated from colonial masters who visited some countries and were able to sell their culture and their beliefs as superior and better than the culture of the people that they are colonizing. They introduced new ways of doing things even down to language and religion, and because we accepted our ways as less, these cultures are slowly becoming history.

I have seen some African parents making the mistake of teaching and allowing their children to practise Western culture both at home and school and at that makes them to become a single culture individuals who lack knowledge of their own culture in the long run.",

OP, because this is happening in practically every home and every region of the world, it is easy to assume that traditional indigenous education and culture have been abandoned, and many homes now frown on it. However, as long as people practise that indigenous culture, it means that some families still embrace it and take the time to teach their children about it, even after western education and civilisation have taken over. Whatever area of the world you come from, if your people do not forget their culture and identity, they can still instill it in their offspring and they will have both knowledge and will not be left behind in terms of current events and technological growth in the world today also. When a person embraces an alien culture, they lose their identity and find themselves out of nowhere and at home unknown. One should constantly prioritise their identity because it is who they are and what they will be recognised with everywhere they go in this world. These should be fostered in schools and made a mandatory curriculum for kids so that they may absorb and cherish their culture as well as employ it in their daily lives.",
