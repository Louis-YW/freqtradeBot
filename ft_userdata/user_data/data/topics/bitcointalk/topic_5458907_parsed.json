I guess there are some topics about how to spot scams and phishing. Thanks for the heads up. I also think I shouldn't create a topic whenever I find a phishing or scam website. How would it be if I gathered them in a single thread? Is't it a better idea? Or shouldn't I create any threads at all? When someone creates a thread about how to spot scams or phishing, it will be buried somewhere in the old topics unless it's a sticky thread. So, what is your suggestion?",

So, what is your suggestion? You can collect them in one place, and it will be easier for anyone who wants to add them to the database of his firewall or antivirus. Adding links to topics that teach you how to avoid phishing links would be useful, or at least put general information at the end of each thread. Efforts to be dispersed in this way would mean that we would need an infinity of Phishing topics.",

Maybe it should have been in this regard that every scam or physhing related websites should be logged on the same thread while any other form of scam which should be single handedly identified for specific reasons either being a forum member scsm related activities, or that has to do with a renowned exchange can have a different thread created for each, because you will easily find out that members nowadays often creates threads on accusations too often without having more discussion on them from other members because some of them were issues of less concerned, such could be the categories of scam reports which can be on a single scam accusation general thread.",

And it's good to see that the community is still alive posting such scams accusations here so that it can give warnings to other members. Good catch by the way.",

I don't think forum people will fall for those scams.We almost wouldn't know the phishing link if you didn't tell us about it. Unfortunately, Google and Namecheap are very slow in deleting these links, and all our efforts in reporting may yield results after a week or two. Therefore, prevention is better than cure and knowing how to discover these links is much easier than trying to delete them.Quote from: Learn Bitcoin on July 08, 2023, 02:18:34 AMThanks for the friendly advice.

Therefore, prevention is better than cure and knowing how to discover these links is much easier than trying to delete them. If exposing that phishing to the forum or the community adds value, I will continue to post those website links if I find any. But, as I said before, I am not actively looking for these websites. I don't think Namecheap care about what website is hosted on their hosting. Namecheap and Google both care about money only. I see Google ads allow scam links before. They don't verify what they are promoting.

Sorry, I forgot to change it. Now I edited the OP and updated it. I have seen some Hyip scams before. But I don't know if I have ever seen that much phishing before.",
