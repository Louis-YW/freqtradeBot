I think just a mobile wallet with seed phrase written on standard paper (or waterproof paper) is good to get your first $100 of sats and learn how to receive, send, and maybe a few other things while they spend the time to learn how to truly secure their seed phrase and use more technical wallets. Nostr and Stacker news are making it easy to earn tiny amounts of sats via the LN but that comes with a whole different set of challenges. What do you all think is the best way to get new users onboarded with the least amount of risk but also to get them to control their own private keys?",

I don't think Bitcoin enthusiast either new or experienced need to analyze the current condition if they're only want to invest Bitcoin, because they can just DCA without need to look when the right time to buy Bitcoin. As for inability to protect their own wallet, it's really stupid if they did that mistake because when they want to create a new wallet, there's a warning message where the seeds/private keys shouldn't be shared to anyone else.",

      "body": "Here are some of the tips 1. Thorough research: Before investing large sums of money, spend more time learning about bitcoin. The amount of time you spend depends on your ability to grap the knowledge; investing is not the issue; knowing where your money is going. Everything moves slowly at first.2. Resist 'fear of missing out': it is better to miss out than lossing all your money, the resistance I mean is you will heard about a coins, unfortunately the coin is doing well, don't rush for it first, knowing it is most important thing. 3. Put in no more than you can afford to lose: So many investment opportunities are dangerous than cryptocurrency. Except for volatility, nothing is guaranteed. Furthermore, for most instances, it is uncontrolled.I have to stop here because this is what I can said now for my level. I will like to learn more if anyone can help, and if there is any I have left out please include it.",

We all came to the realization that we do not own our bitcoins if we do not hold the keys after FTX closed down recently. The best way to own bitcoins is by following these methods. However, from what I have observed, many individuals are scammed before understanding the fundamentals of bitcoin. We must acquire the fundamentals, regardless of whether someone is in it solely for profit or for the long term.",

Those set of investors are those you should avoid totally since their lack the basic knowledge to understand the popularity of Bitcoin investment and at that, they already build a predetermined mindset and formed an ideology of taking Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme without making any efforts to know how bitcoin will make them rich. Those are the set of investors this thread is also pointing to because they believe some the have the capital to invest, which is final and as long as they can lay their hands on Bitcoin they become instant millionaires,  this has bred frustration I'm the long run when the market doesn't go their way.",

HAVE KNOWLEDGE FIRST BEFORE YOU BUY BITCOIN The afar bolded term capture the entire message and essence of this thread, and any contribution or suggestion is welcome. The most crucial thing for a beginner to understand is that, It would be beneficial if someone understood or did more research on bitcoin before purchasing it, As an illustration, one of my friends who was introduced to bitcoin before me was overjoyed when the person who did so mentioned that it would be profitable for him to buy,The person who introduced him was a friend from online (social media), and he chose not to discuss it with me. Along the way, he used his school fees to purchase bitcoin without my knowledge, along the way to buy bitcoin without doing any research into it, and he was ultimately duped, I suggest that as a newbie, you don't try to play the clever card; instead, question and learn about bitcoin before you put yourself through the process.",
