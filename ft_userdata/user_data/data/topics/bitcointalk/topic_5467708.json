  "content": "Since the mood on  Willis Blockparty Number 46  is still pretty quiet, I thought I might be able to pump it up with a raffle!I am IN and participae in block parties number 46-50 and hereby want to give away a part of the winnings (of course only if a block is found).The rules are simple: - There are 5 places to sign up for (block party number 46-50)- In total, fabulous 30mBTC will be drawn, which will be evenly distributed among the 5 places (i.e. 6mBTC per place)- The winner is the one who has guessed on a Blockparty in which a block is actually found, so maybe nobody wins at all.- Individual places can be filled several times, in case of multiple occupancy, the winnings in case of block found will be divided among all- If a winner is a participant in the respective block party, the individual prize is doubled- Anyone registered before 08/2023 and with at least 50 earned merits and without negative trust can participate- participants can only register for one place, no multiple accounts, please be honest. - Registration for a place is possible until the start of the respective block party.- Entries may be edited until I have added them to my list - Payout of winnings is after I have received the winnings of a possible block find myself, the winner needs to mentions his Bitcoin address here in the thread. - Fees are on me.- In addition, I reserve the right to change the rules at my own behalf and to distribute any winnings arbitrarily, participation in the raffle does not lead to any claims of any kind whatsoeverCode:Bitcointalk Username:Blockparty Number: That's it. Good luck to everyone!  Maybe one or the other will take part in the Blockparties themselves.The sooner the spots there are filled, the sooner there is something to win here.",
