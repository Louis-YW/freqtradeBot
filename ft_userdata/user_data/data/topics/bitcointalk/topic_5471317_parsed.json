I think bitcoin may first face the first resistance at $100000. But it might go higher if the price continue to hit $100000 over and over. I am expecting more than $100000 though. But nobody can know what the all-time-high of bitcoin can be and which means no one can answer you accurately.",

To begin with, I will tell you that no one can tell you when the moment is right, because no one has insight into the future. You have to be honest with yourself here, which means that you decide for yourself how much profit is enough for you, and if it is 100%, then you will sell then, and if you have set a higher goal, then you will wait and hope that the price will reach that point. You can reduce the risk by selling gradually as the price goes up.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on October 23, 2023, 09:21:48 AMEven after the good few days recently my portfolio is still down 17% overall and at the worst I think it was 50% down so just getting back to break even will feel big for me but need to remember I am in this to do a lot better then break even. You concluded everything yourself, the choice is yours to decide if it makes sense to be happy to sell and get out what you invested - but that means that all this time was pointless. I think you are too burdened with things that should be quite simple.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on October 23, 2023, 10:54:28 AMI do not own any Bitcoin yet only altcoins. ~snip~I was convinced that part of your investment was in BTC, but this statement changes the whole thing. Any discussion about altcoins should be in the Altcoins board.",

      "body": "I believe by now you should have a good knowledge on Bitcoin before investing. Holding or selling of Bitcoin depends on the perspective view of the investor. Bitcoin can be a store of value for most persons and this set of persons do not sell their Bitcoin because they hold it for their future. Another set of persons are the day to day traders who go into Bitcoin for sort term purposes. They are mostly considered as gamblers. Some are holders, these people buy and hold their Bitcoins for long term they do not see it as a store of value but they have a target price at their mind so they hold the Bitcoin for as long as it can take and within this period they gradually accumulate Bitcoin with strategy like DCA so tat they will have more before reaching the price target. So it depends on which side you fall under and how you trust Bitcoin for you to decide when to sell or not.",

How you lll know its good to sell? I think its a matter of research. We knew the ATH price of such tokens and coin last bull run if ever they surpass it means there will be new ATH now based on charts movement and fundamental analysis if its strong then wait until you are totally satisfied then withdraw there will be series of rally which we cant fully understand how long it will last.

I am hoping I have a good bull run with the altcoins I have and then I may look at buying a full Bitcoin at some point.Hmm, I thought you invested in Bitcoin, well if not, then ALTs are also a good source to make some good money but from your statements, I got the idea that you are expecting more than 4x or 5x from your investment on ALTs. I will not discourage you, but only warn you, that if you really want to make 4x or 5x then you already have a plan and you only have to follow it. Do not fall for little profits, while you have 100% confidence that, the alt, you have invested in, can make you 4x or 5x. For example, the current market, made me $100 profit (Alhamdulillah) at first I was making $45 then $55 then $70 then $90, well when the market went to $30600, I was making $100, so I thought I should book the profit at least, because the bull run is yet to start. It has not started. So don't fall for it. We might see BTC to retest the price range of $27,000 to $28,000. And that price range is my entry point so I made my decision and have to agree on it even if the price of BTC goes further up after booking the profit, I have to agree with it and after booking the profit we should not regret our decisions, if you think you will regret then don't take profit. Wait more, but if you think you cannot bear the regret of losing the opportunity then book the profit. That's all I can say for now, because we don't know the future.",

If you see you recovered your loss already, sell a portion of your holdings every two weeks. If you had Bitcoin, the suggestion could have been something else. Everyone has a target I guess. I have a target that I won't sell until Bitcoin touches the 80K mark. You might have your own target. If you reach your desired price, do not wait for a further pump. People usually hold longer expecting it will grow more and more. But the process is no infnite, it will start collapsing at some point.",

In the last 7 days, BTC is up about 10%, the next coin is only a little more than 5%, and all the others in the TOP 10 (with one exception) achieved a smaller price increase.",

Any advice or individual plan when it comes to selling in bull run? Firstly it's important to know that next year is not the actually bull run rather what will be happening will be the halving of Bitcoin which will in turn induced a heightening in the price of Bitcoin because the halving will reduce the total amount of Bitcoin Available for circulation which will cause so many to keep Holding, a case of demand and supply causing inflation, this is exactly what will happen from later part of this year till a greater part of next year.After the halving there will be a relative scarcity of Bitcoin which will lead to the continuous increase in price also known as the bull run or bull market. This will take part from later part of next year till early part of 2025 after which investors would have made a lot profit from holding, some 100% and above profit, in oder to bring this profit to reality they would begin to sell off their assets to realize the money physical and invest in another business probably, it's at this point when the bigger investors must have sold off their assets, we will now experience a gradual fall in price and know the the bear market is setting in, with this piece of advice applied with some patience and discipline I think you would make it better with your portfolio, anyways this is not a financial advise (DYOR).",

Do not monitor the price too often and hold your coins by not setting any target when to sell. That way, you won’t be bothered by any market crash or when the price has surge high in an instant. However, keep updated with the market and never stop from doing continuous research. When you see that the market is bullish, and bitcoin price has reached another all time high after the bull run, then you can decide to sell your bitcoin in order to gain maximum profits. It’s up to you if you’ll sell them all or only a portion of them. Just stick to your goal why you invest in the first place so you won’t be making regrets in the end.",

You shouldn't expect anything much from your altcoins, and it is better that you sell them when the price pumps and quickly invest it into bitcoin. This is because it is only bitcoin that has the potential to give you good profit during the bull run.Like others have said before, if you invest in bitcoin, you should have a price target i.e the price that bitcoin will reach before you will take profit, so that you don't get carried away with the anxiety and miss out the ATH price of bitcoin, to avoid regrets and selling your bitcoin when it hirs the bear.

Any advice or individual plan when it comes to selling in bull run? I probably won't say anything original, but I think you should know it.- Don't try to “catch” peak prices in order to sell for maximum profit.- Sell in several stages in parts in order to average the price indicators, because the first point (above) is almost impossible to implement.- Choose several levels of price indicators at which you will sell bitcoin and do it at these values. That is, draw up a sales plan.",
