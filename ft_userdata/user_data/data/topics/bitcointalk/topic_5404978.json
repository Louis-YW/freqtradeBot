Sadly only Twitter offers this kind of easy to set up and use API, but there are other means that could be usedÂ  Will definitely keep everyone posted when new features are added",

That's an interesting idea - haven't considered Twitch yet. Looking at their API doc, it seems to be quite easy to get it going.I'll PM you to get more details about your expectations",

Why don't you introduce the bot on a trial basis at no cost for a certain period in some projects grps so that the owners of those projects can get a feel of the same and can promote their project by initiating tasks in that bot or do rains of their tokens in their grp. Just give it a thought maybe.That is an interesting idea, will definitely give it some thought. Thank you!",
