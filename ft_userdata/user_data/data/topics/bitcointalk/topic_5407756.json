  "content": "Despite the uproar caused by Tesla's announcement last week that it has sold 75% of its Bitcoin, the corporation claims to have $222 million worth of \"digital assets\" as of the end of June on its balance sheet.The new information was included in the company's quarterly report, which it submitted on Monday morning to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.A few days before submitting its complete earnings report to the SEC, a company will frequently issue a press release and hold an earnings call. Because of this, information of Tesla's sale of $736 million worth of Bitcoin on Wednesday spread before the firm provided any information.During the company's earnings call on Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk added that the company had sold its Bitcoin to raise cash as COVID lockdowns in China continued.Musk stated on the call last week that the reason for the sales was the uncertainty around the end of China's COVID lockdowns. Given the uncertainties surrounding COVID lockdowns in China, it was crucial for us to optimize our cash position.But in the hour following the revelation, the price of one bitcoin fell by 2.5 percent, reaching $23,078.18 on Wednesday. According to CoinMarketCap, the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization has further declined and was currently selling at $21,969.29 per BTC.Meanwhile, it appears that the news that Tesla had sold a significant amount of its Bitcoin was well received by its stockholders. Prior to the announcement, TSLA shares were trading at $742.50 at market closing on Wednesday. As of Monday afternoon, they had risen 9% to $812.16. According to Yahoo Finance, that is the highest the price of TSLA shares have been since early May.https://decrypt.co/105923/elon-musk-tesla-holds-222m-digital-assets-after-dumping-bitcoinMy question is what is the relationship linking Tesla corporation and the COVID lockdowns in china?Or was this just a well laid out plan to raise his trading prices?",

It should be well received because TSLA is making electric cars. That's their main source of income. They shouldn't play games with the investors' money. If Elon wants to make crypto investments, he should either use his own funds or create a separate company which is about making crypto investments.Quote from: StanCrypt on July 27, 2022, 06:34:34 AMMy question is what is the relationship linking Tesla corporation and the COVID lockdowns in china?Or was this just a well laid out plan to raise his trading prices? I have no idea. If you don't like or understand what Elon does, you should probably stay away from his stocks. Don't touch TSLA, problem solved. There are hundreds of other promising companies out there. Elon's TSLA isn't the only game.",

It definitely wouldn't kill the company but it would slow them down a good chunk.As for it being justified or not, whatever. Their CFO wanted to manage risk and they indeed did made a financial decision in which they think selling bitcoin was the right move to do.

Not every business wont really ending up on constant profits or making cash all the time and as we do know and we arent blind that pandemic hits hard and no matter how known or reputable your company is but still it wont really be an exemption into these kind of conditions.It is really just people cant really believe that his losing up billions just because he had made out some manipulative act in the past where people doesnt really seem to believeon what he's experiencing now into his companies.So its his company then it would really be just his rights on what he would gonna do and same into those coins that he had bought if he had that kind of plan on wherehe needs funds then its none of our business if he bag sold those coins that he had.",

He manipulated dogecoin, bitcoin, his twitter deal... I couldn't care less about musk and his ideas, but I feel sorry for people who bought because of him and got caught off guard by his sales. Learn from it! Musk will only tell after he's done it and you, the followers, will be the sheep he takes advantage of. If somebody is now buying Tesla stock because of his tweets, I can only feel sorry for you, because Elon holds so much stock that he can crash the market if he decides to, especially if he persuades his brother to sell with him. By holding Tesla stock you become dependent on these two people. I don't like to depend on anyone but myself.",

The curiosity however is if they sell such amount in btc to either finance the challenges of covid-19 on Tesla branch office in Shanghai and the covid-19 outbreak persist, what are they going to do ? Shut it down or what ? Selling more btc?",

Tesla and other US automakers and industries, rely upon a steady stream of container ships from china containing manufactured parts. This is known as the global supply chain. During the 2020 pandemic, tesla faced semiconductor shortages from china. Elon Musk looked into buying or building his own semiconductor plant to enable tesla to produce its own semiconductor chips in house. Unfortunately, the start up costs of producing a semiconductor foundry are so expensive. (Reportedly around $50 billion, if I remember correctly) That even the richest man in the world couldn't afford to finance it.Attention given to TSMC semiconductor foundry in taiwan shows the worldwide power and wealth the silicon chip industry enjoys atm. Elon tried to buy twitter. If he had more money and wealth, he may have bought a semiconductor foundry instead.",

If the control of covid in China can be resolved immediately, Elon's business will become more optimal and can aim for a more positive market. Until 2021, Elon is flattering a lot about China. either he licks. I do not know. but what is clear is that he has an interest there and it is again a matter of moving prices and making a profit.related to BTC which has been sold by tesla. then that could actually be good news. because in reality the news is not strong enough to drop btc any deeper.even TRON said it would collect the amount of BTC Tesla sells.Elon's influence is now starting to wane.",
