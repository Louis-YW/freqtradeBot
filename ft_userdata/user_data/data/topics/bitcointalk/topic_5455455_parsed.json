  "content": "Image SourceCrypto currency has been around for a long time in Pakistan and a lot of people have invested in Bitcoin and Crypto currency since then millions are trading in Bitcoin, but now the government has started creating difficulties for crypto traders and there has been a debate in the senate that crypto currencies should be banned and a committee has been formed to ban crypto currencies. Therefore, the bill will be prepared and presented in the Senate. The Central Bank Director has also issued a statement.[/url]After this news, many traders are selling their crypto currency and Bitcoin and withdrawing their money from the exchange by converting their money to stable currency, and in the current situation, traders are selling crypto currencies and bit coins at a loss. this is because everyone is afraid of what will happen to their assets if the government bans access to the exchanges.I myself have decided that I will not sell my Bitcoin but I have transferred my Bitcoin to my hard wallet where I believe my Bitcoin are safe, because I think that Bitcoin is a great choice for investment, here my capital is safer and more profitable than in a bank.Despite the ban, I will hold Bitcoin because Bitcoin is the best investment.",

I don’t know but just maybe they would have found out that it has affected their local banks and they want to just restrict it. Quote from: petulino on June 06, 2023, 06:22:44 PMAfter this news, many traders are selling their crypto currency and Bitcoin and withdrawing their money from the exchange by converting their money to stable currency, and in the current situation, traders are selling crypto currencies and bit coins at a loss. this is because everyone is afraid of what will happen to their assets if the government bans access to the exchanges.I myself have decided that I will not sell my Bitcoin but I have transferred my Bitcoin to my hard wallet where I believe my Bitcoin are safe, because I think that Bitcoin is a great choice for investment, here my capital is safer and more profitable than in a bank.Despite the ban, I will hold Bitcoin because Bitcoin is the best investment.This the major problem with many people without proper bitcoin knowledge. They fall for every FUD created by government and rush into panic sales of their funds. No amount of government banning of cryptocurrency can make you lose your crypto funds store on self custodian wallets. The only fear is those on exchanges that are probably regulated by the government or generally on centralized exchanges. Using the hardware wallet for the storage is the best but if the amount to store isn’t that much, you can simply use a self custodian wallet like electrum that offers both cold and hot wallet storage",

      "body": "At present, implementing a ban may not be a favorable course of action in your jurisdiction due to the significant number of individuals already involved in cryptocurrency. However, it is possible that certain wallet software or exchanges may be prohibited. Nevertheless, due to the inherent nature of decentralization, no government would ultimately succeed in completely banning the usage of cryptocurrencies. In the event of a ban, people would resort to trading on the black market. A similar situation exists in my own country, where Bitcoin is not officially permitted, yet I and many others continue to use it. We engage in local fiat-to-crypto and peer-to-peer transactions. The government's attempts to impede us have proven ineffective.",

So I don't think the current price fall is not even happening due to the statement from Pakistan it's mainly happening due to the high network fee for the past few weeks.Bitcoin is going to be there even if every government says it's illegal and do you know how is it possible? Because it's decentralised and doesn't need permissions from government to exist.",

It's up to you whether you want to listen to them or not and they know it. That's why all they do is post \"recommendations\" but cannot make countries play by their rules. Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is a joke. A puppet on a string. If an elected government of a country bows before such an organization, it only shows how deep in debt the country has to be if it's afraid of being put on some list. You can't ban bitcoin, that's a fact and many countries have learned it the hard way. Time for Pakistan, I guess.",

I don't understand why some Asian nations do not fully welcome bitcoin. They prefer to initially discredit bitcoin for their citizens before eventually making it legal tender. Asian nations including China, Japan, and India did that before. The Pakistani government, in my opinion, won't be an exception to that. I think that eventually, they'll want to legalize bitcoin and change their minds about their initial position. It is just a matter of time. The government of a nation cannot block the growth of bitcoin (it is unstoppable), even if more than 240 million people are living there. What happened when the Chinese government took those actions a year ago? After learning about the economic impact bitcoin does have, they later encourage their population to start using it.",
