You can even do better, and I think they all are looking for means to diverse people/members/investors for their own selfish interest. You just don't happen to see it now",

Just a word of thought,  If a crypto signal group was accurate as the owners claim it is, then why don't they quietly make money out of it instead of vigorously advertising it in the forum?What’s your end game OP? Same old scam?",

      "body": "Well, at least the website has placed a disclaimer at the bottom of the page.QuoteDisclaimer: The signal service does not constitute and should not be regarded as investment advice. The Alpha Research provides an execution only service. You act on the signals entirely at your own risk.Obviously, there's a business motive behind these free signals and that's to sell their TA service to those who will be interested for more. I guess it doesn't hurt if you join the channel as an observer. If you have some knowledge on charts, you can judge their calls on your own and leave anytime you want.To be fair to them, a quick browse and I can see that their analysis looks more professional than what I've seen in the past.",
