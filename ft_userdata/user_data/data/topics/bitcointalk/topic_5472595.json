      "body": "Many people rely on binance as their only access to cryptocurrency. They use their binance account as kind of a bank, when it really shouldn't be that way. If you want to buy crypto at good rates then binance is useful, but you shouldn't keep funds there. Sadly though too many people do. So if binance goes down, it will affect many people greatly. Just in the same way MtGox's Celsius' or FTX's bankruptcies currently do. So while the answer to the OP's question is yes, the reality is that is really shouldn't be that way. There are many ways to store crypto securely without having to rely on an online centralized service that could go bankrupt any moment and people should be using these. Only keep in an exchange what you absolutely need to use services within it like futures, no more.",

Since my Binance Visa debit card is expiring in a few months and Binance didn't find another card partner I withdraw everything i had there (which was not much btw) so no, I personally won't be affected much. Quote from: fokinlipat on November 02, 2023, 03:40:07 PMI know there will be lot of devastating affects on crypto market of this incidence like bitcoin price will fall very sharply.Drop will be significant indeed, but only in the short-middle term. Bitcoin price would eventually recover and everything would be back to normal, like it happened in the past. Quote from: fokinlipat on November 02, 2023, 03:40:07 PMMany users will also loose funds and some will loose faith on crypto. Some will maybe losse fait in crypto, but you would have to be very ignorant to loose \"faith\" in bitcoin just because you trusted some centralzied entity to store your money, going directly against everything bitcoin stands for.",

There is absolutely no downside to getting rid of a CEX like this that does everything possible to hinder BTC while promoting their alternative centralized crap!",

So in other words, don't rely on a centralized exchange to give you an update before they shut down.Quote from: fokinlipat on November 02, 2023, 03:40:07 PMWill it affect you in any way if Binance completely shuts down ?

The ban of cryptocurrency in my country has limited most persons to trading through P2P. There are local exchanges where I can carry out crypto-to-fiat transactions but I don't really like their services and the two popular ones are having serious issues at the moment. So Binance has always been the place where I carry out most of my crypto to fiat transactions because of their reputation, price rate and the P2P trade. So if they were to be shot down today, it's going to affect me in a way.Day to day traders are mostly going to be affected and other persons that have their funds in there but the effect on the overall crypto market? Maybe a little.",

Not to mention that many will indeed lose funds in the process. As to losing faith, I don't care much.

I don't rely on Binance, nor do I hold BNB or any of their coins or share in projects, so, it won't affect me. But it will affect me in a way that my savings, including Bitcoin and some altcoins, will go down if Binance shuts down because of bankruptcy or hack, money stealing, etc. If Binance just decides to shut down and let users to withdraw their funds, then it won't affect crypto market significantly, but such a scenario is unlikely to ever happen.Quote from: stompix on November 02, 2023, 05:18:25 PMI will probably need an ambulance!I will keep stuffing myself with beer and popcorn and develop a carpal tunnel syndrome from typing \"I told you so\" a million times  that I will need surgery!I think you'll get cirrhosis from drinking tons of beer and diabetes from tons of popcorn before developing a carpal tunnel syndrome from typing.

Binance cares about it's users and also it's reputation, hacks took place with trust wallet and it doesn't even take them long to pay back all those affected, that's because they already have damage funds available. I am not saying something bad can't happen to Binance but there is a difference in a platform that cares about it's rep and one that does not care, if MT GOX want to refund all the money they could have already, because it's been too long already, so stop bringing their case back, it's all gone.",

If your context is exchanges shutting down or getting hacked, the simple solution is not to use that exchange as a wallet which several people have done before and the habit has not changed yet. Only keep funds that are locked up in trades over there and do review those trades in case they are keep unfilled for long.Once you are trusting a centralized exchange with your money you have no other option.

Because if a trouble comes, a hack or what or they suddenly becomes bankrupt, there's no way that they can recover that anymore. That's the consequence for not listening to people's suggestion about how to keep our funds safe and that's not through any exchange.",

The effect on Bitcoin is indirect and temporary. In the long run, the fall of Binance and even the rest of the centralized exchanges shall be beneficial to Bitcoin and even its price. I believe the price of Bitcoin would be a lot higher if there aren't centralized exchanges. But the effect on BNB would be tragic. Binance's collapse would be fatal to BNB even if BNB is now more than just a native coin of Binance exchange. Binance is now like a prostitute but it still is an exchange more than anything else.
