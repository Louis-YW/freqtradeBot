I'm telling you, check it out! Social pressure is clearly at play when people continue to play casino games despite knowing the odds are stacked against them. Just because we see other people succeeding doesn't mean we can't. And this is why casinos are so keen on displaying their huge wins for all to see: to inspire confidence that we, too, may walk away victorious. Nevertheless, don't discount the fun you can have with your pals at a casino. Gambling is a common activity that may be enjoyed by a group of people, whether they are old friends or complete strangers. The truth is that we both need to exercise caution. Substance abuse and monetary collapse are no laughing matters. Keep your cool and gamble responsibly.",

Some people play only to get profit and earn money through it while ignoring the part where they are having fun. On the other hand, some play purely to have some fun and spend a peaceful time and such people don't really care if they win or lose, though it adds to the fun if they win.I believe it's better if you don't take gambling as a source to earn profits as that only makes it worse.

That's for online casinos; it's only the physical casinos, where I believe most of the big boys go to spend money and just have fun, and sometimes a means to escape works and you have some really good time with friends. Ordinarily, what takes me to casinos is 60% hoping to win some free money and 40% to have fun and pass time. Without the belief that I might win some money, I don't think I will be eager to go there more often, even though the money I am to spend is only a penny.",
