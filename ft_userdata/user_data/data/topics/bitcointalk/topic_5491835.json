Remember, when you generate a new seed from disconnected PC, this disconnected PC doesn't mean it safe if you ever use this PC to connect with internet or you bought the used one. You need to generate a new seed on fairly new PC or you've reinstall and cleaned the not secure PC.When you need to send your coins, you don't have to spent it all.Just create unsigned transaction in your offline PC and sign it in your online PC, read https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html",

This is a good advice. But, I don't know how people use their computer or mobile device without an internet connection. If you can afford to buy a laptop or a computer to use as a hardware wallet and never connect it to the internet, you should be able to buy a hardware wallet as well. Simply disconnecting and never connecting it to the internet is not enough. You should not connect any device to it that has internet access, and you should not use any pen drive to transfer data. Because you never know if there is ransomware or not. A hardware wallet costs around $50 to $200 depending on the model and the company. You should take one if you are serious investor.",

You are describing an air gapped wallet creation which is almost the same to hardware wallet assuming the device you use is an air gapped since you will not move your tokens after you create your wallet.And yes this safe as hardware wallet. The only difference is you can’t transfer funds conveniently like the hardware wallet technology. I do this before to my old laptop but it’s hassle for me because I always want to transfer part of my funds so I just purchased a HW that only cost a couple of hundreds for safety and convenience of my asset.",

No it's not.I have seen to many people making mistakes with their imagined fake airgapped system, that I can recommend everyone to stay away from setup like this.There are to many things that can go wrong, and people don't really understand how to keep everything offline and updated in the same time.It's not that hard to get hardware wallet today, for example Satochip cards are lees that $25 with discount, Safepal is almost free, Jade and Trezor One are aroud $60, etc.If you don't want buy anything, than using old smartphone would be acceptable with disabled all connections (airplane mode) and removed sim cards.Quote from: FirmWars on April 06, 2024, 09:42:50 AMIs this practice similar to using a hardware wallet?

The best and safest solution in my opinion is to dedicate a USB disk to a Linux OS (installed not live) and having your wallet in there.Here is a very old topic with a step by step guide to create a DIY kind of cold storage: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=853288.0If this is your first time with Linux, Bitcoin, etc. you can take all these steps and create a TestNet wallet with some TestNet coins which you can get from any faucet out there. This way you don't have to worry about losing money. Receive some coins then send them out to learn how things work.",

As others have said, this kind of setup will fall under the category of air-gap PC and it should not be connected to the internet once you have set up everything. Although if I will have to choose between a hardware wallet vs a air gap pc, I will go with the hardware wallet.And if the person that known have this kind of setup since 2013, then good for him. He could be very knowledgeable and knows how to protect hit Bitcoin with that kind of setup. The key here is that you know what you are doing if you chooses air gap setup.",

I rather think the main culprit is our own.  We care too less until it becomes too late.  You can skip most of the attack vectors by simple extra steps.  The main issue here is the word 'extra', which many people run from.  Better add a few extra steps and be safe than be lazy and cry out loud later.",

This advice came from a man I know who said to have been keeping his BTC since 2013 in the same manner, he said the internet/online is the culprit or enemy of every crypto wallet. But hardware wallets are not too expensive, many wallets are quite cheap, such as the Trezor One hardware wallet, which costs less than 60 USD each. And I think if we are serious about our bitcoin investments and intend to keep them for many years, spending $60 to own a hardware wallet is not too expensive. But it's okay if we use Electrum wallet or any open source software, as long as we meet enough factors to be safe for it. You can use any wallet you like, but don't make the excuse that a hardware wallet is too expensive to own.",

If you're investing much on bitcoin and you're yet complaining of the unaffordability of buying a single hardware wallet, then that means you're not giving the necessary attention to what can jeopardies your asset, even though electrum wallet is not a bad option once its on airgapped device.It all depends , because if you're still using electrum wallet, its something different from hardware wallet because it does not have a physical showcase as how you could move, store , use and apply its uses on any of your interested device, however, there are alternatives as well to using a hardware wallet as you have given one example already, one can make use of a paper wallet too, or anything that has to do with a wallet types which falls under a cold storage.",

But if you are a high level investor then you directly buy hardware wallet and deposit your BTC in that wallet. Only use that hardware wallet later when you are ready to sell.On the other hand, caution should be taken for added security when using Electrum wallet. Create Electrum wallet using internet connection only once by electronic device i.e. computer, mobile or smartphone and it is better not to establish internet connection on that device before preparing to sell BTC. In this case, do not use any type of input device to protect yourself from harmful viruses like malware or ransomware.In my personal opinion, it is better not to use Electrum wallet.
