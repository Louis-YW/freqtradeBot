When I do not give the password to `curl`, it asks directly:Code:Enter host password for user 'testuser':You can see it in the very first code snippet in this thread. Nevertheless, I have just tried: re-created and added the `rpcauth` string, sent -HUP, then tried Code:curl --user testuser:testpassand Code:http://testuser:testpass@127.0.0.1:8332/ the same result, 401 Unauthorized. And yes, the curl request was taken directly from the doc.Anything else I can try here?",

Without adding `--http1.1`The only idea I can think of is that the daemon reloads config not immediately but after some time. Anyway, it's solved. Thanks to everyone who tried to help.",

So, if you have to make changes, you should stop bitcoind gracefully (frankly, I'm not sure if your kill -HUP does initiate a graceful exit; I always use bitcoin-cli stop for a clean termination of bitcoind), make your changes to the config file and then restart the daemon.I'm not aware of another method to trigger bitcoind to re-read its config file.",

Take datadir or txindex for example. You can't really change these at runtime without discarding the application state (former) or incurring a short but huge performance penalty (latter). Or what if you change the RPC url or authentication? Then you'd have to wait for existing RPC calls to finish - which may be long running like importmulti - or abort them.SIGHUP reloading works best for simple programs, not those with complex states such as a full blockchain.",
