  "content": "QuoteHollywood actor Keanu Reeves talks about cryptocurrencies, NFTs, metaverse, and much more, during the promotion of John Wick 4, saying the principle behind cryptocurrency is amazing.In an interview with Wired, Keanu Reeves noted “I think the principle, the ideas behind an independent currency, are amazing. These are amazing tools for exchanges and distribution of resources. So to pooh-pooh crypto, or the volatility of cryptocurrency, it’s only going to make it better in terms of how it’s safeguarded.”When asked about how his popular movie the Matrix just looks more and more wildly prophetic by the day seeing how AI is taking over, Reeves responded “People are growing up with these tools: We’re listening to music already that’s made by AI in the style of Nirvana, there’s NFT digital art.”Reeves added “It’s cool, like, Look what the cute machines can make! But there’s a corporatocracy behind it that’s looking to control those things. Culturally, socially, we’re gonna be confronted by the value of real, or the nonvalue.”Speaking about his concerns about the metaverse, Reeves noted “It’s this sensorium. It’s spectacle. And it’s a system of control and manipulation. We’re on our knees looking at cave walls and seeing the projections, and we’re not having the chance to look behind us. Or to the side.”Reeves stated that Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has created more land, and now there’s more land for sale. “It’s wealth creation and its opportunity,” he added.Last June Keanu Reeves launched Futureverse Foundation with Fluf world NFT along with artist Alexandra Grant. Regarding the foundation, Reeves stated it’s something his partner, Alexandra Grant, is really interested in, so he’s kind of riding her coattails. “I helped set up the launch. We’re trying to take this technology that people are interested in and give opportunities to artists with different viewpoints,” the Matrix star added.https://www.cryptotimes.io/keanu-reeves-says-principle-behind-cryptocurrency-is-amazing/....On a scale of 1 to 10. How intelligent could Keanu Reeves commentary on cryptocurrencies be rated? How would Keanu's intelligence level compare to commentary other celebrities and financial figures have made on bitcoin and crypto over the years?Its interesting how Mark Zuckenberg's metaverse is becoming synonymous with crypto in general. I guess they all fall under a heading of digital assets, which could make it fair game. Although, crypto loyalists could balk at the idea of NFTs, crypto and metaverse being grouped in the same category.Is there hope for celebrities to someday become competent and knowledgeable about things like NFTs, crypto and metaverse on a broad scale? Celebrities tend to be a little isolated from technical details. Is there hope for this type of enthusiasm resulting in a positive experience with the technology?",

It is interesting that Bitcoin was not mentioned (at least as far as the quoted text is concerned), which perhaps best says that everyone wants something new with potential big profits.Quote from: Hydrogen on February 17, 2023, 11:41:54 PMIs there hope for celebrities to someday become competent and knowledgeable about things like NFTs, crypto and metaverse on a broad scale?

Celebrities have their place in the scheme of things, and I don't see why they should become experts in technical matters - because people who have money also have personal financial advisors who deal with technical matters.",

Best ones are those who has the knowledge about something and not simply one of those who does not but still claims negative thing bout that certain thing. Good thing that Keanuis a smart guy; rather than to not give a statement, he spoke what he has in mind. This industry is just amazing and interesting. Problems just arise with impressions created by different individuals. There are influencers who are pro cryptocurrencies and also those who are not. Whatever their ide is towards this industry, the way they would deliver it to their fans and audiences is the thing that would matter the most especially ones which are under this industry.",

This man is the epitome of being a public figure IMO. He rarely speaks on such things but when he does, he poses a great understanding of it which is admirable. He mentioned that he supports his partner in what she does, but is also smart enough to not use his name in the cryptospace to create his own NFT for monetary gain.",

They were just happily collecting a check. There isn't anything wrong with sponsorship deals, but perhaps they can be used to mislead the reputability of companies and celebrities owe it to people to exercise caution. Kevin O'Leary is a prime example of this, financial guy who was the prime cheerleader for FTX and received financial compensation from them. He was abundantly clear about his partnership, but of course he probably should have done a bit more research into what type of unstable business venture he was getting into (IMO all centralized exchanges are unstable).I don't see any issue with what Keanu Reeves is saying. He's not supporting a specific project, merely talking about the philosophy of crypto.",

I think you could tell if someone is of high intellect with the way they speak and act. Asides his comments on cryptocurrency, his demeanor generally has been nothing but gentlemanly. No scandals that I’ve heard of, and people that happen to meet him wherever always leave him a 5 star rating for his behavior and manners. I think his comments has some good solid points and I could easily rate his intelligence level at a much higher rate than a lot of celebrities who endorse whatever and whoever pays the right price. And yes, I think there is a glimmer of hope for some celebrities celebrities at least  to be somewhat knowledgeable in technical details.",

Just like what Elon did with his action but everyone knows he did for his own fun. However, these celebrities are involved with the crypto as investors considering they are not are billionaires like Elon so they would take up this in good way. Moreover, various series and movies are already mentioning bitcoin all the time. Whether bitcoin is being shown in negative role or the positive one, it is at the end of series is getting published to everyone through OTT platforms and social media all the time. Sometimes what celebrities are speaking about crypto may not be based on knowledge or perfect one but whatever comes out of their mouth is publicity to the fans.",

When Elon Musk talk about Dogecoin or Shiba Inu... speculators listen and he influences the markets.... but if he says \"Crypto will be in his new Tesla cars\" ... competitors listen too... and that is what we want.  Imagine if Keanu Reeves says.. you can only pay with Crypto currencies, if you want to see his next movie before it's release date.",

I didn't know the whole thing turned into a fiasco and CEX ended up deleting the ad, but critics say the message it was sending was just wrong.

And then suddenly he is against the metaverse, which means he is selective in what's good and what's bad. His description of it as cave walls without being able to look behind sounds a lot like Plato's allegory of the cave. I'm not sure if I agree with this comparison because the metaverse won't be obligatory and taking part in it means realizing it's superficial (unlike Plato's cave or Matrix), but I agree about the system of control part.His comment on cryptos isn't very deep, but it's not bad either.

He was the poster boy of the game and a lot of expectations were created due to his participation, as he is seen in a very special manner by the audience. Anyway, it didn't end well for players who pre-ordered the game, paying a much more expensive price for the product, which was considered a failure due to the blatant number of bugs, glitches presented.So, be careful with what celebrities endorse, even if it's Keanu Reeves.",
