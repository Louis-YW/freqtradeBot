      "body": "How long was the losing streak? Mostly, it happens in slots only where a player wins big, next to it will be a long losing streak. The same goes with Keno, if you hit the jackpot amount, and then continued the auto bet feature, you will yourself in a long losing streak but it won't be too obvious. They will sometimes give you a win but you won't hit a jackpot anymore. It's wrong though if it happens in Blackjack too. There's no such thing as big wins there it's only multiplied by 2 or a blackjack bonus. A 20 times losing streak is unforgivable. That takes out the fairness of the game like it's rigged or something. I don't play that game anymore because of that low winning amount. I'd rather stick with games that have jackpot chances, big amounts of winning, and withdraw afterward.",

Bad luck, or improbable events, happen. And streaks of bad luck too. I'm sure that hasn't happened 1,000 times in a row. More often than not it's happened more times than average, and you remember more of those times because they're more painful than the other times where it was normal (that you won with 20).Quote from: Coin_trader on July 16, 2023, 05:28:17 AMI decided to immediately stop my game since I knew that this will continue while my temper will be very bad in long run.You did well.",

It always feels like it's rigged for you to lose when it constantly happens. Once you got the winning streaks, you then can expect a losing streak as well in Blackjack. But try another game like Baccarat before the losing streak happens and see if you got that losing streak. And if you do then consider the conclusion that it's really rigged so they can take back the money you won. Don't wait til they got everything from your account though.",

Assuming that your strategy is optimal I don't understand how you can lose so many times when having 20 or a push with Blackjack. In my experience I rarely see the dealer getting a Blackjack when I have one. With the right strategy in Blackjack we get really close to 50% winning chances, which only gives a small edge to the casino. It's good that you stop when you realise that your mood is changing. We need to keep an close eye on our emotions and don't fall in the habit of chasing losses. Unfortunately there will always be times where we face a losing streak and we need to decide how to deal with it. What I noticed from your bet sizes is that the higher losses go the more you are willing to bet. Maybe you are trying out a martingale strategy to recover? But in such a case your initial bets of $5 seems to big because you get wiped out so fast. Maybe start lower if you want to go up in size with your losses, or stick to your $5 size to recover over time.",

For the games that I prefer, Blackjack is not among them, so we can have different results. Since when I have been gambling, I can have a bad day or a good day with little profit or big profit sometimes. But I have not played for that long and continue to lose, also I do not continue to win. I win and lose randomly, but what I looked more for is for the winning to be more than how I am losing.",

And then just play the small amount that is left on my account.And when I thought that I can continue to have my luck on my side, then I went on a massive losses every time I play.There are days that I will hit good money at the start, but then again, I felt that the game will do that me so encourage me to bet and wage higher and higher. Anyways, it's just a rant on my side regarding the game provider. So now I totally move out of playing or using Evolution for now.I think it's the same with Baccarat, you just have to bet on Banker and Player. Of course, there are side bets but mostly it's like 1:1 game.This is what I’m talking about, I’m winning big time too on other day of my game but in different evolution gaming games, most of the time on crazy time and dead or alive. Thenafter a few days off on gambling, I realized that my account has a very low win rate especially on Blackjack which I supposed to have a 50/50 chance of winning since I play with advance strategy here. But guess what, All the odds is in favor against me no matter how strong my card is. I sometimes feel that Evo mark my account when I’m on profit to give me a low win chance rate to any table that I sit. But of course this just my assumption due to my upset.  Are you on green or red side with your total PnL?Quote from: ethereumhunter on July 16, 2023, 08:21:38 AMIf you don't understand how Blackjack works, you need to learn more to play it well to increase your chances of winning. But if you find it difficult to win after you learn, maybe Blackjack is not the gambling game that suits you. You can look for other gambling games that might be more suitable for you so that you can get more wins than when you play Blackjack. Men, My oxygen is Blackjack already for I am playing this game most of the time. I'm also very well versed on Blackjack strategy or card counting on a regular deck without continuous shuffling method. I also have a good bankroll management. I'm feeling upset on my lose but that doesn't mean I can't afford to lose it.",
