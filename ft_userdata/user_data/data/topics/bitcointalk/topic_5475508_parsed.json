A lesson learned to not use this 3rd party app and become more effectively in control of my crypto in the future with a more custodial wallet. But nonetheless I still really need to get this transaction confirmed. Please can anyone help me with this . I really need some help. Try not to beat me up to bad with my already known now beginners bad moves. Please and thank you !!!",

They give you the freedom to customize your own fees by yourself and that site gives you insight on the right fee to pay to have it confirmed faster. This particular transaction do you have the private key or recovery seed to its wallet. If yes then import it into electrum wallet and rebroadcast the transaction again if it has already been dropped. Yuh can check this guide on how to download electrum wallet  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5240594.0",

But if it doesn't work for you then we may have a very much different situation.Mine took almost a week too before I finally tried sending another transaction and confirmed both transactions. But like Charles-Tim said, it might be best to import the wallet so you can set how much your tx would be. If the 3rd party didn't give you keys, then maybe use your other wallet to send another transaction to the wallet destination and use the right amount, both transactions will probably be confirmed in less than an hour.",

I think it is better for you to wait for the transaction to drop out of the mempool and then resend with a higher fee.",

It was maybe my sentence, what I meant was he should import the private key into any wallet Like electrum so that whole rebroadcasting the transaction if it has been dropped, he can actually be able to customize the fees to the prefer amount he wants. I also thought of the viabtc paid service but wasn’t sure how much it costs. But a $63 fee for a transaction of $200 transaction doesn’t seem ok to me except if OP is in a hurry to have this transaction confirmed. He could just wait for it to get dropped and broadcast a new one",

      "body": "You could maybe try to double spend the transaction with a higher fee. Double spent transactions may also be rejected by some miners, but others might accept them regardless. So It at least has higher chances to get confirmed and pass through faster instead of just being dropped. It's not that hard to double spend a transaction actually. While it's not an intended feature of bitcoin, certain wallets make it somewhat easy to do it, although you might have to jump through some hoops to do it.",

There are nodes that don't have OP's transaction in their mempool and you are right that OP can make a new transaction if he/she owns the private key of the sending address and import it in electrum, but that's not called rebroadcasting. Rebroadcasting means broadcasting the same transaction.",

OP's transaction is paying less than that.Purging from a node's mempool would only occur at this level when the node has a \"default size\" mempool of 300MB. One may assume that a lot of nodes do still have a default sized mempool, but it's up to the node's operator.Quote from: khaled0111 on November 25, 2023, 11:36:31 PMAll he have to do is to use a wallet like Electrum and keep handing servers till he finds the appropriate ones then he can recreate the transaction, pay the appropriate fee then broadcast it. This may work if OP finds an Electrum server whoes node has dropped his transaction already. The transaction would then be shown as local which you can then simply delete and make the coins available to send out a transaction with more appropriate fee (and RBF enabled). This solution assumes that OP controls the private key of his transaction's input in a non-custodial wallet and so far this detail hasn't been disclosed by OP.Frankly, I'm not entirely sure how nodes would handle such a new conflicting transaction when they still have OP's original transaction in their mempool (needs a larger non-standard sized mempool, though). To my not yet freshed up knowledge the new transaction should be treated as a double spend and thus be rejected, unless the node has a RBF-all policy.",

Use with caution as long it's not sufficiently confirmed as legit.It's interesting that they've added a gimmick of \"additional fee options\";they may have implemented it using prioritizetransaction RPC; because otherwise, they'll need the user's prvKey.It's nice to let their clients have a sense of control but they might think that the additional fee is applied to the actual transaction.while in reality, it's only applied as \"fee_delta\" to mempool_spaces' node and their partner miners that uses it.When looking on other blockexplorers, they'll still see the original fee rate.Some may think that they are scammed.",
