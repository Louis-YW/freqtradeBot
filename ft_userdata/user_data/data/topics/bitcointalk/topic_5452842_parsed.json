Wetin dem do, dem intimidate voters, dem follow to manipulate the results, dem carry thugs to go snatch ballot box, kidnap INEC staff, bribe the electorate etc. Most of these terrible people already get family for US or dem like to dey go there go run one or two matters. As e be like this sef, we never see any list and dem nor go release the list to people wey dey affect. These people go know when dem go embassy wan to apply for visa. QuoteTaking Steps to Impose Visa Restrictions on Individuals Involved in Undermining the Democratic Process During Nigeria’s 2023 Elections CycleThe United States is committed to supporting and advancing democracy in Nigeria and around the world. Today, I am announcing that we have taken steps to impose visa restrictions on specific individuals in Nigeria for undermining the democratic process during Nigeria’s 2023 elections cycle. These actions are specific to certain individuals and are not directed at the Nigerian people or the Government of Nigeria as a whole.Under Section 212(a)(3)C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, these individuals will be subject to restrictions on visas to the United States under a policy covering those believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining democracy. These individuals have been involved in intimidation of voters through threats and physical violence, the manipulation of vote results, and other activity that undermines Nigeria’s democratic process.The decision to take steps to impose visa restrictions reflects the continued commitment of the United States to support Nigerian aspirations to strengthen democracy and the rule of law.As much as I like wetin the US don do, e go still make sense if other countries like UK, France, China, Japan, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Korea and all these other nations fit do the same. But e go hard because even some of these other nations dey benefit from these guys big time. E go also make sense if the visa restriction fit touch their family members as well -  their wife, children too. Shey una agree say visa restriction nor dey enough. Which other measures una feel say dem suppose add to this visa restriction?https://ng.usembassy.gov/taking-steps-to-impose-visa-restrictions-on-individuals-involved-in-undermining-the-democratic-process-during-nigerias-2023-elections-cycle/",

However they should released the list of those individuals let us know the evil doer in our country to enable us get the needed president to rule the country.If this is actually authentic then there will be serious problem before 29th of this month when the swearing in would take place.",

I longed expected this to have taken effect but it seems they were too lousy over it and kept mute for such a long time but they seems to realize themselves now. I like the fact that the politicians were really affected by the restriction. They should live up to expectations in accordance to the law and the oath of office they swore. It is high time they are held accountable and responsible for their actions and inaction's. The United States did figured this out and maybe used another means to pass a signal to nations that is it not game as usual. The next thing you will hear  is confiscation of all government official and politicians ill gotten wealth stashed up in foreign land at the detriment of their various nations. I think that would serve them better when it gets to that point.",

I am beginning to feel that these guys are just toying with themselves  (not us ) with these travel ban they had placed. Do not be surprised in the nearest future  you will  start hearing that politicians have been travelling out of the country with fake identities with the aid of those their lackeys and cronies they planted into the system. The worst of it all is that, this would be  an international collaboration and they would be moving out with private jets since they have it, it would not be a challenge to them in anyways.",
