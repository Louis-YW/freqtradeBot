Well, I am also happy to see the trend looks good again. It's a nice feeling, but I am also a bit wary because we're not out of the danger zone yet.What I want to say is that you should not care so much about this small and short movements. Look on long term charts. The price can continue to go up or can go down again (and can even become scarily low, depending on the price one bought), but that doesn't mean we have to be overly affected by these movements. Again, it's only a couple of days of moving up; that's not much, not yet.So: keep your cool, don't be neither overly confident, nor depressed by the price movements. Or at least don't take financial decision based on such short-time movements",

You simply will not be able to abstract from the market and every day you will recalculate your losses and think that you could buy bitcoin much cheaper than you did earlier. I wonder if you have set a goal for yourself, at which price you are ready to sell your BTC?",

It is difficult to resist the urge to check the price and to not feel excited or dismayed when the price goes up and comes down respectively.With more roller coaster of emotions, you will eventually begin to feel more disinterested in what takes place in the price from day to day and instead focus on more long term goals.AT 47, there is still so much to look forward to and I hope you investments can make you a bit more secure as you enter that new phase of life.- Jay -",

Have you thought about the age difference? For him, you are still a snotty kid.But on the topic, to really enjoy your investment, forget about checking the price of Bitcoin for a while. Set a goal for how long you are willing to part with your money by investing in bitcoin and at what price you will be satisfied with the profit. While sticking to regular investments despite the price, you also need to understand that this time should be two to three years or more, a time when you can receive benefits that will be many times greater than your joy today.",
