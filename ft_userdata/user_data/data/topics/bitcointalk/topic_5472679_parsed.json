  "content": "The power of the mind can never be underestimated. Every good thought stems from the mind. The mind is where creativity and further strategies is released to build up successful ventures. The mind is like a fertile garden where every thought its planted like a seed and will germinate and grow  into a full tree if watered and nurtured properly. In this fashion, every good and bad idea cultivated in the mind which is constantly watered by the desire to actualize it and nurtured with proper strategy has a high possibility to materialize. Many great men are testimonies of the power of the mind. They thought of a solution to a problem, and with constant dedication, planning, excution strategies and follow ups, they achieve their aims. Let's look at a few of them:Abraham Lincoln: had a conviction that all men are created equal, should have equal rights and equal opportunities. He pursued it with determination, which brought about the end of open marginalization and slave trade in the united states. Although he paid the ultimate price with his life before his idea was actualized.Charles Schwab: A young man in his thirties whom conceived in his mind the US steel corporation and gave a famous speech at a gathering which swept the money king Morgan off his feet and bought him to his idea. Morgan invited him for another discussion for clarity and he convinced Morgan so much that he invested over $400 million in the dream of this young man. Surely he wasn't disappointed.Napoleon Hill: On a tip off from Andrew Carnegie, Napoleon went into proper research for 25 years on the secrets of acquiring great wealth. An idea that people will term irrelevant, but his conviction and strong will power gave birth to the famous book \"think and grow rich\" which uncovers 13 principles of acquiring genuine riches and achieving the impossible. Himself received a reward of his own dedication by refusing to accept a deaf and dumb child. He continued believing in his son's ability to live a normal life, constantly encouraged the boy. Nature finally rewarded him accordingly and his son lived a normal life many years later.Rev. Dr. Martin Luther king: he had a dream that one day, people wouldn't be judged by the color of their skin, but what they brought to the table. He was an activist for economic equality, eradication of racial activities and equal recognition. He achieved his aim, but died fighting for black workers to have equal benefits with whites. He called for equality on several occasions and even when it fell on deaf ears, he did not relent as his convictions were strong and his ideas were sound.Satoshi Nakamoto: had the idea of decentralization of currency, transparency and trust in transactions , freedom from unnecessary government monetary policies. He  pursued his ideas by creating a program where people can send money to one another anonymously and securely with softwares called digital wallets, outside government regulations. He met with political and social backlash, but stayed true to his game. The bitcoin crypto currency we now enjoy is a testimony of his strong idea.Many great men have already demonstrated that the greatest power a man weilds is his mind. As soon as your mind is compromised with negative thoughts about your Idea and strategies, only then are you defeated. There is still room for critism and change of strategies that are not practically sound, but keep the idea alive.We ought to use our minds properly, feed in only positive thoughts to this fertile garden and populate our subconscious minds with possibilities of achieving these goals and we will see how strategies for actualizing these great ideas of ours will be unfolding gradually until it become a success.Even in the forum, the desire to rank up and get the best recognition should keep us going. we should be committed to active learning, contributions, creating quality threads and all other lawful manners of engagements that will help us actualize the very idea of being in the forum. All these are achievable with the right mindset.Don't rush yourself, just keep on every good cause and take things a step at a time. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day. You need to keep a sound and positive mind at all times, and believe in your abilities. That way, you'll coerce others to believe in you too.",

Just take a look at the forum, anyone that joined this forum at first can testify the difficulties they encountered while navigating through the system as almost everything was strange but through time and being devoted to learn and develop oneself in this forum so many of us have seen the positive results it has yielded.It is good we understand that sometimes there are times we find it difficult to do things simply because we feel that those things are very complex and we do not have much knowledge and understanding about it but believe me when you remain committed and do research to know more about that particular thing as time goes on you start getting familiarized with the system and possibly adding to what you have acquired as well though it takes time but you will surely get accustomed to how the system works.",

It's whatsoever our mind tells us about anything and everything that our heart would accept. In situations where we have to think before acting, we often struggle with the decision making because our mind is trying to process all rigorously.   In our day to day living, as humans we should never infuse negativity, we should embrace positivity. Yes we may be in tough and rough situations, and only our mind could help us survive. Without us knowing we subconsciously task our minds every second of the day and the only time the mind is out at rest is when we're asleep that's in essence sending us a message that our mind is essential in our living.",

The sound mind is also refers to those advocates the sound mind is one who speaks for the people and that who Abraham Lincoln was and advocate for the people, and Satoshi Nakamoto was having the mind to liberate the poor from the oppressive rich people and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther king was advocate for people who were chained in the Church from the spiritual growth and not to grow and he spoke to liberate those who where in the bondage. And others have said, the mind is the most important part in human body because the mind control everything other things in the system. Ones again thank for the sound mind of yours.",

Innovation is the ability of bringing alive a unique idea that either solves a problem, or enhanceds living. There are many problems around today from economical, political, technological, agricultural e.t.c.There's a whole lot, and a person's ability to  bring up an idea to attempt or properly solve these problems makes for innovation. Innovation starts from you recognizing a problem and thinking of approaches to solve it. So you see, its a conscious effort and you must be intentional about what you're doing if you must be innovative.",

Some are not to be blamed due to the environment they find themselves in which is not helpful to help them make such innovations become viable. Satoshi Nakamoto may have had same feelings, but he never relent and made his way through to make this project a success that we are now benefiting from. Sometimes, going for your dreams without minding the obstacles ahead paves more way to make everything seems doable along the journey. Nothing is impossible until you make it feel so and surrounding yourself with positive minded people is a great tool to drive your vision into reality because those are the catalyst to make you achieve those things faster.",
