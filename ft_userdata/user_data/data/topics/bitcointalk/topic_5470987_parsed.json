  "content": "....our prayers are with Mr IBU in this trying time and we pray for quick recovery........ My people, ¬†I know by now most of us for don watch or read waiten is happening in the Nigeria movie industry, ¬†the two trending stories coming up from that industry in the last two week is that of the young 20+ actress who splashed millions of naira in buying a house for herself within few year/ month into the acting business. Another one comes to be that of John Okafor who has been a comic actor for over 20 years, ¬†his own na sickness, ¬†one of his legs ü¶µ may be amputated if not flown ‚úàÔ∏è ¬†abroad for urgent medical attention, ¬†he has carried to the public with his personal account flying all around social media seeking for donations, ¬†now goes how much he need, ¬†just 7 million naira to fly out for medical treatment. So this thing come made me the wonder say how can a very popular actor who have put smiles on people's face for over 20 year can afford to foot his travelling and treatment arrangement for such a small amount of 7 million, which will result in a public donation. And a young girl who is bearly known for getting such an amount of money that runs into hundreds of millions within a short period to splash on such a home for herself, ¬†and her case is one among many of her colleagues who have bought SUV cars worth millions in the same movies industry. So the thing comes that makes me wonder what really happens, is why the ladies make amm for that industry and the men are poor or even below average, ¬†because most of the deaths of actors that we have seen are mostly as a result of proper financial care at some point, ¬† the thing comes to the look like say the more you look the less you see for Nigeria movie industry.",

      "body": "My brother nothing comot for wetting you dey talk o. Me self I dey reason am all the time say wetting dey happen to our Nollywood star Today. One thing I discover be say them no get love among themselves. Na competition Dem dey do. Who go dey de top. because had it been say Dem love themselves you go know. them for get union to take help themselves rather Dan seeking for help from social media or from government. Many of them don fall thesame victim. I could remember Clem ohameze (ogbuefi) been get similar issue and na mercy land help am. So many of them had similar issues.Another thing I discover also say e dey affect them na fame. say them be actors or actress no mean say there life different from your own. The work Dem dey do made them popular pass money wey Dem get. I bet you if you check those actors account you go see say you fit Get money pass them. I no be actor but I understand one thing from a movie wey I watched. There is what dey called (NOTA) Nollywood old timers association. E get were time go reach that role wey you been dey play somebody wey sabi am pass you go come out say him or her go ft do am, and accept small price to do the work then you as an old actor go dey expect hire payment to do am. Before you know the youth don dey take over your role and you no go get fictuers again now you don become Nota.Another thing na Nollywood of then and now no be the same. Back then Nollywood money been Small compeard to now. Back den dey only fixture you and get paid for it. But now many actors now they promote there movie for YouTube and even for Facebook just like Ruth kadiri wey don get movie production. If you whatcout now old movie don dey flunt for Facebook you know why? because na now there eye come dey open.Mismanagement na one key factor. because say acting na your work no mean say you go be actor forever. Nothing last forever when you dey work and money dey come out always think of another thing wey fit fetch you money because one dey that your stream of income fit dry. Na warning to all of us. Even this Bitcoin we dey praise here every day, one thing fit come out wey go fit super seed am tomorrow. Or one day e fit no ft bring out money like as e be today. Nothing last forever. That's why we supposed dey do research because as we dey grow naso technology dey advance.Then as for the ladies to get money pass for movie industry. Just forget that one. Na movie runs them dey do. After them do hookup for politicians Dem go hide for movie industry. just like some 9ja Yahoo boys wey cash out big-time go enter music industry make Dem no fit find him source.",

Mr IBU na person wey dey act film well and sometimes when I dey watch those throwback movies I dey laugh, because IBU na person wey funny. But you talk say men no dey make am reach women for the movie industry and that's a lie. Let's talk about quality Nigeria movies before I talk about the rich male actors. IBU na actor wey dey act oh but you never observe say anyhow film funny reach, people don dey watch quality and standard films, now naija movie industry don upgrade because others too dey upgrade for example: shanty town, blood sisters, brotherhood etc. People no dey get time for local movies again, even me wey dey talk no dey reason local movies again. Make I mention actors wey feature for this movies wey get money scatter, RMD, Deyemi okanlowon, Tobi, IK ogbonna. So men too dey make am for the movie industry no be only women.Okay most people for the comment section dey talk say the women dey involve for hookup, that one no be lie. What about the music industry for niaja why e be say the men dey make am pass the women, or abi the women for the music industry no dey do hookup.No allow all this celebrity fake life style deceive you. No be all of them get money na packaging them dey do. But wetin dey pain me for this Mr IBU case be say money never come to do the surgery, all these celebrity suppose don support there fellow man IBU with the money. No be when he die every celeb wan post am that one na evilness. One thing I observe for naija music/film industry be say them no dey help each other. Na the same thing¬† happen to mohbad too, nobody gree give am listening ears na so the guy take die. Almost all the celeb page wey I dey see for IG don post this IBU case and money never still reach for the surgery, I pray to God rest in peace is not the way people shall trend.",

Me sef as i fess hear about am i no fess believe say popular actor like Mr Ibu go de beg for this kind situation i swear, so of all the popularity wey dem de get e mean say nothing to show for am because i no see how e suppose be wey u go popular like dat wey him no go fit get person wey go help am. So most of him colleagues wey de wey de flaunt houses and cars online no go fit help am? Like i de reason say even if 2 people say dem wan raise funds to help am de go fit oo but be like na all man for himself oo. I even see advert of popular Kanayo O Kanayo telling people about Mr ibu condition and even urging them to make contributions to his account. I know he must have done his best to support them but instead of making public announcement i think they should have just discuss among themselves in the film industry to help him raise the money because i feel the public announcement will make people look down on the film industry, people will be forced to believe they don‚Äôt pay actors and actresses a reasonable amount of money if not Mr Ibu would not be in a situation where it will get to the extent of begging the public for help.

Bad as e be, 7m still big but e no suppose be problem for person like Ibu even if e be say him don exhaust all him money on top the sickness and even if him no get friends, what about people wey him don help?

One thing we gats know be say, times have changed and na so the industry don change too, with plenty means to making money form the industry. These veteran guys no dey act again for sometime, the money way dem don save don drop, inflation too don devalue am, endorsement deals way them been get kwa don sort alternatives.
