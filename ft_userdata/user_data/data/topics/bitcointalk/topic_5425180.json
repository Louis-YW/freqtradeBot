Like expecting btc to hit bottom after a bull run is rational but expecting that such a big exchange will go insolvent is not rational or thinking that such a big Cryptocurrency will see it's very basic concept flawed is not rational. These all might be planned but normal retail investors can't think of these and everytime it's an entirely new thing that they do. So I think one can only think like them if one becomes one of them.",

Bitcoin will become a little more diversified, as these whales sell, and that means there are less single entities holding a large share of Bitcoin. You want whales to sell right now, even if that causes panic selling. Since, you want every opportunity for that whale's share to get distributed among several users. I keep saying this, but the price of today is irrelevant, and users need to stop getting so obsessed with it, if they're planning on using Bitcoin for a long time or always planning to use it. As for Whales being the culprits to some of the largest scams relating to Bitcoin, I mean probably. Although, that's only because these companies that have become successful have managed to amass a rather large share. It's not that every person who buys a large amount of Bitcoin is going to scam.",

We have a relatively small number of Bitcoin addresses that contain the vast majority of BTC, but we don't know how many of these addresses belong to single individuals, and in companies, things are often decided collectively, and some things are more likely to happen than others. Moreover, is there any evidence that it is the very rich addresses moving their funds that play a crucial part in the price dynamics of Bitcoin? I don't think so. And since 'whales' as big powerful players that manipulate the market don't sound too real to me, I don't think people should be or think like them. What people should do is be mindful of where they store their money and which projects they choose to support.",

As we people own limited resources and we don't want to risk it, this is where we are wrong but responsibilities are forcing us to do this. Whales own money + they risk with diversity. Our mindset also plays an important role in this process.This is a good answer. A bit too simplified, but true.Rich people have the comfort of investing money they don't need right now. It's like you investing 100 USD. You could put 100 in this project, 100 in another one and forget it for a few years. You won't feel any pressure. Rich people do the same but they put a million here, a million there and they never get squeezed. Bitcoin goes down by 50% and they lose 500k out of their 50 million, while you, poor guy struggling to pay the rent lose that $50 that could've been fuel for the car. Now you either have to sell at a loss or go to work by bus for a month. That's why it's so important to build a portfolio that isn't making you uncomfortable, no matter what happens. How do you do it? There are a few options. One is to invest less than 10% of your liquid assets while also having some illiquid ones. For instance, you have a house, a job that brings you 2k a month and 10k saved up in the bank. This means that you only have 10k to invest and you take 1k and buy bitcoin with it. Whatever happens to that investment you won't get into financial trouble. The second option is to dollar cost average where you don't touch any of your assets but every month take 10% ($200) out of your paycheck and buy bitcoin. This is also a completely safe way to invest.The third option is for those who had profit from a bull market and withdraw all they've invested + some, leaving only profit in the wallet. Your ROI from this point is above 100% and you've already won with an option to win more.",
