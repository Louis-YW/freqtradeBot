Going through Mrsloty it looks like good number of local leagues have been listed. If the preference is to spend on popular leagues, you can go with the trusted sportsbook available in our forum. You can use the best that suits your requirement, and majority have got instant settlement on bets as well as instant withdrawal supported.",

But you aren't going get much information about them from bitcointalk community. You are the first person who has mentioned this casino name in this forum. Anyway, the review of mrSloty.com looks really bad on Trustpilot. There are 213 reviews, almost 95% reviews are related to the complaints of their service. Most of the issues are related to withdrawal delays. Therefore, you have chosen a wrong sportsbook.",

In-case about \"TrustPilot\" who share by fellow member bitcointalk.I still never trusted \"TrustPilot\" review even the review is good with 4-5 star. The reason, because you can pay a review service to boom server for gain a higher star review. So try to find a review from user experience in forum rather than using trust pilot.",

I know nothing about this gambling site, and like you, I have not found much information about it online. The only real lesson that I learned from my brief search for information about this gambling site is that it’s incredibly difficult to find good information about the site. Therefore, it is hard say if this site really is legitimate or fraudulent. I also noticed that they have some bad reviews on Trustpilot, which is never a good sign. Although TrustPilot is not a best source of unbiased reviews, but still I think it is better to look for a more respectable casino to play at. There are plenty of other online gambling sites out there that are much more trustworthy and reliable than this one, so if you want to play casino games then I would recommend looking elsewhere.",

But if you are going to read the reviews here:[1] https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.mrsloty.com[2] https://casino.guru/mr-sloty-casino-reviewAnd it's mostly negative reviews, and same as what you have said, the withdrawal takes more time. So that is a big no-no if you are a online gambler. So I would advise you to stir away from that website and don't play with them any more.",

Even for let's say they are legit, the withdrawal time period is horrible. I don't see any reasons why withdrawal should take up to 3 weeks before it will be processed.  Even for manual payouts processing, that shouldn't take about a week.There are many reputable bookies here to choose from. Shift your attention to those sites instead.",

May we know how you got to know the casino site and how did you get interested in joining the site? Maybe that can shed some light on us.The long withdrawal is a little suspicious because it could be that the casino site doesn't have a balance in their main wallet to pay the winnings so they need more time to collect the money.How much did you win @OP until the casino site took 14-20 days to pay you?",
