I don't get it but it looks like you talking about syncing issue that only downloads a few blockchains.Have you tried to uncheck the prune on the settings?Because if you didn't it would download only the partial blockchain disabling it will bitcoin core download the whole blockchain.",

Did you set the VM-disk to \"grow as needed\"? My guess is you have 300 GB available inside the VM now, and in that case you could have been better off setting a maximum size to the VM disk.QuoteI used Ubuntu since I have found a very good Tutorial on Youtube (although I do not have any experience with Linux...).Does that mean you're running the VM on Windows? If so, why add a VM? If you don't trust your host OS, you can't trust your guest OS either, so it doesn't make Bitcoin Core more secure.",

But all the data will not get stored in that folder, the blockchain will be stored in the folder ~/.bitcoin (which is a hidden folder). In that folder you will find the .dat file where the blockchain is stored and the bitcoin.conf file to configure the RPC calls.Please next time be more clear with the questions and we will be happy to help you.",

      "body": "You should not run Core inside a VM, unless you are testing it, because the disk is virtualized and that will cause performance issues. If you can, run it inside a container, since it avoids the overhead of a guest OS making read()/write() calls, as well as a hypervisor multiplexing all this. Most OS'es have a special filesystem for container disks that allows them to access their contents without having to make a gigantic file designated as a virtual hard disk.",
