  "content": "Bitcoin Client Software and Version Number: Bitcoin core V25.0.0Operating System:Windows 10Description of Problem:Hi all,I'm trying to connect my HW wallet to Electrum, Electrum to an Electrum personal server and the personal server to my BTC node.So far I've managed to get the \"listening to Electrum wallet\" output from my EPS, which makes me think that I've succeeded in running EPS and linking my EPS to my node (screenshot 1).Problem is that my Electrum wallet can't seem to connect to my EPS (screenshot 2).I've tried changing ports, changing machines (running Electrum on another desktop), even added a line to the properties of my Electrum shortcut (screenshot 3).My node, EPS and Electrum wallet are all on the same machine.Can someone help me? I really don't know what I'm doing wrong here.Thanks in advance!Â Screenshot of the problem:Screenshot 1:https://imgur.com/FBZmtsxScreenshot 2: https://imgur.com/TMwMNCiScreenshot 3:https://imgur.com/20kRJo7",
