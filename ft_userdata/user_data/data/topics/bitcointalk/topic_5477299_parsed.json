Even if you're pissed with such introductory topics it can change the fact that newbies will still do the same thing over and over again. Till something is done about it you can stop seeing it because after correcting this niggi here someone else is gonna come and will still make such mistake because they don't know about it yet till another person tells them too. Hope you get me? Try and be cool sometimes like the first commenter did",

He's just a newbie that knows absolutely nothing about the forum and has indicated interest to learn about Bitcoin and seeking for materials. You were once a newbie Mate.

I'm not cornering you and not trying to side with @sheenshane, but what he wrote in the previous comment I did not find a single disrespectful word.He has done what he should do, his suggestions and direction can be a motivation for other newbies to make it easier for them to adapt to the forum atmosphere. Don't assume wrongly friend. Even though sometimes you find other users who seem a bit harsh in guiding, maybe their character is like that, but the aim and objective is to want newbies to develop faster while on the forum.",

I need materials to further my knowledge about Bitcoin or crypto space generally. Plasey I need your helpWelcome to this forum, I hope you will find what you are looking for here. Actually, you will find some useful material to enhance your knowledge about BTC or other alts. This forum is full of useful information and tutorials and the amazing thing is you can find useful tutorials in your own local language. If you want to know something then be more specific like How Blockchain works, or How to store your BTC for a longer period of time.  You should visit the BTC section which lies on top of the home page, and if you want to learn technical things then do visit the technical discussion section, even if you don't know anything at all and are totally new to the crypto sphere even then you can visit these sections and can make posts there. Because by making posts, you will learn more.Try to remain as active as you can and follow old users because they are the ones who have contributed more to this forum. I would suggest you an encyclopedia of useful topics made on BTT but unfortunately that topic is no more so, I don't have any single useful link for you to give unless you have specific topic to know more about.",

Maybe the word IMPOLITE pissed you. I mean no disrespect, all I'm saying is that there are more polite  and less harsh ways you could relate your information to OP.There's absolutely nothing wrong with OP posting on the forum as a newbie. Learning and contributing doesn't in anyway contradict common sense. And I can't wrap my head around what you mean by DEPENDING ON OP TOO MUCH or what you're trying to say, but what I can say is that you've seen wrong.My observation is that there are more polite and less harsh ways to convey your message and if you find that offensive, then SORRY.",

OP, you have been suggested some content that will help you understand the purpose of Bitcoin and the forum.Yeah, the forum has different boards, ranging from Bitcoin technical, Bitcoin discussion, Bitcoin development, Bitcoin mining, etc. You just need to be active on the forum, and in a little time you will be able to know how to source information on the forum. The forum also has a search button, which allows you to peruse the forum and probably find your results if any such discussions have occurred. If you can't find any results, you can go over to any board that you think is very appropriate for your topic and create a new one.",
