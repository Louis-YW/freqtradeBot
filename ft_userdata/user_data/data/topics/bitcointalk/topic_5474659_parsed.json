Take note that all the fee you pay when making a transaction from a non-custodial wallet goes to miners and non-custodial wallets doesn't charge you any extra fee at all. The fee you have to pay depends on number of inputs and outputs, address(es) type, how congested the network is and how fast you want your transaction to confirmed. Different (non-custodial) wallets may use different methods for fee estimation and many of them even allow you to set the fee rate by yourself. It's only custodial services like exchanges that charge high fees when you request a withdrawal.",

Schedule your transaction during weekends so that you can send transactions using normal fees. I just recently sent a transaction using 3.5$ fee with just a day of waiting. Be patient is the only way to pay less since the fee will slow down at some point so just send a transaction using low fee around 4$ and just wait to for the fee to slow down. People rushing in to send transactions is the reason why the fee is continuously rising.",

If yes, in times like this, their fee is even worse than what it's being charged for normal transactions executing.If you are not just buying to hold and it's for business purposes, I mean, if you accept payment in exchange for the service you render, it will be highly advisable if you can change that payment option because you might end up running losses as a result of you paying that high amount or fee. And if you are also buying for investment purposes, if you consider the amount you buy and the amount you pay for the fee, you will notice that you might be spending more than you are accumulating unless you are buying in large quantities. The fee is high everywhere, but I will advise you to make use of a wallet that can allow you to decide your fee, which you will choose based on how fast you want the transaction to be, and for small transactions, there are free accelerators there for you to use, as Charles has suggested.",

So, you can try using another wallet that supports SegWit addresses to reduce transaction fees by optimizing the use of block space.You can probably customize the fees in the Blockchain wallet. This way, you can adjust the fee settings. However, before doing this, you should have a fee estimator tool. I used to visit a website before conducting Bitcoin transactions that provided real-time fee estimates, but I can't find it anymore. I would have shared it with you, but there are similar tools available.Customizing the fee has its risks, as setting it too low might result in slower confirmation times or even rejection. If you want, try using a different wallet with lower fees compared to others to find the most cost-effective solution for your needs.If you're open to using alternative coins, consider using LTC or BCH. Depending on your needs, you might explore other cryptocurrencies with lower transaction fees for specific use cases.",

Yes you can customize your transaction with trustwallet but still it is not suitable for use when broadcasting bitcoin transaction because it doesn’t have an RBF opt in. Where this will be a case is when you set a fee and suddenly your estimation goes wrong then you need to bump the fee without the RBF opt in from the start it will be impossible to bump the transaction from your end. Although this days almost all nodes are now going full RBF but still you can use better wallets like Electrum that have this features Quote from: Saisher on November 19, 2023, 02:32:55 PMThe miners only prioritize transactions with high fees there is no solution to pay lesser fees when the volume is too high, the only solution is to wait until the congestion eases up, you can use a wallet that uses RBF and send it the amount that you can afford so when congestion ease up you can rebroadcast it and always check Mempool to trace the transaction fees and priority.RBF doesn’t really rebroadcast your transaction but rather replaces it with a new that has higher fees. If you’re not really ready to pay high fees during this period it is better to go through the ViaBTC free accelerator with all requirements meant or just leave the transaction till the congestion reduces",

And for you it would also mean to consider using LN for 10$ transactions (the on-chain fee doesn't depend on the amount of value you are sending).I've also made my homework some time ago by consolidating the funds/transactions where possible.And as said, for on-chain tx, ViaBTC accelerator is your friend. And a huge lot of patience.However, as a disclaimer, I know it's easier to give advises than following them: in the past few weeks I didn't need to spend much, so my advice is based on my past actions (it's not the first time the fees go up \"too much\"; it's even not the worse situation we've ever had).",

Because life is not smooth, transaction fees are not cheap forever on Bitcoin blockchain or any altcoin blockchain.They must have a little bit money in Bitcoin, stable coin or cash. Make sure they will always have money to use with different ways and don't waste their money by expensive fees.",

Some people mentioned LTC and BCH but DOGE is also widely adopted and provide cheap transactions too. The last solution is to use a custodial platform like an exchange or a casino, with low or free withdrawal fees and to use it as wallet.
