      "body": "The main thing to keep in mind is that with most camera possibly all of the hardware wallets out there today they are using standardized chips to perform the functions. So yes these chips might be doing something shady, but and this is important, it would be doing it for all the devices that they are used on. So if something was wrong with them it would not just involve hardware wallets.Also, there are many eyes on these chips camera so while yet again they could be doing what they are doing, some very brilliant cryptographers and security people probably would have already seen something being “off\" with them. They might not know exactly what is wrong, but they would know something is wrong. At the end of the day it's been proven time and time again back the humans that use the devices are by far the weakest link.There are people that keep using certain hardware wallets even though they have been proven to be security risks or outright vulnerable to attacks. And yet they are still being sold and people are still using. At that point, why would you even bother making a chip that is vulnerable, it's easier just to start your own hardware wallet manufacturing company and sell it cheap enough that people buy it no matter how much other people scream that it's not secure.-Dave",

      "body": "I'm not sure how many HW manufacturers do it already in their code. They shouldn't rely on a single TRNG as source for entropy but rather combine multiple RNG sources, combine them safely (no expert here, I guess XORing them is enough) and thus no single \"rigged\" *RNG source from any chip in the HW can spoil entropy used to generate the seed and nonces. (I know that the BitBox02 uses multiple sources of entropy for seed generation and likely for nonce generation, too. I haven't checked the source code by myself yet, though.).To particularly address the nonce covert channel attack there's the Anti-Klepto Protocol, explained here as implemented in the BitBox02. Please, forgive my focus on BitBox02 as an example for in my opinion suitable countermeasures. It's just that I informed myself a lot about this HW and consider it a good one. It's not perfect, but which HW is?",

Trust me, been there, done that.Keep in mind most of these chips cost below $1 when dealing in the single unit price and drop to $0.80 or less when dealing in quantity. They don't want to talk to you for 2500 of them, they want to sell to Mouser or Digikey and have them deal with you:https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Microchip-Technology/ATECC608B-MAHDA-S?qs=sPbYRqrBIVnKfPKcuUlUgg%3D%3Dhttps://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/ATECC608B-MAHDA-S/13415130?s=N4IgTCBcDaIAQEEAqBRAwmgbABgBwCEBaAWQQAkARBQgZRAF0BfIAEven when you get to the higher end chips, you are still under $3.00 each in quantity 10+:https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Analog-Devices-Maxim-Integrated/DS28C36BQ%2bT?qs=vLWxofP3U2zN7T53brV95A%3D%3DI guess the best way to put it, is one of the clients for my day job is a board level component manufacturer. When I need a part that is in their 'sample pack' or small local warehouse I can grab it from them if I am in the area. But if I need 25 of a part, THEY send me to digikey....-Dave",

      "body": "Meanwhile the official doc describing security of STM32 microcontrollers wildly used in HW caught my eye. As it states they may undergo various type of outbreaks  and although  their design countermesures many of those attacks HW makers must take extra special measures to eliminate/mitigate possible threats.Even MCU of air-gapped HW may be under the threats. Say those of them which utilize NFS protocol to communicate with software proxies may be vulnerable if that protocol have some  weaknesses. That is why it is very important for HW to be open sourced. Very dangerous (and at the same  time the most cost-involved)  are hardware invasive attacks which are possible at direct access to device. So each HW  possessed by you  must be considered as device to which you and only you have access, no one else.Quote from: https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/dm00493651-introduction-to-stm32-microcontrollers-security-stmicroelectronics.pdf",
