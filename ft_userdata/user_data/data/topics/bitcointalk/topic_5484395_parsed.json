All miners, especially pro miners already have the halving in mind. And they also realize that most likely the hashrate won’t decline which is what happened in the past. So if they are still investing money into the future after the halving date it means they are confident of bitcoin future performance.",

Well, it's also good for the network, since a higher hashrate means more security. What I wonder is whether increasing the energy level for mining won't fuel the narrative that Bitcoin consumes too much energy and is not environmentally friendly.Quote from: mk4 on February 07, 2024, 12:45:20 PMI mean, the only way for them to maintain their current revenue is to double their hardware/hashrate yea? Gotta make the investor reports not look like that revenue didn't just cut in half. Unless bitcoin's price doubles, in which yea it's possible — but it's uncertain.Most of us believe it is most likely. It is certainly not a sure thing, but like everything in life and in investments, there is always a risk you have to take, a level of gamble that you don't know if it will work out. That double price would mean reaching $90K and I think all of us in this think it will reach and pass $100K, otherwise it's going to be the most catastrophic cycle by far since Bitcoin was launched.",

At any point it is wise for a bitcoin mining company to increase their mining machines. There will probably be shortages of miners during the bull run though so it makes sense to do this now when it'll likely be easier and cheaper to acquire a bunch of miners.",
