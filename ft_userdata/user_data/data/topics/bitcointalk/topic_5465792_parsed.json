      "body": "When making investment decisions on a particular token, one should look beyond just the price impact since it was launched but rather at the use case of such a coin, as what the coin can be used for is among the things that can sustain its price longevity, as token prices can now be manipulated by project teams just to draw the attention of investors no matter the place or network that token is being developed. Another thing is that just because a coin that was recently launched has done 10 times does not mean it will do another 10 times in the coming weeks, as the week to come might be its time for correction, so always be mindful of what you buy.",

This ecosystem was not as good as you think. You just saw a token but you have not seen the performance of all of tokens in the base network. It's not even worth investing, but this actually depends on the how well the fundamental owned by the token itself. Base network owned by coinbase but scammers were trying to do the same like when they were issuing so many tokens on BSC for scamming purpose. You must be careful with it. I think that if there have been so many awareness about this. I have been only receiving my aerodrome airdrop on base. I never trade other token because it's very risky.",

If the network succeeds, the price of the native token will increase, and if it fails, then all tokens on the base network will inevitably decrease its value.any new network does not attract large projects due to the possibility of defects in the network or excessive centralization, so it rarely grows quickly.",

The only coin I can tell someone to invest on is bitcoin and maybe other good coins that has been existing already and having high market cap. The token you are token about is on another new blockchain, people will go for it, but if the price startes to fall, it can be a huge loss for someone. Gamble with these coins and if possibly that you make money from the little amount of money that you are able to afford to lose that you invested on it, convert the profit and the token to a better coin like bitcoin.",

Because if it's new, even if we say it's 100x, that's still not an assurance to say that the token you're talking about has potential. It's still good to do your own research so you don't regret it later and don't waste the capital you'll use for that token.Besides that, is there an exchange you're talking about? Maybe that's because you're just getting carried away by the hype because the token is new in this crypto industry. You must know how to pick legitimate and illegitimate tokens or coins so that the capital you use will surely generate income.",

This has been the attribute of most of the shitcoins that have nothing to offer that can aid their sustainability in the market,  what is also most important is another significant fact that the project mentioned has no track record so this makes it hard for us to properly analyze the possibility of its future,  aside from the pump attributes the coin exhibit.",

What base network is that? That's always the case that I have been seeing with them, when a newly launched network has come. There have been tons of new projects trying in and maybe they'll be at the top of the attraction from that network.But as a basic rule, I'll only invest if I am sure with what I am about to do and done necessary things like DYOR.

Always DYOR on every investment we do make, we do have tons of looking like legit projects but ending up on being a scam or rugpull on which this is something that you should really be looking careful or be wary.This is why it would really be always important that you should know on when to get in and when to get out specially when you are in profits. If you do see that a project does have some potentialthen it would be a risk taking thing if you do decide to hold it for long term. Cant blame down into those people who do really look for those opportunities on finding out a gem which could bring out 1000x profit into them and this is why the search would really be a never ending thing.Quote from: Hildentine on September 06, 2023, 06:21:13 PMI think anyone who wants to invest in crypto specially in new chain token first read the important points of project then invest if anyone blind invest any project so its many chances they are loss in this .My experience is that first gain knowledge about crypto second project see there roadmap etc then try to invest choose strong project.The hardest part on having this kind of verification on every project that you do encounter a good looking ones but ending up on a scamand to those projects who do look shit but ending up on being pumped and been supported. This what makes your mind boggled on what the heck is the mindset of these investors or with those whales but of course you should really be careful with those casual pumps and dumps on this market.",
