They are doubting the notion that stablecoins are \"stable,\" arguing that issuers lack the necessary tools to keep their stablecoin peg at all times, implying that no stablecoin currently meets their recommendations.This is what they said about it:“Most existing stablecoin issuers promise (implicitly or explicitly) to maintain a stable value, typically relative to a single fiat currency. However, many of these existing stablecoins are issued by unregistered and unlicensed entities and do not have credible mechanisms to support their promise of price stability.”What do you guys think about this?

Since it is a centralized managed by a 3rd party, holding them is not too different when you hold the currency, your assets can be frozen or locked at any time. Stablecoins are quite an important part of the market, the use of which is sometimes mandatory because we need to use them in some cases like DCA, or have to use them when the market starts to fluctuate...we need stable assets to avoid a bear market. You can use them normally but don't keep them for too long will not benefit you.",

      "body": "Depends on how you would define 'safe'. If you mean \"safe from losses\", technically it is not  simply because currencies especially cryptos' market value are naturally volatile. Stable coins are not really 'stable', it is just that their market prices does not move that much from a price point unlike with other cryptos which often break barriers depending on market behavior. But indeed it would be less risky to invest your money with, in comparison with others.If it is 'safe' from hacking, fraud, and the likes, that would depend on the network that particular currency is using as well as its security in general. Safer to invest, yes. Less risk of losing huge amount of money, also yes. But keep in mind that the bigger the risk, the bigger the profit, so quite balance things out depending on your aim as an investment. You should not expect that much of profit if you will be choosing stable coins as investment.",

But yes with the advent of P2P it's easy to handle stable coins to fiat and very quick.But still the question though, it is safe, as we don't know if this stable coins projects are back up 1:1 against the dollar or they are just running on fractional reserves just like bank. Really hard to answer this though, for me, I used stable coins, but I don't put everything on them. And if I will ever had to transfer my crypto to stable coins, I will simply withdraw it P2P.",

Unlike exchanges which get hacked or scam people out of their coins. Which is why I would also say USDT is safer than BUSD. Simply because of BUSD's connection to Binance through the Binance Smart Chain (as well as because of the chains pseudo-centralized nature.)Although With ETH 2.0, I would rate USDT lower and put both of them on the same level of trust.",

Moreover, thanks to p2p, it is very easy and very fast to do.Why should I store stablecoin when I am not ready to use it for transactions, stablecoin has its price peg to centralized currencies like united states dollars and from time to time the price may fluctuate but it will definitely bounce back to its fixed price that is a peg with. The bit in some situations like that of the Luna USTD crash where the stablecoin crumble, so the risk of holding it is still there. It then becomes better to always have the coins converted totally into fiat to avoid holding a large chunk of coins that do not have any potential to increase but decrease at the interval.",

These are two same different things as Algrothmic stable coins are good in terms of the asset's scalability and transparency that reserves are clear and these coins are trustworthy but about their peg system, UST is an example.On another hand there USDT and USDC no clear reserves but their + point is their stability and peg system reserves are highly sheddy and these are non-trustworthy.",
