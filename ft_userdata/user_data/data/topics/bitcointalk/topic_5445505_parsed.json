Why pretend they won't ask for KYC, but ask for verification after a big win. While my lack of knowledge has kept me away from several big online casinos in this forum, I decided to do some additional research in my spare time.Some Facts Why KYC Verification is a Necessity For Online Casinos.~Online gambling businesses have become more attractive since the Covid19 days, more money entered the gambling business, making the attention very noticeable, also a good opportunity for the law to go after them.~There are penalties on online gambling necks too, they have to implement anti-money laundering procedures just to survive, many online gambling platforms faced the panel in the past and ceased to exist. ~You have no idea how much these companies spend per year just to be friendly to the law and pass criterion regulations and business procedures, it is called intense regulation, to avoid fines. ~The only way these people can avoid the mistake of allowing fraudsters into their system ( gambling platform ) is by having KYC and AML (anti-money laundering ) in place. ~If you see another way that I don't, do drop your comment, because people can't be trusted, they will pretend to be a random online gambler but they have other bad intentions in mind. From now henceforth, my assumptions about KYC verification from reputable online gambling platforms have changed, I seek for answers and I find them, drop your opinions if you think I am wrong or you think this is not accurate enough.",

All of that could be part of the terms of service (TOS), or they are required by regulators to verify their clients once they hit a big amount of money. Sometimes, not all the information we need to know is present in the TOS, but as long as it's legally enforceable, we can't blame the gambling site for doing their job to comply with the regulators.Unless in the case of scam casinos.",

This guarantees security for the end user, because if the casino in question is regulated and respects the law, the chances that it will provide an honest and reliable service will be even greater.If an online casino is not regulated or not monitored by a third party, the risk of exit scams, frozen-accounts and frozen-funds is higher. You can't have everything without paying a certain price for it ; regulations offer security to the user but cost him some of his online privacy and personnal datas.It's a choice to make, but the choice to send your funds to a shady platform is rarely to the advantage of the end user in the long run.",

Casino doesn’t pretend that they won’t ask KYC. User just assumed it by not reading the ToS. Their ToS stated that they can ask KYC anytime. They just didn’t do it on the spot when you register.I hate KYC too but if this is what the law requires then we have no choice if we really want to still use the service. We have a choice to avoid using it. KYC is not necessary to ask by decentralized casino or casino without gambling license.",

      "body": "When you complain about your knowledge of Casino rules, it seems that you are familiar with the existing rules, especially the KYC rules.You even elaborated on why KYC is necessary for online casinos. Reading all the explanations of facts about KYC in online casinos, it all depends on how the policies of each online casino owner, and the role of the government also become very important in the regulations used. The application of KYC as you explained is to avoid Online Casinos being used as Money Laundering sites. Because it is a crime that tries to eliminate traces of transactions through gambling sites. And online casinos that apply KYC and AML regulations are online casinos that are legal and licensed by the local government. Some online casinos that operate without KYC and do not even get permission from the government are Illegal casinos and are dangerous for users who play there. Casinos that apply KYC also request KYC at certain times such as when withdrawing assets with the minimum amount required to do KYC or complete personal data without or requiring additional documents. For more details about KYC regulations, you can read each FAQ or ToS of the Online Casino, there will be a detailed explanation of how the regulations function and must be obeyed.",

Casinos enforce KYC because there are requirements that are mandatory KYC is due to a license used by casinos so that as much as possible casinos will ask KYC for all their customers with the aim of fulfilling the license requirements used. Maybe there are some casinos that don't ask for KYC but To be honest, I personally doubt whether they can be trusted to make it a favorite place to gamble.2. Some casinos do say that they don't require KYC but in the end where when a customer gets a big win and wants to withdraw funds as a whole the casino will ask for verification or KYC with the aim of avoiding unwanted things like money laundering and so on.We as gamblers must be able to understand all of that and be able to react properly.",

I can understand where you are coming from, yeah, its messy and we don't like KYC, but it is what it is, it has changed a lot as I have said. They are being mandated now which is wrong, but they have to follow it so that they can remain in the space as it will be very hard for this casinos to exist without any KYC specially for big wins. So it's either you submit or not. Just for comparison though, even if you go landbased casinos and wanted to take advantage of their freebies, you will have to fill out forms and your information too.",

Another reason for implementing KYC is to remove anyone below the age of 18. Anonymous casinos fail to filter users below the age of that age. Almost every country only allows users 18 or above to gamble. If anyone is found below 18 then the law of the land prosecutes both the platform and the user. KYC helps detect those users but there is a loophole. Kids now days are very smart they can easily manipulate parents to go through online KYC in the disguise of playing online games that requires credit/debit card. Parents as they are busy with their own life always go through such manipulation and only come to sense when they see their bank bills.",

I think them asking for KYC only on big wins is a marketing strategy, I mean the idea of KYC is totally outside of the users mind during registration since they weren't asked, so they'll just proceed as usual but when winning big or withdrawing, they'd suddenly ask of that and at that point, some (if not most) users would probably have the mindset of \"might as well do it since I'm already here\", which would retain them as users of said casino. There's also considering the fact that KYC at registration simply damages the casinos capability to attract user base since they probably know themselves how people hate KYC.",

But sincerely speaking, it would have been better if KYC is mandatory before depositing into your gambling account on any gambling site, but gambling sites makes KYC not necessary for deposit while it is necessary during withdrawal. Assuming you are from a restricted country, you gambled and later the gambling site know about it just because you want to withdraw. But if you do not want to withdraw, you will keep depositing into the gambling account and if you continue to lose, nothing like the gambling site knowing if you are even over 18 and the likes. In this matter, I always which all gambling sites that makes KYC to be compulsory to make the KYC mandatory for deposit after registration.",

I personally aren't willing to give my identification to someone but somehow it's needed as per casino license and their anti-cheating. There are risk on giving your identification such as your KYC information might be sold to someone or get hacked and be used on something not good such as illegal activities.
