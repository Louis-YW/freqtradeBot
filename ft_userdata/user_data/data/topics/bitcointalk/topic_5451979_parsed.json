It's a good activity to play games, I usually don't miss the majors. I started watching the matches to analyze. I made my predictions because I got a Paris viewer pass, I must say that I am doing well for now.My Pick'em guess is that the G2 team will win 3-0, no doubt. They've already done 2-0, an easy stage for G2.For the team that will lose 3 times, I chose fluxo after being stuck between Mongolz and Pain. It is enough to make 5 correct guesses, passers know., I guaranteed two. There are teams such as Faze, Ence, Monte and Forze in the teams that will go on tour. I think it will be easy.",

      "body": "ENCE and G2 started the tournament very well and advanced to the next round with 3-0.So far MOUZ and Team Liquid have been huge disappointments, MOUZ eliminated 0-3 and Team Liquid lost first map after 0-2. I thought Liquid could beat Fluxo in Game 3 but they played the Nuke map so badly. Especially EliGE was unexpectedly bad from him. When they were on the T side, they couldn't provide map control and Fluxo started winning rounds in a row.I thought The MongolZ would do 0-3, but they managed to win the 2nd map. They defeated GamerLegion at Inferno. My Pick 'Em predictions were compromised.",

As you said, this increases the importance of the tournament even more.We are currently waiting for the legends stage in the tournament. My predictions are not good so far so I continue as a spectator, I don't bet.I wonder how the teams that manage to constantly participate in tournaments will perform when they switch to the Source 2 engine. Because I have experienced the game in beta phase and it can really make a big difference in the way the teams play.",

It's normal for Fluxo to be eliminated because they were really bad. I expected OG to play better, that team was also a huge disappointment. I thought The MongolZ would lose 0-3 but they won against GamerLegion. FORZE Esports was my other choice, they didn't make it to the next round.I got 5 wins in my Pick 'Em picks. It's going well for now.I watched many matches in this round and got a general knowledge about the teams. There have been big differences in teams since the last tournament. Now, it's necessary to carefully examine the teams that have just started the tournament.All of the teams that came out of the Challengers Stage, except GamerLegion and Monte, seem to be strong enough to push the others.The tournament is taking a one-day break and we will have time to make our Legends Stage predictions.",

NaVi and ITB are currently the teams I am eyeing at for this last Major, with G2 and ENCE on the runners-up should the first two decides to fuck things up and just drop out of the tournament. Surprised that OG didn’t qualify to the next stage though, as I believe they have decent firepower and strats in their bag. I don’t know much about Monte except for sdy, but damn, they managed to qualify compared to Mouz and OG whom a lot of people are expecting to at least not get eliminated that fast.",

On the Vertigo map, G2 came from behind but Fnatic didn't give up and won the map. Fnatic played the end of the match very well. The next matches are open to surprises.",

I have confirmed my final pick'eml preferences.I also made my selections for the champions stage. I assumed he would win at Major Vitality home, Zywoo should continue to perform very well.I think the hardest match at this stage will be Liquid-Apeks. Apex was my choice. Monte is a very fit team, I followed what they were doing to Navi. He was so bad in the S1mple Monte match that it might be his worst performance in recent times. Monte is a pretty good team, as I said, they didn't even let a player like s1mple play. In my last choice, I chose Heroic on the faze-Heroic side. Faze even came here with the support of a little luck. In particular, they had a very bad time in bo1 matches.",

Just saw Woro2k and DemQQ clobber the lights out of Simple and his team, and it's so satisfying after the beef they had on twitter where Woro2k seemed to predict that he'd step on Simple's name and team soon. And this being the final tournament before GO becomes CS2 just puts so much salt on the wound. I hope after this, Simple works on his ego and the way he treats his teammates. It's clearly the problem here considering sdy, a previous teammate of theirs was able to win 16-2 with Monte after being kicked out of NaVi cause they thought he was the problem, well this game just solidifies that it's Simple and his negative attitude. Anyways, playoffs is coming soon, hope to see more from Monte, but my money's still on Heroic and Vitality.",
