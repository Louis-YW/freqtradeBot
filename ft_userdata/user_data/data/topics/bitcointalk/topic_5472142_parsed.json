  "content": "ADVFN, also known as \"Investorshub\" or \"IHub\", had their crypto coin PlusOneCoin (https://plusonecoin.org) hijackjed.It suffered a rare 51% attack all week long. Someone loaded up a bunch of PlusOneCoin network servers, then ran up the hash to nearly 20X the average rate (about 3-4.5TH/s) for an HMQ1725 coin, and mined it from nearly .06 cents to .004 and left. All while lowering the difficult to next to nothing.They appear to have left now that there's nothing left and returned the difficulty back to where it was. (can be seen at https://blockchain.plusonecoin.org)Can read about it here.. The admins over there don't want to talk about it.https://investorshub.advfn.com/PlusOneCoin-PLUS1USD-32755https://pasteboard.co/CUMKbWwAELmU.pnghttps://pasteboard.co/HJlAPIcTsysY.png",

Also, now that this has happened... a lot of these Shitcoins will be shunned for it's weak security.Â  There has only been one attack that came close to a 51% attack on Bitcoin and the miners in those pools decided on their own... not to support it, because they knew a 51% attack would have destroyed the confidence in the technology and the value of their coin would have collapsed if it was successful.",

      "body": "Shit coins usually have shitty future. That's another example why we should not invest in shit. If someone is not willing to invest in Bitcoin or ETH, it is better to invest in Gold and stocks. And honestly, buying such coins is a pure form of gambling. You never know how long they are going to exist. The crypto community do not need thousands of coins in the market. It's just way too much crowded now.",

      "body": "It also shows that these less maintained coins can be easily hijacked and zero'd out..probably by using 0days and malware.Suddenly you can take the hash rate up and load up some servers and mine the coin until it is dead. I've never seen a 51% but it looks like it's happened to a few coins. I bet many aren't reported. Advfn is traded on the London Exchange and the person who started the coin owns a blockchain company in the UK called blockchain.io and hails crypto.He's probably going to wake up pissed tomorrow.",

      "body": "Well, just one of the many clear and proven risks when decides to go into gambling form of coins whose future is designed to go pump and dump. Though I am sure that we have many gamblers even in this forum who are taking some \"calculated\" risks with the hope they can strike the gold they are looking for. As to people like me who is prudent and got no money to wager then we should not entertain the idea of buying just another worthless coin or token. My hats off to gamblers though for being great risk takers.",
