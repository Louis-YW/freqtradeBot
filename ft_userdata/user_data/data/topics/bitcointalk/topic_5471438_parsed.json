Fighting between Jewish armed groups, some of which the British regarded as terrorist organisations, and Palestinians escalated until the armies of Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan and Syria invaded after Israel declared independence in May 1948.ill let you follow the rabbit hole of the british mandate and the politics of <1947",

I only wonder will this war causes the inflation worse?Generally speaking, any war can cause the prices of commodities and services to go up for many reasons and on top of the heap is scarcity and the increasing demand, not unless majority of the people in a certain country can be decimated so demand for many stuffs is critically reduced. Now, having said that, the concern is on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza and as far as my country is concerned we already experienced a little increase in the price of gasoline here since we are an importing country and usually an uptick in the price of this commodity can affect prices of the common goods in the market. Let's hope the war will not spread, otherwise this can be catastrophic on our end.",

Wars are unpredictable on how they will end and with what cost after all war processes.The war of Israel, Hamas in Gaza will be bad because they are located in Middle East that is a hub of oil and any dramatic war in this area will result in rise of oil prices.

We know oil can affect many industries and aspects of society in many countries.Aside from the oil price hike, there is danger in the oil explosion because of the vulnerability of the area and there is a huge interest in such situations from other countries of interest.  Every country is trying to protect it's interest as far as the resources of the states are concerned.QuoteLet's hope Israel, Hamas and Iran, USA will not escalate this war from between two nations to area war and many allies will join it.I am scared of all of these fights and bombings that are going on, in this conflicts because this is the nature of how other world wars began. From two countries of interest in conflict then other countries will join the war especially the bigger countries in support of both parties.This is similar to what happened at the Austro-Hungary and Serbia conflict where the Austro-Hungarian armed forces occupied Serbia thereby invading the Bosnia and ceasing all the trade routes around the borders. This was what spite up the guys from both sides of the country to degenerate into war.",

Russian invasion to Ukraine is not done yet, but Russian is top 3 country who own oil, this make oil shortage to countries which previously used to import from Russia. Didn't their issue start 2 years after the world war 2? With Israel failing and firmly declining Palestine's right to sovereignty? It's even funny that Israel isn't even a legitimate state by conventional standards and they are the ones that are oppressing Palestine. On another discussion, I suppose the war provided that it keeps on will do some number on the economy of the countries who would participate. It's a little concerning for me that we got different countries fighting off against each other nowadays, makes me think that a world-war is going to happen soon or something.",

So the headlines about it are bound to always be present in the mainstream media specially in countries that support this terrorist organization, in this case UK trying to cover up the genocide.QuoteI don't discuss geopolitics here. I only wonder will this war causes the inflation worse?In short not unless it expands.This time it is different because this time nobody in West Asia is tolerating Western support of this terrorist organization so they have been declaring war on US specially after POTUS visited the organization's headquarters and increased the supply of bombs used to kill Palestinian children. Over the past two week all US military bases that are illegally occupying Iraq and Syria have been getting attacked regularly and US casualties are already in 3 digits. Last night other groups in different countries joined in and declared that other US bases in West Asia such as in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait are legitimate targets as long as US continues supporting the Israeli terrorists. I haven't seen any news regarding attacks on these targets but if those bases start getting attacked it could significantly affect oil price which in turn affects the inflation.Additionally these attacks have been \"light\" so far, using loitering munitions, rockets and shells taking small number of casualties from US military. More importantly US CENTCOM has not dared respond to any of these attacks.If CENTCOM decides to retaliate against any of them, the attacks will change in nature and become \"heavier\" using missiles with heavier warheads and deadlier loitering munitions and using much larger number. Which would also expand the conflict to the seas, namely Red Sea (Suez Canal, Bab al-Mandab Strait), Persian Gulf (Strait of Hurmuz), etc. that would not only affect oil and gas supply of the entire world but also affects the international trade by shutting down the trade route through Suez Canal. This can cause hyper inflation very quickly.",
