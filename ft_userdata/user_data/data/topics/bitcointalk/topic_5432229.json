  "content": "Towards the end of 2022 We all know that in 2022 the crypto market experienced a very violent storm, especially until the price of Bitcoin fell by -60% of its ATH, several events pushed bitcoin to fall as it is now, which I know include;1. Tera LunaTechnically, Terra Luna was not bankrupt but the monumental crash cost the owners of LUNA and UST an estimated $60 billion in losses. and pulled other companies into the abyss of their demise.2. Three Arrows Capital (3AC)Bankrupted on July 1, 2022, the main cause was due to the ownership of the LUNA token which collapsed with UST due to a massive sell-off. They owe an estimated $3.5 billion to 27 different companies including Blockchain.com, Voyager Digital, and Genesis Global Trading.3. Digital VoyagerBankrupt after 3AC, July 5, 2022, due to financial difficulties resulting from a loss of $650 million in 3AC. the latest news is that Voyager Digital was acquired by Binance for a $1.22 billion ransom.4. CelsiusBankrupt on July 13 due to a prolonged Bear market and also affected by the bankruptcy of 3AC, because they borrowed $75 million from 3AC and have a total debt of $5.5 billion.5. Comput North (Bitcoin mining)This mining company went bankrupt on September 22, 2022, due to a falling Bitcoin price and economic difficulties which were triggered by an increase in energy costs for mining, its assets were sold out.6. FTX Group & Alameda Research Declared bankrupt on November 11th, destroyed after massive liquidation by its customers, this was triggered by CZ selling all Native FTT tokens, because these tokens were used as collateral or debt guarantees to borrow money by Alameda Research.7. BlockFiFiled for bankruptcy on November 28 due to its association with FTX, BlockFi estimates that it has $1 billion in assets, while the company's total liabilities or debts are at least $10 billion.8. GenesisHad temporarily stopped withdrawing user funds citing \"unprecedented market turmoil\" after the FTX collapse, but was saved by creditors from the crash crisis.9. Core ScientificIts shares plunged to 30% of resources sold out on December 21 and declared bankruptcy, but its bitcoin mining continues, it is said, to cover debts.All of these incidents have had a significant effect on the price of Bitcoin, I can't go into detail because it would be too long and too much drama, but other than that, we have to take lessons from every incident that happened in 2022 as knowledge to be better for the future.So, have you expressed your rage for 2022, and what have you learned from all of this in 2022?Tell me if I missed something#happyNewYearBitcointalk",

Many say this is a game of fear and greed and I mostly agree with it.I learnt that does not matter how strong and stable a platform looks, one should never leave one's coins there, in consequence I reduced by exposition to centralized exchanges.I also confirmed that those services which offered interests on one's Bitcoin (Blockfi and Celcius) were nothing but a ticking bomb.I hope you did not suffered much losses and can let go your \"rage\" in a constructive and healthy way.",

I learned a lot of lessons especially about taking profits if you are trading or investing with a goal.It seems these entities went bankrupt is part of the bear market, it's part of the cycle where the market corrects, there are some entities that are affected but not all, and some of here are indeed misused of funds and intended to fraud the people.",

The growth of cryptocurrency and the increasing adoption have caused massive crash in the market. Same time the economic situation around the world at its worst makes things go even worse. To make a recovery it takes time, as the upcoming bullish move is predicted to be close to halving scheduled for 2024.More and more things learnt from the year 2022. Beyond all these issues, the best learning is to trust bitcoin than any other altcoins.",

We all know that majority of privacy coins has been delisted, so maybe next year we will hear such services again at the helm of US government.I appreciate the highlight on that article!. I had almost forgot about what happened to Tornado Cash.Nonetheless, the lesson we can learn from this is different from the situation on the privacy coins. The fact privacy coins are getting their liquidity and acceptance attacked for obvious reasons, it is an \"old\" precedent, it has been going on since 2020 with the delisting of DASH, Zcash and Monero on somw exchanges and also the reward the United States government offered to anyone able to develop tools to track monero transactions.The Tornado cash drama, on the other hand, can teach us one can get arrested and charged by developing software aiming to improve privacy, which sound very dystopic. Or was that guy charged for any other crimes?",

Bitcoin was doing good that time, hovering above $20k when suddenly this news broke out and then we go on another lowest lows.Of course the obvious lessons, \"not your keys, not your coins\", adage, do not leave your precious crypto to any crypto exchanges otherwise you will be the another victim, another statistics if it collapses because of mismanagement or collapse of the system.",

Regardless of the market, as an investment, there will always be risks, so the lesson here I want to tell you is that when you accept an investment, you must take into account the risks that you will face, not only think about profit.

Though I can't relate because I don't have funds on other platforms and keep them in my own wallet, it is really the best thing to do if it happens again (which I hope it doesn't) because it is not safe because everything would be a problem on a bear market and it was also affected by the recession. In \"green days,\" we really don't have a problem at all, as most of the exchange platforms are doing well, but when \"bear days\" come, that is really a huge problem, as there are possibilities that they would be closing due to the price constantly dropping.",
