On the other hand, Royse777 is right to consult a lawyer before making any other move, as things stand. It goes to show how much campaign participants do not use the service they promote. Because if they did, they would not deposit the bitcoins into a centralized exchange directly. I don’t think coinjoin helps because I suspect Binance may just add the user to their watchlist. I thought we all expect a platform that requires its users to perform KYC will not accept mixed or as they like to call it “tainted” coins. Binance is doing a lot of crypto policing these days, and considering recent events in the company it seems they will be willingly to do anything to get in the good graces of crypto regulators. I think Royse777 made a good call. No manager wants to be in this type of situation.",

I mean, neither of those are smart things to do but I am curious how deep Binance actually goes in their investigation. I think that in the event that the funds went directly from the campaign address to CEX, there can be no doubt as to where they came from and that is a problem for anyone who received payments in that way - while in the event that there is another address in between, there can be justified suspicion that the client is not directly connected to the mixer.I think that CEX never seriously analyzed the transactions in the sense that it froze funds that have to do something with \"mixed coins\" that are not directly related to any major crime. In other words, I never got bad feedback from the people I sent payments to their B accounts, but of course I never allowed those transactions to be in any way connected to the addresses I used in the campaigns. In other words, even though the coins were \"mixed\", it was never a problem for the exchange.",
