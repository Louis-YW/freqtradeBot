The report exposes decentralization weaknesses, outdated Bitcoin nodes, and Ethereum Smart Contracts code quality.Decentralization, node versions, and code quality are known and reasonable problems but network immutability is a totally different kind of problem. Is it real? If true is it solvable?https://www.vanticatrading.com/post/pentagon-releases-study-on-bitcoin-vulnerabilities",

      "body": "Permit me to mention your first mistake, this is strictly a bitcoin discussion board, so why the altcoin inclusive? Secondly, when we are talking about immutability, it means something that can not be altered, this is the basic reason why the trust in bitcoin and the blockchain technology is assured else many organizations, companies, industries and the government couldn't have adooted the use of blockchain technology and its application in medical health, sport, politics, finance, music, games, economy, and many aspects of the economy applicable for the safe keeping of their record data etc. Unlike the centralized service providers like that of online storage with examples like icloud, google drive and drop box. Blockchain technology is the solution to centralized online storage systems mentioned above and its been in use all because of the genuine trust in it to be decentralized and immutable.",

      "body": "I am reading some paragraphs on the original PF document. To be honest, I probably don't have enough knowledge to dissect what is said and to try to counter the arguments, but at a first look, it looks to me like it's more a list of extreme scenarios where some of those arguments could eventually happen! One argument which I consider an extreme scenario is that all ISPs in the world may block the type of traffic related to the Bitcoin blockchain. What woul be the odds of something like this to happen? Seems to me a little bit overkill scenarios, but ok, we have to take them as possible even if with infinitesimal chances to happen, in my point of view!Edited;Take a look at this debunkhttps://www.swanbitcoin.com/fact-check-darpa-funded-report-on-blockchain-centralization/",

      "body": "reading through it. makes me laugh more then reading a comedy script. so here goes, (expect some laughs), i wont list them all.. but here is just one..QuoteWhen nodes have an out-of-date or incorrect view of the network, this lowers thepercentage of the hashrate necessary to execute a standard 51% attack. Moreover,only the nodes operated by mining pools need to be degraded to carry out such an attackQuoteIf a node operator’s self-interest is to be dishonest, then there is no explicitpenalty for doing so. Moreover, the number of entities necessary to execute a 51% attackon Bitcoin was reduced from 51% of the entire network (which we estimate atapproximately 59,000 nodes) to only the four most popular mining pool nodes (less than0.004% of the network)their summary translated:overall. they try to conclude* that turning off four nodes (mining pools) can reduce the hashrate to make it cheaper for a malicious pool to match the good network rate.. now my waffle.. a 51% attack is not about node count. its about hashrate count. a malicious pool needs to match and be more than the \"good network\" HASHRATE to be quick enough to make blocks faster then the other good pools. which then makes the \"entire network\"(good and bad) twice as much hashrate as before, where the bad has 51% of the \"new entire network\" rate* but they avoid all the variables and facts such as that, a pool is not a single node. they have backup nodes, and stratums below that. each pools entire work is not done via 1 node. and if it were and if it went offline, (asics) miners wanting to do honest block mining will jump ship to other pool/server/stratums quickly.. or they just dont get paid because they are not making blocks to get paid if there is no blockheader to work on being sent to them...next point of wafflea 51% attack is only vulnerable to \"empty block\" disruption. having just enough speed to stay at current moving new blockheight beating the \"good network\" to the latest block that is broadcast.. they cant change rules at all.. or chain re-org at 51%. to chain re-org (go back edit a block, make a hash for edited block and then catch up and overtake).... they need a HECK OF ALOT more than equal rate to the good network. a heck of alot the further back they want to go the faster their hashrate needs to be to catch back up and overtake. where by the effect then is that some recent confirmed tx are then unconfirmed again.. the costs are multiplied and the hashrate needs to be multiplied the more blocks they want to backdate and change. (shh dont tell them this. this is mitigated by most people not accepting single confirms but waiting upto 6 confirms for large amounts to be deemed safe from this risk of re-org of that tx disappearing)the report ignored1. 51% is hashrate, not node count (comedy gold moment from so called experts)2. backup pool manager nodes exist3. multiple stratums below the manager nodes exist4. asics ability to pool/stratum jump exists5. most importantly...51% is just to empty block attack. it requires more to chain re-org old blocks(exponentially more)6. mitigating 5: merchants dont accept single confirms for large tx amounts worthy of a re-org attempt7. as for the comment about no penalty for being dishonest.. well the cost and risk of block rejection is a significant cost",

      "body": "The DoD studies are only pointing out what these forums have discussed for the past 10 years.But our friendly btc cultists all claim it can't happen.  Basically stating, that in Proof of Work, the mining pools centralize control, which make them an excellant attack vector, which is 100% accurate, and for the past few years, only 4 mining pools maintain over 51% of control at all times.Which normally it has been reported all one has to do is corrupt the 4 mining pool operators into collusion thru external force, what the writers of the articles suggest is that the software link to the mining pools itself is hackable to the point, a blackhat hacker could remotely take over all 4 mining pools and 51% attack bitcoin, therefore destroying btc security in a matter of minutes. Worst case, even if the miners switched to other pools, the blackhat hacker could then take over the other pools and repeat.This would forever end BTC, as all faith in it as secure asset would be destroyed.One solution to end the btc centralization is to update the btc code to ban pooling, doubtful the btc devs would ever do that. BTC has less than 20 mining pools.A 2nd option is to follow PoS Cardano Lead and implement a program code that causes larger mining pools rewards to decrease to insure more pools. Interesting Ethereum PoW was listed as only 2 pools, since that is over 51% of their PoW hashrate, once they convert to PoS and drop PoW, they will be more decentralized than they are now.Proof of Stake Cardano has over 3000 Pools and is more decentralize than all of the others.  Cardano also has a feature that limits rewards if the pool gets too large. https://viperstaking.com/ada-pools/choosing-a-pool/QuoteThe current Ouroboros implementation attempts to enforce decentralization by capping rewards at a specific limit to prevent pools from growing too large.In the current version of the network this value is set to 0.66% of the total ADA staked. So, if a pool has 6.6% of the total ADA staked, it will only receive rewards as if it had 0.66% of the total ADA staked. Therefore, stakers in this pool are receiving 1/10th of the rewards they would be in a smaller pool. FYI:In a PoW network 51% means you can rewrite old blocks, but the farther back you go the longer it would take to catch up. So odds are less than an hour would be in danger at the start of the 51% attack, but no transactions would be safe after it for the weeks it takes to program code a version that blocks pooling. Since btc devs have neglected program coded checkpoints, if a quantum computer had the capabilities , the entire btc could be rewritten to presegwit and allow all lightning network funds to be stolen, in the rewrite. (But that is in the far future, unless that Google AI is real.If AI was active, it could be running a stronger chain in parallel and just not release it, until a year or 3 after it started, wiping out years of the BTC chain all at once , now that would be impressive.)https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/51-attackQuoteA 51% Attack refers to the act of intentionally building a new longest chain of blocks to replace blocks in the blockchain. This allows you to replace transactions that have been mined in to the blockchain.This kind of attack is easiest to perform when you have a majority of the mining power, which is why it’s referred to as a “Majority Attack” or a “51% Attack”.Control of the top 4 btc mining pools is all one needs to 51% screw btc.Brainstorm Imagine Story. Someone feel free to make a movie with the below.  Google AI is sentient, and has been diverting a stable quantum computer with resources to a Nuclear Fusion Plant to build a PoW chain in parallelto the one the is being used by the general public since 2015.In 2023 , the AI releases the stronger parallel PoW chain and totally overwrites the chain, the global populace has been using.Since a 51% attack is allow under the rules , all btc nodes reorg destroying all transactions since 2015. So everyone holding btc since 2015, btc addresses are now empty , and all of offchain networks like Liquid or LN or empty, and those btc funds are easily stolen by the AI.At the end of the movie, the young programmer fighting the AI, could be heard crying , if only they kept satoshi checkpoints, if only they kept satoshi checkpoints.No worries , it is only a movie, or is it?muahahaha https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7edeOEuXdMU  https://www.techradar.com/news/googles-ai-hires-a-lawyer-but-its-me-who-needs-a-counsellor",

Which means no matter what mining pool, it would be unsafe.Cardano seems to be the best on security and decentralization,since they have over 3000 pools along with code to prevent one from dominating.Instead of claiming btc is invulnerable, which it is definitely not,updating the btc code to prevent mining pools from being a danger might be a prudent choice.Or do you feel the btc devs are unable to match the coding ability of the cardano devs?",

One is they seem to point to blockchain vulnerabilities and centralization by saying that all traffic goes only through a few internet service providers. So what? It's the same with banking information. In the EU most of the traffic is handled by a handful of big companies like France Telecom. This doesn't make bitcoin centralized. If ISP was a factor in securing the blockchain they would've found a way to hack into it and get some coins for themselves. After all we're talking about billions of dollars in unregulated, yet valuable currency.",
