The fact can't lie if pie was a scam coin. That's it. There's no benefit given by pi coin to the community. Have you seen it carefully? I think that what you were saying was sounds bullshit. Pi coin will never be comparable to the bitcoin. Just to tell you if bitcoin is the most legit crypto forever. Truly decentralized coin that exists in the crypto market.",

To be honest, just don't believe the absolute non-sense of this Pi coin. It's been proven along time ago that this is just worthless as it gets. So many threads have been made and people here won't change their perception against Pi. You will see what we are talking about when they somehow manage to put their token into the market but don't wait for that to happen since it will be hard or impossible for them to release the version of their token that where mined by the public.",

      "body": "They may look similar at first glance, but they have unique characteristics. The main function of Bitcoin is to be a decentralized digital currency that allows secure transactions and a store of value. Now, the pi network if I am not mistaken It is still in the early stages of development and is being mined by individuals. The Pi Network aims to create a cryptocurrency that can be easily mined using mobile devices and has a vision of fostering a community-based ecosystem.Even though pi and bitcoin are cryptocurrencies, they function differently. Bitcoin is widely accepted and used for various transactions, investments and even as a hedge against the traditional financial system. The Pi network, on the other hand, is still in its testing phase and has yet to establish itself as a widely recognized and adopted cryptocurrency.",

Pi is centralized, so if you don’t want to provide KYC then mining might not be ok with you, there are also rumors about this project but again don’t get hyped and just see if this project fits for you and if you can wait a little longer before making profit and its not guaranteed as well.",

Ethereum that is largest by market capital and most sort after don't even boast like the way PI miners talk about this shit coin, if shit coins are not better, I heard the PI network also runs some ads which is why they are have been fooling the owners about mining that is not validating any transactions.",

The last time I read pi network white paper, they indicated they'll be running like a Blockchain technology where users can stake their token through a validator, up till now, they haven't fulfilled their promises while the so-called miners are still hitting the mining button for a couple of years now without gotten anything. It's a waste of time to be mining pi network, it's just the beginners that have zero knowledge about cryptocurrency is falling for these scammers.",

As far as mining bitcoin, it's hard to done solo mining now, the hardware is expensive plus you should lived in a country with cheap electricity.It might handy for you if you will read this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5417375.0",

What function does PI has? As far as I know PI doesn't even have a working main network. Its still on testing phase. How come something that doesn't even have a functionable network be the same as Bitcoin? Based on some texts on papers? In that case there are many coins that mimic bitcoin in their whitepaper. As far as I know, you need to complete KYC to use PI. So it isn't centralized and someone can control the network. So its not bitcoin.Oh, if PI has the same function as bitcoin, isn't PI another shitcoin that has no real use case?",
