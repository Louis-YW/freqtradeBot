  "content": "Offering everyone the opportunity to test the most accurate risk-free Bitcoin/crypto price Prediction method in Cryptocurrency space. I want my method to be proven to people first before they can start trading with their money, based on my instruction. I will probably do this with you for two to three weeks before you start trading Bitcoin/crypto with your funds. After the testing, I'm going suggest you start with amount you can afford to risk, once you are pretty confident in your understanding of my method, you can gradually increase the amount you use for trading.If you are satisfied with my method, you can donate parts of your profits to a Bitcoin address I will be providing. If interested, send \"Interested\" to me on Telegram & I may add you to my Group.Telegram: https://t.me/Goodfruitexchange*Note that when I said this is the most accurate method in crypto space, I mean it 100%",

There is nothing bad for anyone to learn how to trade than depending on another person that can have means to earn from the novice trader after stating that the signals are free but not actually later free.",

Will you be ready to apologize & possibly compensate if it's true? What time do you want me to test it publicly? Seems you don't know me on this forum otherwise you won't utter such unproven words.",
