But one thing I saw a lot of but didn't quite have a good understanding of was the trust list. My question is simple: \"What's a trust list?\" and \"What's an ignore list?\" and \"How do these work?\"What is an ignore list?When someone makes a post or a reply. You can see an option to ignore at the left-sided profile picture. I mean under the picture. If you click that option, then you won't be seeing any messages from that person anymore. You can try that out. But by simply clicking that button under my profile, you will know what ignore lists mean. Once you do that, make sure to unignore me. If you want to get some good content, then follow me.What is a trust list?The one whom you trust the most. You can add anyone to your list. But you should add only those whom you think are good guys and will not scam other people. Because, let's say, a person has 20 positive feedbacks and zero negative feedback, a newbie or a person who is afraid to deal on BTT can easily trust that person and will be ready to make a deal with him or her. But if that person has 20 or 2 negative feedbacks, then one with a skeptical mind should avoid making a deal with that person. The trust system is not that old. I think it was added to the forum in 2018 if I am not mistaken. I read about the date of the trust system a few days ago, but now I forget when it was really introduced.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5191802.0 check this thread out for more details about trust system",

However, it would be preferable if the explanation of the DT1 and DT2 were simplified.And just a confusion: we don't get notifications of mentioned people on BTT, but we did on Telegram Bot, so please add that too. We get notifications of someone mentioned on the Telegram app, and we have to ignore that person from there in order to not get any type of notification from some member.Or we only have to ignore a person from the BTT, and that person will be put on ignore on the Telegram app too. As far as I think that's not the case, but just in case I asked,",
