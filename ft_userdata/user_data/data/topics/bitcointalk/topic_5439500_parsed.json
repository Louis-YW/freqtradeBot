  "content": "I see a lot from the perspective of some beginners like me who are new to cryptocurrency.Sometimes, some of them see the cryptocurrency world as an easy way or business to get profits or get rich quickly.Many of them have this kind of perspective because they see other people's success from crypto.What they don't even know is how difficult the person's struggle was before being successful and making a profit in the crypto world.Not only success but in fact many negative cases have occurred in the crypto world.Sometimes beginners don't realize they have entered a \"landmine area\".One wrong step means they will enter into negative news from the impact of cryptocurrency risks.From that, I try to keep reminding myself and for beginners like me.Not to have too high expectations in the cryptocurrency world.Cryptocurrency is a high-risk and very volatile thing.In my opinion, it is not suitable for us if we only have too high expectations. If you want to be successful in crypto or whatever we do or try, let's not have too high expectations first.But try as hard as possible to learn what opportunities we can take advantage of.It's the same with being in this crypto world.Don't have too high expectations of getting rich quick in cryptocurrency.However, focus more on increasing knowledge and views on ways of thinking to find where we can take the opportunity to benefit from this cryptocurrency world.Learn and increase as much knowledge as possible from various existing sources.Then we have to know and determine how we can take advantage of this cryptocurrency world in order to get maximum profit.We must determine according to our current conditions and capabilities.Set your limits and don't be greedy so you won't be too disappointed when you don't succeed or experience losses in the crypto world.Do you think high expectations are good for crypto beginners?",

But it is also important to remember that crypto can be a wild ride, with prices going up and down in a heartbeat. So if you are a beginner, getting your hopes up too high from the start could be a bad move. My advice is to do your homework and learn as much as you can about the risks and rewards before you invest. And don't treat crypto as a quick way to get rich - it is more of a long-term game. But remember, everything has its risks. No risk, no reward!",

Having high expectations can lead to so many unfortunate things, like you said some people actually got into crypto because of the success of others and without even trying to find out what they went through to get to where they're right now, the sacrifices they made, the pain and hardship they endured during their journey. No, they just jump into it thinking that they'll also be as successful as that person and when things doesn't goes as planned they start having cold feet about if they should continue or not. If you don't want my unnecessary pressure then you shouldn't have high expectations in crypto.",

I wouldn't expect too much on my asset but if you are determined to make a huge profit in the future. Make sure you don't doubt and never regret on when you are selling your asset then reinvest after that. So, basically, all you need is a good plan whether it's plan A to Z in case the other plans doesn't work. That's all you need, determination!",

No risk, no reward!Lol,everybody has expectation,and I used to think that expectation is what brings motivation,if you aren't expecting anything,you won't be motivated to do nothing.When one is expecting something,he works extra miles to achieve his set target,but it seems it's different in crypto,because your high expectations here can lead to heartbreak,and emotional trauma which is unhealthy.That is why it is adviceable to take it step by step,one at a time.Putting all your money in investmests because you are expecting to be rich in less than no time might just end you in loss.That is why it is good to strategies,read the market,and calculate well before making any big move.",

This will definitely give him/her the motivation that they need in order to start their processes and learnings in the cryptocurrency world. But having high expectations can also backfire especially if that person becomes overconfident and arrogant to begin with.Channel this burning passion and rage in learning the fundamentals in the cryptocurrency world. If investing into this platform were that easy, then everybody would have been millionaires by now. Again, having high expectations is not necessarily bad but you have to place such expectations in the right place in order to take advantage of such motivation.",

The beginner thinks Cryptocurrency is the goods, so that if have a chance, they bought it and sell it when having the moment. crypto is broad with many aspects that should have thinking besides the profit, which will change if they focus only on 1 kind, such as bitcoin.",

However, we need to distinguish that becoming rich and earning some side money are two completely different things. People who became millionaires had mined or bought coins at ridiculous prices, something that is no longer feasible. Even if the value triples now, you still won't be any closer to being rich by having $10,000–$20,000 in Bitcoin. You'll earn a decent amount, for sure, but it won't make you a millionaire. This era has passed, and some newbies are yet to comprehend that it's theoretically impossible to happen again.",
