Though i dont get annoyed of it, except quoting the whole long text from the first quoted reply to the 4th replies lol. I usually seen this on gambling boards. Seems many users there are tired or just lazy doing the simple deleting those nested quoted replies.There's no preferred way to do it IMO but the recommended way is what you have mentioned. Only quote the phrase/text that you want to respond/reply.What i usually do is just use \"/...\" as snip if necessary and everyone has their own version of it.",

I don't mind too how people quote me, provided they don't distort my comment to favour a misleading narrative.My judgment of those who quote in block is that they aren't well tutored, it doesn't matter their ranks.

To snip off a few text just to make emphasise on our area of concern and bring it to the spotlight too. That to me doesn't mean quoting someone out of context, I think the narrative that follows or you give your explanation is what could mean your quoting someone out of context.It becomes necessary to read and understand the heading for which the user whom to have made the comment was making and then, you respond in a way that tackles that narrative. It gets personal for sme to have been quote out of context but, I think the best measure to a better understanding is further explanation and put the responses to a quote at right to avoid a wrong narrative.",
