Indeed it’s a thing worth to be celebrated in my own opinion, it marks the very beginning of some ideas regarding bitcoin which has grown up to the level that it is right now.

Even if not all the forum members are getting paid, there will still be people on the forum.",

These sig campaigns are like the engine that keeps the forum working and lively because if anyone were to argue otherwise and say it's mainly for the information, I think that would be telling yourself a lie because if it were so, you could have gotten that info elsewhere. The sigs and bounty campaigns just added spice and a uniqueness to the forum...Happy belated anniversary to BitcoinTalk!",

Activity wouldn't be this big if it wasn't for bounties.In the beginning, there were no signature campaigns, and in addition, Bitcoin did not have a price that motivated people, as is the case today - and yet a respectable community was created then, of which, unfortunately, there are not many members who are active on the forum today. Of course, the campaigns played a big role (and they still do today), although it should be said that the benefit was mutual because many companies from the world of cryptocurrencies successfully advertised on this forum.Quote from: salad daging on November 19, 2023, 09:46:13 AMI see this admin user has 7 posts, but can't see his posts, what's wrong with that?I think that these posts are somehow hidden or even deleted.
