  "content": "As Bitcoin awareness spread across many geographical locations and the quest to tap into the many advantages Bitcoin presents, knowing the importance of knowledge in the entire journey be it governments or at the individual level bitcoin has proven to be the best alternative where there is no restriction to the financial freedom of the individuals.The fact that bitcoin transactions are made secure and transparent via the blockchain and as an emerging development there is a need to have an in-depth knowledge of the subject matters, so we can be able to handle our daily financial transactions without any restrictions or third-party involvement given p2p freedom.So I am looking for a university where I can run a master's degree in bitcoin since I already have an undergraduate degree, I was thinking El Salvador will be the best country to expect such a university because El Salvador is 100% bitcoin-friendly please any suggestions?",

I think that such a Master's will work best if your undergraduate degree is somewhere around IT or Economics, though, and if it isn't, it might be really tough.I like the list that dzungmobile shared, but it doesn't have everything, of course. And courses in specific languages can be an issue, of course. For instance, I've seen crypto-related courses in my country, but they're all in Ukrainian language.If you just Google \"Master's in Blockchain\", you'll see plenty of results on the first page, all from different universities. I can't say how hard the admission process will be or how good the programs are, but they exist.Here's just a list of a few links:https://www.unic.ac.cy/blockchain/msc-digital-currency/https://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/levels-of-study/postgraduate-study/masters-by-coursework/master-of-blockchain-enabled-business-mc279https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/academic-departments/mgen/ms-insy/ms-insy-blockchain/https://www.frankfurt-school.de/home/programmes/master/blockchain-digital-assetsGood luck with your search! I recommend choosing several universities and make multiple applications, as the admission process can be pretty competitive at some places, and you don't want to waste years on trying to get an offer.",

I've heard of cryptocurrencies being a course, and a subject and some people think that it is even a good profession. My personal question is why? Given how risky this industry is, in comparison with other investments such as properties and stock market. Even those who are in this industry for almost a decade are still seeking for new knowledge about this industry. Maybe, people are way too amazed by the potential of this blockchain in particular with profit potential, but things just work on a different way for this industry; no particular pattern. Having a master's degree means you have a mastery of something right? Are there anyone in this industry whose in such level?",

You could easily acquire knowledge in these subjects through workshops and YouTube videos that are much cheaper and can be studied at your own pace. The only caveat I see doing this is that, you have to create your own roadmap of subjects that you need to study based on what you want to achieve. Plus, the discipline of spending a fair amount of time consistently.It is better to learn theoretically and create your own bitcoin/blockchain projects instead of wasting resources for a piece of paper and a title that no one cares about. Unless you are doing it for enjoyment, which I still think you are not. I don't know, maybe I am just sick of the current educational system we have now. Sometimes, the internet, especially YouTube videos, is way better than those PhD professors in my university.But hey that's just me!",

Because institutions have to register them with the respective educational system of their country and to approve the course, it must be according to the laws and regulations of that country (which means countries that have banned crypto usage, are unlikely to teach a registered course in any university about BTC). But you will find courses to learn BTC by different names, like Blockchain. because blockchain changes the purposes as it has its own benefits, even for governments. Now, to your question about which university to attend. I think first you should share a little bit of information about your geographical and financial status. like how much you could afford and whether you could go to another country to learn these courses. or you are querying about \"online courses\".Here is an article covering most of the registered courses about BTC/Blockchain to learn in universities. (In the list I would prefer you to not select Massachusetts Institute of Technology (USA) because that state has senators that hate BTC and well at least show their hostility about it, you can read the topic about it has already been discussed).If you are looking for online degrees in this field, then this article might help you, 7 Universities Offering Online... El Salvador's adoption of BTC as a legal tender has been of less benefit to them till now, Who knows the future, but at the current state, they are facing difficulties and their citizens are too.",

If that is true, then few universities are now studying blockchain, but they give a bachelor’s degree, and therefore there are no higher academic degrees (PhD, for example) that can discuss the master’s thesis, in other words, there is no university Currently giving a master's degree specializing in Bitcoin.If you are looking for a university that accepts Bitcoin, there are a number of them, but I think that you will need a lot of expenses in housing and travel, so the easiest solution is to convert Bitcoin into cash and pay the university.I wish you success in your scientific career.",

Governments may not focus on spending money to sponsor to an individual where there is option for them to already hire people who are professional or knowledgeable in this matter and ask them to teach their staffs or certain organizations. There are more things governments needs to focus with unless their country plans to be Bitcoin friendly or plans to do more crypto transactions then having a school or at least subject related to it will help them to influence more users in using it. In my country there is a bank who sponsored series of seminars about Bitcoin and just need to register or choose schedule but no school yet focuses on having it in the curriculum.",
