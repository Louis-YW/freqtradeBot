But, numerous accounts are posting mindless shits beyond my understanding. I cleared some post and clarified the requirement. But, same shit again! Are those bots? Is it even possible to run bots on BitcoinTalk, where sign in requires Google CAPTCHA solve? If not, then why are humans responding there like this? What are they gaining by wasting there own time?p.s. Pardon my naivety. Though an user of BitcoinTalk since 2014, I spend most of my time on CT & TG. Hence, my knowledge about BitcoinTalk is limited in comparison to those who registered at my time.p.p.s. Please do not turn this Meta thread into a discussion of merit of the Crypto I am promoting there. I know, it is a memecoin and I am an early investor. No further discussion regarding that in Meta please.",

If not, then why are humans responding there like this? What are they gaining by wasting there own time?If there is anything that I have understood about that section (altcoins and bounty registration), only a very few of those hunters make the time to eventually read the rules of a particular campaign; most of them just adhere to their common POA as it seems to be the first step before furthering their bounty registration. They might not be bots, but most of the accounts flooded with the so-called shitpost might likely appear to be operated by a few individuals who are in a rush to secure a spot for themselves in the campaign.",

In that section, I think that members that participate in bounty programmes are mostly subjected to only one method of application, so any time they see a campaign, they are always in a rush to apply without reading the rules. Another thing you should know is that the Altcoin section is mostly flooded with some spammers.",

They will forever be newbies by engaging in this kind of spam. Well, either way, I just linked and tagged 19 accounts that have been engaging in this behavior in OP's thread and others as well. Not that it really matters so much. A minor inconvenience for them, they'll create 19 new accounts tomorrow and be back at it.There's a few different farms in OP's thread but I don't have time to do them all at once, lol.",

Only those who have this pattern do you know that you have read the rules.I see you've done more or less this. But, I should elaborate more. How to put some more detail in the candidature text, or have additional information in the informative text about the rules.Anyway, use your imagination a little to try to make it easier for you to find who really read what you wanted to be read.",

I'm not going to that section anymore because it's being swarmed by newbies out there who are posting Proof of Authentication, and social media links. Correct me, but I guess in every 10 seconds or 20 seconds, there's one either POA or social media links that are being posted on that section. Overall, it's filled with newbie-ranked users, and they aren't bots, but just low IQ users who don't even know how to read.",
