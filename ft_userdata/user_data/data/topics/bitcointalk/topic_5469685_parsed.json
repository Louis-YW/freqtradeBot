  "content": "Hello. Two years ago I've imported a private key from my paper wallet into the blockchaindotcom wallet and from there I''ve spent all the funds from that wallet. Today I just wanted to check how importing of a private key into the Unisat works, and I've tried to to import that private key from the very same paper wallet; but to my surprise the (legacy) address which I've got was completely different. How can this be possible?",

      "body": "I do not know the reason, but if the private key is correct, this might probably be the reason: legacy address can be compresed or non compresed. If compresed or not, the address start from 1 but different. You can know from the addresses public key which start from 04 for uncompressed while 02 or 03 for compromised. Or from the private key as 5 starts the private key for uncompressed while K or L starts the compromised address private key.",

Please check the first post again. acme89 already emptied the wallet two years ago and moved the coins elsewhere via Blockchain.com. Hence, there are no more bitcoin to access on the old wallet. He just wanted to practice importing private keys into UniSat and was surprised when he noticed a different address compared to the one he funded years ago.",

While mainnet addresses are the same, the BTC testnet addresses are different.Similar but that may be an unrelated issue.Based from that info alone, I can tell that it's an issue with the \"coin_index\" derivation path used in testnet which should be different from mainnet.Still need confirmation with testing though.But with their \"busy\" developers (since the original issue I reported above is still not closed) and the issue being testnet-specific,I wont make the effort to report this issue myself.",
