  "content": "Apparently, Ledger is in the news again for the wrong reasons.At first, SuchiSwap CTO (one of the leading DEXs) made a tweet about the suspected vulnerability.The primary issue is that the Ledger ConnectKit NPM package Library that is used across majority of decentralized applications was updated few hours ago with malicious code (drainer):How come?It looks like the NPM key was leaked via a github action Â which means Anyone can invoke the action via a PR on Ledger's GitHub Orgs, then leak that key by crafting a malicious package.json.Right now, any user interacting with any and all Dapps could potentially be exposed to the vulnerability and end up losing all funds to drainers. According to my research so far, it doesn't include users who are just using Ledger for day-to-day transfers with no interactions and prior interactions before the vulnerability was disclosed appears to good.Side note: This only shows how poorly the Ledger team takes security and their continued negligence of the security of their products and services.Update #1: Ledger has confirmed the vulnerability report:QuoteðŸš¨We have identified and removed a malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit. ðŸš¨A genuine version is being pushed to replace the malicious file now. Do not interact with any dApps for the moment. We will keep you informed as the situation evolves. Your Ledger device and Ledger Live were not compromised.",

The Ledger ConnectKit Library is a common Library that is usually used for connecting wallets in order to interact with Dapps (staking, swapping, Money markets, etc). Being compromised means any user that connects to any decentralized application via a \"connect wallet\" kit is likely to get drained since there is malicious drainer embedded in the library being used.This is a case of a library being popularly used in frontends getting compromised.",

I already identify that during my interaction with revoke.cash they already made the site offline but I'm still being vigilant for further announcement. Not necessarily I would switch considering there has been some staked assets on my wallet and the advisory that no interaction yet on any dApps means I won't be able to get them out as well. Still monitoring the incident and glad we have huge helpful community not just here but on Twitter/X as well.",

If anyone use only one wallet, store all fund there but are ready to explore around new platforms, dApps, smart contracts, such interactions are risky and drain all money in that wallet.I don't mind about Ledger and the advice is general for practice with fund, wallet and any interaction that can steal your money.",

I have had terrible experiences in the past so I am either not connecting it every day or just rarely synch the new balances, check the updates, and bug fixes only. Though the news only states we should not be connecting to dApps, what happens if I just connect it normally synch with the network? Because I know if I connect and if there are any updates for let us say wallets of different coins then it will start auto downloainf it.
