I still love my privacy tho. I don't want any of my personal information to get leaked(sometimes intentionally by rogue employees) and get into the hands of bad actors. Nor would I like some entity(read apple,facebook, google) to have ay kind of influence over me. Obfuscation of personal funds is a part of maintaining that privacy. To protect info about my spending mostly.Monero and BTC LN are better suited for such task than mixers imo. Regardless of what's more efficient, it's still an attack on our privacy.

There's an active bounty of a million dollar by IRS on monero   And we got BTC LN too. imo, BTC LN should suffice for privacy needs for a common man like me.Quoteexchanges do not have to witness an actual crime first, and link that to a user that then mixes to then suspect it as laundering.No worries, I will do a P2P trade.",

EG cheapest mining on planet is about $13k/btc (hardware ROI included)EG region of america at 12cent electric is about $19k (hardware ROI included)so by exchanges knowing that this american could be a btc buyer when the price is below $19k and a btc miner(seller) when the price is above $19k becomes valuable info to then collate with other users data to then work out the whims of the 'support levels' of bitcoin market pricesyep just knowing user 123xyz is from 12cent electric region is worth something to analystsand the DCG know this stuff and share this stuffthey dont care about peoples privacy. they just want to move people into different services they can profit from for different reasons. privacy guess get syphoned off their value via the fee's of using privacy tools and normal people get their data sold.",
