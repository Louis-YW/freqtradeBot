  "content": "Quote(CNN)Antarctica's so-called \"doomsday glacier\" -- nicknamed because of its high risk of collapse and threat to global sea level -- has the potential to rapidly retreat in the coming years, scientists say, amplifying concerns over the extreme sea level rise that would accompany its potential demise.The Thwaites Glacier, capable of raising sea level by several feet, is eroding along its underwater base as the planet warms. In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, scientists mapped the glacier's historical retreat, hoping to learn from its past what the glacier will likely do in the future.They found that at some point in the past two centuries, the base of the glacier dislodged from the seabed and retreated at a rate of 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) per year. That's twice the rate that scientists have observed in the past decade or so.That swift disintegration possibly occurred \"as recently as the mid-20th century,\" Alastair Graham, the study's lead author and a marine geophysicist at the University of South Florida, said in a news release.It suggests the Thwaites has the capability to undergo a rapid retreat in the near future, once it recedes past a seabed ridge that is helping to keep it in check.\"Thwaites is really holding on today by its fingernails, and we should expect to see big changes over small timescales in the future -- even from one year to the next -- once the glacier retreats beyond a shallow ridge in its bed,\" Robert Larter, a marine geophysicist and one of the study's co-authors from the British Antarctic Survey, said in the release.The Thwaites Glacier, located in West Antarctica, is one of the widest on Earth and is larger than the state of Florida. But it's just a faction of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which holds enough ice to raise sea level by up to 16 feet, according to NASA.As the climate crisis has accelerated, this region has been closely monitored because of its rapid melting and its capacity for widespread coastal destruction.The Thwaites Glacier itself has concerned scientists for decades. As early as 1973, researchers questioned whether it was at high risk of collapse. Nearly a decade later, they found that -- because the glacier is grounded to a seabed, rather than to dry land -- warm ocean currents could melt the glacier from underneath, causing it to destabilize from below.It was because of that research that scientists began calling the region around the Thwaites the \"weak underbelly of the West Antarctic ice sheet.\"In the 21st century, researchers began documenting the Thwaites' rapid retreat in an alarming series of studies.In 2001, satellite data showed the grounding line was receding by around 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) per year. In 2020, scientists found evidence that warm water was indeed flowing across the base of the glacier, melting it from underneath.And then in 2021, a study showed the Thwaites Ice Shelf, which helps to stabilize the glacier and hold the ice back from flowing freely into the ocean, could shatter within five years.\"From the satellite data, we're seeing these big fractures spreading across the ice shelf surface, essentially weakening the fabric of the ice; kind of a bit like a windscreen crack,\" Peter Davis, an oceanographer with the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN in 2021. \"It's slowly spreading across the ice shelf and eventually it's going to fracture into lots of different pieces.\"Monday's findings, which suggest the Thwaites is capable of receding at a much faster pace than recently thought, were documented on a 20-hour mission in extreme conditions that mapped an underwater area the size of Houston, according to a news release.Graham said that this research \"was truly a once in a lifetime mission,\" but that the team hopes to return soon to gather samples from the seabed so they can determine when the previous rapid retreats occurred. That could help scientists predict future changes to the \"doomsday glacier,\" which scientists had previously assumed would be slow to undergo change -- something Graham said this study disproves.\"Just a small kick to the Thwaites could lead to a big response,\" Graham said.https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/world/thwaites-doomsday-glacier-sea-level-climate/index.html....Awhile ago I was curious about negative side effects of terraforming antarctica. How much woul dmelting all of the ice there raise sea levels. Sources I saw claimed sea levels could rise 100 to 200 feet above current levels if all of the ice in antarctica melted. It was an eye opening statistic.Now it seems scientists are projecting a piece of ice the size of the US state of florida could break off the ice shelf and melt. Potentially raising sea levels 16 feet above current levels.World leaders like Barack Obama and Ivanka Trump are not heeding these warnings. Considering they continue to buy up beach front property.With the term climate change refugee being coined in regions like bangladesh and the maldives. As unfortunate beachfront residents are forced to move further inland.What trends can we expect from this. And what steps can be taken to address them. Perhaps crypto tokens and coins have a role to play here in subsidizing solutions to climate change.",

And glaciers “floating in water” do not actually change the volume of the world’s oceans, because... they essentially change the form of storage of liquid found in the world's oceans. In total, the most dangerous “potential” is at the south pole.But no matter how much we argue “which ice is worse”, the fact of rising sea levels is a FACThttps://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a005100/a005114/seaLevelWaveTank_6-24-2023a_wavetank.mp4",

      "body": "This is a huge, global problem, but honestly, I don't really believe that we have to face the dangers of nature before the dangers we cause ourselves (war). But it's clear that the reality that post-global change is increasingly changing what people are starting to think about is also quite relevant. I remember when I was young, I used to encounter cold winter air that I could clearly feel, but now the winter in the area I live in is no longer either cold. But people are gradually getting used to and adapting to the environment. Looking at the issue of rising sea levels, migration is almost mandatory, but thinking back, I think the responsibilities and obligations of individuals are only very small and don't even have much impact on environmental protection. For countries with developing industries, the problem of industrial waste and CO2 is seen more clearly, the cause of the greenhouse effect. It reminds me of a few years ago, when I read the information. It is believed that since the outbreak of the epidemic, industrial emissions into the environment have significantly helped restore the ozone layer. Perhaps our common problem still needs a joint plan from all countries, not a single solution, and we can begin to find ways to overcome it by seeing the problem.",

I guess that the process of global warming will make huge regions in countries like Russia and Canada more suitable for living, so all the climate refugees from the coastal areas could just move to Russia, Canada or Kazakhstan. Those three countries have plenty of space and a relatively small population. I'm joking, but I might be right in the end. Ice melting in Antarctica and Arctica cannot be stopped at this point. All the policies for reducing CO2 emissions won't change anything.By the way, do you have any plans of launching some \"Antarctica coin\" or \"Doomsday glacier token\"?",

That's what the world is at these days, denying a scientific data is what people like to boast about these days, it's not like the yare secretly denying science, they are talking about how proud they are. There are politicians all around the world who say they do not believe in \"climate change BS\" and get votes for saying that, the humanity has gone that stupid, this isn't something you deny or accept, it's a fact, it's reality, it's proven data, you do not \"believe\" that humans breath oxygen, it's science, it's data, same goes here.The bigger problem is the drought, even though it may look like sea levels rising means water, the reality is that inlands will be very drought, and farming will become much harder, and there will be plenty of fires all around, so food will be much scarce as well. This is a much bigger thread, not finding anything clean to drink and not be able to afford to eat.",

The process of mining crypto emits more energy which causes more harm than good to environment. But taking OPs question whether there will be role to this solution to global dilemma is just absurd. The application of cryptocurrencies, although vast, cannot be applied on very specific things like this, thus making more senseless argument if we continue. I'll believe if the OP proposes one solution.
