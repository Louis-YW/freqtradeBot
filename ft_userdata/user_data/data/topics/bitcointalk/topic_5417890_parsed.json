Maybe nobody does actually want to see this  .Obviously just a tune up fight for Fury and looks like he just wants to add another trilogy to his belt (apparently nobody else has had two trilogies before), and also just giving Chisora a big pay day at the tail end of his career. It doesn't look like many people are all too excited for it and Chisora should be easy work for Fury but I guess I'd rather see him fight somebody at least than nobody at all. Chisora's corner threw in the towel late into the last match but I think Fury will get a KO earlier on much like his last fight against Whyte.Daniel Dubois vs Kevin Lerena is also on the undercard. Maybe they'll try squeeze a Tommy fight on there too but given he's fighting next month it might be a bit too soon, but if not I'm sure there will be one of the other Fury clan members on the card.",

Yes it deserves a thread but obviously its Fury's win again. Looks mismatch by just looking at their records. Despite defeating Chisora 2 times already,  Chisora gets WBC heavyweight title fight.",

And we all know that this will be an easy fight for Fury, another get busy and cherry pick for him at the end of the year.And I reckon that Fury has a lot of option for next year if he wanted to be active, there is the Joshua fight and then Usyk. Forget about the title eliminator between Andy Ruiz and Wilder. I think Fury will go for Joshua or Usyk next after he blow up Chisora for a knock out win.",

Looking at the bookie, the moneyline odds for Fury is 1.04x and if you bet Fury to win via KO the odds is only 1.35x, which mean both betting option profitable. I think Fury will win via KO against, that's why the odds for Fury via decision seems really impossible to happen. I think Dubois vs Lerena might be more interesting since the moneyline odds for Lerena is 8.20, I will throw few dollars for Lerena in this match.",

      "body": "Chisora had been beaten twice, so I do not think that there is a need for trilogy between the two.  Probably this time Chisora will be KOed, since the result in favor of Fury gets better every match.  Like, UD win on 1st match then corner retirement on the 10th round in 2nd match.  So in the trilogy, I think a KO will be recorded.  I think this fight is just a filler for Tyson's Fury idle time and at the same time get some money from it.Quote from: bbc.reporter on November 29, 2022, 03:50:28 AMQuote from: hilariousetc on October 21, 2022, 01:05:50 PMObviously just a tune up fight for Fury It might also be Tyson Fury needs more extra christmas money to buy his loved ones gifts hehehe.

And even if Chisora trained seriously, with long reach and height advantage, I do not think Chisora has way to defend against the solid job straight of  Fury.",

If I were to exaggerate a bit, it is even a possibility that Chisora won't be winning a single round, although it might also be possible Fury won't be giving his 100% focus, determination, and grit knowing that he's only up against a small old man whose boxing career is doubtless at its end. Anyway, Pacquiao and Morales fought 3 times. Pacquiao also fought Marquez 4 times. The second is not a trilogy, but then there was a Pacquiao-Marquez III. So technically, Pacquiao has had 2 trilogies.",

I don’t see the point in this fight, a champion who doesn’t keep his word and can’t end his career in any way should at least choose stronger opponents for himself. There is no intrigue in this fight, despite the fact that Fury has become heavier, slower and not as hardy as before, the only question is Fury will win on points or by knockout. Most likely, the goal of this fight is simply not to let forget about Fury and still show that he did not finish his career.",

His last fight was on April 23, 2022, and this is his second fight of the year.  If he will not fight this year, his popularity might be affected.  Since Usyk and Wilder had a good performance in their recent fight, Fury had long been relaxing, so he needs a tune-up fight to keep his name on the tab.  I do agree that the fight is somehow boring since we already know the possible outcome of the fight.  And I really think that there is no need for this trilogy because the 1st and 2nd match is clearly won by Fury.",

Basically think of this as an open public sparring session. Fury and Chisora are somewhat friendly so think of this just as Fury giving him one last big pay day and for him to keep off the ring rust until the Usyk fight.  I suspect it will be quite a boring fight unless Chisora decides to go for glory and Fury has to turn up the heat to match him. I'm more interested in how many people actually turn up to the venue. It's an open air stadium in December and nobody seems to be excited about this fight here in the UK so I'd expect it to be half full which wont be a good look (unless they end up giving a load of tickets away to save face). It's also the highest ever UK PPV so I don't think it's going to do good numbers on that front either.",

I think Fury likely knows this is ridiculous deep down. I'm a Fury fan, and I think he's the best of this generation, and beats Joshua, and likely Usyk if they did face, right. However, part of me wants to see him lose in this fight, just as a wake up call for boxers, and their promoters. They try to milk the cash cows for as long as possible, that when we do end up having the big named fighters fighting the other top fighters, they're well out of their prime. The public has basically been robbed of a Fury vs Joshua fight for a few years now. I didn't mind with the Wilder trilogy as you always had that threat, but Chisora is well out of it these days, and it would take Fury being complacent to lose here, which honestly I've seen him get complacent before. The Wallin fight comes to mind.",
