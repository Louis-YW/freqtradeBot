      "body": "ChatGPT is a machine learning language model that can be used to generate human language. It can be used to write text, answer questions, and more. However, this so-called AI has nothing to do with the actual process of trading, nor does it have anything at all to do with predicting market movements. In fact, the whole idea is somewhat absurd. If you want to predict the market, use historical data and create a model based on that data. Could you use the OpenAI engine for that? Probably yes. But I do not see how ChatGPT relates to this at all. By the same logic, has anyone tried to use DALL·E to help in trading?",

Agree into this post or response.@OP, you should look up into these threads on which it would really be ideal on reading up others response in related to this not only speaking about trading matters but also there are people who do consider out on making some usage of these AI's when it comes to their gambling activity or hobby which we do all know that it isnt something to be that relevant which its true that it would still needing up to be feed upwith information for a certain AI to have these informations plus we know that speculative things isnt something that could be handled  out which i dont see on how they do make out those considerationson trusting up which i do see that human beings is more better when it comes to kind of approach specially on gambling and trading.",

To be honest I can't really think of how an AI will be able to predict the movement of market during trading but I'm sure that within a short period of time most YouTubers are going to start using it to text out trades if trading with chatGPT will give any good results or if it will end up as a bad trade ( i.e if it hasn't already been done.).",

      "body": "Artificial Intelligence can actually come in very handy when trading using bots. It can ease a lot of strategies and take over the human to watch the market and react to market changes. For example imagine the altcoin market where a shitcoin is chosen daily to be pumped, AI can detect those and report it to the user to act on them. Then the AI could continue watching the shitcoin market to analyze the volume and orders that are being placed and decide how much the user should unload at what prices (eg. 10% of the bought coins after 20% profit, 40% after reaching 50% profit and so on).Trading bots sometimes have something that resembles what I explained. ChatGPT on the other hand, is not designed to do something like this. It is also very broken at times with the flawed answers it will give you. Bottom line is that you'd need a specialized AI for trading not this generalized one.",

ChatGPT is programmed to decrease human labor on different niches of the internet, and may not be efficient to serve as a relatable guide to trading. It'll make good predictions about the market, and could go through other trading bots to fetch information, but trusting that the bot is smarter than us is laziness, and an unexpected lie. I always see ChatGPT as a means when I'm not energetic to carry out a task; trading or writing. It helps programmers write good programs. But, I noticed that the human labor is not completely wiped out, humans always want a do it all technology, yet we still have to crosscheck all the results these robots provide. Glancing on the trading results it provides could eat up more energy and still go wrong. I'd advise that, trading requires money so traders should invest additional time while making trades. AI may not give us what we expect.",
