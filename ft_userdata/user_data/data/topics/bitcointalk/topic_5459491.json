It's a good idea, if we learn first before thinking of contributing, that will help us understand better and help others. As I speak, I am still learning and trying to know more.  If you come across posts you are not acquainted with, learn from the posts and the replies, it isn't a must for you to write something that will end up annoying others or see you as spammer.Learning first, build our experience.  Your motor as a newbie should be learn first and every other things will follow and be added unto you.",

As I speak, I am still learning and trying to know more.  This is a very common topic discuss and already this topic has been discussed a tons of time in this forum. I am suggesting you that before posting anything never rush to do that and realize about it's acceptability and share something unique. In every sector in the life no one can contribute without learning first. We had learned also about how to walk. But the discussion topic should be about how you can learn from this forum.1. Read Forum topics and others opinion and specially merited posts. 2. Use search option to find out your topic what you want to learn. If you can't find it then make a post with proper information in this Board.3. You can track some most contributing forum users and their posts to learn more effectively. 4. Visit the correct board where you will see your desired topics. Like if you want to know more about this forum then oftenly visit Meta board. To learn or discuss about trading then visit Trading Discussion and there also have gambling related discussion board. In these way you can learn a lot and start contributing.Anyway Never Stop Learning.",

When newbies do this things it is clearly seen that they are after merit. And it is has been long advices that merit isn’t gotten alone by creating threads, you can have as many merit as they could give once you are able to make quality replies. Creating multiple threads without having any meaning only gets you into some members (mostly merit source) ignore list",

Of course, you already have some experience, and I think that newcomers should listen to their own kind, who recently came to the forum but quickly understood how to behave here. Seeing leadership from high ranks, some give up, realizing that it is more difficult for them to go all this way, but looking at others as themselves, motivation becomes greater.That's right, you should not go out of your way when someone does not have the necessary knowledge.

Using a centralized exchange is not the issue but a choice. Storing funds on a CEX is a concern whn the forum has been continuously discussing about the cons. This proble will continue unless one of them lose funds and comes here for a solution. The problem is unless shit happens with someone personally they are least bothered.",

One must know how these forums develop because of their users or members. Every day I think there will always be new newbies signing up. Although I don't really understand it, he is a real beginner or a rookie who has an old account. Turning off new accounts will certainly make this forum will not develop. So in fact I don't need a new account, because the new account is a growth in the number of users. As long as they continue to abide by the existing rules, it is certainly good. But if it harms some moderators here have the right to ban it. We can even create an open report.",
