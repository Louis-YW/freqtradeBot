      "body": "If you do not want to go for fund password, is the exchange not supporting 2FA instead? I do not even recommend sim authentication. Fund password is better, but 2FA code on another device is the best to me.Maybe the exchange is a scam? See the Trustpilot reviews: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/bitget.comThe review on Trustpilot is poor. I also checked Quora, people are adviced not to use the exchange. I was surprised that the exchange is ranked 15th.",

Regardless, you should never rely on SMS for verification, It's better you try two factor authenticators. Some exchange apps at least access, even fingerprint verification.Try contacting their support. Maybe they could helpBitget is a low tier exchange like MEXC. They list all sorts of shitcoins, so you should be very careful with such exchanges.",

Actually, it's a scam since before there are lots of reports outside of this forum.It is likely the same as yobit with lots of shitcoins and most of the shitcoins can't able to withdraw.Next time if you already do research and some say its a scam don't use their service unless your coins are only listed on their exchange?Would you mind to try if you can able to add 2FA for the authenticator app? So that you have option instead of receiving 2FA code in mobile generate it with an authenticator app. Sms 2FA sometimes delays even on other exchanges due to DDOS attacks so switching to the authenticator app is the best option.",

      "body": "It's the most annoying thing with SMS 2FA. A lot of fiat services I've used heavily relies on SMS 2FA and mishaps like this are inevitable as we have to rely on third party services to get our codes which means there must be no problem with your provider and theirs for it to work. You can try to get in touch with your provider and bitget to check with them but if you can switch to TOTP, that would be better! as it provides better security and eliminates mishaps like this.As for them scamming, imo it's too early to tell... but they're certainly aren't with the reputable bunch and I've always suspected them to be faking a huge chunk of their volume. At the very least, I wouldn't place a large money with them.",

I've seen a tweet a couple of days ago of someone claiming to have lost +200,000 $ (stolen)[2] and if you check the comments, you can see that more people are reporting similar issues. You should definitely consider switching to another exchange once you get back access to your account.[1] https://twitter.com/EvanLuthra/status/1641727962566508545",

Make sure that you're not blacklisting sms from bitget, maybe you forget you did it.I had similar problems with SMS verifications, and the problem was on my end. It turned out that I had blocked the prefix of a foreign country because of SMS spam coming from that country, but a legitimate service for SMS messages is also located in that country, so I blocked both good and bad messages. It sounds strange, but such things happen. Personally, I do not prefer this method of verification, but in some cases it is the only choice and cannot be avoided.",

I've faced the same issue with other highly reputable exchanges.It's usually due to a problem with their SMS service provider or your phone carrier. The problem usually get solved by trying to resend the verification code multiple times or retrying after a while. If the problem persists, then your only option is to contact their customer support.",

They will prompt you to use a password different from the exchange login password so that even if someone gets access to your account, transferring your funds will be deterred without the funds password.Concerning SMS Code. It's simply to verify your mobile Phone number because you want to carry out P2P Peer to peer trading so that when making transaction with a peer, you can be called or you can call to confirm or complete transaction in case of delay. If you fail to recieve the code, check if you had activated DND do not disturb.. so you deactivate in other to recieve codes or check your network provider.I use Bitget and I use their p2p alot so I know this. I haven't had any issue with them. Meanwhile, the best place for initial support inquiries should be customer support or the exchange community. That way you'll get direct useful response. I hope this helps.",
