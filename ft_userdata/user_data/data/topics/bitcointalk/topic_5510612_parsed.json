If you are to choose among this options, which will you choose base on your personal view of things. Share your idea and Help someone to think right. I'm not an investment expert, so my opinion wouldn't matter much. This is the reason why I avoid giving financial advice to anyone. However, I can throw my two cents about the matter and what I think of the two investments you have mentioned.First of all, the two things you have mentioned are different by nature. A hotel is a business that you start from scratch, its success will depend on how much you understand the niche and how you manage and maintain your business in the long run. The initial few years will be very crucial because that is the time when your business will either blossom or start dying off.Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are investments that are completely different from business. You use your money to buy some Bitcoin, you hope that its price goes up so that you can sell what you have bought earlier and get some profit. You don't have to have an extremely large budget for this unlike starting a hotel business where you will need to buy or rent a place, pay for electricity, hire employees, etc.Finally, you need to keep in mind that it's easier and quicker to liquidate an investment but the same can't be the case with a business. If you buy 1 Bitcoin today, the price goes up $2,000 from where you bought it, you can sell your Bitcoin immediately and get the profit. You can't do that with a hotel, can you?These are just a few points. There are a lot of things one needs to consider before one concludes what one needs to do with their hard-earned money.",

      "body": "bitcoin or property..wellwhen you buy property like a hotel, usually its not just buy now sell later and profit.. when you buy property usually you then have to renovate it, do repairs. and ofcourse there is all the costs of the legal paperwork to transfer ownership, insurances, inspections, buying/updating liquor licences, etc, etcso buying a $2m hotel or $2m of bitcoin.. the hotel ends up costing you alot more then $2m in the first 6 monthshowever bitcoin does not have ongoing costswith a hotel, even during the renovation process you are not making money, instead you are paying out money, you even have to pay out town council/state property taxes even if its not making any incomethen you have to spend money recruiting staff training them and getting them ready to serve the first customer of the yearwhere as, with bitcoin if you buy on a dip where the price is near this 2nd half of years low, then the profitability of bitcoin can soon showmuch is the same with property like a hotel. if you buy it at a discount compared to valuation then profitability can show, should you want to flip the property over to a new owner. however most businesses dont sell property at value so good luck buying a cheap property on a dip.the only way to break even and profit from a hotel is if its location is in a tourist area that will get consistent occupancy and in a desired area you can charge a premium per room to cover all your ongoing costs, so good luck in your search.. or take the easier option which is bitcoin, which has less things to worry about on a long term bases",

Both Bitcoin and a hotel are good investment choice for someone who already wealthy, most especially Bitcoin because a wealthy person won't have need for the money he invested in Bitcoin any moment or soon, so he will be able wait for the long term profits that accumulate over time.Hotel is also a good investment but if I have to choose one among the two, I will gladly choose Bitcoin over a hotel, because with Bitcoin I can avoid paying tax and also cost of maintenance of the hotel.",

If you are to choose among this options, which will you choose base on your personal view of things. Building a hotel, managing a real estate and a business is more complicated than investing your money in Bitcoin. The first investment contains many things to do, maintenance cost, and human cost to run your business and economics, politics can affect your business revenue too.With Bitcoin, you can avoid many unnecessary risky cost and it helps you to minimize risk, maximize profit, and you also won't have to do it with a lot of pressure like managing your hotel business. Real estate can be damaged physically with time but Bitcoin won't be, 1 bitcoin will be always 1 bitcoin, in your secure non custodial wallet.",

I will rather invest in Bitcoin and maintain a low profile while my Bitcoin keeps appreciating year upon year. With hotel, you have to go through many paperworks and need a competent hand to manage it for you and you also have to worry about your competitors, so that you won't be outsmart out of the business. But in Bitcoin you will have rest of mind provided your investment is for the long term. You won't worry about competition as Bitcoin have no competition out there. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, as more people keeps adopting it and Bitcoin going mainstream, you stand a better chance of making huge profits. Every year more hotels are being built and the competition gets tougher, you won't be getting same number of customers as people will start shifting to the newly built hotels that keeps coming up. As time goes on your hotel will eventually become old fashion, but that can't happen with Bitcoin. That's why it best to invest in Bitcoin than hotel.",

I won’t really fancy anything that’ll have a recurring cost even after I’ve spent a lot of money to start it up. Hotel is a good investment because it gives passive income faster than investing in bitcoin and holding on to those positions until they’re rich enough to take your profits. With recurring cost, it may take me more time, several years later to get the profit I must have accumulated on bitcoin over a shorter period of time when compared to that of an hotel investment. I’ll gladly go for bitcoin if I’m to chose amongst the two options to use for an investment purpose.",

If i do have the money or financial capacity then i would definitely be considering both things. I would be investing on real estates on which we know that it could potentially give out that passive income but of course there would really be factors on which needed up that consideration specially on where those properties been located. Profitability will really that matter the most with that crucial aspect because properties which is placed into those rural areas in compared into those urban areas specially on commercial locations on which we know that you could be able to say that your property is really that well placed.This is why buying up will really be not just that just easy without having these kind of factor considerations. We do know that when it comes to investment aspect then the more the better but the main issue we do really have is on the capital that we would really be using up. We do know that real estate business or investment doesnt come cheap and thats why onlypeople does have that financial capacity. This is where other investment options kicks in and this one includes Bitcoin of course and others which are something that could be deal up even with lesser moneyor capital that you could make use.",

Building a hotel should be more expensive than buying bitcoin, building a hotel should be more time consuming than buying Bitcoin. And most importantly building a hotel should not stop you from buying Bitcoin. Building a hotel is a business for me and I can not compare it to investing in Bitcoin. If I only had the option of choosing among the two, I will go for buying Bitcoin because Bitcoin will be less easy to maintain and people would not know that I own Bitcoin unlike when I own a hotel. Bitcoin is going to give me more profits and I can buy as many Bitcoin with the same amount of money that I wanted to used to build the hotel. Bitcoin is the future and it can not get devalued unlike the hotel that can go out style for some visitors and unless I renovated the hotel, it might not be getting business anymore.",

I would expect a lot of persons to advise you on taking Bitcoin investment given that, this is a Bitcoin forum and I wouldn’t expect anything different on a real estate platform but, by all means, if you have the means to archive that milestone of a hotel, then by all means you should go ahead and get that investment running.It’s a real estate and not just a hotel and you would be doing the labour market a favor as an employer of labor.

If you are to choose among this options, which will you choose base on your personal view of things. Share your idea and Help someone to think right. I think this should be called a topic of investment counseling but in anyways... Hotel is a real estate investment with potential to yield quick incomes for a long period of times which might actually be inflated based on economy era because people would only patronize you when their incomes are flowing because it most especially, hotels are of pleasure lodges which means one need to make some extra incomes before patronizing the hotels.And starting up a hotel invetainments involves huge amount of capital Bitcoin is one unique investment structure that is designed to face its own inflations off the global economy system.Bitcoin is not a quick source of income but literally a safe for long term investment as it requires patient holding while anticipating on making profits in time.Interestingly you can invest with any minimum capital and how long you keep holding would determine your profits.If we may consider to he disasterous occurances that maybe effective, then Bitcoin investments is better because natural disasters can always hit the real estate investment while Bitcoin assets remains unharmed.About thefts risk factors, I think they are both risky to thefts because armed robbers and online scammers would always hunt on investors that is being exposed of their worths and can always succeed when they fails to keep the source of their savings secured or privately.",

Why not have both if you are capable of? but for commoners like me, I don't have a lot of options and obviously buying Bitcoin is the best option. Asking about building a hotel seems easy and not problematic but the reality of it is that it's not as cheap as doing DCA with Bitcoin. All you have to do is to make yourself comfortable to the choice that you're about to make. But buying and holding Bitcoin is never a bad choice based on my and others' experience. And if it means real business to you building a hotel, it costs a lot more not just with money but time and resources. You'll also have a management that you'll need to be focused on to your people so that you'll have everything monitored and running smoothly once the business is operational. Compared to Bitcoin, you hold, sit and relax.",

You're talking two completely different extremes here. If you have enough money to build a hotel and invest in that then you shouldn't be consulting with the Bitcointalk forum members about this you would just go out and build a hotel AND buy bitcoin lol. Nobody just goes out and builds a hotel without extreme wealth and connections. Anyone right now can buy bitcoin.

I don't want to be troublesome to invest in a hotel or any property that make your investment grow up between 10-20 years. if we look how bitcoin grow up in the last 10 years ago, certain, if you are a smart person will be thinking if bitcoin is the right choice than invest in hotel or property. You don't need to think to repair and renovating your property again when invest in bitcoin, you only need to buy hardware wallet, metal seed and safebox than you will be safe as a smart investor. I just thinking about selling my house now, but haven't get a buyer yet, because I think bitcoin is more profitable than I invest on property.Besides that, hotel prices are quite expensive, and is not certain many people will live if the location is not good and far away from airport or any public facility.

If expenses wise ill go straight for bitcoin, if you are going to build a hotel you will need to spend millions all that are expenses meaning you'll bleed cash from the start, while if you invest on bitcoin its about timing wait for the price to go down then buy a few bitcoins, you can do like sell when you get profit then buy when the market bleeds, its less stressful imagine working with papers and workforce daily making sure you're hotel is on track on a target date, while on the other hand in bitcoin you can just buy and sell when there is profit, you can also can make a small business while trading spending less unlike a hotel, managing a hotel also is not easy.",

So I think you won't get the fairest answer and it would be unwise to seek real estate investment advice on a forum that only talks about bitcoin. Also, if you are planning to go into the hotel business, it means you have experience in this field while most people here are only familiar with bitcoin. Hardly anyone has experience in real estate or the travel business so seeking advice from inexperienced people is not a good idea either.
