  "content": "QuoteThe morning did not begin with good news. Ukrainian cities were subjected to massive shelling from the enemy. We hope all our readers are staying safe. Unfortunately, there are victims and destruction. Russian terrorists attacked civilian objects. In particular, in Kyiv, a rocket damaged the building of the 101 Tower office center, which housed Samsung’s office and the company’s R&D center.As the Director of Consumer Electronics Division at Samsung Electronics Ukraine Andrii Skira reported on his Facebook page, all company employees were outside the office. We also hope that employees of other offices managed to respond to the alarm and get to the shelter.Any evidence that Russia is a terrorist country is no longer needed. It should not be feared, it should be defeated. Therefore, we remain calm, believe and donate to the Armed Forces, and continue to work.https://mezha.media/en/2022/10/10/russians-hit-the-office-and-r-d-center-of-samsung-in-kyiv/....It is known economic sanctions on russia deprive the russian war effort of vital parts and components, such as semiconductors and computer chips.Could russia target chip makers like samsung as primary military targets in the future. In an effort to pressure them to supply russia with much needed components? In this instance russian rockets appeared to target samsung office bulidings. No one was hurt thankfully. Everyone had evacuated to a bomb shelter. How much pressure and destruction of real estate and assets can a chipmaker like samsung endure before they begin to reconsider sanctions and decide to rethink their stance on supplying russia with vital parts and components?",

For samsung it is business and stopping the supplying to a country will surely have an impact over their market. Maybe after finding an alternate supply region, Samsung might take a stand to supply Russia chips and other components that are necessary to stay connected.",

This was simply an attack on Ukraine's economy, and it's pretty futile, because the US and EU already agreed to provide 1.5B per month each to Ukraine.",

Only one rocket, apart from substations, was fired at the building of the SBU in Kyiv.",

Can you think of a good scenario where a missile interceptor lands directly on top of the real estate it is supposed to defend?Does it fit the profile of systems like iron dome in terms of impact and collateral damage.From photos of the building covered in smoke, it does look a little like building may have been hit.Samsung was also a target of at least one electronic hacking attack in 2022.QuoteParsing Samsung’s data breach noticehttps://techcrunch.com/2022/09/06/parsing-samsung-july-breach-notice/My interest in this is finding a motive to keep european and american economies strong.We need both regions to be strong to keep russia in check.Its not a conspiracy theory, last I checked its a fact.Quote from: be.open on October 12, 2022, 03:13:45 AMThe New York Times disagrees with you.

If Ukraine didn't attack on Crimean bridge then russia won't attack civilian buildings too. That bridge was not any military infrastructure and there is no battle going on in Crimean territories. I think both side is to blame for these actions and there are others sources from where russia could get those chip. So sanction will not be a solution for every situation. This just makes your enemy desperate so that he do more madness.",

Switch on your news Russian media, since Putin exactly meant what he is saying which is to respond harshly. Hitting Kyiv like yesterday caused the blackout in the city. This opinion is erroneous. Russia illegally built the Kerch bridge from its territory to the Ukrainian occupied peninsula of Crimea and has recently been actively using it to transfer its military and various military equipment to southern Ukraine in the combat zone. If Ukraine stops resisting, it will disappear as a state, and pro-Ukrainian citizens will be killed, which is now happening in the occupied territories.

As well as construct new units to replace old ones.If that is true. Is it really a large leap in logic to say that this conflict will eventually focus upon that aspect of supply & logicstics.

No, they did not fly to destroy ammunition depots, military units, troop concentrations. No. They shelled peaceful cities, destroyed thermal power plants and electrical substations, destroyed residential buildings, squares, just streets. This terrorist attack did not have a purpose that would help in the current situation, when the pathetic Russian army is losing the war.The goal was and remains the same: to intimidate the population! In order to force Ukraine into negotiations, and at least somehow avoid a full-fledged military defeat of the Russian army. But there is a problem here - the assessment of goals, among the Krenmlevsky Nazis, is based on an assessment of the mentality of their population. And so they were waiting for FEAR from the Ukrainians. The result turned out to be diametrically opposite: even more hatred for terrorists, even greater firmness in the position not to negotiate with terrorists, and even greater efforts by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and volunteer detachments to destroy the army of occupying terrorists!",

Eight Russian armies invaded Ukraine on February 24 from three sides, including from the territory of Belarus, and began to quickly move towards Kyiv in order to overthrow the legitimate government there and capture Ukraine. Such impudence of Putin in the 21st century in the center of Europe shocked all civilized states. Therefore, their desire to help Ukraine, which was attacked, is quite logical. If Russia had not attacked Ukraine, this conversation would not have happened. But Russia attacked. Of course, having seen the resilience and professionalism of the Ukrainian armed forces and the entire people, the United States, like all NATO countries, is taking the opportunity to weaken Russia militarily and economically. NATO countries were afraid of an open military clash with Russia, and here a relatively small Ukraine with a population six times smaller than Russia is defeating the \"second army of the world\" on its territory. In fact, Ukraine is now doing what the NATO countries have been preparing for the past few decades. The US successfully uses the situation, and no more. But Russia itself is to blame for this: there was no need to attack Ukraine.",
