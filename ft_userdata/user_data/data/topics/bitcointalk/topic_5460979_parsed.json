  "content": "This topic is created with the intention to make it self-moderated,  but then I had a second thoughts about allowing everyone to contribute to the discussion since the aim of creating the topic is to explore ways to examine members progress and experience in  Bitcoin since the start of your Bitcoin accumulation and bitcointalk activities. The versatility of the topic and the relevance of individuals' contributions and experience contributed to my leaving the topic for general discussion instead of self-moderated. So the big question is,  how will you rate yourself since your involvement and interaction with Bitcoin and bitcoin talk as a community,  have you become more financially educated resulting in your consistency in building a financially free future by accumulating Bitcoin and spending less and investing more,  or have you become more Conservative in your approach taking Bitcoin as get a rich quick scheme that will always end you in frustration? What have become you financial life and status in the society and how have you managed your privacy using Bitcoin?                                                                                 My self-rating Bitcoin have become a life changing financial tool for me since my involvement with Bitcoin,  more also what have impacted my thought positively is my contact with this forum bitcointalk,  which gave me access to wealth of informations Ion Bitcoin and other financial topics that have helped shape my mindset and help me make better informed financial analysis and decisions. 90% of my thoughts originate from Bitcoin in terms of investment,  and the other 10% is on related topics that come up here in the forum,  being a Bitcoin maximalist my entire portfolio starts and ends with Bitcoin.",

For the privacy part, I haven't got the chance to use Bitcoin much and currently using it to HODL or like a piece of gold. I bought a domain with Crypto.",

You can name this topic as BitcoinX, Bitcoin Exploration. X is the trend after Elon Musk tweeted that he will change Twitter to X.Do you think that you over magnify the role as well as importance of Bitcoin?It can not be a tool to help everyone on Earth to get rich because Bitcoin market is a zero sum game. I assume you know it but forgot about how this game works when you made this topic.Quote90% of my thoughts originate from Bitcoin in terms of investment,  and the other 10% is on related topics that come up here in the forum,  being a Bitcoin maximalist my entire portfolio starts and ends with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has rendered many people various financial opportunities to make them run their economy lives smoothly without having the usual challenges experienced with the traditional economy and the fiat currency, now with bitcoin, i can personally manage by financial economy, manage my business and have enough privacy needed by me to control my financial assets and investment without going through the centralized authorities, my status in the society also have changed, because people could see the new dimension of me emerged without complaining of bad financial economy together with them because i control mine independently, some wish to be me but don't know the secret is nothing but bitcoin.",

The reason is simple, when you want to try something new, you fear if you will do something wrong. However since I get paid in Bitcoin and just hold it, I feel the volatility of Bitcoin isn't a problem and I can deal with it. Accumulating Bitcoin and hold it to make big profit in the future will make you think you will become rich, yeah you're rich but financially free is when you can still earn money without need to work. If you not have at least 100 Bitcoins, I don't think someone is financially free.",

At this state I'm still not a financially free even though I've been committed into bitcoin, I see bitcoin to some of my friend those are the one who teach and enlighten me about the things I need and I come up with the bitcointalk community members shows up the things I need to learn and to avoid to my path those experience came from different people makes me more aware about the bitcoin itself, still currently I'm building myself to the innovations and changes of the bitcoin, so for the upcoming halving and ATH I'm prepared and not getting FOMO for the situation.

The forum has improved my approach to saving and spending. Financial terms like long-term investment, Dollar Cost Average (DCA), Hodl, FUD, and others have made more meaning to me. The forum has instilled the attitude of longtime investments and the need to be patient and wait for your investment to mature. DCA average has made investing quite easy for me and my investment don't have so much impact on my finance. I have also been exposed to the concept of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt and how institutions and influential individuals use it to manipulate the market, so I have learned bravery and focus. My taste or desire to invest in money-doubling schemes has been quenched by this forum.QuoteWhat have become you financial life and status in the society and how have you managed your privacy using Bitcoin?      Financially the forum has been good to me. My engagement in this forum has been fruitful financially. Regarding the change of social status, I am still that young man working quietly in the street of a developing nation. I have always kept the financial part of my life secret hence my social status is still the same. I have learned so much about privacy and security so I don't want to attract criminals to myself by telling people about my relationship with bitcoin and the forum. My phones and laptops have better security and I am more conscious about not using my phone in public spaces. I am also conscious now about clicking on links to avoid hacks and privacy invasion strategies.",

And we would never get this forum before even in the real world, so this forum is a very valuable teacher.and anyone who engages with bitcoin with this forum is sure to get a decent profit, thanks to the knowledge and good advice one gets on this forum.and financially bitcoin is very helpful and can also change someone's life for the better than before. And the financial freedom that we get from bitcoin doesn't mean we have to use it often because in the future bitcoin is much more profitable and we have to be more efficient and also keep buying to cover what we used before so that in the future we still have lots of bitcoin.",

Untill I found that everything the government said was a myth and everything to date is to make rich more rich and the poor to remain a poor. The recent tax on our earning is the best example. Without any regulations the government went ahead and placed a tax on our earnings.These tax rules are not clear and are harsh. As the government is governed by burecrats these ministers are now being questioned. We will never achieve our full potential as the government has been only promoting.those who are in to software. They never thought about trading, social media promotion & etc. They are still in the old age and they will still be the same. Unless the government rethink.",

I don't hold any other asset, though. So, my portfolio's worth varies from time to time, according to the price of bitcoin. I wouldn't say bitcoin has taught me to be financially dependent; I think that's rather difficult, and can't come to you without lots of action. No, bitcoin holders from the early days aren't counted. What I do acknowledge, though, is that bitcoin has given me the interest to study money. As a politically neutral currency, it raises you concerns of whether the financial system is working as envisioned, and pinpoints its flaws.",

I haven't really harvested Heavily from Bitcoin investment profit, but I have been earning more than double what my country calls a minimum monthly wage with the help of a signature campaign that is being paid with Bitcoin.

I started my journey back in 2018 when i started to do Virtual Mining (free of cost) which only wasted my time. Actually i am the one who wasted my time not those mining fake platforms.So, i left spending time on crypto after frustrating and then in 2021 i again started my journey and came to know about this platform, spent some time on bounties, then started to take part in discussions which really excites me because i was learning things. So, yeah! in short this platform had taught me a lot. Even, this platform help me to find my passion of Content writing. And also in selection of a niche. I may want to become a developer of blockchain one day. But till then i will learn as much as i can. So, to do that, now i have expended my reach in technical discussions too.
