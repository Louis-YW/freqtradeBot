      "body": "Yes it nearly always happens that way.Things like bitcoin, eth, monero and polkadot are less likely to shift from the top spaces based on market cap (but eth, xmr and dot are still likely to fall compared to bitcoin as all altcoins are and have proven pasts of doing).There hasn't been that many cycles though too to base things like this off which should be another concern here. There's a chance something could emerge to outshine everything near the top (a few CBDCs or a big tech issued token could cause a few of the top slots to slide).I used to think 1-10 was low risk and 10-20 was higher risk (back in about 2018) but I think that's changed too.You could look for what VCs invest in but make sure you actually do your own research - even if it's just taking time to watch a video on it from YouTube or a quick flick through their whitepaper and forum.I think axie is an example of another coin recently that fell from nearer the top before, I doubt it was reported on much because it was defi gaming and that industry seems weaker than the stablecoin one.",

      "body": "Yes because VCs are not blind, they always go with very good projects but it's better to do your own research, VCs involvement with a project doesn't mean it can't turn to scam or crappy project. Remember LUNA?The more new ideas are created and built into new projects many old top ranking projects will lose their ranks and get replaced by the new projects, this is somewhat normal, a project has to be very strong to retain its rank after several years, for example Ethereum.Popular layer 1 projects are topping the top 10 on coinmarketcap today, we already have Layer 2 and it's possible that attentions may be shifted to layer 2 some day making layer 1 lose their positions too. Final advice, always do your own research.",

That's always been the case, some projects suddenly went to the top 1-20 like BNB and ADA. And for the Luna case, there could be as we know that market is too risky and volatile and we don't know the people behind. If there intentions are real like Do Kwon, who gain the trust and reputation, but his project collapse right in front of us.",

Copy trade can be a thing, but always following someone's decision might put you on a bigger risk so better not to rely on anyone and don't make any decision if the top investor adopt a project, that doesn't mean it's a good one.Old project like NEM/XEM was on the top 20 before but due to the competition they are not able to adopt it and now they are down to rank 90. It's really possible to replace the old project by the new one, this is a very competitive market and if you failed to develop new things expect the worst scenario.",

However, this is not the only element and reason. Even though VCs invest in new projects, we must also analyze further whether the project is really suitable and worthy for the long term, or just for hype. Because many people only take advantage of the hype so that the project will easily fall.Quote from: Harchive on September 29, 2022, 03:55:58 PMAnd also can we see another top project in the rank of 1 to 20 failed like that of Luna?I am sure that non can predict it exactly because the fall of LUNA is also unpredictable at that time. We saw LUNA as a very promising project with great progress and development, but suddenly it is fallen down and made this as shit now. So, it may be possible, but we can't predict exactly. And hopefully, this will never happen again, enough only for LUNA. Quote from: Harchive on September 29, 2022, 03:55:58 PMFor those who have been here since 2016 do new altcoins always replace the present top 20 altcoins every crypto cycle?IMO, it's possible.Some may take over others, the new one may get higher and some on the top previously may be replaced. As we have seen on some coins or tokens previously. But, not all top coins are replacable. It will depend on each project. But, exactly, it's undeniable to see this probabiloties.",

For those who have been here since 2016 do new altcoins always replace the present top 20 altcoins every crypto cycle? Investing in VC-invested projects is also a factor to evaluate the quality of projects, for example, Binance Lab funds most of the projects they invest in are successful because they have a team of research and thorough screening before investing. But that does not mean that the project they invest in will not be a scam in the future, because they are also investors and not project owners. So you can rely on that and do your own research and then decide to invest.We are in a young, open industry, so it is normal for old projects to be replaced by new, better projects with more utilities. That shows that the market is developing very well, which is a good sign.",

It was when more of the users has the enthusiasm to really support projects thinking this is the future. The prices of the tokens including Startis and Lisk and etc shoot to the moon while we got them for less than $0.20 I believe. Comes bear market after 2017, none had ever improved.

For those who have been here since 2016 do new altcoins always replace the present top 20 altcoins every crypto cycle? Since crypto is cyclistic, I would say Yes on your 3 questions.VC knows some inside information or at least they have a bird eyeview and so they are the one who invest first on a company that will blow up in the future. So it's normal I would say to inves on those projects being endorse by VC.Maybe projects in the last 4 years have been a boom or bust. They started hot going as high as 10-20 and then disappear. It's how crypto works and only prime mover coins will have a chance to stay in the market for many years.",
