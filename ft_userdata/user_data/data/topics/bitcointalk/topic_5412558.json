I think most of these services are running a custom code and don't really want to offer integration for individual users. They target business owner for marketing and stuff like that, so best of luck if you're trying to contact them and ask for a map plugin for your website.",

      "body": "Looking at both those sites I am probably going to say it's not worth the time and effort.There are BATMs that no longer exist that are still listed.There are entire BATM networks that are not listed. (LibertyX comes to mind)Even if you just want to spend crypto, there are stores that no longer exist that are still listed.And so on....These maps seem nice but since they 1st came out with all the other integrations of crypto into other apps they really need a major do-over IMO.As an example, the SPEDN app. You can do crypro -> spend in store to Baskin Robins, Chipolte, Game Stop, Petco, and about 20 more places. No, they do not 'take' crypto but so long as you can put crypto in -> get stuff in the store on the fly does it really matter? Do you want to see all of them listed? Even if you want to support businesses that directly take / support crypto they probably are not doing it themselves but through a 3rd party, be it BitPay, Square (Block) or some other one. Very few that I have seen are doing it internally.Not trying to be a downer, just being a bit realistic for this at the moment. -Dave",
