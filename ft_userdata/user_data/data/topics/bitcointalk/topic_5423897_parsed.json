I read Ghana is trying similar thing but with gold. I wish the country takes my advice and do the local currency trading.Â It's nice to see India so obedient to order even though it isn't really a Christian nation. It's quite hard dealing with people you think will understand. I hope the country is greatly favored.",

In addition to the volume of trade exchanges between the two countries, the UAE attracts a large part of its labor force from India. With entering into a cooperation agreement, the UAE dirham will open up to a huge market, which means an increase in its value with an increase in demand in the Indian market. India, in turn, will have a foothold in an emerging market that includes the largest financial institutions in the world, which will enhance the position of its local currency and its recovery after a long period of stagnation due to both internal and global crises.",

The balance of economic interaction must be balanced. Why ? Because no currency is really freely convertible, and for the most part will only be used for mutual settlements between these two countries.2. Each currency must have quality collateral. Everything is more or less here - on the one hand, oil, on the other, the largest economy in the region, and indeed the world.3. Since both economies are not self-sufficient, and still largely dependent on the outside world, this project will have a very narrow \"corridor\" of use, because both countries will still gravitate towards receiving income in more liquid currencies (dollap, euro)",

The previous world order where 2 super powers (US and Soviet Union) each controlled half the world didn't go away with a world war. It was replaced when one of the super powers (ie. Soviet Union) fell apart from within. This new world order is being introduced in a very similar fashion where the United States is weakening from within and possibly completely falling apart in the next 5 to 10 years.",

Bitcoin is different from fiat currency.Sourcing for dollars to carryout international trade have been one of the challenge of most developing nations. Although using the dollars makes international trading easy but it has also promotes the influence of external actors in the economy of some nations. Using society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) have made the dollar a major international trade currency. Trading in local currencies would reduce the challenges of sources of dollars and reduce external controls from powerful nations. I also totally agree that bitcoin would indeed a good alternative in international trades because it would give the nations involved equal benefits and opportunities.",

In case of the Indian currency (Rupee), it is free-float but that is not the case with AED. So effectively the Indians are trading against the USD when they are dealing in AED. And as per my understanding, almost all the currencies within the Gulf (GCC) region are pegged to the US Dollar. And although it is true that the GCC currencies are regarded as some of the strongest national currencies in the world, they are not protected against any potential drawback from the USD such as inflation.",

Because their standard of living is already at the level of the 18th century But how many economies will be pulled to the bottom by the wreckage of the US economy - you canât even imagine!
