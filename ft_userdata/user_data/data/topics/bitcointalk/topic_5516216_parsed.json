But this time around, yeah, the bullish market is probably driven mainly by institutions. Yesterday, the fees were as low as 2 Sat/vB for high priority transactions. So, I guess this is just a spike in the fees, a quick and temporary increase. Right now, the fees have decreased considerably. It might go north once more especially if the retail market goes active, but I'm seeing double-digit fees in a day or two.",

It has even gone lower than the 5sat/vbThis happened in the past week and it took only about a day to go back to normal. If not for this post I wouldn't have noticed that transaction fees were so high yesterday. I don't think the bull run is a reason for high fees. Normal bitcoin transactions, no matter how many they are per minute, will mostly not lead to congestion and ridiculously high network fees, but ordinals and runes that are spammed every second are the major causes of network congestion and high fees.",

The good news is, this time it only took a few hours before things went back to normal. So, when I see this kind of situation, I’m not too worried because I’m confident the fees will drop again soon.But this trend definitely has an impact, especially if we adopt Bitcoin as a payment method. Let’s face it—no one’s willing to pay fees that high. This is why most people will continue to prefer fiat money for all their transactions instead of Bitcoin.",

Not to mention, in the more distant future, what will happen to transaction fees if bitcoin is legalized globally and widely used on a daily basis?This is one of the reasons why I think bitcoin will never be able to become a popular currency, payment method, bitcoin is not absolutely perfect as we think, it's just that many people don't want to accept that.",
