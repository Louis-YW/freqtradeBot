Is Roshtein streaming on fake money or not?I am sure in 101% that he plays fake money, but a lot of friends of mine - said the opposite.After twitch banned stake and other casinos, he deleted all videos and dont even stream anymore, so its 100% proof they he had deal with stake and use free money to play, what do u think?https://youtu.be/9X5eSMS_Uow",

Each streamer has a different deal. IMO Rosh is a fake money guy. Fact is, we will never 100% know.",

From my perspective, I can say that he is a genius at his craft. I actually want to see more of him streaming. So I know the fact that there are various deals between casino and the streamer. Regardless, based from my conclusion everytime I watch his streams, I believe that the money that he is spending to play on Stake came from his own pocket. I know it is hard to believe it. In my case, at first I did not believed that it is a \"real\" money, but then later on, I am convinced that the money is not fake.  You can see how genuine his reactions are and how he behave on his next day stream almost everytime he had a big loss from his previous stream(s).This guy, Roshtein, is different from other streamers.",

I don't know what Rosh or Trains deal is, but I've heard people discuss that train uses his own funds and is 100% reimbursed for his losses and paid money on top. So IMO train is a fake money streamer as he isn't actually losing his money and is paid for content. Rosh may have the same deal and fill his balance with his funds but is reimbursed 100% if he loses plus a little extra on top.I cannot confirm any of this, just my thoughts.Think about it. Slots are fucking terrible. You're gonna lose most of the time. Who in their right mind is gonna go max bet billions of bets knowing they're gonna lose their ass, if they weren't playing on free money basically?",

      "body": "I was scammed by a casino owner, the casino name was Bitlucy. Anyone who knows me on the forum know what happened with me. Some believe and some does not, I do not care anymore now. Eventually the owner scammed many clients, including me. The whole incident effected my real life and virtual life with that my financial status too. However, the bright side of every loss was to gather huge experience from this unfortunate event.None of the streamers play with real money. Depending on their channel's popularity the casino owners offer them credit balance. All numbers are relative and depending on the level of bargain they come to an agreement with each others.If someone has 5M subs then they will get $50k, $100k or even $1M credit. Someone with 1k sub may be offered $100 or even $150. You get the idea.There are conditions for them to be able to cash it out. A condition of wagering x times. x could be 20, 30, 40, 50When someone is lucky they actually make good amount of money. Sometimes the casino owner will give another condition of able to withdraw a maximum amount. In that case, even after the successful required wager, the streamer only can withdraw the maximum amount that was allowed to him and casino owner will remove the rest of the balance.A casino needs traffic and clients. The streamers provide it to the casino. It's a win - win for both. The strategy works very well.",

What marvels most is that his stakes are always high. It is still a strong debate if he is a high roller or fake but there are no solid claims to which side to classify him but yet his followers keeps increasing i think this isn't clear at all.",

That is not fake money, that is sponsored money that comes from the gambling company, they use it for marketing purposes only and as you can see, sometimes streamers like this have better odds but I don't know if odds can be manipulated because they always win. However, as stated above, we don't know what is their agreement, so this is only a conclusion towards them.",

When the bank roll is high they usually can't fully withdraw all their winnings unlike what you said, but only a percentage of them like 10%, someone has made a thread about the different deals offered by casinos to streamers. Being paid by a percentage on their winnings allows them to look super happy when they make some good winnings during their streams while letting them showing big amounts on their screen.",

At leat to them they need to tell what's real and what's the show.Many influencers keep a role of being rich as attracts money, but maybe not as much as they would people like to know.Obviously this is just me guessing.

I can't deny some might be watching him for entertainment purposes like me.Seeing how easy any streamer like roshtein to win big bonus makes me think if it looks unreal. Local gambling streamer in my country was also getting max win so easy. But this is how marketing through streamer works. I do believe mostly of streamers used WSO (Winrate Slot Online account)",

The reason they can make it even with that is their ability to create a stunt or reaction that would still relate to the users, regardless if it was their money or not, and that's their craft, does leave a bad taste though since some people think they can hit it big like them with no risks involved.
