You can receive as many as possible because different people can send merit to you, but max of 50 from the same user. Read about merit system here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2818350.0At top right corner of each post, you will see quote, beside quote you will see merit, click on it if you want to merit the post.",

See this section: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=merit. Every time you get 2 merit, then you can spend 1 sMerit for other users.QuoteIf yes, How many?50 merit/ user within 30 days. This means if you have 1000 sMerit then you can spend it on 20 different users.Quoteand how many can you receive as a Newbie?There is no limit to the amount you receive if it comes from different users. The rule is that you can only receive and send 50 merit in 30 days from or to different users. This cycle will repeat for the next month, and I think that's how the system works.Quote from: hd49728 on August 25, 2022, 07:35:42 AMI believe you know that you need one merit at least to rank up and earn more stakes for your bounty work.I just realized about that.",

Its not that he didnt answer it correctly but only a few tweaks like reasoning like what I was said.A plain newbie account cant send any merits if he dont have any smerits. To be clear.",

Glad that you have understood what I meant, I included theymos merit system link which is enough to understand what merit system is all about, if Rafi0001clicked on it, he is going to understand everything that is needed to know, he got no merit, which means he got no smerit, nothing to send.

The problem here is that he is here only to participate in Bounty Campaigns and now he realised that earnings are not as good as told by his/her friend or a family member. When these Bounty participants realize that there is nothing like a permanent income with Bounties as it used to be back in those days then they ask questions, about how to get merits or if they have multiple alt accounts and want their main account to rise the rank they would as such stupid question as OP did!This individual might be doing the same.",
