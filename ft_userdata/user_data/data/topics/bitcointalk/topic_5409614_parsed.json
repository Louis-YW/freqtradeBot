If those two were true then I think there's a chance you've made a loss more permenantly and it's probably worth looking at what you did wrong to try not to repeat the same mistake.If you didn't buy an ico and just bought a coin that was hyped then you might be better off holding some of the coins (and transferring the majority back into btc) as we might see similar runs again but price might drop a lot too between now and then.If you bought coins you thought would do well but didn't, this is the one that's going to be harder to assess. If they've still got an active team and they look to be doing things and coming up with new ideas then you might be better off holding the coins. If not then you'll be better off selling them - especially if they're low volume and low volatility.",

Buying tokens that are not in the top 30 in CMC is considered useless to me and should be taken serious risk if taken for consideration.",

Is there a possibility that the market will rise in the future?99% of those altcoins won't ever come back to the old all time high and sooner you realize that, the better. I was in a similar situation back in 2018 when I had bunch of altcoins that dropped much compared to the price it was when I initially bought them. After some thinking I've decided to sell all of them with a loss and it proved to be an excellent decision because if I waited for a new bull market, I would lose way more. Its not easy to sell with the loss, but more often than not it is a right decision.

Is there a possibility that the market will rise in the future?The crypto market is on the downside atm, after the peak of late last year. This results in majority of coins losing most of their value, and forms part of a cycle of ups and downs.Not all coins gain their value after dropping as 90% (and this is a conservative percent) of them are shitcoins which were built on hype. So, there's a 90% chance that the token you own would not regain its lost value.Always do you own research, before making any investment decision",

If they are shitcoins or ICO, it might not return to what it was when the bear market continues. But if it is well known altcoins that you bought, don't bother so much, before the ending of September, btc will get to $30k and your tokens will return to live. Disclaimer - DYOR.If you are buying any coin apart from bitcoin and some popular altcoins, make sure you enter the market at a good time and do not stay for long without getting out of the markets.

Is there a possibility that the market will rise in the future?Cryptocurrency fluctuates a lot. If you are new to this world then do not panic and remember only one thing that every investment decision leads to positive and negative consequences. So, make your decision after proper research. Altcoin investing is not easy business, and you need to be prepared to accept losses. The altcoin market can be notoriously volatile, and unless you are an expert in market analysis or you are betting on the right token or coin at the right time, there is a very good chance that your investment will fail. But if you are willing to put in the work, then it is possible to generate substantial profits, especially if you catch a rising token before it climbs too high. Now, tell us which tokens you bought so that we can tell you if there is a chance for them to recover or not.",
