  "content": "A friend had Bitcoin stored on an old iPhone (back from 2012), in an app called «Bitwallet» (by Sollico software).But when they tried to transfer it out, it complained about the key being \"neither a compressed or uncompressed key\".No software would take the private key in (tried a dozen), and trying a WiF decoder showed it's invalid (even though it \"looks\" right, starts with 5K, right length, etc).So I decoded it using a small nodejs script, and what I found is a key where 15 of the bytes are FF.Something like :80 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff etc... <15 real bytes, kept secret, presumably valid> <checksum>So my guess here would be that somehow the flash on the iphone got corrupted, and half the key is missing.Does that make sense, or am I missing something, and a key with half of it being ffff makes sense in some way I couldn't find?We also have the public key/address. So what we have (if I get this right) is the public address, half the private key, and the checksum. Any reasonable way to get to the coins with this?This is like around 128bits of entropy, which doesn't sound like it can be cracked, but could the checksum and public address help in some way?Any other ideas of what to do? There's 3 BTC on there.Thanks in advance for any ideas.",

It can't be stored separately and as I said before if one character in it is \"corrupted\" you won't be able to decode it since the checksum would most probably be invalid.Same with prefix, it is not something that is attached later, it can only be decoded. Again if the string is corrupted, after decoding (even if you ignore checksum validation) it is unlikely to get the same prefix.P.S. to be honest, this looks like yet another fake wallet that you have found and are wasting your time on it.",

However, it's very unlikely to find one, and it's impossible to prove that an output can be spent by two or more private keys unless you find those. Otherwise, it's just highly likely. Quote from: ecdsa123 on December 03, 2022, 09:32:45 PMYou are wrong. do not think there is a range or not. think about it as : there is privatekey somewhere - 2**96 possibilites. that one privatekey in this example is zero it means there are (2**96) - 1 to find. Run abstract thinking about it.I don't understand you. There is no private key with value 0. It's outside the curve's range.

Often this also involves me talking with the customer and doing sleuthing etc.When I can't figure something out, just in case, I'll go to forums/social media and ask around. When I do that, I always say \"my friend asked me for X and Y\", because i don't think anybody cares about the details of exactly why I need help...In this case, after investigating, it turns out the customer's story about a 10 year old iphone is bullshit, and his private key can easily be found just through Googling. Apparently this is pretty common, if you run a wallet recovery service, people will frequently contact you with keys they found randomly on the internet, pretending they are theirs, asking you for help with getting them to work.This is against TOS, but still people do it all the time.
