  "content": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a direct challenge to Europe's postwar order, which is articulated through multilateral organizations like the EU and NATO and is backed by US strength. It needs to be seen if these systems buckle or are re-energized by the Russian threat. It's also uncertain how China will balance its ties with the West and its Russian neighbor in the long run. China has actively prepared for a period of geopolitical turbulence by hoarding oil and commodities as a reserve buffer, while maintaining friendly relations with Russia. Beijing is in a good position to help L&MICs mitigate the conflict's negative consequences. Debt has crippled many Asian and African economies, which are reliant on Chinese inbound investment and commodities consumption.How do you think China would respond to this crisis? your thoughts please.",

Mirrors the composition of china's military which also relies heavily on conscription. I would guess china is using data collected from the invasion to better strategize their announced impending invasion of taiwan. The west in the current era functions as a series of chinese vassal states. Russia is more independent than the united states. But Putin grovels to suit china's needs. The big question is whether china will be able to survive when its safety net of global trade & beneficiaries dry up in the next impending economic crisis. Its wealth and GDP are built upon a foundation of ghost cities and questionable assets. Critical banking infrastructure has been failing for many years. They have bubbles in the form of evergrande and multi trillions in automobile related debt.",

They're far from collapse but their economic growth appears to be slowing a bit.They might look to Taiwan to ease any economic woes if they have them. Not that the Ukrainian war would have offered them any pause in their intentions to take Taiwan, but it certainly has reaffirmed their ambitions seeing the miserable response by most EU nations and the U.S. The only difference is that Taiwan is worth more to the U.S. than Ukraine. So if compelled, the U.S. might use military force to protect Taiwan in the event of an invasion (I'm still a bit doubtful thought).China are the real winners here.",

See no matter how much we advocate the west, there always should be some other equivalent power to counter balance a growing power otherwise that power would substantially do anything it wants to and will portray it as the best thing for the world. I think what Russia did isn't correct but was necessary to show an example that how one country can decide to go against what the whole west wants the world to.",

In fact, China now supplies goods only by land, and sea freight is blocked by 80%. Both China itself and the whole world, which is used to receiving goods from China by sea, suffer from this. This can be regarded as an act of China's soft economic warfare in its confrontation with the West.",

There were some videos circulating around of China killing people's pets and confining them to their apartment buildings not even allowing their citizens to go to the grocery store unescorted, if at all. I can't verify these videos, but they seem legitimate and aligned with the CCP. IMO, they weren't too vulnerable from COVID, they just forced themselves into a position that allowed them to be economically fragile.It's also why I laugh at folks that think China would be on board with Russian sanctions. As if they would pass an opportunity to conduct trade with an oil producing region.",

Almost all energy resources is going to china as the biggest partner now.QuoteCurrently, around 80 per cent of Chinese imports of Russian products are minerals, and crude oil comprises more than 70 per cent of those imported minerals, according to Post calculations based on Chinese customs figures.More  information",

Russia probably wouldn't be in as dependent as state as North Korea is but if the Western powers do push through those sanctions, Russia wouldn't really have much alternatives but to sell to China at lower rates than it would have wanted.",

Due to the nature of its government working China could not be trusted at every corner of the roadmap. The only thing that is putting up China and Russia relationship strong is the current opposition of EU and USA to Russia thus giving protection to China in geological sense. China needs Russian fuel, and it’s not at all in the position to create another resource or relation due to their negative attitude. China is going to stay silent, and will only open up arms when everything is favourable.",

Russia invaded Ukraine for a reason and this reason was birthed by US who wanted to have interrupted access to Russian border. If Ukraine is invited in NATO, it will have to give this access to the NATO forces aka US. That's what US is looking for a long long time. Russia definitely didn't appreciate that! Now through this gameplan, US also planned to increase the dollar dominance in EU nations which didn't work out. Look at the list of suffering countries - these are from EU only who are heavily dependent on Russian oil and gas. US didn't take the hit. Understand the gameplan of US. They are just trying to maintain their supremacy over the rest of the world while Russia and China is a roadblock to achieve this.",

What you described is the most peaceful state of the world we have ever seen for many decades and it was shattered by an unnecessary war. We have already seen, even if you fail to understand it, that Europe/America/others have come together more than ever before to face the Russian threat and supply weapons to Ukraine. Everyone in this region is going to suffer, Ukraine is facing many pointless deaths due to Putin's pathetic bloodlust and Russia is going to be a global pariah for decades while Putin stays around. China is actually fostering their own home grown problem right now with this weak attempt at zero Covid, while the rest of the world understands it will always circulate and they have no respect from any free people.",

They could use that billion population power into this trouble and end up with a good result in the long run, wouldn't be ideal but wouldn't be a problem for them, totally profitable.",

I don't think that they are stupid enough to attack Taiwan, conventional wars are getting pretty much obsolete in the 21st century, the war in Ukraine is an example. Wars are just too expensive and the potential benefits are questionable. Why waste your resources in a war, when you could achieve your goals using other ways.",

And the world \"bent\", then expressed \"strong concern\", but nothing more. Everyone understood perfectly well that 2014 is a tracing-paper since 1939, although now it is not Hitler who is at the head of the world terrorist, but his pathetic likeness from the Kremlin. So it was all expected and predictable.I am now more interested in another topic - this is the disinterest of Germany, France, Italy (and some other, less significant countries), in the correct end of this war! Namely-not interested in the victory of Ukraine over Russia!For them, this will mean building a new way of life in Europe, losing their status of \"top EU countries\", forcing them to new rules of the game, where they (the ruling elite) can no longer be the bedding of the Kremlin, receiving handouts from the Kremlin, for the sale their countries and the EU as a whole.In a word, the real shock for the ruling, corrupt elites of Europe will not be the fact of unleashing a war by terrorist Russia, but a victory over Russia!",
