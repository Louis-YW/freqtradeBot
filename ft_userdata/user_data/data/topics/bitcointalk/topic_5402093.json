  "content": "Global bitcoin adoption to hit 10% by 2030: Blockware reportI am surprised to see that bitcoin adoption is not yet up to 10% of the world's population. See the blue arrow, where we are in 2022, very not close even to 5% of the world adoption. With bitcoin presently at $30000 and having over $500 billion marketcap, I thought the world's adoption would have been more, but not, but an opportunity for people to buy bitcoin.Quote“With Bitcoin direct financially incentivized adoption creates a game theory in which everyone’s best response is to adopt Bitcoin.”Bitcoin, like the internet, smartphones, and social media, also derives benefits the more people that adopt the technology, which is known as the “network effect”.“Case in point if you were the only user on Twitter would it be of any value? It would not. More users make these technologies more valuable.”However, the authors of the Blockware report stressed that the model used to predict the rate of adoption was only conceptual at this stage, adding it is neither meant to be used as investment advice nor a short-term trading tool and it would continue to be refined. However:“The general trend is clear; there is a high probability that Bitcoin’s global adoption will grow significantly into the future and thus so will price.”Although, this is said to be conceptual but adoption is what most likely will occur. Some people will be saying it is too late to buy bitcoin, just like some.people said in 2014 when bitcoin price was at $1200 or below, some people also said so in 2017 when bitcoin reached $19600, some people said so when bitcoin price reached $68900 in 2021. Following bear markets and then rise again and reach all-time-high. The probability that six digit is possible in the next long lasting bull run is very high. No one is late to make the continuity of the adoption possible.",

With bitcoin presently at $30000 and having over $500 billion marketcap, I thought the world's adoption would have been more, but not, but an opportunity for people to buy bitcoin.Even if we are now at some 5%, I would consider it a success, although after 13 years of Bitcoin, we could expect that percentage to be much higher. I'm not surprised that so few people have come into contact with Bitcoin at all, because generally the average person won't understand (or won't want to understand) what Bitcoin is no matter how someone tries to explain it to them. If we reach even 10% in 8 years, it will still be a good result, considering that it would mean that we are approaching 1 billion users globally.Quote from: _act_ on June 10, 2022, 02:28:36 PMAlthough, this is said to be conceptual but adoption is what most likely will occur.

No one is late to make the continuity of the adoption possible.People who say it's late mostly use it as an excuse no matter the price - because in 2015 the price was around $200, during 2018 it dropped to only $3000, and the announcement of a pandemic brought it down by as much as 50% to only $5000 and it's always for some expensive.  In 5+ years $30k will be considered cheap, but even though the numbers are changing, people are not changing too much.",

      "body": "Bitcoin adoption will reach 10% by 2030? Why notIn fact Bitcoin fits perfectly with every technological development and is proven to date. If we look at the early growth of Bitcoin, nothing has changed at all, i.e. Bitcoin can adapt to all technological advances without needing to be updated. That way, if we talk broadly for 2030, Bitcoin will remain compatible with increasingly sophisticated streams of technology.This can be proven that adoption in the following years until 2030 certainly does not rule out the possibility that public openness to Bitcoin will be much friendlier and make it a complex alternative to all types of payment methods.",

I mean it gotta start somewhere so its always an option Everything needs a start, and until it gets carried forward the circulation shouldn't be let down. The gambling platforms does this and helps with the progress of adoption. If bitcoin wasn't used in gambling and dark market the real time adoption could've taken a fast phase or else it could've gone unused. For now we can see a good awareness among common people about cryptocurrencies, because in the past it is believed as a source used for gambling and dark market.",

I am pretty sure that Satoshi and handful of enthusiast and early adopters  couldn't imagine this success in their wildest dreams. Keep in mind that bitcoin has been around for barely more than decade and went a long way from being traded among few cyperhunks for a fraction of  a cent, to situation that we have now. On top of that, big percentage of people are not interested in self-governnace and everything else that bitcoin represents.",

However there are many definitions to that, is someone who signed up at an exchange who ran a free 2 dollar giveaway once with that amount sat in their wallet a user? What about a wallet owned by a hedge fund, are they calculating those investing as people using it? Are they including wallets with dust amounts in, which sit abandoned never to be used again?
