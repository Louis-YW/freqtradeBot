  "content": "It's no more news that Bitcoin fell sharply last week with over $4000 shedded, this was largely attributed to contradictory events, regardless, the market has moved significantly and the aftermath has left the sentiment on the larger charts bearish.If you remember in my last review here, I made mentioned that Bitcoin could do three things, it could either claim a bullish path with a convincing break of $31,450, or a bearish path with a sustainable breach of $29,400, or could remain sideways in a confined range between the two levels. It however chose to breach the lower end and convincingly moved a $4000 target below it.Now, the weekly chart remains bearish and threatens further selling. I see $25,000-$24,700 (approx. low of June) as the viable barriers to contend with. A significant break of these levels would further pressure the market.Let me hear from you guys, what do you think of the fate of $25,000 this time?",

This is same with day traders that rush in to purchase Bitcoin during the short term bull run. I’m thinking the current dip as shake off to remove those short term players and transfer there Bitcoin is to the new holders that will hold long term. This will make Bitcoin value slowly moving upward instead of a quick pump that follows by sharp dump like this.",

If bitcoin breaks the support and it moved below $24000 to $23000, I am expecting $20000 and prices below again. If bitcoin will go down further, it will not go below $17000 is my guess.",

Do you think that 16K bitcoin price will come? If it comes to that level, it will make a double bottom and of course, in that price, you should accumulate more bitcoin but I doubt that we can see bitcoin ever again under 20K. With halving just a few months later, I do not think that the demand for Bitcoin can be so less that it can dump to under 20k.

I think the dump for the moment is over and Bitcoin is headed again towards the 30K resistance but it may take some days before it will be ready to test that resistance again.",

Whether it would stay down or go above it. But if we go by what other price of bitcoin has displayed, it is possible to say the fate of the $25k would come into play and the same way possible to remain at that price for long. I said that because the bitcoin price of $28k-$30k lasted for many months before it falls below the $4k difference($26k)Now, that the bitcoin price is at $26k, it can fluctuate within the range of $25k-$26k for a month or two before we can think of seeing it skyrocket to a higher amount or a lesser amount.In a nutshell, I think we'll keep seeing bitcoin for $25k-$26k until the end of this month or the beginning of next month",

No worse news expected, bitcoin should be priced higher towards the end of August.As far as I know, we are already in a new cycle starting with a bear market.  I also hope that the market will recover soon or if not soon, the halving will be enough catalyst to swing the trend to a bullish trend marking the start of the Bitcoin campaging to a new height(ATH).Although I am not confident that Bitcoin will recover soon, I hope that the market will stay sideway and not do another dip down to sub $20k.  It this happen, the Bitcoin market will take a heavy toll and those anti-Bitcoin will start their noise again saying \"I told you\".  But although the market looks grim, this is the best time to accumulate at a lower price.  So lets take our chance to get Bitcoin at a discounted price.",

I don't expect bitcoin to dump more value and head for another low of support - but it is possible even if at the moment we are just speculating.I expected more support rather than pessimism from the majority - but some groups definitely expect a deeper drop to the accumulation plan. A deeper decline is possible - but only if bitcoin is really hit by worse issues.",

If ever the price would be hitting below 25k then we might be seeing 23k next and possible worst we would be going back on $20k. Well, im not really that close minded about the probabilities on which i do believe on something more lower considering that there might be still that last dip or decline before the price would be starting to recover and reaching out 40k to 50k as we are fast heading or approaching with the halving events on which we know that after that we would really be seeing that bull run. Although it wont really be an assurance on when it would be happening but at least you had already secured yourself on the bottom which it would be the wisest thing to be done.",
