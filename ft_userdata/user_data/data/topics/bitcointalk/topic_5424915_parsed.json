      "body": "This movie looks very violet and I wonder if people will walk out of the movie theater with all the aggression. My heart rate spiked while watching the trailer.  The trailer shows, how “Cocaine Bear AKA Pablo Escobar” felt ingesting a high amount of cocaine. The irony is that, in most cases it is true that it is euphoric and can be deadly. It is showing what can happen when taking cocaine, blissful feeling, to the high feeling, and even anger. So, I guess, this is a new way to prevent the use of drugs. Kids say no to drugs. I think this looks like a crazy movie that could be very violent and hard for me to watch but it still interests me so I will see it when it comes out next February.",
