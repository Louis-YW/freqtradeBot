  "content": "Hey fellow crypto gamblers,I hope this post finds you well, but I come bearing some unfortunate news about BC.Game. It seems like the once-promising platform is going through a series of drastic changes that might spell the end for this casino.Over the past few months, I've noticed a significant decline in the generosity of BC.Game when it comes to bonuses and rewards. It's disheartening to see how they have been systematically cutting back on the perks that initially attracted many of us to their platform.Firstly, the removal of the rakeback bonus was a big blow to regular players who relied on it to enhance their overall gaming experience. A reduction in referral percentages further indicates a shift in the casino's approach, making it less appealing for users to bring in new players. The removal of the wheel bonus is another puzzling decision. This faucet-like feature was one of the main attractions of BC.GAME that brought people over.Perhaps most concerning was the attempted removal of the BCD rakeback, a move that was fortunately reversed due to a public outcry. However, the fact that they even considered such a drastic step without considering the impact on their player base is alarming. Furthermore, there's a growing concern about BC.Game's lack of response to numerous threads on the forum. Many players have posted questions or issues, but BC.Game has not taken any action to address them. This lack of engagement adds to the frustration, as players feel ignored and left without solutions to their problems. It's essential for a gaming platform to actively participate in its community forum, providing timely responses to ensure a positive and supportive environment for its users. The silence on BC.Game's part regarding these threads raises questions about their commitment to resolving player concerns and maintaining a healthy player-community relationship.BC.Game also made some changes to how the games look and work, causing confusion and frustration for players. The way things used to be easy to understand is now more complicated, making it hard to navigate. They also took away the private message feature, which used to let players talk to each other. This not only makes it less fun to play together but also means players can't easily talk about problems or concerns. On top of that, there are more problems now with bugs in the games, making the whole experience less smooth and reliable.These changes collectively paint a grim picture for the future of BC.Game. It seems like they are prioritizing short-term gains over the long-term loyalty of their players. A casino is only as good as the benefits it offers to its users, and BC.Game seems to be forgetting this fundamental principle. As a community, we should take this as a warning sign. If a platform is willing to strip away its most attractive features without considering the consequences for its players, it's time to reevaluate our trust and loyalty to that platform.There are plenty of other crypto casinos out there that value their players and continue to offer enticing bonuses and rewards. Let's use this opportunity to explore other options and find a platform that truly values the community it serves.Feel free to share your thoughts and experiences with BC.Game.",

And we really cannot be too trusting, with all the scams going on in the world of gambling and crypto (especially crypto-gambling). But I would also agree with the above poster. It seems like they are just readjusting as well as remodeling their promotions to fit their current goals. Although I cannot call it a smart change, if it angers and disappoints so many in the community to the point that people are complaining loudly.",

The distrust of a casino caused by accusations spreads quickly in this community. What is being posted here can be on social media in just minutes and users are already alarmed. And the competitors are always here to catch those leaving customers. Not also a fan of BCgame even when they quickly rise up. We all have loyalty to casinos we always play.",

Do not forget that there is a fierce competition on the business so if everything they do will have direct impact on their business.",

I think this is a warning before they completely go bust and vanish with our money.In a way it's true because how were they able to keep the business afloat for so long when they're really not making that much profit due to their generous promotions right? If that was really the case they would've made something about it early on and they should've talked to their customers about it so they won't be surprised about it. If this is really the sign, I just hope that people that have been playing there or have their money stored hopefully can get out their money before it's too late for them, with the multiple scam accusations about them recently I would probably think twice letting my money stay there.Quote from: goldkingcoiner on November 23, 2023, 02:07:26 PMBut I would also agree with the above poster. It seems like they are just readjusting as well as remodeling their promotions to fit their current goals. Did they explicitly said that they are going change or that they've given their players some sort of early warning that there's going to be a change in their casino? Because if they did then it's in their right to do it and have the people just go with the new rules but if it's not then they fucked up because people are surprised about the changes and they weren't even probably considered or consulted about the changes.",

Declining business is one factor to look at but we should admit that they offer too much percentage in return to the player.  They are still popular here in my country because I watch a lot of local streamers here using BC.game while they have lots of followers that playing too. Just like any other business. If their promotion cost already doesn’t cover much by their profit. They need to cut some expenses to continue the business. But I doubt they will easily close the casino while they have strong number of active players.",

It's one thing to be slow at addressing concerns, but to just ghost support cases is very worrying. I'd never use such platform myself.",
