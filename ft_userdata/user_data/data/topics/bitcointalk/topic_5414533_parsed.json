What's your opinion regarding this statementWell, every price prediction is possible even the lowest that one can say like $3k again or $1k or any lower. Bitcoin is volatile that it can be at those prices that we're not expecting or has been predicted by him or by any other guy in the market.We're in a speculative market and it runs with speculations that anyone can say.",

It's not a viable storage of wealth (yet), it's a volatile invest. I use it to send money quickly with less fee's. BTC pretty much tracks the tech sector and the fed, so as for now it behaves like a stock.Eventually as it's market cap increase 4-5 more trillion via institution it may become a lone actor.",

      "body": "I think that Saylor is afraid of being too bullish because he made that mistake once and is making his predictions too bearish. 60k in 4 years is a very bearish prediction because in 2, after the halving, we should be in a strong bull market. I don't need 60k to unload my coins, but I also don't want to see it being manipulated into a downtrend by politicians who are afraid their fiat currencies are dying. It's their goal to make bitcoin, gold and stocks look like a bad investment that are losing value. It's all a big lie.

Bitcoin should be trading at least for 25k USD at this moment but it's not and the reason is not bitcoin's weakness or mistakes of those who made higher predictions. Sometimes people just don't want to give you your money's wort due to economic conditions and it dosn't mean you have to sell below the real value. Price at a given time is not value, pretty much like when you get offered a very low paid job. If you value yourself, you decline such offer and wait for a better one.",

If you value yourself, you decline such offer and wait for a better one. bitcoin does have an underlying value. as do jobsmin wage in america is $10/hour. meaning everyone should turn down a job paying less. and no one should accept such job.. this is the bottom underlying value of fiat. the minimum secure and supported value all people think is the minimum.. peoples individual values(sentiments/emotions about self worth and price) can vary which are all values above that limit. however fiat has a underlying limit no one sells themselves for below.bitcoin has one too.. no one on the planet is acquiring (mining or private OTC purchase) bitcoin or trading on markets for under $15k. thats the current bottom limit underneath the speculative market bitcoin also has a upper limit. the amount every person and their mother can acquire bitcoin for less that. and that limit is $90k at the momentthe market price is volatile but wiggles up and down between these limits. right now the top limit is about $90k so no way is there going to be a $100k bitcoin in 2022yes $68k can happen anytime with the right rally.. but a save bet is that it will hit the $70k mark again in next 4 years. its like common send using a safe number in a large buffer safe time schedulemuch like saying in the next month you will use the toilet. no one can predict the exact price of any future given moment but you can see the bottom-top windows and calculate mining vs hashrate costs to adjust that window and see where the future window may lay at any given hashrate .. to know the realms within that the price will speculate(wiggle) between",

But this is only a possibility even though the optimism from bitcoin's history can help anyone survive longer. I guess 4 years is already long enough to expect a $68k price for bitcoin. It may even be possible by next year once the bear market is over and bullish season will start to enter. With positive news that are expecting to hit the market that will create a huge impact on the price of bitcoin, that way bitcoin will easily touch $68k even before halving happens.",

Speculations are already keeping new users coming in crypto in hopes to get rich every 4 years. $68k in 4 years still is somehow high still but its happening ever after halving. The trend continues to higher ATH to higher ATH. Given the current economy and people starting to look at BTC because they can't trust banks? $500K in the next decade is very possible.",
