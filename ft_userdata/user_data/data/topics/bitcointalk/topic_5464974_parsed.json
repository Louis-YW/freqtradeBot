  "content": "Hello Guys Here i want to present the new crypto project New Masternode Savings Coin (nMNSC)The story behind the project:We were an investor in a crypto project called Masternode Savings Coin (MNSC). We really liked the developer's concept at the time because it was in line with what we were doing. So we put a few thousand euros into our hands and actively supported the project through a strategic partnership. Unfortunately, this support remained quite one-sided, because there wasn't much from the developer side, instead of concentrating on this one project, he took over a few others and then worked on them, then a little on the other, etc. That's how it happened, of course there has of course been zero development over the last few months while we have risen to become the biggest whale because we have bought a lot of coins from the market. Then he collected money from other investors with the promise to pay them back with interest, but he hasn't been around since mid-June. the users who lent him the money are now chasing their money and we are sitting with many others (also from the other projects) on worthless coins. So a few from the community, including us, got together to save our funds and give the others the opportunity to do the same. For this reason, we ended the partnership and are now redesigning the whole thing according to the original ideas that we as a company had with it. MNSC now becomes nMNSC (New Masternode Savings Coin).What is the Usecase of nMNSC?The main Usecase of nMNSC is to build an Buybackprogram through investments in other PoS Projects. It will be a closed Cycle and can expanded any time. The Rewards from nMNSC will change in BTC -> These BTC will be used to buy Coins from other PoS Projects -> These will generate new Rewards -> These Reward will change in BTC -> These BTC will use to buyback nMNSC from Market = Cycle closed. This will be the Basic. Also the community can create any time more usecases and also the users can create there own usecases. The target is to create a  new store of value backed by other PoS Projects.No OwnerWe decided to have no Owner. A Crypto Project stay and fall with the Community. So we decided to give the Force to the Community like a DAO. Everyone can make suggestions how we can grow up, then we discuss about it. If we see the reactions are positive we bring it to the final vote. Through a Votingsystem the Community can decide about it. The Team just manage the basics.https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1130925058773229568/1145970804551585792/nMNSC-logo-256x256.pngExchange nMNSC will be listet on Stakecube Exchange in next days. https://stakecube.nethttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1142056334880165960/1142060274967388210/image-1.pngDiscordFor more information about this project and if you are interested, please visit our Discord server https://discord.gg/YXV3SW4XVrCoin Specs• PoW Algorithm: Quark• Premine: 35,000,000 nMNSC• PoW Blocks: 1 - 500• PoS Blocks: Starting from 501• Block Time: 60 Seconds• Maturity: 20 Confirmations• Prefix: nMNSC adresses start with the capital letter \"N\"• Ports: 14258 (p2p) / 14259 (rpc)Why is the Premine so high and what happen with it?The Premine of nMNSC will have 35,000,000 nMNSC. The reason of this is we take into account the amount of coins and their current values of other Derik Projects, also their are about 19 Million MNSC. So it can secure that any users of all other Derik Projects, can swap to nMNSC. Anything left after that, will burned.",
