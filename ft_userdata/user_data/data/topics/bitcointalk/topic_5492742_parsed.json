I'm using the DCA method in collecting Bitcoin and I sincerely love the dip we are experience now prior to the halving because it will give me ample time to collect more Bitcoin at discounted prices. However, I don't thing we will see as much as 30% drop in price considering that halving is just days away.

From January till now, Bitcoin have enjoy positive news following the ETF approval and many critics have even embraced reality. Consequently, there have been injection of fresh capital that have lead to the sustained growth we have experienced. Like I said before, those still sitting on the fence till this time are not ready to be invested in Bitcoin.",

I thought that by now people who are into bitcoin are used to the price of bitcoin pumping and dumping because it is volatile in nature. The war has been on over for some times now and bitcoin recorded a price higher than the previous ATH before the halving, yet they want to still hold the conflicts responsible for this dump. Ever since bitcoin price reached 73k, this is how the price have been moving, it moves down to 62k,and back up to 71,and down again. So I don't see what is new here tht is caused by the ongoing conflict in Gaza. It is just that in every scenario tht plays out, human will always look for what or who to put the blame on. Keep stashing up more bitcoin now that we can buy in discount, and enjoy your profit in future.",

Bitcoin is already down and anyone who knows that it's a great opportunity should try his/her best to accumulate some of it.I agree with you. It's not all about showing one a way on how to make money, what also to be considered is if the person in question do have the resources to invest? Just as you said, if the resources just as investing on bitcoin whether the dip, bear or whatever is about money as the resource to invest in It, anyone who's interested of investing and doesn't have the money would still be setback with the excuses of no money to Invest on. And believably, there are people like that who have the interests to invest on bitcoin but doesn't have the fund to make it real. And we that are already in the bitcoin system is already aware that it's not just about investing but you must have alternative on how you can keep earning while your bitcoin holding works out to bring you profits in matter of time.So not everyone who's are interested in this journey are capable to meet up with the demands.Moreover, anyone who has been of irreverent excuses to Invest in this bitcoin would always have excuses nomatter how clear and flexible the opportunity would be for them and not basically that the price of bitcoin has befall on the dip where we can buy cheaper. It all depends on what we want and our readiness including individual ability of securing ita provisional demands",

Just like yesterday they weren’t expecting a -10% dip when you tell them there will be an heavy correction. Also reason why some of the are that sacred are because they must have invest an amount they cannot afford to lose and they are worried as to when the price will pump again. One thing is this dump will take out the chicken/weak hands off the market, because people will still sell at a loss mostly altcoin investors. Quote from: btc78 on April 14, 2024, 10:35:12 AMQuoteWhy do everyone thinks that the price drop is caused by the Izrael-Iran conflict?It might not be the reason but someone really thought it was so they took their coins and now it has caused a domino effect with everyone else trying to sell their coins as soon as possible.War always has its negative effect on any market, because it causes not just unrest that makes people to panic and sell but also if prolonged will affect the energy supply market and anything that affects energy comes back to affecting the bitcoin mining which in turn causes a drop in bitcoin price. Yesterday’s incident wasn’t the cause of the dump because they were already few drops ongoing. But immediately after announcement of the conflict there was a sniper drop of bitcoin from the $65k region to less than $61k in just like 2 hours. Had there been a prolonged alteration we might have face a more sever drop still",

As for those who always say they want bitcoin to decrease, they wait for bitcoin to decrease and will buy more. Most of those people will never dare to buy bitcoin and when bitcoin drops they use the excuse of wanting it to decrease even more, until bitcoin recovers but they still don't have bitcoin in their hands. We are only 5 days away from the halving and I don't think anyone expects bitcoin to drop more and most won't buy if it drops more because no one has any money left to buy. I'm one of them, LOL.",

They can hope for dips but when dips appear, they are fearful, not greedy.

A Bitcoin analyst predicted that we may see a correction during the US tax day this year. Investors will sell their shares and cash out profits from all markets and they will pay taxes. The day is here and we are only one day before the US tax day. I don't really know how much it impacted the market and how much the war, but we can see how hard it's dumping.

Bitcoin has gone from $15k to $73k, a 15-20% correction is normal but many people are overreacting. It seems like people are not just investing in bitcoin, most are also investing in altcoins and many altcoins are having quite large drops and people think things are getting worse. But if we only invest in bitcoin and what is happening with bitcoin, bitcoin is not even down 15% then we cannot call this a big dump.

Goods and services have skyrocketed to the sky that the small amount of money you have now is for survival first because if is only the living can invest.
