This makes a whole lot of sense now, I have always thought Satoshi disappeared because he needed some privacy and probably give room for bitcoin to be used in a decentralized way without him/her/them interfering from time to time.Now it is clear, Satoshi must be avoiding some sort of pressure from the government and those who weren't in support of the invention as at that time.",

No one knows exactly what Satoshi was thinking at the time and why he chose to maintain his privacy. There are many reasons that can be thought of, such as avoiding government pressure or perhaps even imprisonment, as well as a practical application of Bitcoin’s basic idea of ​​privacy and decentralization, or perhaps for other reasons that we do not know.I sometimes wonder if Satoshi had not chosen to maintain his privacy and hide his identity, what might have happened? We probably would not have seen Bitcoin as it is today.",

Now that mine are all spent, I wouldn't mind getting a few of those back Was hoping to get some comments or opinions from people from back then, so you seem to be one of them. The general feeling I got was Bitcoiners on this forum weren't generally supportive, nor thought the focus on Bitcoin thanks to WL was good.But I wonder if opinions changed since then. Bitcoin has many use cases, and WL being able to accept funding because traditional means weren't available is essentially a direct parallel to my own case as a freelancer just wanting to get paid. Blocked by PayPal, not able to have Visa/MC or even SWIFT in many places where I used to work.Quote from: NotATether on June 27, 2024, 06:23:01 AMWikileaks should have been doing even better than places like this forum and other sites that have reserves of dozens or hundreds of BTC, but it's felt stagnant ever since law enforcement started closing in on Assange.So I don't think they've actually got much of a use for all that money but it sure is handy to have around in case the site and servers get shut down or seized and they have to move shop elsewhere.Yeah, they've not published anything new for years, in all practical purposes it's dead.

If it is about human rights, it's truly to say that Russia is bad.Their activities mean something for their homeland's citizens because it creates pressure on governments to change, minor or major, so their contributions have value, I have to recognize this. But if after all, they migrated to Russia and had to say sweet words about Russia just to satisfy that regime under Putin, it sucks again. Honestly I don't know Snowden has ever said sweet words about Russia or Putin.",
