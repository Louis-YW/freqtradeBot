So bro there are many sides to the story of all the fairytales of being rich and influential, it's a political game, where. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.",

The holy book will not mislead us and I believe that for every one penny that you give out from your heart,you will never lack it. On the other hand the government might be doing all these to encourage Elon in his generosity.",

In fact, once the government becomes aware of your significant wealth, they tend to offer grants, subsidies, and even tax credits just as what Elon Musk's companies are enjoying. Simply because the government benefits a lot from that kind of business. They get tax and they can get discounts from such business and they needed the spacex for their space projects, no more no less. Your example of businesses cannot be compared to other \"small businesses\". If you are talking to SMEs, i dont know if US have that kind of sellers, but they are lot of them here which is probably government helps them provide anything they can, smaller tax, promotions, and place to sell, sometimes cash assistance as well. So you can't say government doesn't help smaller business, not unless its not registered and business owner didn't approach the government to ask for assistance.",

      "body": "Maybe, just maybe, because the government believes they can utilize Musk's businesses to a certain extent. That's why they are supporting his businesses when he needs funding. Also, they know that Musk can generally get the money somewhere else through his assets so they can basically just give him whatever he wishes and it'll be at his doorstep when he wants to. There are a lot of perks when your business is literally a multi-billion dollar one with technologies that the government might be interested on. Also, these businesses failing might also translate to a lot of economic damage, so instead of letting it fail, the government can just go ahead and spend a little here and there to save it.",

The reality is that this is all about power and influence, not about whatever spiritual force there is in the world. In my country, huge corporations are getting billions and billions of loans. It is very easy for them to borrow from both government and commercial banks, receive grants, even tax incentives and exemptions, and other special treatments. On the other hand, what are called MSMEs or Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises are barely breathing. It's always a battle of survival for these small businesses. They're being preyed upon, abused, by lending sharks. The reason? Far from biblical. It's as worldly as the lack of powerful connections and influence and grease money. They can't afford to donate millions during elections. They can't afford to give sports cars and whatnot as gifts. They can't call the president of the largest bank in the country.",

The reality is that this is all about power and influence, not about whatever spiritual force there is in the world. I agree but apart from power and influence, governments provide facilities and tax incentives to those who create jobs and generate economic activity. This is very good for governments because then they collect taxes, which they like so much. So let's not think that the tax incentives given to Musk are given altruistically or because of the power he has. It is by giving those tax incentives that the government also ends up collecting, in the form of income tax from the employees of his companies, or VAT from the Teslas sold and things like that. Also, if Musk innovates with SpaceX, the government is spared from doing so.",

Historically it is the government that finances capital-intensive exploration or scientific research. The first American space adventure Project Mercury in 1958 was sponsored by the US government. But as entrepreneurs keep making advancements in technology, the government will always want to support them because it will benefit the country. The US wants to ensure that this project becomes a US brand and it will become a project that promotes national pride. Also , the government wants to secure these inventions to restrict these entrepreneurs from selling the idea or partnering with competing nations. Another reason is that these billionaires have the money to engage in partnership funding. The government might not want to totally fund a project so they like working with people that can afford to provide part of the project or investment cost.",

They need the true light to see and do right. The quote is meant for the Israelites or Christains.* The World's culture isn't really fair.

That's because almost all business people, and entrepreneurs who are already successful now, not a few have a dark past. But they didn't give up and kept fighting until finally they succeeded in achieving all their dreams. So what you mean is that those who only have a little capital tend not to be looked at by people or the government. Because the government or the general public must have seen the evidence first. It was only after that that a sense of trust emerged among the people and reached the government.And when viewed from an economic perspective, there will definitely be a significant difference from what is called venture capital. So it is certain that those who have small capital will not develop as fast as those who have large capital. But do not rule out, even those who only have small capital will be able to develop quickly. Because you do not forget other factors besides money. Such as innovation, inspiration, fighting mentality, and totality in doing his job.",

An example that you mentioned from Elon Musk, and I also know that to have such success, he also had to put in a lot of effort to get results, it is better to compare the process of they do not look at the current results to compare and argue without logic.
