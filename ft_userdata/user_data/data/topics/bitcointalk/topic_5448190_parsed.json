      "body": "Quote from: mimosizz on April 09, 2023, 10:33:22 PM. . . when miner selects transactions for candidate block, they usually pick transactions with higher fee. . .The transactions are typically chosen by the software that the mining pool operates.  Individual participants in the mining pool generally don't get to choose the transactions. Since the mining pool gets to use those fees for profit and/or to pay the participants, and since there is a limit to the number of bytes of data that can fit into a block, choosing the transactions with the highest feee per used space is the most profitable thing to do.Quote from: mimosizz on April 09, 2023, 10:33:22 PMcan they pick any valid transactions with significantly low fee?Sure. But they will earn less bitcoin if they do. Since miners need to pay for the mining equipment, internet connectivity, electricity and possibly employees that they use, and mining pools need to pay for their servers, network connectivity, electricity, and mining participants, they need to earn as much bitcoin as they can. If they fail to earn enough bitcoin to pay for all the costs, then they will run out of money and have to stop.Quote from: mimosizz on April 09, 2023, 10:33:22 PMif they can, how all these things work?The mining pool would just modify the computer software that they use so that it uses some other method of choosing transactions.Quote from: mimosizz on April 09, 2023, 10:33:22 PMis it manually adding a list of transactions?That would be possible, but it would be slow and risk errors.  Far more likely, they would just modify the software to implement whatever criteria they wished to use.Quote from: mimosizz on April 09, 2023, 10:33:22 PMor automatically?It depends on why they are doing it, but since mining continues 24 hours a day, every day, continuously, it would generally make more sense to have software that handles most of the process for them.Quote from: mimosizz on April 09, 2023, 10:33:22 PMi guess if it's an automated process, miner can't pick low fee transaction at all but i read that miners can include any transactions they want for the candidate block.If you're talking about a miner that is mining for a mining pool, then they would need to rely on the pool to handle it.  For a solo miner, they would need to modify their own software.",

For those who want details.Quotethat is really messed up! every single documentation that i have ever seen has always said \"it must not be compressed or it will not be mined\". now i went back and checked the out, they are all are ambiguous about it!take BIP143 for example:https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki#restrictions-on-public-key-typeQuoteAs a default policy, only compressed public keys are accepted in P2WPKH and P2WSH. Each public key passed to a sigop inside version 0 witness program must be a compressed key: the first byte MUST be either 0x02 or 0x03, and the size MUST be 33 bytes. Transactions that break this rule will not be relayed or mined by default.",
