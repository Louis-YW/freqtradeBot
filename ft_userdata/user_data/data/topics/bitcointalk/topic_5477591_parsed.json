As a matter of fact, gambling is designed to make you hopeful of winning always and if you are not careful, you might become complacent. It takes effort to overcome the urge to continue gambling after major wins. Those who have been able to master gambling and all it takes to remain in the business ensure they fix this psychological problem as soon as they can.",

If they are winning, they will see it simple and they will become relax. This is the time to lose. Also if losing, the zeal to win and not lose that make a gambler continue to gamble is another time for more losses to occur. This is how humans are. If they see something easy, they will enjoy to do that thing. But in gambling, that is the time gamblers are vulnerable to gamble with more money and lose.",

After winning a large sum of money, a person often loses the sense of reality, and begins to believe that the lucky streak has just begun. At the same time, a large sum deprives a person of a sense of proportion, and usually he does not notice how his winnings completely disappear",

      "body": "Actually, many people and some social researchers have suggested there is an inverse proportionality between the amount a gambler would wager in Relation the knowledge they have on mathematics and laws of probabilities. When anyone gambles, that person is not supposed to be thinking about the chances he has to earn money, otherwise it will only end up in frustration and broken expectations. Those who enjoy their sessions at the casino the most are those who think the least about mathemstics. You know why? Because there is only reason anyone would try to apply math on dices or slots in a casino: to try to make money out of it, and we all know how that turns out to most of the gamblers. Just see gambling as fun, fun does not need to have a rational purpose to exist. For example, there is people who likes to drive around their city for fun, even though their are losing money in gas, they are not earning anything beyond the experience of a lovely afternoon, and so, they enjoy fully because there is no thought about earning money when going out for a car ride with friends.Gambling should be seen in the same way, it would save so many people from suffering bitter experiences, in my opinion. By the way: the chances of earning money while driving for fun are zero percent.",

      "body": "The reason for the belief that their luck isn't running out is because the brain is overjoyed and the fleshy circuits right now is going haywire on happiness and so the person can't think straight on what to do next, even if they are the most logical ones out there, when they win, they're definitely going to go over their plan and keep on playing, your brain craves dopamine and so you want to chase that hit from that win and so you end up playing hoping to get that win again. That's how gambling addicts started, they win big and then the next day they're chasing that high they get from winning.Quote from: ryzaadit on December 12, 2023, 04:05:54 PMYou are supposed to keep playing on the heater until you meet a cold section.

One things people should aware, just need to set up a limit win and stop while you got cold section (streak/multiple lose) after your heater.That's how it's supposed to be played but the problem with that is that it's just a phenomenon that many lead to believe to be true and so we end up having to think that this is true, that there's such a thing as cold section. For me, this heater that you're calling is just the same as a gambler's fallacy but the only difference is that it's a matter of winning until you hit a lose unlike the fallacy. Non-statistic strategies are not the best kind of strategy to me because when this kind of stuff is put into practice, it's overwhelming underperforming and it's not consistent compare that to those that have a math in their approach, it's totally different and you're wins and profit will go up when you subscribe to that, even if you set up a win so you'll know when to stop it's not that effective.",

      "body": "There is a general upbringing in the world, amongst children. Which is to try again. We keep on trying, and even after getting what we want, the impulses seek more of it. The gambling world is dealing with humans not robots. And we are obliged to behave accordingly. A problem if happening to one person could be seen as personal, but when it occurs with too many people, then the fault shouldn't be on anyone. But, it'll be seen as a general psychological problem. Go on Quora, you'll read hundreds of posts about people who wagered all the money they've won, ranging from 1k dollars, at once and lost it all. When credited with extra money maybe from family, they'll wager all the money, still. Believing that luck is on their side for winning thousands of dollars. The whole money goes back to the casino. Even if the gambler withdraws the money, he'd feel the urge to play more the next day. Within him, all his efforts are paying off. He wouldn't mind the subsequent losses, and keep on wagering until the whole funds gets exhausted.Gambling addiction causes this type of problem to players, and they try to stop when broke. Immediately money is handed to the person, he'll rush back to gamble. This is related to the thread that says; reckless gambling begins from a win. However, not all gamblers get involved in this ill behavior. But, a colossal amount of gamblers have been through similar situations. While we blame the gamblers, let's take it outside the gambling niche. If a salesman gets more calls and closes deals often, he keeps on going to work. And also work diligently as a salesman. Humans tend to repeat, whatever works out in their life. Regardless of the challenges that follow after it worked. They'll keep reminding themselves of the positive days, as a weapon to get passed the negative moments. In a niche other than gambling, it's quite okay to keep on trying after a one-time win. But, gambling isn't a profession, and following a similar route would be detrimental to the life of the gambler. Yet it seems inevitable. The brain doesn't recognize whether it's gambling or not. It only releases those impulses, involuntarily.",

The chance will be the same in the next round, 50-50.Gamble fallacy will believe for the 11 rounds \"Banker\" will have a better chance.",

And he will continue to play, saying, \"if I'm so lucky, I'll be lucky again now.\" But according to the laws of mathematics, the chance of such luck becomes much less, doesn't it?When I view gambling with the laws of mathematics, then I will never play gambling. Because math is about certainty, while gambling is about possibility. Which of course this is very contradictory. When math speaks that one plus one is two, then gambling will speak differently that one plus one is ten and it could also be that one plus one is zero. If we think rationally, of course gambling is very detrimental, but we also get other things, namely sensation and pleasure when doing these activities. So just assume that the loss you experience is a fair price for the thrill and pleasure you get.And speaking of the possibility in gambling it returns to ourselves personally, whether in doing this gambling is only for pleasure by continuing to squander money. Or change this activity that still gives pleasure, but is less detrimental and gives us a little benefit. All of this goes back to our beliefs and understanding of gambling, as well as our abilities at the time of gambling. With good self-control and finance, we will always be able to turn this gambling activity into an activity that does not cause a big loss. And with good knowledge and abilities coupled with your skills when gambling, you will always increase the chances of getting a win every time you play gambling.",

For some people, like new to gambling the heater is a streak, so basically betting on a heater means you're putting a bet to continue a streak. It's like the NBA teams, why would you bet on 3-16 Spurs over 16-3 Philadelphia? Technically the math that you should think of this is the chances of how many win did it have, or basically the probability of repeating the same pattern.But sometimes countering a heater may be a good idea since there will be a point when there a shift, or a pause on that streak but then again putting a bet on a heater after that pause or shift is the most preferable to do by most of gamblers, not until there is a turn over.",

It looks innofensive, but it makes total difference the more you play and the longer loss streaks you suffer, especially after hundreds or few thousands of placed bets.However, not every gamblers care about mathematics or understand it, so they just ignore it and go ahead betting as they wish, without worrying about the consequences of their acts, as you mentioned in your post.I think the title of this thread funny, because in fact, there isn't logic against mathematics. Logic is a very elementary concept inside this subject. What gamblers can try doing is to use their luck against math, as it's the case of jackpot and lottery winners who to win big once it's already enough for the rest of life, so they don't need to enter the so feared long term gambling.",

If he's lucky, he'll get more; what he relies on is luck, not mathematics. For me, this is quite terrifying because the probabilities I consider are based on calculations, not just feelings. Someone who relies too much on luck is likely to get something big (if lucky). Unfortunately, I can't force my luck too much, so maybe our gambling approaches are a bit different.For me, mathematics is somewhat necessary to understand the probability of winning we might have, while luck plays a significant role. I still strongly believe that gambling requires a significant amount of luck to win big, and I also believe that mathematics plays only a minor role.",
