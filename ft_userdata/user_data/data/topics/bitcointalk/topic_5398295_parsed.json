      "body": "It is already panic selling because I see the price jump drastically to the lowest price and seems it is hard to rise higher and get to the higher price. But if miracles are coming to that coin, the price will rise again. Otherwise, the price will go to another lowest price and even, the coin can get delisted from all exchanges. It is a critical moment for that Luna and we don't know if that Luna can survive and pass this test. I can't imagine how big the investor lost before when the price is jump down.",

Will it go to 0 or up?It will not go to 0 because as long as it has buyers, it will not go to 0 but I don't think in the short term it will go up.TBH, with what happened to LUNA and with what is happening right no with the market we might see LUNA under a penny. If the developers will not make a solution to what is happening right now to them and if they will not fix the problem regarding UST then they will be in an absolute disaster (even though they are right now already). If you want to make a huge risk, you can trade LUNA short term on exchanges where it is listed now but don't hold it mid to long term. Good thing I didn't buy this one because I'm also eyeing on this coin for quite some time.",

So the supply has grown from 300M to 1.5B and may continue to grow without limit, and without a cap, until the price is zero.https://messari.io/asset/terra/chart/sply-circAnyone putting money into the token is making a bet that the developer will do some kind of emergency decoupling of LUNA and UST with a software patch. That might occur but, at that point, what's the point of LUNA? It becomes just another shit coin and one with a profoundly huge supply meaning sub-penny status forever. Outlook is not good and any investments right now in it should be viewed as you providing immediate liquidity to UST holders. Probably not a role you'd want to play - you're not speculating, you're trying to bail out UST which will bankrupt anyone who tries since the sell side on UST is unlimited as long as it stays below a buck.",

You must also see how dip the price right now. There's no hope for this token, im sure that if people are also aware about this troo. Even when there was an announcement for the UST burn and this doesn't give any impact to the price of luna. It was still dropping so hard to the bottom. I suggest you to take a look at the chart of terra luna right now. This is the worst token after bitconnect",

I see luna like Soft rug, only a small chance of recovery, one way might be to migrate but it may not be possible to get the trust of the community back.",

Did you convert the remaining of what was left after the drop in price to another crypto or safe coin? or are you holding on waiting patiently and believing that the price is going back up and you will recover?",
