There is important one too that I have not mentioned yet which is bitcoin and also some altcoins that are of good marketcap which I believe can make me 10x or more in some years to come. I do not like spending money on things like cars because I do not have the money yet, if I have money for it I can buy myself a car to make things easier for me but I just do not joke with something I think its value will increase with time. With the little that I have as for now, I will prefer to use it to invest on bitcoin and good marketcap coins because they are easy to buy.",

And, yes, I often prefer to spend it on experiences, like with people I care about, rather than on things like cars and clothes, as you mention.In reality, the car is often the biggest source of financial stress, especially for the middle class, and this is something that many people do not realise. Never buy a car to show off, get one that is reliable and that you can afford.",

What is \"your dream\"?  bigger home, a bigger car, private schools, branded drink, gold?...Incidentally, 1 week ago I decided to move from a rented house in the city center and returned to my hometown because I had finished building the small house of my dreams with my wife and children. This made me think that for 1 whole year I spent money on renting a house that I couldn't own. Decisions had to be made which turned out to be costly in the city, making spending even more wasteful.For now, 2 wheel transportation is enough for me. Owning a car is ideal, but the taxes are much more expensive. Reducing unnecessary purchases makes me feel more economical. The cost of living in the village is quite economical and so far I know the difference between the cost of living in the city and in the countryside.",

I've learnt this as a lesson for some while ago about money and how we spend them, it is believed that money has it own season of flow whereby each individual is place on the advantage opportunity to utilize the money for valuable things while it lasted, once the flow stops then what is left is the things we have engaged it doing while it flows, but many never reason it this way that money can stop or cease to flow, this is why we should understand that nothing lasted forever because nothing is permanent.",

There's this great guy that I used to look up to, who in his old and frail days told something so profound I still think about it sometimes. \"Money is meant to be spent\", is what he says. Simple but holds so much value. You only have one life to live, don't spend it sitting in front of the desk working all your life and yourself to death. Not saying you should be a bum and forget about everything in exchange for experience, I'm saying you should look outward, find other sources of income that would allow you to have more freedom. That way, you can go out there and take yourself to adventures and experiences you have never seen. Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry as it stands today is a prime candidate for a venture that you might wanna try to expand your career and profit choices. Do yourself a favor.",

Nothing wrong thinking that cars and clothes are important. They can be part of an income generating business for which you use the car for transport and clothes are authentic and can resell.It's all about what we do and sometimes, on a rare occasion if you want to spend on something unusual you can do that if you've got spare money.

What is \"your dream\"?  bigger home, a bigger car, private schools, branded drink, gold?...Most of our modern culture revolves around derivatives of consumerism. We're encouraged to have a credit card at a young age and spend ourselves into as massive a pile of debt as possible. Our role as consumers is emphasized over all other aspects of the economy. This current arrangement relies heavily upon globalism and global markets. Our system of consumerism could be trending towards lower sustainability due to rising fossil fuel costs making it more difficult to outsource manufacturing and production to regions with low cost labor.As a result of current day market trends, I think my attitude towards money should naturally be to reduce my role as a consumer and become more involved on the production side of things. Anything to do with boosting local manufacturing and production is where I want to be. Whether this ends up being profitable over the long term isn't particularly relevant. As it may be necessary to survival. I'm not certain exactly where others stand on this topic, as most are not being as forthcoming with their opinions as they used to be.But if I had to pick something to invest in over the long it would probably be local production and manufacturing sectors which could see a healthy boost if globalism falters as some are predicting.If we live to see a steep decline of consumerism coupled with a rise of producerism it may be nice to be on the uptick side.",
