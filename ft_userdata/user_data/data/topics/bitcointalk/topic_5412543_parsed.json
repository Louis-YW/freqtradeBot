The order is defined for the group, which is the number of elements in that group.QuoteWhy then use secp256k1 order of a point P always = infinity, but on curves with b = 2,3,4,5,6 not = infinity ?  Order of the curve is equal to N not infinity. We are working over a finite field after all.You thant say ehat  print('order of P = {0}'.format(P.order())) is not order of a point ?thrn multiple VERY BIG x to G : P = x*G we get publick key with  BiG privkey. And after multiply this Big pubkey too enothrer BIG b = Q, afer publikey Q multiply to text2hex we RESULT  = ONLY 1036. How to implement this to curve b=7 secp256k1 ? Ofcause with order N - 1ps order of a point = infinity then N / scalar of pubkey = infinity",

I thant convert point from order 2^255 bit, to order 3652 bit., and after bruteforce point for find privkey.I wal already modify order of curve in enother scrypt , then multiply point to -1 and result was not more then new N(order of curve). But, then I multiply point of privkey > new order of curve point go to unknown region(not simple 0 and not simple \"not more then order of curve \")",
