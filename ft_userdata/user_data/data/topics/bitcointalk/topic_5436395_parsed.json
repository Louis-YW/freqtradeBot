  "content": "hello everyone, I recently met an AI dev and through talking we realized we could make a BTC price prediction AI togetherI understand crypto and what interplays with it and she can write mean AIs, a perfect combo ðŸ‘ŒWhat we lack is data. I found some sites that sell BTC price change datasets but they are obscenely expensive. They are sure affordable for big trading companies but not for me and the AI dev.Does anybody know of alternatives or open source datasets?https://data.world/datasets/bitcoin offers some limited datasets of hourly and daily price changes, we need as much \"resolution\" as possible(minute changes or even more precise)... the dev can write the perfect AI but if its trained on dataset with poor resolution(incomplete) it might not work...Would appreciate any help...Thanks!",

The halving is in just over one year so Iâ€™m quite confident youâ€™re wrong on that. Only time will tell but I think we 100% see above $100,000 before 2026. We usually see a meteoric rise after each block reward halving. History doesnâ€™t repeat but it often rhymes.",
