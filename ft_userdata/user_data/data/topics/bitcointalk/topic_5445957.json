  "content": "Aliexpress have been my favorite for a long time now, but this was while Credit/Debit card payments worked in my country, right now, the Central bank of Nigeria have ordered all the banks in the country to terminate and block all Nigerian issued Credit/Debit cards from processing international/Dollar transactions, this simply means Nigerians can no longer carry out dollar transactions with their Naira Credit/Debit cards.Few days ago, I found something I loved on Aliexpress and wanted it badly, I contacted the seller to see if he could take payment in bitcoin, but unfortunately, he said No, I also tried a couple of other sellers who also don't seem to accept bitcoin payments./Right now, I am looking for another trusted online shopping site where bitcoin is accepted as a means of payments, and the site should be like Aliexpress that sometimes, offer free shipping to Nigeria for some of its products, I would very much appreciate any suggestions, suggestions must be sites that have been tried and trusted , I would have searched google for suggestions but I trust this forum far more than I trust google, and this is why I brought this here.",

I stopped using it after I've found AliExpress but you may want to take a look there since it ships to a lot of places (maybe everywhere, I don't know) and accepts many payment methods.I don't see Bitcoin on the list, but - depending on the country of the user - the list can be pretty big and maybe you can use bitcoin together with one of those payment methods....(For clothes there's also Shein, but it seems to have far too few payment methods; plus my wife has shopped from there only once, which is not enough for a proper review).",

There used to be some free script that I use to sell just a few items, its sort of a static page for a shop but I forgot its name. Unless you want sellers to register in your store, then that will only make it complicated.",

They offer a convenient way to use cryptocurrency for everyday purchases, and many of them also come with additional features such as rewards programs and cashback incentives. Some of the most popular options include the Binance Card, Coinbase Card, BitPay Card, Crypto.com Card...",

I would've suggested buying from eBay but apparently, their cards are region locked and require you to link a U.S PayPal account[2] as well. @OP I would recommend doing the following:- Maybe you can try to use Shopping.io (they support AliExpress). Make sure to do your own research first.- AliExpress has been accepting WebMoney for a long time, until recently. Try to reach out to sellers and see if they still accept it and then exchange your BTC for it if they do[3][1] https://twitter.com/paywithmoon/status/1624548553598111746[2] https://www.bitrefill.com/buy/ebay-usa/?hl=en[3] https://www.bestchange.com/bitcoin-to-wmz.html",

      "body": "I think, it's definitely frustrating when payment options are limited due to country regulations. I thinks it's great that you're looking for alternative shopping sites that accept bitcoin as payment. One site that I would recommend checking out is Overstock.com. They have a wide variety of products and accept bitcoin as payment. So, it might be worth checking out if they offer free shipping to Nigeria. Another option could be Purse.io, which allows you to use bitcoin to purchase products on Amazon. However, I'm not sure if they offer shipping to Nigeria.",
