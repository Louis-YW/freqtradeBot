Bestchange's stance is clear regarding AML/KYC disputes between exchangers and customers: if AMLBot (the service they are affiliated with) shows a high risk score, then Bestchange calls customer a criminal/terrorist and quits mediation. There are hundreds of such cases at feedback pages of their listed exchangers marked as \"KYC/AML dispute\" on their .ru domain and outcome is always same - customers lose funds.There is also a reason why Bestchange is listed as a 'taint proclaiming' service in the thread [Blacklist] of unreliable, 'taint proclaiming' Bitcoin services / exchanges",

This is the first time I know this information. I found myself sent them merits before, but I do not remember such a discussion. In general, it is wrong to distinguish between Bitcoin on the basis of its clean coins and dirty one.ChangeNow is not a service that I would recommend to someone and expect a perfect experience free of complaints or being scammed, so it is better to stop using or recommending it. I will try to contact @bestchange to see their opinion.",

That kind of habit will definitely save OP from potential headaches, hopefully others would take note and never do what OP did so the cycle at the least isn't vicious if won't be stopping anytime soon.",
