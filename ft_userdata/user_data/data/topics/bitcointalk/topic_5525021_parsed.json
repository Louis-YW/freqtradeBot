But let's say a fact that if Bloomberg can change themselves and turn from anti-Bitcoin to pro-Bitcoin or just neutral, it's good for Bitcoin.I don't need to know actual motivational reasons behind this narrative change of Bloomberg but on top of that, I am sure that Bitcoin will get some benefit from this, and it's enough.Bloomberg can not stay outside the common trend.Bitcoin is not dead but it was called as dead 450+ times. The trend of \"Bitcoin is dead\" is downward.",

It's not an either/or situation; both can potentially exist as valuable assets .  The media's focus on gold often reflects a misunderstanding or a deliberate downplaying of Bitcoin's unique properties.",

The irony of this matter is that these media have had to eat their words over the years, as well as many large companies and managers who said that Bitcoin was a bubble, and years later said the opposite while they filled their wallets. That's the old tactic of creating FUD so that people panic and sell their coins so they can buy them cheaper and be able to continue accumulating. That is why I have always thought that the articles that appear in the media should be read between the lines and ignore what they say as a general rule.",

Where is this guy who wrote this opinion piece? Does he still think that Bitcoin is a High-Tech Dinosaur soon to be extinct in 2025?If he were to write about bitcoin again would he still maintain his stance?Since he wrote that opinion piece about Bitcoin, I have concluded that he's on the same side with Peter Schiff which is the wrong side. A High-Tech Dinosaur soon to be extinct will now about to be adopted as a strategic national reserve.",

Do they maybe try to sell you something? Yes, of course, because their average reader is someone who doesn't know how to actually do a proper research.It would be interesting to know what the writer, Stephen Mihm, thinks now since he had the opportunity to buy bitcoin for a few bucks but instead he decided to talk shit about it. He literally saw the biggest train of his life stopping before him and he decided to talk a walk instead of jumping in.",

So it's not like  that institutional investors re-discovered Bitcoin's potential, some of them are ahead of the game. It's that when Michael Saylor becoming the preacher of Bitcoin and his company the Bitcoin proxy, suddenly it become the most sought after assets from whales to institutions and now from government itself.I wonder though what happen to the author, still perma bear after all the years?Or he jump on the boat later on like 2017 and later? Is he still working with Bloomberg?",

They had the same or even more sophisticated and experimental tech than bitcoin. But just because no one uses them these days, they're worthless. BTC is the most popular cryptocurrency. Success isn't guaranteed and foreverness is nothing but a concept. BTC will remain standing so long as we support it and use it. It's decentralized so the support is vital. You can be a miner, you can be a node runner, you can utilize the lighting network but most importantly,  and at least in theory, anyone can develop BTC.And to this day, hundreds of people go through the painstaking process of developing Bitcoin Core. While some might consider Bitcoin not so technologically advanced, it remains one of the cryptos with the most activity in its development process. But there were points that things looked pretty grim. I won't blame anyone for not believing in Bitcoin. There were times that many of us were too occupied with infighting also.",

Bitcoin was effectively banned in China, after several months of China fueling its growth. Everyone was calling it a bubble as prices crashed. Bitcoin's legality was a grey area in pretty much every jurisdiction and governments were not willing to soften their stance on it.If Bitcoin were to have continued down that path, I doubt Bitcoin would be as big as it is today. Unfortunately, that's the general sentiments of the population back then and they're really not to blame.",
