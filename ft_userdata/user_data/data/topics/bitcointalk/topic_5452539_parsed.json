  "content": "Setting out to a destination doesn't mean that we must surely get there as planned or on scheduled, note we might encounter and obstruction, there might also be a temporal setback on the way which may either delay us for some hours or even make us to go back to where we are coming from in other to continue the journey another day or still placing the movement on hold for some months to allow the situation that led to the cancellation of the journey to be put in control before re-embarking on the journey again as the case may be, but we can figure out a means that will help us to reach where we are going or replan on how to get there later without giving up on this mission and this is achievable by putting up a good strategic plan to complete the unfinished journey or mission despite what comes our way again. Relating this to our natural life, for us to make our destiny a fulfilment we may encounter obstacles which might even discourage us but it take endurance, extra focus, energy, and the happiness that comes with knowing where you are heading to, the purpose of what you are doing, and what to benefit on reaching their. In summary we have to work hard to make our destiny a reality no matter the obstacles we encounter on the way of making it happen, it is better to try than not trying because no risk most times leads to regret.What's your take?",

Planned them, but the most. The important thing Is That,  regardless of the part and process, it is good enough to arrive at Our expected result in the long run. So trust the process and do your part, the outcome won't be different from what you expect, but then the process may change but not the result",

      "body": "I see it this way: In life there are two kind of things. Stuff we can't control and those we can control. We cannot control or choose our family, we are supposed to embrace them and learn how to live together.However, the things we can control are those we are supposed to take advantage of as much as possible to get to be happy. I have seen stories on internet of people who are born with serious conditions and deformities and yet, they took what they can control and decide to be happy with it. At least, that is the way I see it. Destiny is real or not depending whom you ask, some misuse the concept of destiny to project their entitled way of thinking, tho",

It made more sense in a Newtonian conception of the world where a Creator made the rules of the world and when he set it to work, he did it precisely like a Newtonian clock without leaving degrees of freedom in the system. Whoever knew the causes could calculate the effects.",

If you're destined to be rich someday then do you think that you'll be one if you don't do anything like working hard, investing or even betting on the lottery?So, if it means that if there's a fixed destiny I'd say there is. But, we have also control over that destiny so it's flexible based on how we do things in our current lives.",

However, there are also those who believe in alternate realities where everything that can happen does happen. Recently I spoke with someone about this subject who was talking about choosing your own reality. He thought your decisions don’t make your destiny, but rather transfer you into the universe of your outcome. It was an interesting conversation.",

The fact that we can’t tell the future of what we’re going to become or what we’ll achieve in this life is what makes it fascinating and a world full of hardworking people trying to make ends meet.

Your plan today might be useless tomorrow because of changes in political, social, or economic policies. Death is the only path to an easy or trouble free life because as much as we are alive there will always be problems that need solutions. As humans, we have the responsibility of planning our lives but we should also be aware that we don't have control over the outcome of these plans because there are some uncontrollable forces.

They believe that God has planned everybody's life and regardless of our efforts, we must end up the way the creator has destined it. It is believed that no matter how someone tries he will never be rich because God has destined him to be poor. Sometimes this belief makes a lot of meaning because some people luckily become rich become without effort or hard work. While some diligent people are still poor regardless of their effort. But this belief breeds laziness and carefree life. We need to strive to achieve our plans but I know there is also a God that influences the outcome of our labours.",

On your way to the top, it is expected that you will encounter obstacles that will be able to shake you off in your quest to the top. If not well prepared for the journey, you might fall at the way side, without getting at your destiny destination. That's why every human being ought to have a not giving up spirit for what obstacles he faces because obstacles doesn't last forever, it's only there to build and test your life endurance. As they say, destiny can only be delay but can't be denied. What will be, will be. Someone having an accomplish destiny doesn't come so easily.

However, it is crucial not to lose sight of our mission and keep a positive mindset.It's important to acknowledge that reaching our desired destination may not always happen according to our initial schedule or as smoothly as we hope. We might face temporary setbacks that require us to adjust our plans, take detours, or even pause temporarily. Nevertheless, this doesn't mean we should give up on our goals and dreams.Instead, it's vital to embrace resilience, endurance, and an unwavering focus on the purpose and benefits of reaching our destination. We must be willing to adapt, replan, and develop strategic approaches to overcome the obstacles in our path.

All we are clamoring for is to be wealthy in life or to make a big name, where and how does this big names comes they all belongs to wealthiness because I strongly believe that greatness are often derived from richness. They journey of live sometimes could likely be classified as a \"commensalism\"(also known as the survival of the fittest).",
