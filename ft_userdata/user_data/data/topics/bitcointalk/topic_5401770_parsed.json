  "content": "Why are people get scammed? Because scam looks real and used to victimize the ignorant and the foolish. But the best way to avoid scam, phishing and online attack is to know about it, how it works and not to be greedy. People should always know this, that no money is just coming from nowhere freely, no free money. Scammers use high yield return and free money to scam people.I received an email from Google Form that directed me to a site Crypto Donate, I screenshot part of the email below, I did not do anything or fill out anything, but this is just the email.Below, which I did not screenshot (but I can do that if there is any need to) is a link, I removed my email from the link and I got this:https://donate.starcryptocoin[dot]tk/According to the fake site:QuoteGet Bitcoin help from all over the world!Instant payments to your Bitcoin wallet.More than 1,000,000 people who have applied to the project have already received Bitcoin assistance.All transactions for the provision of Bitcoin assistance are made by the participants voluntarily, directly between each other.The first three scammers review:Quoteb]Teresa[/b]It was hard to believe. And why? There are a lot of scams on the Internet, here and there everywhere they promise \"mountains of gold\" and in the end nothing. I sat here and read the comments and thought to myself, well, people write that they get money, why am I sitting there thinking ?! registered and made the right decision !!! today I have already received my first payment of 0.058 BTC, many thanks, I will continue to participate in this project, because this is a good deed for everyone.CalebPainfully tired of cheating on the Internet. I feed the scammers every day. More precisely, fed! Yes, this project Donated me. I have already written a thank you to the support service. Thank you again from the bottom of my heart in the comments.EsterMy pension does not allow me to be posh and live very well! But thanks to this project and kind people, I went on a cruise with my daughter and grandson. Thank you all very much!There are still thousands of reviews on that site, be careful. Do not send bitcoin, else, you are scammed. I am concious to avoid any scam, I did not wanted to do it actually because I know nothing will come out of it than scam, but I need more evidence to know if this scam site only wants people's name, picture amd email address. I used fake name, fake email on the site. I provided a bitcoin address but newly generated from a wallet, I submitted it on the site, the site linked the address to some fake donators, I clicked on accept payment as it was bringing up the fake donators until I complete it. Then it brought up the picture below. https://donate.starcryptocoin.tk/cab56kapl.phpThis is just a scam site, donate and be scammed because of greediness. I know I am not only the one that has been sent this scam email, please, tell all your family and friends and let this go beyond Bitcointalk.",

      "body": "These scammers know that there are many greedy people out there that they can easily victimize with their schemes. If you're someone that knows the specific thing on the web and you didn't do anything, this is just the same as those old scam schemes that someone from any state in the US/EU/UK that has passed away and wants you to inherent millions of bucks from thin air. That trick never gets old and I'm still receiving them with my old email almost every day. That's why if an unknown email comes and after clicking it says gullible promos, wins, money, etc. I don't waste my time checking in all that it says and avoiding any link that it attaches.",

Obviously no because you do less and will be promised high return, these guys out there are getting smarter each day and we need to as well get wiser to secure ourselves against any vulnerable point for an entry.",

Because if not, it is highly unlikely that you have signed up on a website that has been sold or hacked which might be somewhat alarming, to be honest..Nevertheless, looking at the screenshot, its funny seeing such huge amount of btc balance is for free given how hard it is for an average joe to earn it.

So who will be fooled into becoming greedy and believing that such things happen in real life? Some of us got as many as 20 BTC some time ago, we just had to believe that Santa Claus was a little late this year due to the pandemic Quote from: Charles-Tim on June 08, 2022, 08:24:22 AMThis is just a scam site, donate and be scammed because of greediness.

In my case, 99% of such messages end up in the spam folder anyway, and if one does appear in the inbox, the best we can do is mark it as spam and prevent others from seeing it at all.",

Fake vouches can be bought nor the owner itself doing it just to fool newbies who's seeking money for what they are trying to offer.
