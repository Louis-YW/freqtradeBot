  "content": "Mobile Devices with Malware Pre-infection AttackIt is very important for us to know the brand of mobile phone and devices we are buying and also the supplier through whose means we are getting them from, hackers now infects malicious attacks inbuilt on this devices right after they are being manufactured before they handover to other channels for sales and delivery to final users, this malicious firmware attack is most common with android phones devices as found being distributed across the world. We no longer trust the firmware suppliers of Cheapo Mobile Devices as they can introduce a programmed set of malicious attack on the devices before they were being distributed to the supplier across the globe, all this begins when there was an internal crisis within the mobile phone firmwares and some have deemed it feet to ensure the raise a counter terror attack on each other through the introduction of this malicious firmware attack on mobile device right after they were being produced.QuoteThe malware turns the devices into proxies which are used to steal and sell SMS messages, take over social media and online messaging accounts, and used as monetization opportunities via adverts and click fraud. https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2023/05/11/bh_asia_mobile_phones/Once they got hold of a user through his Android phones device with a particular kind of proxy plugin attack they introduced, they takeover the device IP location and address and extract useful and sensitive informations from the keystrokes, it is very important to note that this kind of attack is more predominant in Asia and some part of Europe and unevenly distributed across the world.",

      "body": "This is a significant matter that firms should address, because I am confident that the hackers are intruders and are related to the companies in some manner, as they cannot obtain the exact number of devices affected by the malware attack.Although Android phones are good at first, I urge that consumers stick with well-known and trusted brands like Samsung since I am confident that their security will be closely maintained and such concerns will be rare.Quote That is to say, you'll find this sort of bad firmware in the cheaper end of the Android ecosystem, and sticking to bigger brands is a good idea though not necessarily a guarantee of safety.To avoid such attacks, we must exercise extreme caution, avoid using cheap mobile Android devices, and purchase our devices from a reputable provider.",

Buy devices of this types that are many raises your chances of having such malware issues.",

      "body": "If this is true, then we are not very safe again with our privacy and security because this malware can be used to compromise every sensitive piece of information on our phones, including our bank accounts through bank apps. But I believe this malware attack can only be rampant on the new Android mobile devices that have been recently developed. For some old, existing Android technology companies that have been trusted, I believe they would not want their business to be interfered with, which can put them in a situation where individuals who are using their products will totally abandon them for another product that will become a trend then. All these technology companies always stay updated on new technologies, and they also love to improve their technology, so if this attack is real, they will need to be running their Android mobile before pushing it out to the market. I know that all these technology companies are always in competition among themselves, so if any of those companies mistakenly allow any mistake in their products, they will suffer a loss, and their competitors will use it as an opportunity to excel. Since they don't want that, they will make sure to give their customers satisfaction. Is just my thoughts.",

      "body": "Well it feels that every day I get a text message that is a spam text message. It is sometimes from a person and it is sometimes from a big company like Amazon or a clothing store. It is a text message saying I have won a contest or a text message trying to give me something for free.I have felt tempted to click the links but I will never do this. I did always think to myself that we can not get a virus on mobile devices. My friend says he got a virus on his tablet from some link he clicked. This scares me because I did not think it was possible.",
