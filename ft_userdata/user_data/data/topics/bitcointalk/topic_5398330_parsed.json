QuoteHi everyone, As mentioned earlier, the team is hard at work in a war room for the last 4 days. Our number one priority is to put together a plan and communicate this to you. Given this unprecedented time, there is a huge volume of messages that we have to go through. We will consolidate information and put out announcements to assist our users on Discord and Telegram.",

What !?!     Just checked on Binance and the price right now is about 0.006usdt something, this is so sad. I have witnessed the rise of luna and the hardships it overcame over the years and I honestly liked its concept which is why I thought it would only go up as time goes by. What a waste, sigh. Although I sold my Luna holdings last year, I was still hoping to see better buying conditions but now, I am hesitant to buy back since I have lost trust on it and I think a lot of people also did which is why the price just continued to drop. I really do not know whether they can still be able to recover from this or not. Really, what a waste.. sigh.",

People are leaving this as they know this was a garbage token that will worth zero. it's better for them all to save their money rather than try to put more money into this scam token. Luna is a scam token now. I think that you must forget this. this worth nothing right now. Another meme token.",

Check the exchanges it is listed on and see what goes on there. Luna is not dead. The price is picking up and it is around two cents after falling to $0.008 today. It can still rise like what happened to Ripple with SEC in 2020. Am buying more Luna and holding.",

Even yesterday and the day before i was always thinking about investing a few bucks into Terra when it was around 2 USD or so and i was already regretting it when i did not buy them when it went up to around 6 dollars yesterday but now i am pretty happy that i did not buy any Terra. I am not really sure at the moment if Terra will have a future and if they can recover from that huge losses that happened the last few days and are still happening at the moment. The sad thing is that Terra is bringing down pretty much the whole crypto market with them after all Terra was a top 10 project.",

The value of UST has decreased because many have withdrawn funds from the anchor protocol in the Tera ecosystem. in this case, of course it is sustainable because UST and Luna are tied so that many burn UST to get $1 in luna and can be converted into USDT or USDC",

According to OutlookIndia (https://www.outlookindia.com/business/how-crypto-whales-wiped-off-terra-luna-on-binance-other-platforms-read-here-to-know-more-news-196106), this was caused by big investors, otherwise known as whales. During the midnight of May 7 and the early morning of May 8, big investors,  who are also called crypto whales, began to sell approximately 285 million UST simultaneously on Curve, Binance, Anchor and other platforms. They also started to short Luna crypto currency at the same time. Since UST and Luna are tied together by an algorithm program the massive selling and shorting caused the balance to be put off. The day ended with UST losing its 1:1 ratio to trade at $0.98 that day, and Luna was down by 6 per cent at $76.51. Today, the value of 1UST at CMC is $0.3871.Where lies the trust in the crypto space? Investors waking up to see even their \"STABLE COINS\" seriously devalued. This is lesson learned and I hope other stable coins and future ones will have a more robust approach to prevent this ugly situation repeating.",
