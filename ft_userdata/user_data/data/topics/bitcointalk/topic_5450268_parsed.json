Osmosis is an inter-blockchain decentralized exchange (DEX) built using CosmosSDK. Osmosis allows cross-chain trades and offers asset pool customization.

On the other hand, the goal of Tezos is to provide a self-amending blockchain that can evolve over time without requiring hard forks. In summary, while Osmosis aims to provide a DEX platform within the Cosmos ecosystem, Tezos aims to be a more sustainable and democratic blockchain that can evolve over time without requiring hard forks.",

But in terms of multiplier gains osmosis will be a greater choice but with risk. Its a dex on cosmos and one of the best dex out there being used on a non decentralized space. But if youll gonna ask me then I'll spare funds for both of them cause they arent rivals or what in terms of services and product.",

I'd take 5.87% of stake for Tezos and that's realistic to me and I've got no problem if it suddenly drops some more.

Osmosis apr has already dropped down a lot, in start when it was airdropped it had it in thousand. But it's not based on people that stake but thing called 'thirdening' which reduces supply by 1/3 every year until issuance reaches 1B max supply. You can read about it here.",

It will be so good to have more but the risk is quite high due to the volatility from the price of coin.",
