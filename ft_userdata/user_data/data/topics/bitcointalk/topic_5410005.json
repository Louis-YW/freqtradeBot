  "content": "I am convinced that I have discovered a way for people who sent bitcoins to nonexistent addresses to have those bitcoins returned to them. Back in 1999 I acquired an old Volvo from a family member. The family member had lost the signed title to the vehicle and was unable to locate the person who they purchased the vehicle from. I learned that I could get a title for the vehicle in my name by purchasing a surety bond. I wrote a paper declaring that I was the possesser and rightful owner which I signed and had notorized at a currency exchange. I took that to the insurance company and paid them $500.00. They provided me with documentation that said they would be liable for any future claims made by another person who could prove to be the rightful owner of the vehicle. In any event the car from then on was legally mine as the state of Illinois verified by issuing me a title to the vehicle. I am convinced that the same can be done in the case of lost bitcoins. Chain analysis can search for the address (the person claiming lost bitcoins has to provide the address) and the errant transfer. An insurer (an insurance company may have to be created for this purpose) can, for a fee, insure the claimant in the event that someone else claims to be the rightful owner of those bitcoins. Once all this is done the bitcoin developers can credit the possesser of the public address with a new private address issued in a hash that says they possess the amount of bitcoins that was lost. This can work and should be implemented asap. $Rasul11@cashapp",

      "body": "You can't compare Bitcoin to a centralized system just like that.Firstly, existing UTXOs aren't \"credits\", those are locked through scripts that can only be unlocked using the owner's private key.Secondly, the developers don't have access to the users' private keys or full control of the blockchain, they can't just decide to spend or move a coin if they want to.And lastly, The coins which are in the 'blocks' which form the 'blockchain' isn't stored in a single server that can be manipulated by a single entity.The blockchain is stored in every 'full node', those are the users of the reference client 'Bitcoin Core' or other alternative implementations of Bitcoin that follow the network's protocol.So anyone (even the developers) can make that \"insurance company\" but they can't just issue the coins to the claimers,they still need the private key or change the network's protocol which requires the agreement of the whole Bitcoin network (the users).Quote from: 1polymath on August 15, 2022, 11:53:08 PMOnce all this is done the bitcoin developers can credit the possesser of the public address with a new private address issued in a hash that says they possess the amount of bitcoins that was lost.

Yes, some chains are relatively easier to target for 51% attack but it doesn't mean they provide intentional mechanism for devs to transfer user's funds without authentication. In fact, if we go more technical, almost every blockchain uses the same way of encrypting users' funds like Bitcoin does (ignoring State vs UTXO difference) through SLIP-44 which is based on BIP-44. You will find over 1000 blockchains having the derivation paths based on SLIP-44 in the link I mentioned.There are some crap custodial-based tokens which are being built on the top of other blockchains and could be locked by the issuer and all but let's not confused those tokens with the blockchain protocol. They are just an implementation over the blockchain via smart contracts and smart contracts can have custom rules but it doesn't mean the whole chain is equally vulnerable.After reading the OP, I am thinking that the simplification of Bitcoin's working into address and balance is doing more harm than good. People are completely misunderstanding the way Bitcoin works. Maybe, it's a high time that we should drop the use of the terms like 'sending funds to the address' and start using something like 'locking value in the script'.",

I do feel as though I'm just as eager as anyone alive to see bitcoin change the world of finance. I've been reading books on the topic such as the one I'm currently reading (The Age of Cryptocurrency) and taking in as much information as I possibly can. I expressed a thought and wanted to hear some intelligent feed back. Didn't expect to hear from trolls but I guess I expected too much. The responses I received (some of them) cause me to believe that the responders don't understand the btc blockchain as much as they think they do and or they didn't understand what I suggested. In any event I definitely want to give anyone who I may be of assistance to the opportunity to show gratitude. I live to help others. I am a giver and I just want to help others if I can.

It's not fiat like PayPal you can dispute, then it won't call decentralized ever.A level headed thinker, great. Thanks for your patience. Believe it or not I actually do have some understanding of how btc and the blockchain work which is how that idea can to my mind. Unfortunately I haven't had the luxury as of yet to speak with people who are well versed on the matter. I was not suggesting that a transaction be reversed. I didn't suggest that someone should dispute a transaction. I wonder if anybody who read the post actually gave it any real thought because if they did it seems as though their responses would have been different, clearer as to why what I suggested is so far from being reasonable. Again, I want to thank you for being rational with your response. And I do hope to hear from someone who understands what I purposed and who can be clear as to why it can't be done.

Thank you for your response. Thank you for being kind. It is possible that I was not able to clearly convey the idea that I shared. They way I understand it is that when information (any worded message) is made into a hash (a string of numbers and letters) that information can be included in a block. The message can be what I suggested in my post. Nothing would be reversed, nothing would be altered. The message would simply allow what was dormant to become active again. This may not be what developers decide to do but it would be good for the life of btc and the blockchain.Quote from: NeuroticFish on August 16, 2022, 02:22:47 PMQuote from: 1polymath on August 15, 2022, 11:53:08 PMOnce all this is done the bitcoin developers can credit the possesser of the public address with a new private address issued in a hash that says they possess the amount of bitcoins that was lost.
