  "content": "I’m giving away 30 physical cryptocurrency coins to promote the opening of my new crypto coin shop. I am giving away the following coins, strictly one per postal address, entry is free and unlimited.    - 1 x Silver Casascius 2012 1oz round, 1BTC (redeemed)    - 1 x Lealana Series 1, funded with 1 LTC    - 1 x Lealana Series 2, funded with 1 LTC, (can’t remember if it is buyer funded or not)    - 1 x Casascius 5 BTC series 1 sticker (redeemed)    - 1 x Casascius 5 BTC series 1 sticker (redeemed)    - 1 x Casascius 1 BTC 2012 with Series 2 back (redeemed)    - 3 x Casascius 1 BTC 2013 with Series 2 back (redeemed)    - 1 x Casascius 0.5 BTC with Series 2 Back (redeemed)    - 10 x Nastyfans 1g silver round, Nasty Fans (no funds present)    - 10 x Nastyfans 1g silver round, Nasty Pool (no funds present)About the competitionWhen Satoshi Nakamoto first launched Bitcoin, the very first source code files he shared contained code for a decentralised marketplace.“I started implementing a marketplace feature earlier that facilitates offering things for sale and taking orders, it's only half done though.  A bit like e-bay but without auctions, just \"buy now\".  Among other things, it would make it easy for anyone to offer currency exchange.”    - Satoshi Nakamoto in an email to Mike Hearn Apr 14th 2009#include \"market.h\"    - Satoshi Nakamoto, 2009 Bitcoin source code heders.h line 69 Some developers have now completed a version of a decentralised, marketplace on a fork of bitcoin, it has the following features:    - Decentralised - It runs directly on block chain smart contracts    - Unstoppable - it cannot be taken down like dark-net marketplaces    - Trustless - MAD escrow makes buyer or seller scamming impossible     - Anonymous - It has greater privacy protection than MoneroThe same developers have also implemented an atomic swap decentralised exchange that allows users to transact directly between chains. It has the following features:    - Cross block chain - a trade is between chains, no wrapped coins or tokens, traded coins go directly to native wallets    - Trustless order book - the order book shows a list of offers, this cannot be taken down or spoofed    - Atomic - a trade either completes, or users get their funds back, there is no other outcome    - User Interface - the client contains multiple wallets and all the tools you need to trade in one GUI, nothing complex, just easy instant trading    - Decentralised - no need to trust an exchange will give you back you coins    - Unstoppable - it cannot be taken down as it runs on a block chain    - No fees - there are no fees at all, apart from the fees of sending funds on their respective block chains; a total of two transactions per participant    - Extensible - pretty much any crypto coin can be added to the exchange, trades can happen between any pair when one supports lock_time in its UTXO functionsHow to enterI have listed the competition on the marketplace, you can download the wallet which contains the marketplace and/or view the marketplace and bid via the portal. If you place an offer, you will be entered into the competition. Strictly one entry per postal address. Please add the code “crypto_competition” somewhere in the postal address data so that I can verify you are from this forum and not someone random trying to enter, if you leave this code out your bid will not be counted.The competition listing will be up for one week, at the end of which I will select the winners at random from the valid entrants, and you will be contacted via the marketplace encrypted chat, on or around the 17th Dec. Please make sure you either leave your wallet unlocked or unlock it for a few minutes periodically so that you can decrypt your encrypted messages and check if you have won.Entry is free, but if you are selected to enter, you will need to pay fee of one Particl coin, about $1.20 at the time of writing, to claim your coin. I will refund this to you after you receive the coin, so there is ultimately no cost. There are no other charges.Postage is included and coins will be sent tracked in the normal post.I will also be hanging out in the forum here to provide help if anyone needs it, so feel free to ask me questions.",

If you place an offer, you will be entered into the competition\"I am confused by this...  are these items for sale or are they being auctioned off?Where would I place my offer?And can we use Bitcoin to pay/enter this contest?So to clarify further, the competition is listed on the Particl Marketplace, you will need to either load the wallet or use the portal to access it. You will need to own some Particl coins (PART) to enter. You can get PART from:    - Particl’s decentralised atomics swap DEX, Basic swap. The first beta currently supports the following coins:        o XMR        o BTC        o LTC        o PART        o PIVX        o FRIO        o DASH    - Wizard Swap    - Bittrex    - Probit    - HitBTCIt will cost you nothing to place a bid to enter the competition, if you are selected as a winner you will then need to pay 1 PART, plus escrow of 1 PART and some network fees, usually a few Satoshi, so you’ll need a maximum of about 2.0002 PART to take place, just under $3. You need to do this so I can get your address details etc and send shipping details. I will refund this after you confirm receipt of the coin you have won. So ultimately you will end with the same amount of PART you started with.Quote from: Eclipse33 on December 09, 2022, 06:20:18 PMCan you explain your connection to this project and what your company wishes to achieve. You are giving away a little under $10k in physical crypto (vintage good stuff) from a Newb account. Please enlighten us as to who you are and your company's vision. I’ve been using particl marketplace on and off for a few years now. After getting scammed a lot as a seller on eBay I have decided to try and move my business to particl. I sell coins, bullion and physical crypto, so this is an experiment to see if I can get customers to come on board as the marketplace provides both an anonymous platform for trade, and an environment where scamming is infeasible due to use of MAD escrow. Ideally I’d like to move away from eBay to particl because its way safer for buyers and sellers and crypto can be used natively.Based on recent sale prices I’d say the value of stuff I am giving away in this completion is closer to $1-2k, but happy to be wrong, a lot of this stuff sells slowly so it’s hard to gauge the price. I’m deliberately choosing to give away physical crypto coins because I think targeting this community first could be the most fruitful. People in bullion still don’t get crypto a decade later.What particl is trying to create is an ecosystem where most crypto can be freely traded and eventually almost any crypto can be spent natively on the marketplace. Currently we have centralised exchanges and dark-net markets, both of which require trust and are therefore fundamentally broken. Particl makes both of these turstless. The exchange provides atomic swaps with a trustless unstoppable order book. The marketplace provides anonymous scam-free access to goods, fiat and bullion. Banknotes and direct bank transfers can be done via the marketplace using MAD escrow. So this is why I want to move my business there.",

However the portal will also ask you to send funds so that it can place a bid on the network. If you didn't get either of those steps then I'm guessing it wont have sent the message.I'd suggest using the actual marketplace in particl desktop if you are having issues.Note using the portal adds the requirement of trust to the process as you are basically sending funds to a website's wallet. Using the marketplace in particl desktop is trustless.",

I would also advise sending some public funds to that wallet too just in case as I think these may be needed for validator fees.Hope that all makes sense.",

Clicked on all your links and have been  going round in circles/ dead ends- gave up after 20 mins. Absolutely. It seems the listing has disappeared from the portal, not sure why..?Any way here is a step by step guide:1. Download Particl Desktopparticl.io2. Get some coins    - Particl's atomic DEX (Basic Swap), this is built on Particl's encrypted decentralised messaging system, so its arguably way safer than a centralised exchange. You can trade Monero, BTC. LTC, Dash, FRIO and a few others.    - Wizard Swap    - Bittrex    - ProBit    - HitBTC3. Make a bidMake sure Particl Desktop has downloaded the block chain, after that it will sync all the current encrypted messages associate with the block chain, some of these are the marketplace listings. You will see the marketplace listings appear in the marketplace under \"Market>Browse\", so if you don't see it just wait patiently and keep hitting refresh.You will also need to move some funds to your anon balance as this uses ring signatures and blinding to keep the buyer and seller anonymous. Go to \"Wallet>Send/Convert\" to make sure you have funds in both your anon and public balances.You can then place a bid. Click on the listing and selecting \"Add to Cart\". Then under \"Market>Cart\" complete the checkout process, don't forget to add the password “crypto_competition” in your address somewhere so I know you are from this forum.Once that's done I will accept you bid. I will message you on the marketplace's encrypted chat to confirm.Hope this helps, let me know how you get on and if you get stuck.",

Right now you can do this manually via Particl's DEX.They had this working a year back with a CEX plugin, but the CEX changed its API so support that was dropped, but it was a good proof of principle before migrating to the more reliable Particl DEX.",
