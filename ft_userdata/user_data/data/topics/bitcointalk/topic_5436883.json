That would be a drag&drop backtesting strategy builder where users could test their ideas.It's not meant to be super sophisticated tool for PRO traders etc, but rather a low entry, fast validation/estimation or a gateway to more spohisticated approach.My idea is to aim for crypto markets as these tend to attract more beginners than legacy markets, but at this point it's just the underlaying data really.My question to you is what do you guys think? Does this sound remotely interesting? The tool would be free so there would be no cost in using it.",

Does this sound remotely interesting? The tool would be free so there would be no cost in using it.Not a bad idea but there is a lot of backtesting software out there already, and while most of it is geared towards the stock markets the truth is the same principles and strategies which work on the stock market will work here as well with just some adjustments.The advantage is you want to make this tool for free, but there are also other tools which you can use for free even if it is with some limitations, in light of this I do not know how viable is your proposal and how successful it could be, but if you have the motivation to create this tool then no one can stop you.",

Are you trying to lure something from here?Nice observation  Seems to be like someone toying around with fantasies here in the forum just to see how members react to his threads. I mean, if he was that serious with what he was pursuing or suggesting, he would have already positively responded to the different queries in the thread.Indeed the first topic that I created was just to check if my problem that I am trying to solve is a real problem for other people. Thats why I posted as someone who has no knowledge on coding etc.Initially I had two ideas. One was to live trade some historicall sessions where you could just speed up the time and learn from your mistakes, observe patterns like DCAing on leverge leads to account explosion etc etc.But this niche is quite well covered in the space.So the second option was to create no-code trading backtester. Yet again to show that your trading idea has some potential or not.It's about saving the time, making it easy to onboard etc. As each of the platform introduces somekind of DSL you need to learn or python language. And my imagination was that most of the people will just drop at this point.SO I guess what I am trying to say is that now I am just evaluating the idea and trying to gather the feedback from the potential audience, what is the other ppl take on that.Quote from: BitMaxz on January 27, 2023, 12:09:44 AMAre you planning to produce a drag-and-drop trading backtesting tool?It's exciting but the problem is how secure and safe your software is. Right now, people can't easily trust any software out there due to malware and viruses or software that includes spyware unless you are one of the trusted people here or since it's free if you can put a fully open-source code into Github and let people/developers decide if your backtesting tool is safe.And the good thing is if you put it on Github, maybe some traders out there that know more about strategies can pull requests to share some script/code that you can add/patch to your project.This would be a web based app. I am pretty confident when it comes to solution security etc so I don't expect it to be a problem.When it comes to the app being open-source - that's a nice idea. I have not consider that in the past, but maybe it's something worth doing!Quote from: EarnOnVictor on January 27, 2023, 01:34:59 PMI've never backtested with cryptocurrency before because I developed my trading systems with traditional trading and it works for cryptocurrency as well.

You know that different traders have different trading strategies, right? They could probably be a thousand or tens of thousands.Well my idea was to just expose set of tools/indicators which then the end user could use to create his own strategy. Will it cover all the scenarios? Probably not. But the goal is that people won't need to learn DSL's for every other tool out there in order to test that MACD+moving avergage might not be the market killer .",
