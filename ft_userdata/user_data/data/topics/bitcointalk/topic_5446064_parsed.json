  "content": "I was searching about wash trading and how it could impact the crypto market, those who have no or less idea what is wash trading, it's manual or automatic (high-frequency bot trading) making trades of tokens to increase its trading volume to create big candles (increment in the price of that token).I had a firm belief in BTC that it could not be used in the Pumps and Dumps Scheme because of its scarcity (limited supply, high demand) and decentralization. I posted a topic about Don’t Fall Prey to these Market Sentiments and Save your Bitcoin in which i covered 4 major market sentiments. One of them was the Pumps and Dumps Scheme, but \"this market sentiment has no impact on BTC price\". That's what i learned in that topic by reading members' replies. So i can conclude, most of us think of BTC as P&D-free. But i think that's not true when i read a report more-than-half-of-all-bitcoin-trades-are-fake  by Forbes. They manually calculated the trading volume of BTC and compared it with BTC's trading volume of CMC, Coingecko, and other exchanges. These are some key points to their results of the reportQuote1. Forbes estimates the global daily bitcoin volume for the industry was $128 billion on June 14. That is 51% less than the $262 billion one would get by taking the sum of self-reported volume from multiple sources.2. In terms of how much bitcoin activity takes place at these firms, 21 crypto exchanges generate $1 billion or more in daily trading activity, while the next 33 exchanges had volume between $200 million and $999 million across all contract types, spot, futures and perpetuals. 3. Altogether, the lesser regulated exchanges in our study account for approximately $89 billion of the true volume (they claim $217 billion).4. In the Western world and particularly in the U.S., it is tempting to think of bitcoin only trading against either the U.S. dollar or the euro and British pound. But some of the largest trading pair activity occurs against fiat currencies like the Japanese yen and Korean won and against major stablecoins like Binance U.S. dollar and the USD coin.SourceNow i am wondering is it true? like really BTC is involved in P&D schemes because Wash trading is another term for P&D schemes and both have the same purpose to manipulate the BTC trading volume to control its price for their own benefit.",

There are many reports, researches and articles about wash trading volume in cryptocurrency market. It is more seriously with modern trading which is supported by trading bots.

This is market manipulation No regulation in the world is effective enough to fully shut down market manipulation. And to be honest, the term \"manipulation\" is almost a philosophical one and becomes even more complicated when we talk about assets that are traded globally. There are external events like the pandemic or the war which have massive influence on the market and surely a couple of people knew better and earlier than others for whatever reason, and probably a lot of people benefitted from the crash during the Covid lockdowns or from investing in the defense industry when it became more and more clear what's going to happen. Assuming you are running a business that is benefitting from a crisis and you start lobbying for something like a vaccine, you use your financial and political power to convince a government to introduce an obligatory vaccination, is that market manipulation? Or Novogratz who follows a certain pattern when and how he starts to tweet either good or bad about the crypto space. Is it manipulation regardless of his intention or does his intention actually make something manipulation? What if he makes the price move up even though he didn't want to? Or if the price doesn't move at all but he thought he could make it crash? Is Elon Musk not allowed to say anything ever again? Does the follower size decide whether it was manipulation? Which follower count then? Or which price movement in relative terms? There are many many things that make it hard to come to a crystal clear judgment whether there was manipulation or not. And sometimes someone manipulates a market in a jurisdiction where authorities are ok with it, but no other outside authorities can enforce any laws.",

Wash trading only focus on increasing exchange volume through a series of fake by and sell using market maker bot but it doesn’t pump the market at all because it just keep buying and selling as the market moves. Still those buy and sell from legit traders are the one dictates the price pump and dump and not the wash trasing from exchange to increase volume.Wash trading is true but pump and dump scheme is not from wash trading because exchange don’t need to pump the market just to fake their volume. They can do it by just quick buying and selling with low price spread.",

Social engineering (news/FUD) together with sudden movements in order to trigger small trader safety nets (stop loss and maybe others too), maybe together with some wash trading (most pretending it never happens) can be seen as the modern P&D. Are they so big and happen so often? I don't think so, hence there's not so much to worry about.",

Some of the regulated trades are subject to pump and dump, what more the one that is unregulated.  Bitcoin just like any other altcoin are also subject to pump and dump.  Though as the price of Bitcoin increases, it slowly gets away from this pump-and-dump scheme.  I disagree with you about wash trading being the pump and dump scheme.  Wash trading is trading between the same group to increase the trading volume of coins or tokens.  Having a huge volume has benefits to the project.  If they get into the top 10, they are easily seen by other users, and that is free advertisement for the project.  While the pump and dump scheme has another motive and that is to profit by building up the price of the coins then dump to gain profit.  They often repeat it so they buy at the bottom making their position stronger with a larger amount of coins and profit from the pump-and-dump scheme.",

Elon Musk is probably one of the easier examples when we talk about \"influential\" and \"billions of dollars\". But there are many more edge cases where courts have a hard time to draw the line because they would have to shift that line in the next case most likely anyway. When it is about obvious insider information, of course there are laws and there is no discussion. But in most cases tweets or info that gets spread is a lot more on the edge. There have been many cases where executives or people closely related to them sold shares or bought shares before some info was made public. Guess what, nobody could prove that at the point in time when sales or purchases were made, the seller or buyer was already aware of that info. Some of the stuff seems obvious, and some of the stuff is on the edge. The few cases where obvious market manipulation gets caught or fined are not the ones that dominate our global markets. It is mostly the ones that go undetected because it's almost impossible to prove those cases. And again, where does true manipulation start and where does it end? The easy cases aren't really that interesting.",

Because i have learned so far that Wash trading mainly exists to manipulate the market. How \"wash trading\" is perpetuating crypto fraud You can take few examples from this article to understand what is wash trading and how it has the same purpose as Pump and Dump Schemes has. I am not saying you are wrong but I am saying I might not be wrong. Quote from: Odusko on March 23, 2023, 06:02:46 PMMarket manipulation has nothing to d....That's an obvious thing that market manipulation brings fake trading volume and it is totally unfair for real trading volume to share the same room with fake ones. (which means fake and real both combined used as \"trading volume\" there is no option of \"fake trading volume\" and \"real trading volume\" we can see on any of the websites).Quote from: bitmover on March 23, 2023, 07:04:49 PMIn stock market this kind of behavior is not allowed and he would have face fines.Yes, those who try to manipulate the market must have to face penalties. Just like the ones who tried to manipulate the market a few days back, Actor, Actress & Influencers are charged for conducting illegal Crypto Schemes by Flexystar. The same big celebrities who like to play with people's trust have to face penalties. But another question arises here why it did not happen? Like why they did not charge with money to manipulate the market, to play with users' money.Quote from: serjent05 on March 23, 2023, 09:49:07 PMProfit by building up the price of the coins then dump to gain profit.  They often repeat it so they buy at the bottom making their position stronger with a larger amount of coins and profit from the pump-and-dump scheme.Understood, You really cleared it up, so this is what you are trying to say, Wash trading scheme is used to increase BTC price, (not only of BTC of course) but in Pump and Dump scheme, activists also dump the price to gain profit by taking entry in \"short\". Please correct me, if i am wrong.",
