Between setting up a  mining rig to start mining Bitcoin and investing in Bitcoin mining stocks, which is the best option, assuming money is not a problem?In my country, company shares can be bought through a mobile phone, which anyone can do. Just money is not enough for mining. If your electricity is expensive, then mining is not profitable. The minimum batch for investment is a minimum container for 100 ASICs to quickly start mining, but you need to understand this and have at least 350 kilowatts per hour of available power.",
