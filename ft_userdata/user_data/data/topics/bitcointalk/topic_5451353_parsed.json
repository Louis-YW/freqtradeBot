I an happy to share some in this forum.Customer relation, a business person must understand that customer is king and should be treated like a royalty. Even it they are buying the least thing in your shop. When they leave your shop delighted, be assured that they will always come back to patronise you. And they will even market your products to their friends. Meaning more patronage for your business which will be increasing your profit.Your business should have at least one season when you give out rewards and discounts to customers when they buy your products. This will increase your sales geometrically and when you remove the cost of the reward and discounts, you will still have increased profit.Stock different brands of the products that you sell. Customers will prefer to enter a shop where they will see different varieties of what they need. More customers will enter and will even be tempted to buy more than they planned for. More customers equals more profit.Please feel free to drop your own ideas on how to increase profit in businesses.",

Yeah, you need to offer variety of items. For example if you are in the shoe business, then you should have at least full sizes of the shoes that you are selling.So talk to your customer, get feedback so that you can improved. They are the life line of your business, so obviously, you have to treat them very well. I also have online store that born out of the pandemic, and if I may add about the negatives though, there are competitors out there that wanted your business to be destroy so just be careful on who you deal with as well, just saying. Because as much as you are customer centric and giving rewards and discounts, sooner or later they will give you bad feedback because the people that ordered from your is from your competitor.",

All customers are not polite to you and you have to know where to draw the line too, depending on the business you have. But yes, the customer is the one who feeds you and you have to treat him as well as you can as long as he is respectful to you.Quote from: Kelward on May 05, 2023, 01:43:31 PMYour business should have at least one season when you give out rewards and discounts to customers when they buy your products.

Quote from: Kelward on May 05, 2023, 01:43:31 PMPlease feel free to drop your own ideas on how to increase profit in businesses.Well, one of them would be to publicize your business. Not in vain there is a concept called CAC, or Customer Acquisition Cost. It basically consists of investing in advertising and only very few businesses can avoid this and be successful. The question is to maintain a balance and always invest the right amount so that the customers you acquire and what you spend is higher, so that you obtain a higher return on your investment.",

As a customer, I prefer to go to stores with a good service attitude even though the prices may be higher than in other places. In business, we should sell what the customer needs rather than what we have. I mean we should have many different models and based on the customer's attitude we should behave appropriately. That's something I take very seriously as a customer.",

I agree, we don't need to make too much profit for each product sold, but instead can make a small profit but attract many customers, the total profit will be huge. If we sell cheaper than our competitors, we can retain old customers and attract new ones, which is a huge advantage that many large enterprises are applying. We are consumers ourselves, and we know what we need when we go shopping. Therefore, when doing business, always put yourself in the customer's position, then you will gain customers' love.",

Suppose in business case you first started with a shop, the customer in that shop is actually treated very politely with that customer as a result of which it will be seen that the customer will be very happy with you and later he will come back to your shop and bring some more customers. But if you misbehave with customers then that customer will leave your shop with a bad mentality towards you and will tell everyone about your behavior which will make others not come to your shop. So to improve the business you have to treat the customers well first.  Secondly, one must always adopt the righteous path. And accounts should be kept clear. If you are not mature then no matter how much money you earn from trading you will not be profitable annually.",
