However, sports branches that appealed to the audience live, such as football, were more affected.Even if normalization begins towards the end of last season, we are getting ready to enter a season that we can call normal.In this process, especially for football, I think that the big teams lose more power in general.

Of course, we may also be entering a more enjoyable period for betting.I think it is normal for the teams to play more beautiful football when they are enhanced by the fan saying the players name or supporting the team by singing the team anthem.This season it is a sure thing that we almost will see a normal season as the economies of both clubs,countries and other actors directly involved have lost a lot of money from CoronaVirus 19.A lot of industries have been hit and football is no different,other sports include MotoGP and F1 which have held races near empty without fans at all in the year that Covid blasted in 2020.Finally now Covid has become to many countries like a normal flu which most of the people pass without heavy symptoms.For betting it is always the same period though,we could bet in pandemic,we could bet now,this has not changed that much from the pandemic,we have been able to bet on football,F1 and other sports even in 2020 when the peak of Covid was worldwide.",

Like I have said, big clubs still won as usual, Manchester City in EPL, Real Madrid in La Liga Santander, PSG in Ligie 1, Juventus was not able to win in Seria A, but not due to COVID-19 and it was still a strong club that won Seria A. Real Madrid won Champions League.",

Hope that know we'll go ahead in this way, hope to not see anymore supporter far from a field !",

The COVID lockdowns helped the online betting to increased widely, the best so far that had happened which come to be normal now, its very practical to just do it at home than getting the virus. As more and more people got vaccinated, we're going back to what was before though even when the virus hasn't completely gone. We're getting there and its normal to see players wearing masks anymore.

That doesn't stop the fans from supporting their team but it's because the situation and conditions don't allow them to provide support directly on the pitch. But fortunately, the situation and conditions have now changed so that they can watch their favorite team play live. Sooner or later, everything will return to normal as it used to be and maybe it will be a new beginning for all of us.",

But online gambling industry had really flourished to another level during this time. While people were stuck at home, they found gambling entertainment quite amusing and started jumping into the bandwagon. There is a fascinating study available if you want to read,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/05/210517083636.htmSo even when the market is coming back to normal, gambling industry found new players who are expected to indulge more into grambling especially sports. It's all positive for business. Let's just hope it doesn't bring multiple disorders back associated with gambling.",

The crowd is clearly waiting for the moment to return to normal to be on the pitch with great gusto. Direct support makes the atmosphere of the match more pronounced, rather than seeing the empty spectator seats for almost 2 years. This has an impact on the stadium business which only relies on live broadcasts to be broadcast. So the gambling industry improved dramatically. Despite the fact, that gambling has never experienced a shortage of making money. I certainly have the same hope as the others, that the opening for the normal season should be done soon. We will have bigger games in the League and the World Cup this year.",
