  "content": "Hello guys this is my first crypto experience and so far has been a nightmare. I have a huge problem .So I am a freelance developer and I did a small gig for a client and I have never used crypto before. He said this is the only way he can pay me and walked me trough downloading a wallet for receiving my payment. I downloaded Trust Wallet as per his recommendation I dont know if it is good or not. He sent me USDT BEP20 to my address and I received the amount we agreed on. I was happy and we concluded the deal. I did not make a big deal out of this and kind of forgot about this money until now when I really needed to get some cash so I tough I should find a way to transfer this funds from my wallet. Apparently the funds are unusable and I can not send them to an exchange or to swap them inside my wallet due to the fact that I dont have any BNB Smart Chain ( whatever that is ) for tax. This so called tax is literally a few cents worth in $ and I dont understand why it does not take it from my USDT funds.I am way over my had with all of this so I am in a desperate need of help ? How can I get this cents in BNB Smart Chain coin in order to be able to unlock my funds on Trust Wallet ? Is there a button or option where they can take the tax directly from the USDT balance ?",

      "body": "You will need to send BNB to that wallet. If it is BEP20, send BNB on BEP20 network to the wallet. You can buy and send it on Binance exchange. The fee is the network fee, not tax. The fee is also very small. Just send like $1 worth of BNB to your wallet and make your transaction. I also had this problem when I was a newbie, but it is not hard at all.",

Cheers! Be careful about accepting tokens, some of them are burned and some of them contain conditions in the smart contract that prevent spending, so accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT TRC20 and create an account on CEXs trading platform if you want to accept more altcoins and do not accept any token that is not listed in that exchange(binance for example)I am happy that your problem has been solved and I hope to see you actively participating here.

At a glance, you can differentiate between the two from the wallet addresses that support them. What you need in your case is a smartchain type (BSC) with the address prefix \"0x\". In future when you purchase similar necessities through an exchange say Binance, you should be careful when withdrawing to your trustwallet.",

Cheers! Bitcointalk allows the whole crypto community to grow!In the future consider accepting coins over tokens, like Bitcoin which has its own blockchain so you do no need another coin to pay as a transaction/gas fee. Also, avoid accepting tokens running on the Ethereum network generally erc20 tokens cause it need an insane amount to be paid while transacting in comparing with other network tokens.",

First of all, Trust Wallet is a reputable wallet to use, so your client made a good choice there. Aside from Trust Wallet, there's Metmask, etc. Now, regarding the issue you faced with your USDT due to the lack of BNB for gas fees, the BNB token is used to pay for these gas fees (I'm talking about BSC blockchain cause other blockchain fees are paid in different crypto tokens). When you perform any action on the blockchain, such as transferring funds or interacting with smart contracts, the network requires a certain amount of computational power to process and confirm your transaction, and this computational power is provided by miners or validators who maintain the blockchain network. Another thing, gas fees are calculated based on two things: how hard the task is and how crowded the network is. If it's a tough job or the network is busy, the fee goes up.",
