But i cant see the game.Today we have some really good matches.River against Central Cordoba with the debut of Martin Demichelis like manager of River.",

Yes i think in the same way and maybe more high odds, and also huge ones, i dont trust in low odds for the long run less in this kind of tournaments with a lot of irregularity.Quote from: LGD2Business on January 28, 2023, 10:50:13 PMThe Argentina league consists of 2 teams for me, River Plate and Boca Juniors.

I think San Lorenzo and Newells Old Boys are also among the best teams in the league this season.Yes worldwide the only teams are Boca and River, Boca ,makes a big name from his wins in the early 2000 beating Real Madrid and Milan and only losing to Bayern Munich in a close one for the intercontienental cup.As i said above i dont recommend any team before i see them in some rounds, because in this league the teams are really irregulars and they change so much players from season to season.The two teams you mention are really good ones, San Lorenzo its part of the \"big fives\" but its experiencing a really bad present from some years not making tournaments at his height.But... since the last season they seems to find the direction and yesterday their started with a win.For Newells another good team with ton of regular seasons and the last title from 2013 with Martino as manager (former manager of Barcelona) and Maxi Rodriguez like key player. the last seasons of them not are good or bad, mid table. But now they have Heinze as manager and pulling out that of their lose the mayority of pre season games, i think they can do something.In a few rounds i gave to you waht team i recommended to take a eye.Quote from: flipme on January 29, 2023, 02:49:58 AMIt's really nice to see a topic about the Argentine League on the forum.

It was a very interesting moment indeed. River Plate scored and Boca Juniors became champions. The arch-rivals were honest with each other.Yes man, that was a really good end for the league ,also Racing its the archi-rival of Independiente, the one who play against Boca, so they also can give the title to their archirival, a really uncomfortable situation for all the teams.The Argentinian league its suffering so much from the economic problem of the country, we cant compete against other teams in terms of salary and a lot of players are sold fast.",

The one thing about this league that i like most is the similarities between the league and my own country league. I guess it would be proper to the question why?  And the answer is that the home teams get a larger portions of wins and thats the same feat with my our country, the Nigerian premier league. Home advantage is something i like about the Argentina league,  and i certainly place my bet on velez,  boca juniors, River plate when ever they are at home playing and most of the times they always deliver. Nice seeing a thread has been created on this league and i would be looking forward to following up. But the only disadvantage is that i don't get to watch most the games because of the timezone difference.",
