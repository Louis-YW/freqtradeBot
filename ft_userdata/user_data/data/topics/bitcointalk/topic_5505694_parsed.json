I predicted that Trump would introduce a competitor of Bitcoin, and then use his control of the US government to prop up his platform and pass laws to denigrate existing crypto platforms like Bitcoin.Well, it looks like my first prediction is about to come true.Trump already has built-in excuses to come after Bitcoin: he promises to criminalize abortion in the USA, which will require the largest police state created in the USA since the Prohibition in the 1920s (which is how the FBI was invented, for instance). Since Bitcoin and other cryptos can be used to pay for illegal abortions, it will make sense that Americans should be forced to use his \"trusted\" platform instead of \"untrusted\" ones like Bitcoin. (And if that excuse doesn't work, they could think of a dozen more).I would like people to think about what a Trump presidency would mean to Bitcoin and crypto generally.Trump, a convicted criminal and somebody who has been found guilty of running multiple scams all of his life, will have his own business that competes with Bitcoin and/or the crypto industry, and he will have the full power of the US government to give his own company unfair advantages over competitors. And Trump has demonstrated, over and over again, that he will absolutely use the US presidency to enrich himself at he expense of the American people.Do you want to compete directly against the President if the United States and his political party with your business?

What exactly do you mean by denigrate crypto platforms and what laws can be passed to achieve that?Please keep political discussion in the Politics and society board, there are already too many political discussions clogging this board up.Now that crypto is the biggest single donor to US elections this cycle, it's hard see where politics ends and Bitcoin begins. I personally would love nothing more than for Bitcoin and crypto to have nothing to do with US politics--like it has in previous elections--but this year is clearly very different.And Trump entering the Bitcoin space is a clearly a business story, not just a political one.And how would Trump compete against Bitcoin if he was elected? Very carefully, I am sure, but it's really not very hard when you have the entire US government on your side. All he has to do is require features that he knows only his platform has and get government approvals that only get can get. Trump will have the SEC, the DOJ, the FBI, the FTC, and a bunch of other agencies directly under his control--and this isn't even checked by Congress. And if he wins he will also most likely have a majority in Congress, meaning he can basically pass whatever law he wants. I don't think it's really necessary to use this space to come up with all of the ways Trump could do it--it's just too easy .",

I’m so sick of people bashing Trump, if you’re not voting for Trump in this election you’re not an American you’re probably foreign or have no clue wtf is actually going on here.Biden: * Has never been indicted for any crime, let alone convicted, let alone indicted for 88 felonies as Trump has;* Has never had any of his businesses shut down because of fraud, as Trump has for several of his businesses;* Has never funneled millions of dollars of US taxpayer money to his companies, as Trump did during his presidency;* Is not in the process of creating a business that competes with Bitcoin or the crypto industry generally, as Trump is;And there is absolutely no evidence--not even conspiracy theories (which is saying something for Republicans) that Biden engaged in \"money laundering\" with the Chinese or any other government. And also, Biden is not running for president. So there's that.Look, I get it: you clearly want abortion to be criminalized across the USA. I understand it's a very divisive topic, and those who think as you do will vote for absolutely anybody as long as they commit to making abortion illegal, as Trump has. Harris is not going to use the US presidency to benefit her crypto business (because she doesn't have one, for starters). There's every reason to expect Trump will do exactly that.Edit:By the way, your man is basically senile at this point. Good luck trying to win anything with this vegetable:The GOP’s new worry: Trump can’t drive a coherent message",

That, despite his pronouncements against Bitcoin, even calling it \"a scam against the dollar\", a year prior. Now that he's been praising Bitcoin no end-- although he speaks of it as if it is interchangeable with crypto-- there's no reason why his family would step on the breaks. The family has certainly made even better following within the crypto community after Trump Sr.'s various interviews, speeches, and other public addresses that are even covered by the media in which he is so generous in speaking in favor of crypto. No way would they not take advantage of it. As a matter of fact, they've already quickly released Bitcoin-themed sneakers. And it was a sold-out.",

Seeing the positives here, this means that Trump or at least his family is serious with their interest with crypto.If he does not win presidency, he still can very much resort to crypto and launch his own memecoin.

He will use his party's favorite policy goal as an excuse to disfavor his competitors and favor his own products.Republicans are already instituting border controls around states to keep women from leaving states to get abortions. They obviously know all about what you are proposing here, and obviously the only way to stop all of the abortions will be to do what they are doing in certain states in the whole country. Also, Republicans have also temporarily made the abortion drug illegal nationwide, but since a Democrat was president (Biden), that failed. But Trump will reinstate that ban the moment he gets into office. And then yes, all abortion drugs in the US will have the same issues as illicit drugs like heroine and fentanyl since they will be illegal.Stopping the millions of abortions in the US every year--a key policy goal of Republicans for the last 40 years--will require a new police state like the US has never seen.",
