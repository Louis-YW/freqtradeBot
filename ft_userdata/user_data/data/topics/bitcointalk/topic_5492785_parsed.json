Armed conflicts will continue until countries fail and collapse internally, which means that paper money will decrease in value.Your investment in gold and Bitcoin will be smart because, at the very least, your assets will maintain their value.",

But unfortunately, bitcoin has not yet reached that stage, and what bitcoin is achieving is just a highly volatile investment. So it's quite normal for it to be dumped every time the world has a black swan, you don't need to be too surprised about that. But you need to know one thing that it is very volatile, bitcoin can be dumped but will also recover quickly, even increase sharply. And I don't believe WW3 will happen, the war between Iran and Israel is a farce because it seems like it's over.",

The goldprice has a long history of soaring when the monetary system fails.Why do you think it isn't?Bitcoin has proven to have a very independent market that is not affected by anything except the economy itself and only on a global level. For example it won't matter if the local economy in one or two countries is booming or crashing it won't affect bitcoin but if the global economy is affected in the same way then it will affect bitcoin.That effect is always that with inflation price goes up and with recession it comes down. In other words bitcoin is a hedge against inflation or hyperinflation but it is not a hedge against recession.QuoteI have never seen the goldprice crash in times of war, but correct me if I am wrong. During WWII, the gold price doubled. Read this again and you should realize not to compare such an old asset like gold that has been around for centuries and have been treated as something valuable with bitcoin that is only a toddler in comparison.QuoteIf the scenario for the coming months and years is that we are heading into WWIII, and I truly believe that we will, what is your investment strategy for crypto?It depends on how you define WW3. Technically we're fighting WW5 now (3rd one was the cold war between US and USSR). In some definitions (eg. nuclear extinction) you should invest in potatoes because food would be the currency of the world assuming you're one of the survivors...QuoteIn times of heavy monetary inflation/ war threats I expected the BTC price to soar, just like gold soars. In reality what we have seen is that BTC crashes hard and precious metals soar. We haven't had any major global wars with major global inflation to test this. We've only had major localized conflicts and major global recession where the later caused crashes (the COVID recession and the start of Russian invasion of Ukraine).",

They worry about the cryptocurrency's volatility in a cash-based economy where many live hand-to-mouth.Some 88% of Salvadorans did not use it in 2023, according to a survey by the University of Central America's public opinion institute. Just 1% of remittances were sent in bitcoin.Nearly two dozen people Reuters spoke to said they did not care to understand the cryptocurrency, but they were increasingly concerned about the lack of jobs and rising costs of housing and food.El Salvador was been accept Bitcoin as legal tender since 2021, but until now there's no big adoption even Bitcoin already reach 3x times higher since 2022.

The sharp decline is a result of individuals selling believing it would be affected due to Bitcoin relative young age to Gold This same happened during the Ukraine Russian war and even amid the conflict we saw a sharp recovery. To me it's just a correction that's really needed so we can start hitting the $100K barrier. Selling your coin is a choice but thinking if buying after not might but would be too late Note never chase a perfect entry. Gold is a good option during the war but what about after and by how much do you think it would rise. Recall Gold isn't as volatile as Bitcoin and you shouldn't be expecting life shaking profit.

      "body": "My true assessment is that, since Bitcoin moved in multiples over the past few years, people believe that it is what could be compared exactly with Gold and will always perform well without any challenges. But I see it differently. Bitcoin is still finding its path to survive the test of time even though everything seems perfect, but Gold is way old and has done so well and been used for virtually anything you can think of as an asset and it survived. It is a safe-haven asset which is why it was able to overcome all odds and hurdles, especially during the time of war. For the fact that Gold is one of the common commodities that has not failed people, people/investors prefer to keep their money in it, and not fiat currencies that the war may affect hugely depending on the devastation meted on the country spending the currency during the war. After the war, the currency could have devalued so much.But with Gold that has no certain government/country control/dependence, it remains the same, and could even be reviewed higher in price since more capital would be injected into it. If the world war happens again, we may see Gold reaching the moon indeed, especially as the population of the world is higher now, and so will the value of its liquidity and price. Well, I would have said a little same for Bitcoin but I can't because it is still young, and most importantly, it is not a safe-haven asset. It is a risk-on asset just like other major fiat currencies. It also has the limitation of internet dependency, which makes Gold even more unique during war. Because, if the war is bitting and the internet ceases, Gold can still be used to make transactions, which makes it more valuable at that time.",

For smart investors who have a more modern outlook, Bitcoin is a good asset to invest in as an asset that preserves value from a damaged economic system and the price increase can be greater than gold.I can't find any more articles that cover at length who is the best hedge for me to link here.",

I'm personally located in Belgium. I believe that NATO will end up backing the USA in another war, orchestrated by Israel against Iran and its allies. It's hard for me to guess how we will be affected. I'm thinking rampant inflation. I can't imagine there would be loads of violence in my own country. If we somehow would get attacked by Iran, the target would likely be the capital which is a 3 hour drive from where I live. This is where the NATO headquarters are located, so it makes sense. The only scenario in which I think all of us can be affected, is a nuclear strike on the capital with miles of devastation around it. I don't know if we have the capacity to intercept nuclear strikes the way the USA and Israel do. - Regarding the bag of potatoes. I live in a large family house at the countryside. I think this location is much more preferable than a city in a case like this. The house has a huge garden (about half the size of a soccer field) which allows me to grow my own food. I am personally looking forward to this regardless of any war. The house also has 5 rooms, allowing us to take friends and even refugees if we want to. It is likely that we will. - About water I am not sure. My main concern is default on mortgage downpayments due to rampant inflation in WWIII. I think this is how the World Economic Forum will establish their famous quote \"By 2030 you will own nothing\". They know that the monetary system will inevitably crash. I believe they will either blame it on a cyber attack, or on all out war.Surely the end of life on earth as we know it is possible because of nuclear strikes. But I personally believe it will happen because of AI outsmarting the human race and killing all of us, within the next 20-30 years. AI will take over most jobs. We don't need 16 billion people on the planet.",
