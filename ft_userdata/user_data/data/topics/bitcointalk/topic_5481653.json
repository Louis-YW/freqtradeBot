The thing to keep in mind and as a secret would be the seed phrases which are the keys to the wallet. Also, for most signature campaigns on this platform, a good wallet will ensure your steady pay without hiccups and one can HoDL BTC as a strategic investment for a long duration on a good wallet like electrum too.",

And what are the best ways for me to keep my cryptocurrencies safe?Sorry if it seems like a stupid question, but even though I reasonably understand crypto, I'm still taking my first steps with bitcoin.Binance is a centralized exchange in which you do not have full control of your asset, should anything happen to the platform your funds will be lost, there are also other restrictions that exchanges have. Using an exchange to keep funds is like leaving your stuffs in a marketplace. The best form of holding or storing your coins is to be your own bank that’s keeping your funds in self custodial wallet, there you have your wallet keys to yourself; not your keys not your coins. Now there are many type of custodial wallets but the best is the open source wallets and also an offline wallet like an hardware wallet or an airgapped wallet set with any software wallet. Here is break down of wallets and categories you can choose from For privacy: use bitcoin core and run your own node. For cold wallet; you can use hardware wallet (Trezor or passport) or an airgapped device with electrum as the wallet For hot wallet: use electrum, BlueWallet and Sparrow (they have both mobile and desktop versions) Also it is worth mentioning that the even after making a choice of wallet one important thing is how you keep your seed phrase or private key safe, a good and safe wallet is complimented by keeping the seed safe and secure by backing them up offline and secure from physical theft. Quote from: dewcanon on January 15, 2024, 02:53:36 PMIf you want real safe solutions, use cold wallets. The problem is only that they not support all of the altcoins. Ledger or Trezor is a good choice. Cheers  Ledger currently isn’t a good option for an hardware wallets, I will advice OP to stay away from it",

I personally use the Trezor hardware wallet to store crypto assets, and Electrum which I installed on my mobile phone (Electrum is known to be safe according to several members here). Apart from that, I also use a trust wallet on my mobile phone. I specifically use this wallet for airdrops or trading on dex related to altcoins, but recently many people have said that trust wallets are not safe, and have the potential to lose crypto assets due to scamming.If you want to find some references regarding OP's wallet, you can open the wallet software child boards here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=37.0lots of interesting and useful reviews there.",

Do not expect it to be safer when you use it as an online wallet compared to when you use in on an airgapped device as a cold wallet. Also the security is increased if you use it as a multisig wallet.",

You're aware that keeping your funds on exchange is no good and that's why it's a good move that you start to look for better wallets for safe keeping. Once you can afford to purchase a hardware wallet, that should be your next step because as you can see, everyone is telling you that it's best to have a hardware wallet and that's no doubt.

Right now I am also in the process of installing Bitcoincore, and the process is only 11% synchronized (when this post was made). Maybe I'll use Bitcoin core about 2 or 3 weeks later.The safest way to store cryptocurrency assets is, never let other people know the seed phrase or private key that binds your wallet. Keep it off the internet as much as possible and never let anyone know where you store your keys.Some people use paper to write their seeds, or some people engrave them on iron plates to make them safer from fire and water ....and store them in their secret lockers. It all depends on each individual, even if the balance you have is very small, at least you can start to be disciplined in securing your wallet in a slightly more thorough manner.",

And what are the best ways for me to keep my cryptocurrencies safe?If you really mean safe you need either cold storage (but that's not that easy to configure properly and use), either hardware wallet.Even a simple USB stick can do wonders for safe keeping/safely handling your coins... if you have the knowledge for it. But since your money is at a centralized exchange... let's go for a faster and easier route: hardware wallets. They have a big range of prices, it widely depends on how many altcoins you also have and how much you want to pay for the HW. There are plenty of reviews around, you already got a good number of answers.I want to emphasize something else: it's not enough to just get a safe wallet. It also matters how you store the seed, it matters what other things you do (it's easy to think HW is extremely safe, but you use it with a seed generated online, ie unsafe, or not paying attention to the transactions' addresses and get your money stolen by a clipboard malware).So take your time and try to learn a little more.",

There's a lot of decent hardware wallets to choose from like Blockstream Jade, Ngrave Zero... Choose the one that you like and can afford. Some people will like easy to use big screen wallet like Ngrave, some will choose small and simple like Jade. Cheaper hardware wallets will cost you around $100, so it's not a lot of money spent on security, especially if you hold more than 1 bitcoin.",
