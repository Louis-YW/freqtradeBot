  "content": "Yes as the subject said, using borrowed money to buy bitcoin is not good idea because the interest is accumulating every week/month and you don't know when the bull will come and even if you know, you will not know how much it will be. And assuming you took a loan of $400 to pay back within 3 years and the interest rate is $2 weekly and in the 3 years period, bitcoin has not reach the speculated price to sold your bitcoin to pay your loan. Or when you sell, you get the exact amount of the loan, or 1% profit from the sell and you pay off the loan and there is nothing left for you to start over. Is that a good investment? No. So there are many factors one can consider before using borrow money for bitcoin investment. You have to consider the duration of the loan, the probability outcome of bitcoin at the end of the loan year, and the interest rate accumulated at the time to pay back the loan. When you have done your homework well and you see that you can use the loan to invest on bitcoin and there will be no problem at the end and you will have some changes remain in your wallet then you are free but if not, it will shock you and you will be frustrated so prevention is better than cure as they said. Therefore using loan for investment is not advisable. Ordinarily, you cannot just come to the cryptocurrency Ecosystem space without proper planning and started investing, it is not done in that way, at least calm down to study how things are done in the environment, making some analysis, compare and contrast some of the risk involved then if it is good then you key into it and if it is not then you look for an alternative way to invest in bitcoin. I came up with this topic because I was planning to borrow money to invest in bitcoin but when I looked at the risk involved, I have to give up the borrowing plan.",

It’s definitely a good thing to think about investing and wanting to do it as soon as possible but learning when to enter the market should definitely be carefully thought of first. Props to you for realizing what should be done!",

Because indeed there will be risks that must be faced in the future, if investment in bitcoin does not go according to expectations. Therefore, avoiding borrowing money to invest in bitcoin, for me, is absolutely mandatory to avoid. Why did I avoid it, it's because I was not able to overcome all the risks that might occur in the future. I see my inability in terms of my income every month. So it's better to invest in bitcoin, in a slow way and there's no need to rush to get huge profits.But for people who are ready with all the risks and consequences, maybe borrowing money to invest in bitcoin is fine. But with conditions must be prepared to bear all the risks. Because actually if you look at the potential of bitcoin from what has been passed until now. Bitcoin is always profitable, as long as you can patiently wait until the bull run market comes. So even though investing is using borrowed money, but can be patient waiting for the bull market to run, I believe that in the end it is likely to experience profits.But even so, there are a number of things that must be prepared when using borrowed money to invest in bitcoin, so that it can run smoothly. One of them, namely, must have a fixed income every month, in order to be able to pay bills that must be paid every month and to finance daily life.QuoteI came up with this topic because I was planning to borrow money to invest on bitcoin but when I look at the risk involved, I have to give up the borrowing plan. If you feel you are unable to face all the risks that might occur, it is better to cancel your plan.",

      "body": "If you borrow money for the purpose of Bitcoin investment, it presupposes that you don't have an extra money, that which you can afford to lose. So that's basically it. The advice has always been to invest only what you can afford to lose so that whatever happens you're not left with nothing and you can still move on with your life. So, notwithstanding Bitcoin's track record, since it remains risky and that it does not have any guarantee whatsoever that it will rise in the following year or years, you better just use extra savings.",

An investment loan whose repayments are a low percentage of your income is not bad at all. Although people generally take loans to buy bitcoin and crypto would say that they do not have a rational plan, but are left to carry around the fashionable moment, thinking that they will stick the ball and when they see that the plans do not come out as expected they have just sold losses and still have to pay the loan for the difference.",

Do you plan to hold it on exchange or in non custodial wallet.Store your bitcoin on exchanges is risky and it is better to store it in non custodial wallet.The bad way to use bitcoin you bought is to deposit it as a collaterall for Margin or Futures trading.

The best way to make profit is when you hodli for a very long time,this will make you relax and not bothered about the price of bitcoin,either pumping or dumping. If you borrow money to invest, this can give the investor a sleepless night because he will be checking at the price of bitcoin often. If bitcoin price dumps below what he bought that person can sell out of panic and make losses.

I remember back in 2017 when the market touched 20k for the first time, a lot of my colleagues had used their credit card to buy Bitcoin out of pure FOMO. For next couple of years, they had a hard time paying that debt to the credit card company because in my country, the interest on credit card borrowing is around 48% annually. I have seen them taking loan from banks at lower rate to pay off their credit card dues. Which essentially means, they had taken a loan to pay off the previous loan. Investment should happen with your own money and not on borrowed funds. That's a thumb rule of personal investment.",

I came up with this topic because I was planning to borrow money to invest in bitcoin but when I looked at the risk involved, I have to give up the borrowing plan. It's a good thing that you're doing a good math right there and was able to understand the risk involved. Buy hey, $2 per week in a 3-year term is a very high interest, that's $228 in total more than half of what you have owed them. Also, a 3-year term for a $400 is quite long, therefore it'll make the interest rate even more higher. The longer you pay the loan, the more you're paying for the interest. So, first of, you need to find a good company or bank that will give you lesser interest and cut the payment term to at least 1 year, depends on your monthly income the early you paid everything off, much better. Look, borrowing money to invest in bitcoin may not be advisable for many people, but for the most experienced one, they could take advantage of it. Especially when you're trying to get into the bull train before bitcoin priced at more $50k some time in the future. Borrowing isn't always bad as long as you have a comfortable extra income to pay off these debts no matter how long bitcoin you're holding.",

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, so borrowing money to invest in them is like playing Russian roulette with your money. Lets figure this out. Borrowing $400 at $2 per week in interest for 3 years results in a total interest payment of $312. Now, if Bitcoin's value doesnt soar as you anticipate, all you have left to do is repay a sizable loan. Its all agony and no reward.There's also the nagging worry of being indebted and the anger at watching your hard-earned cash go into interest rather than a nest egg. Woah, this is perilous! Financial strategy calls for cold hard facts, not wishful thinking. The cryptocurrency exchange is not a game, but rather a war zone. Stay away from the debt trap unless you've thought it through and have a safety net in place.In finance, as in life, you cant expect anything for nothing. You should always be willing to incur a loss if you want to invest with your own money. If you need to borrow money to invest, don't do it, especially in something as volatile as Bitcoin.

If your payback period is 3 years from now, maybe you can witness the bull run returning to the market so you can sell the Bitcoin you have bought at the highest price.But that's just an assumption because we never know when a bull run will come. So borrowing money is not a good plan unless you can repay the loan from other sources of income so you don't have to think about when the bulls will come. You need to focus on buying Bitcoin in the present moment while paying off the loan every month.It's better for you to invest in Bitcoin using money from your source of income so you don't have to think about repaying the loan money.

Borrowing to start a business is not a bad idea if you have done your planning properly. Such a business should be the type that you have some level of control over. At least your inputs should be able to determine the profitability of the business to some extent. If you take a loan to start up a poultry farm for example. You are sure that if you put in your best, there are chances that you will achieve your profit target. But investing in a business that you have no level of control over is risky. The bitcoin market is not predictable. The price is controlled by some external forces that many investors don't have any control over. So taking a loan to invest in this volatile sector is not advisable because anything can happen.

According to the history of Bitcoin, bull runs typically occur following halving periods that occur after four years, however it is true that even then, no one can predict how long a bull run will go.Although Bitcoin has shown to be a profitable investment, it is never a smart idea to spend funds that you cannot afford to lose due to the risk in cryptocurrency sector. I'm not even clear why someone would borrow money to invest in something with no assurance of what would happen in the future due to volatile nature of Bitcoin which simply means that its price can fluctuate quickly either go up or down. With the knowledge that anything is possible to happen to the price of Bitcoin, I will never advocate for anyone to invest money they cannot afford to lose.Please don't allow us be overly eager to benefit from the cryptocurrency sector just because we see or hear about others doing so by investing in Bitcoin with borrowed money. You will undoubtedly feel dissatisfied if you borrow money to invest in Bitcoin at a time when its value is falling since you cannot afford to lose it.

I mean the main reason was just that cryptocurrency or Bitcoin is just a risky investment and it wasn't recommended to do a loan just to invest in something that is risky it just wasn't worth it because if you lose your money on Bitcoin then you get a debt as well which is a big problem by chance. If we are just going to invest in Bitcoin we already know that we should have liquidated or fiat money that we have in our savings because if you're going to invest but it is already all of our funds I just wouldn't really going to recommend that because what funds are you going to use when the market is down? Your just gonna end up selling your holding and lose money because you didn't have the plan to invest. Most traders are just going to recommend you invest only 10% of your funds in cryptocurrency because it is just way too risky to put everything on it.Taking a loan wasn't actually that bad if you know what you're doing loans could easily help you with your problems and probably it could help you buy assets that could generate your income, but if you just doesnt have funds just dont invest on cryptocurrency just invest it on something that is more guarantee to give income.Quote from: Outhue on August 02, 2023, 06:34:22 AMIf you borrow money to invest in Bitcoin, that shows you have no other option left and this also means that you are trying to invest what you can't afford to lose because you borrowed the money, Bitcoin investment is not for such people, if all you can do is borrow money, brother go out and look for jobs, this is not a matter of when to buy or when to sell, you are doing it completely wrong.Your money or no Bitcoin investment, doing this will put you under pressure and unease mind, it's money you borrow, and there will be a max time for you to pay back the money, I can promise you that it's not going to be a pleasant investment in the end.
