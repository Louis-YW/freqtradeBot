  "content": "Hi,I'm opening this topic on the forum to introduce you to Cloudbet scammers. 3 years ago I opened an account on Cloudbet, I made a deposit of about 0.29BTC, I played on the account and reached 0.92BTC. After that I could not log into the account. I wrote to support, and they replied that the account was frozen and that they would contact me via email. After that they stopped responding to my email. Every 2-3 months I send them an email, but no one answers, now I have decided to put an end to the fraudsters. I sent them documents for verification, my ID, selfie with ID, proof of address, but nothing. Can you give me some guidance on where to report this case. I have a lot of evidence and screenshots.https://ibb.co/L9k0MzV",

Most of us will probably create a thread before a week ends when a casino doesn't reply to us immediately when asking why we can't access the account anymore. 3 years is too long. They might have already deleted your account when they saw years past and you are not in rage.Tons of complains about them in the forum so it's not surprising anymore.",

      "body": "Why did you remain silent all that time, OP?The kyc process and the investigation isn't supposed to take more than two weeks, a month at most. Did they at least tell you why they froze your account? Did you try to reach the admins via any other means other than their email address? Customer support will continue to repeat the same thing that they will notify when there is an update. You need to get in touch with the owner or admis.",

If I recall well, 3 years ago, Cloubet has a good presence in the forum with the support promptly helping out with issues that came up.Right now so many complaints are coming up and yet there is no response here in the forum, so your best hope is the promise the support staff made to you about escalating the issue. Please update us on the progress.",

I am posting the chat image from the OP here for easier viewing.The Cloudbet forum representative has not logged in since March 2022 but still I guess you could send a message as a back-up, you never know maybe they will reply: CloudbetOther than that, you post here in the ANN thread: Cloudbet | Bitcoin Casino & Sportsbook | The No.1 Bitcoin Gambling SiteFinally, the footer area on their cloudbet.com website shows the following maybe you can report them to the Curacao Gaming Licence board though they do not have a great record of resolving allegations: Cloudbet.com is owned and operated by Halcyon Super Holdings BV (Abraham Mendez Chumaceiro Boulevard 50, Curaçao).
