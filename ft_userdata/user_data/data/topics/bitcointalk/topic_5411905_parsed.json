      "body": "I have to disagree. It's all about physics, the more air you can move the better the cooling. An enclosed case restricts airflow andrequires more assistance from fans and even ducting. It also depends on the ventilation in the room.@OP: BTW I like the setup you have with the alternately facing GPUs, looks very efficient.",

It is not so easy to make it yourself from wood and other spare parts, and it can take a lot of time. It is better to spend it on mining.",
