The difference is if you lose in spot trading you only lose a few percent of your holdings compared to betting where you can lose them all. You have more chance to make a profit in trading if you have knowledge about trading analysis while gambling is always based on your luck.

In this definition, trading has a bit of gambling in it.Trading is a bit of a gamble, but, it's not the same as placing bets on real or virtual games. It however, has some similarities with them, imo.",

I had this argument with few of my friends that are traders some hours ago and I will like to here from you all what hou think about this. Well,  on a deeper context,  I will agree with you that trading is like gambling,  but not gambling itself ,  but also,  I will point out that not all trading are actually like gambling.First,  trading blindly can be likend to gambling, since that trader is only depending on luck to earn profit.Secondly, the other trades where the trader knows what he or she is doing,  that is based on the traders market analysis or information he or she has, that trade is guaranteed to yield profit for the trader ~ this is the type of trade that is actual trading,  that is,  trading with confidence and certainty even in a crypto market that is filled with uncertainties.",

In trading the probabilities of outcomes are unknown, so you can't even know in whose favor are the odds. If you are doing short-term speculative trading, then it resembles gambling, because it's nearly impossible to make a rational prediction that would be correct more often than not. But long-term investing that is based on some solid analysis is more likely to be profitable than not, so it's not like gambling at all.",

As trading creates more opportunities to win and make profits, while gambling clearly put you into more losses particularly for newbies who  always bet for long and only stops when they start winning. Though both have risks in common, but there is always advantage in trading especially if you become a pro in it since the outcome of your trades will be most likely become successful.",

What makes them the same though is you can both win and lose.Trading can be considered gambling if only you don't know what you are doing. Professional traders tend to win more and loss less. Newbie traders are a complete opposite. In gambling, a professional gambler can still lose more and win less especially if he isn't lucky and newbie gamblers? Well they lose all of their money sometimes in an instant. I don't consider trading another form of gambling for me because in gambling, you need luck while in trading, you need experience and strategies in order to gain profits.",

If you go 1x for both margin and derivatives (future), they are not riskier than spot, if you start to leverage, going for 2x and on, margin and derivative trading are considered to be riskier. Derivative trading just give the opportunity to long and short.",

Both gambling and trading are risky ventures in which one can either win or make loss. I don't think the term addiction rhymes with trading other that it's counterpart, gambling. Trading may undergo pricing and negotiation, along with delivery and duty charges, whereas I doubt gambling and claiming your reward ever undergoes such process after.  The distinction between both is more than it's similarities. unless you can confidently tell someone you work as a gambler, then there's no reason to think trading could be a form of gambling.",

But on the other side is that a trader can continue to lose and yet continue to trade, that is addiction also. Someone that is trading and losing can be compared to someone that is gamblimg and losing. But that does not mean they are the same, but the losses for gamblers and poor traders can be the same. Know that you can be addicted to anything, it can be gambling, trading or drug etc, but addiction is not good as it can affect health and wellbeing.",

I had this argument with few of my friends that are traders some hours ago and I will like to here from you all what hou think about this. Let me tell you outrightly that trading is not gambling, they are just different. In trading you have strategy, plan and management, so you are not gambling since you know what you are doing. But in gambling, you are doing guesswork, no strategy, or management and you are not having a real plan but using ideas.And the winning 6 and losing 4 trade you used as an example is the challenge and risk in trading, mind you, the table might turn as a good strategy should win 5, 7,8,9 10 in 10 trades depending on the favorability of the market at that time.We should all admit that trading does not come easily, it is all about patience, discipline, calculations, a good system, management and time-proof plans that will earn consistently. Earning constantly does not also mean you will win every trade every day, but means that your losses are lower than your winnings and are well managed in a way that will never ruin your trading account as though you are gambling.Quote from: Upgrade00 on August 25, 2022, 04:25:26 PMthere are more niche ones which are particularly on placing bets on the outcomes of games.Nice!

He wouldn't have linked this together with trading if it were to be gambling in the wider context in which betting is among.Quote from: Charles-Tim on August 26, 2022, 08:16:11 AMBut there is one you have not mentioned which is what that is most pertaining to this discussion, that is crypto tradong itself, some people are not traders but gamblers, example is a person that heard about trading, he just learn the basic and trade with high amount of money, only what he realized are losses, that is not a trader, but a gamblers, anyone that do not make appropriate analyses for trading are gamblers, so some traders are gamblers, but trading is not gambling.You are getting this better than many I had read their replies here. They are regarding gambling in the wider context but not within the trading context itself. Nonetheless, anybody who dabbles in trading when they are not well informed about it is a gambler. There is no way they will not gamble as trading is unknown to them.",
