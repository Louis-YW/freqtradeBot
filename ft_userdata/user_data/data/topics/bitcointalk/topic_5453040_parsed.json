We all know that debt is possible on cards..I know some people likes taking loans or borrow money, but I know him too well, he always advice us to never take any loan for anything.I know some are wondering why I don't ask him, he is way older than me and I don't want to ask him, I only told him to take things easy with himself, I don't know if asking can make him feel bad even more.

The only aspect which I think is existing and somewhat related with the 'play and pay later' you have mentioned is free spins and other welcome bonuses which allows players to play and have a chance to win without depositing the usual required amount. But an actual aspect which would allow a player to somewhat borrow an amount like a loan to a gambling site, is something which is not familiar on my awareness.It would only be possible if you'd go through actual lending procedures such as borrowing an amount you can use to play. However, I won't suggest this way still. Imagine losing the money and still with the responsibility of actually paying an amount.",

As far as I know there are no casinos that provide loans, but maybe at offline casinos we will find some with strong collateral conditions. When it comes to online casinos, it feels like this doesn't exist and will never even be implemented. Apart from gamblers who can just walk away as soon as the bills are collected. Say, if there is a casino like that, even though applying KYC is accompanied by a guarantee even before taking a loan does not mean that the data provided is genuine data. This is risky and the casino's position seems to be looking for gamblers not gamblers looking for casinos.",

We all know that debt is possible on cards..You must be referring to an offline casino because an online casino will never allowed that to happen since they don't know who is using their sites and can run away when they lose. An online casino can never allow such practice or they'll be losing money in the business.I haven't heard of an offline casino offering loan bets either, it looks possible but I haven't heard of any one and if there's one operating, we have to avoid them because we'll put ourselves in unpayable debts. Gambling is very addictive and having free money is dangerous.You should never borrow money to gamble and you should never take loans as well. Gambling should be done with spare money because there's a high possiblity that you'll lose and it's better to lose your spare money than lose money that you still have to payback.",

It's impossible to happen on online casino because someone can use someone bank account, submit fake KYC and other thing. However I think a good casino shouldn't allow this because if a gambler don't have money and still want to gamble, it's a sign of gambling addiction.",

Gambling Casinos is a business so they won't let you play when you don't have funds or money.  It is either your friend used his credit card or he borrowed money from someone else.  Your older friend just stated that he owed money so obviously he borrowed funds to play.  So gambling debt is impossible if the person doesn't take any loan or borrowed money from someone else.We might be guessing here why your friend owed money in gambling but if you really want the correct answer, even though you are a bit hesitant, I think it  is ok to ask information why our older friend got into debt.",

So is gambling debt one way or other possible without the person taking loan or borrowing money? He had already gone too far and he learned his lesson the hard way. It could be in traditional casinos or gambling places where sometimes they let players play off until debt and that's the worst thing that a gambler could do. He might probably took a load so he can take it in online gambling sites. Regardless, it's too bad for him. Let this be a lesson for others to gamble responsibly. And if you're already in a rut place like this, just know that you are not what happened to you, you are what you are going to do about it. Take the lesson and be more accountable for taking risks the next time.",

A gambling casino can't loan you to gamble on their site because it will not help their system, tgey are called a gambling platform and bit a loan scheme, they will prefer you go to other loan platforms abd get wuch to use the money for gambling which is not a good idea at all, we have many gamblers they may take loan and refused to pay back due to some circumstances unavoidable, that is why you have to gamble with your own personal money from the income you made than taking a loan that turns a problem on you if you don't win, that's why many opt on for gambling bonuses and referral bonus if they needed to gamble for free when they are not having money.",

My friend's younger brother is a core gambler,and he loves playing virtual games. There was a period of time that he was on his lucky days,he won very big and will lavish it within one week in the same casino. He continued like that and he keeps winning and losing,so he became to good trusted customer,and they started allowing to play in credit and pay back at an agreed time. It was working for him at first and everything was going smoothly.          His luck days passed and after losing all his funds he played a huge sum to pay back later. He gambled again from the casino without paying and the casino noticed that he hasn't won any game for two weeks,and his debt have pilled up. They decided to stop allowing to play anymore in the casino and asked him to pay up his debt with a given period of time,he couldn't and he was arrested by the casino. This was how we knew what was going on between the casino and him.",

Play and pay later is new to me.Gambling sites providing loan is not at all possible. Just think, on what basis the loan will be provided. Even if collateral is submitted providing loans for the purpose of gambling isn't possible. Maybe in the future we can find financial service providers making tie-up with gambling platforms to enable such kind of inbuilt features within the platform and easily make users get into debts.",

I'm not sure if they just want to be sure that there will be no loss on their end, or they just want gamblers to be responsible. If it's the former, then casinos just want to prioritize their sure profit and don't want to take the risk of lending money despite having KYC. Perhaps this is also a play safe on their end since they knew that some are not even within their scope to follow up for payments and other necessary measures if ever the gamblers will not comply and pay on time. If it is the latter, then the casino is doing a good job in promoting discipline because as the saying goes, you shouldn't really gamble what you can't afford to lose. If you have no gambling fund allocation in the first place, then you shouldn't gamble since you have no extra budget for it. Prioritizing the needs is important after all.",
